            "body": "<p pid=\"b1200.0\/1\">My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup, as well, indeed, as my noble friend Lady Kennedy in the arguments they have put forward. The House has  enormous respect for the Minister. I share that respect but it is noticeable that, despite her arguments, she had no support in Committee. I looked at her closing arguments then and found this one:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1200.0\/2\">&#8220;In the course of their duties on overseas operations, we expect our service personnel to undertake activities which are intrinsically violent in nature. They fight, they use force&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b1200.0\/3\">That seemed to be the justification for this provision: that force has to be used. I do not believe that force is the same as torture. If there were to be confusion between the two, it would be up to the courts to make a decision. It would not be up to a government Minister to say whether an action was unacceptable or, indeed, appropriate for it to be excused altogether by the provisions of this Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"b1200.0\/4\">In her closing remarks&#8212;she was trying to be helpful&#8212;the Minister also said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1200.0\/5\">&#8220;I undertake to consider with care the arguments that have been advanced and to explore if there is any way by which we can assuage your Lordships&#8217; concerns.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 9 \/3\/21; cols. 1575-77.]<\/p><p pid=\"b1200.0\/6\">I am not sure that anything has happened about that commitment. I understand why Ministers make such commitments and why she did so; perhaps she was not comfortable with the Government&#8217;s whole argument. However, I am not clear what she has done to assuage our concerns; I do not believe she has.<\/p><p pid=\"b1200.0\/7\">As has been said before, the reputation of this country is at stake. One thing we surely value very much is our reputation for adhering to the rule of law&#8212;for having a proper system for considering it and, indeed, being implacable in our opposition to any breach of it. That reputation is surely worth preserving, yet it is now at stake. We deal all the time with countries that do not observe the rule of law, be it Hong Kong, China in respect of the Uighurs, or Myanmar in respect of the Rohingyas&#8212;or, indeed, of their own citizens. There are too many examples of the rule of law being breached; we can ill afford to join the ranks of countries that breach it. We have had severe warnings that we might find our service men and women up before the International Criminal Court&#8212;which would be mortifyingly embarrassing and absolutely appalling were it to happen.<\/p><p pid=\"b1200.0\/8\">I am a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which made a detailed assessment of the Bill and its various provisions and produced a report. At paragraphs 63 and 64, the report says that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1200.0\/9\">&#8220;we have significant concerns that the presumption against prosecution&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b1200.0\/10\">runs the risk of contravening<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1200.0\/11\">&#8220;the UK&#8217;s legal obligations under international humanitarian law (the law of armed conflict)&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b1200.0\/12\">and<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1200.0\/13\">&#8220;international human rights law ... It risks contravening the UK&#8217;s obligations under the UN Convention Against Torture, the Geneva Conventions, the Rome Statute and international customary law.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b1200.0\/14\">The report goes on to say:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1200.0\/15\">&#8220;At a minimum, the presumption against prosecution should be amended so that it does not apply to torture, war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b1200.0\/16\">Nothing could be clearer than that.<\/p><p pid=\"b1200.0\/17\">We have also heard quoted today Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. She said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1200.0\/18\">&#8220;No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b1200.0\/19\">I can think of no clearer comments than those I have quoted. I fully support this amendment.<\/p>",

I suppose I need to declare an interest as one of the five right hon. and hon. Members of this House who have been placed on the Chinese Government&#8217;s sanctions list, apparently for &#8220;maliciously&#8221; spreading &#8220;lies and disinformation&#8221;; in the language of the Chinese Communist party, of course, that is a euphemism for speaking the truth. As parliamentarians we have been singled out, together with Lord Alton and Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws, presumably for our vociferous calling out of the genocide against the Uyghur people by the Chinese Government, the industrial-scale human rights abuses in Tibet and the suppression of free speech and liberty in Hong Kong. That is what parliamentarians do, without fear or favour, in a democracy. To be sanctioned by a totalitarian regime is, therefore, not only deeply ironic and laughable, but an abuse of parliamentary privilege of this House, by a foreign regime.<\/p><p pid=\"e157.0\/2\">What further action are the Government considering against the Chinese Government to emphasise how unacceptable and unfounded their action is? Will the Minister assure the House that the Government will not be proceeding with any new agreements with the Chinese Government while these sanctions remain in place?<\/p><p pid=\"e157.0\/3\">The other individuals named were Newcastle University academic Dr Jo Smith Finley and Uyghur expert lawyer, Sir Geoffrey Nice QC. Does the Minister agree that this also represents an attack on academic freedom and the independence of the legal profession in the United Kingdom? What support are the Government offering to those two individuals?<\/p><p pid=\"e157.0\/4\">Given growing concerns about the malign influence of the Chinese Government in sensitive research projects in our universities, the sinister tentacles of the Confucius institutes on campuses and increasingly in our schools, not to mention the wide-scale buying of influence in  UK boardrooms, will the Government commit to a detailed and transparent audit of Chinese influence in our education system, our military capability, our business and our infrastructure projects, and, if found to be acting against British interests, send them packing?<\/p><p pid=\"e157.0\/5\">Given the disgraceful recent dressing-down of our ambassador in Beijing for supporting on social media the role of a free press, will the Minister confirm that British diplomats will not be bowed and will be fortified in calling out abuses by the Chinese Government wherever they happen, as we sanctioned parliamentarians have been fortified to call out the abuses of the totalitarian Government in China by their badly-thought-out and counterproductive use of sanctions, which we will wear as a badge of honour? Will the Minister signal, clearly and firmly, that project kowtow is over and that Britain will not flinch from standing up and calling out Chinese Government abuses, which they have got away with for far too long?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a466.1\/1\">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr McCabe. I thank <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Meg Hillier\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11605\">the hon. Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)<\/phrase> for securing this debate on immigration and nationality application fees. I thank all Members for their contributions to the discussion today. I welcome any opportunity to hear the views of the House on this subject, even if we come from differing points of view.<\/p><p pid=\"a466.1\/2\">It has been an interesting debate. I am in no doubt from the contributions made about the strength of feeling. While I will respond to the points raised today, before I do, it might be helpful to set out the current landscape for the fees we charge for visa, immigration and nationality services.<\/p><p pid=\"a466.1\/3\">As was touched on by my SNP shadow, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Stuart McDonald\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25301\">the hon. Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East (Stuart C. McDonald)<\/phrase>, the Immigration Act 2014 was approved by Parliament under the coalition, during the time when <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Alistair Carmichael\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10785\">the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)<\/phrase> was in the Cabinet. It sets out the governing factors that must be given regard to and are the only matters that can be taken into account when setting fee levels. These are: the costs of administering the service; benefits that are likely to accrue to the applicant on a successful outcome; the cost of operating other parts of the immigration system; the promotion of economic growth; fees charged by or on behalf of Governments of other countries for comparable functions; and any international agreement.<\/p><p pid=\"a466.1\/4\">In setting fees, it is important to emphasise the Home Office cannot set or amend fees without obtaining the approval of Parliament. That ensures there are checks and balances in place and that there is full parliamentary oversight of the fees regime, in addition to debates such as that we are having today. Immigration and nationality fees are set within the limits specified by the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Order 2016, which includes the maximum fee levels that can be charged on each application type or service. That is laid in Parliament and is subject to affirmative resolution procedures.<\/p><p pid=\"a466.1\/5\">Individual fee levels are calculated in line with managing public money principles and the powers provided by the Immigration Act 2014. Specific fees are set out in regulations, which are then presented to Parliament and are subject to the negative procedure. The powers agreed by Parliament in 2014 bring benefits to the broader immigration and citizenship system and to the UK in the form of effective and secure border and immigration functions, reduced funding from general taxation and promotion of economic growth.<\/p><p pid=\"a466.1\/6\">I turn to the issue that the hon. Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch started with&#8212;the simplification and the linked parts of the settlement requirements. As she may be aware, I have recently written to the Home Affairs Committee following a meeting with We Belong, which was a useful opportunity to explore with them their experiences of the current system.<\/p><p pid=\"a466.1\/7\">Following the Law Commission report on simplification of the immigration rules in 2020, the Home Office is in the process of looking to simplify the immigration rules. As part of that, we are looking at reviewing the rules on settlement and when people qualify for it. We are examining how we could improve the path to settlement for this particular group of young people. Having met them, I recognise the concerns and the wider impact of being placed on what is effectively an 11-year path to citizenship, allowing 10 years to get to permanent settlement&#8212;indefinite leave to remain&#8212;and then a year free of immigration restrictions to apply for British citizenship, having received indefinite leave to remain. From what we are hearing, and from looking at the process, we believe that too many are ending up on the 10-year route and that is something we want to look at as part of a process of simplifying the rules and requirements.<\/p><p pid=\"a466.1\/8\">We are also clear that there are areas where we should simplify the rules to ensure that there are fewer instances where a lawyer needs to be paid for support in the process, which is a cost that we know people face. I know there are some strong views across the House on  this issue, and that has been shown today. I look forward to discussing them further when we look to bring forward our proposals.<\/p><p pid=\"a466.1\/9\">It is not just in the settlement group specifically that we are looking to simplify the impact people face. Those who have been following the changes to the rules over the last year may have seen things such as the following. On the student route, if those reapplying have been supporting themselves financially without recourse to public funds for 12 months or more, we do not now ask them to prove it as part of their next application. They can do that, having done it visibly. We have changed the English language qualifications, ending a position that was rather bizarre. Someone who went to a state school and had achieved, say, an A grade at GCSE English language or even an A in A-Level English literature was then asked to pass a secure English language test. We are starting to reform some of our rules to look at the wider impacts.<\/p><p pid=\"a466.1\/10\">A particularly interesting one, which I am quite keen on, is looking towards the reuse of biometrics and how we capture biometrics. The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland set out quite well exactly what a biometrics appointment can mean, and not just for those looking to make a reapplication for leave to remain here in the UK, but sometimes for those looking to get secure entry clearance. An example highlighted to me was of a couple of cultural performers who were Aboriginal Australians. Thankfully, they came within our generous visitor route provisions for the performance they were going to make. Had they been coming for slightly longer, the most expensive part of their visa application would have been the trip from the outback to their nearest visa application centre to give us their fingerprints and facial biometrics.<\/p><p pid=\"a466.1\/11\">To reassure Members, we are looking to make a change. The first step is to look at increasing the amount of biometric reuse in our system. That means people can reapply using the fingerprints and facial images they gave in a previous application. The second part is looking at how we can remotely capture biometrics from those who are making applications for the first time. The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland may wish to know that, for example, the vast majority of EEA nationals applying to our skilled worker route will be able to supply the biometrics using an app on their smartphone to check the chip on their passport without visiting a visa application centre.<\/p><p pid=\"a466.1\/12\">As some may have picked up, last month we launched an enhancement to the settlement route for British nationals overseas and their households ordinarily resident in Hong Kong by allowing a fully digital application route. This is the first time we have done that for non-EEA nationals, and it allows many Hong Kong special administrative region and, we believe, virtually all British national overseas passport holders the ability to apply from home if they qualify for that route.<\/p>",

We are limited in time and very limited in number today, but it is quality that counts&#8212;I am speaking about the Minister, rather than myself. Many colleagues have sent apologies, including my neighbours, my hon. Friends the Members for Vauxhall (Florence Eshalomi) and for Lewisham, Deptford (Vicky Foxcroft) and my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Harriet Harman\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10260\">the Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman)<\/phrase>, the Mother of the House. Well they might send apologies, because the Bakerloo line extension was first mentioned in 1913, so our constituents have been waiting more than a century for this debate and for Bakerloo line trains to arrive a bit further than the Elephant and Castle, where they end currently.<\/p><p pid=\"a422.2\/4\">I start by thanking the Secretary of State for Transport and the wider Government ministerial team for the safeguarding work. The land above and below ground for the Bakerloo line extension has been protected. I am grateful that the Government acted swiftly on the safeguarding directions, in response to my question in December, and I was glad to see that published on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-03-01\">1 March<\/phrase>. This is a decisive milestone for the project. It is important that the time and resources already spent on the extension are not wasted and that the Government remain committed to the next stages of development for this vital and hugely popular scheme to progress.<\/p><p pid=\"a422.2\/5\">I say it is hugely popular, because there is so much evidence to back that up. The Transport for London public consultation saw a tiny fraction&#8212;less than 3%&#8212;of the people who responded objecting to the extension. The public overwhelmingly see the benefits of the scheme, and more than 20,000 people have signed the &#8220;Back the Bakerloo&#8221; petition online, including many of my constituents.<\/p><p pid=\"a422.2\/6\">The project has the backing of the leaders, mayors, councillors and councils of five London boroughs. Southwark Labour has campaigned collectively on it for years. The planning and preparatory work is already well under way and delivery for the extension is embedded into the local development plan for the borough. In Southwark alone, it is estimated that the extension will help deliver more than 2 million square feet of employment space for a range of new work. It also features heavily in Lewisham&#8217;s local development plan. The BakerLewisham extension campaign was a brilliant success for Damien Egan, the mayor, and outgoing councillor Joe Dromey. It is a fantastic campaign with lots of public support.<\/p><p pid=\"a422.2\/7\">I and eight other local MPs whose constituencies are directly affected by the extension have all been campaigning together to see it delivered. It is a cross-party campaign. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Bob Neill\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/13736\">The hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Sir Robert Neill)<\/phrase> is a prominent backer of the Bakerloo line extension and, of course, the former Mayor of London, now <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Boris Johnson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10999\">the right hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson)<\/phrase> and the Prime Minister, has backed the campaign for some years. The Bakerloo line extension formed a major part of his 2011 London plan and, since then, it has been embedded in successive London plans, highlighted as an integral piece of infrastructure within the economic, environmental, transport and social framework for the development of all London. Indeed, in 2015, the Prime Minister said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a422.2\/8\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;The extension of the Bakerloo line will provide a vital new transport link for people living and working in south London&#8230;We&#8217;re now firmly on track to get construction on this major project underway by 2024 and have it up and running by 2030.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a422.2\/9\">He now holds the key to unlocking all the benefits that the extension could bring. He flagged up today at Prime Minister&#8217;s questions that the Government are spending &#163;640 billion on national infrastructure&#8212;an amazing sum. I am genuinely impressed. It is good to see infrastructure coming forward. We need nuclear investment, we need other infrastructure investment and the Bakerloo line extension should form part of that infrastructure development.<\/p><p pid=\"a422.2\/10\">One reason the extension is so universally popular is all the benefits it would bring. It is not just about transport&#8212;it is about regeneration, the delivery of housing, jobs and the post-covid economic recovery, and tackling the climate emergency. Of course, it does have transport benefits. Improved transport links and reduced journey times would benefit my constituents and hundreds of thousands of people across south London. It would bring capacity for 87,000 more people every morning in peak time. It would mean that a tube train every two to three minutes between Lewisham and central London is possible.<\/p><p pid=\"a422.2\/11\">It has environmental benefits. The Bakerloo line extension would help reduce air pollution and congestion on the roads by increasing capacity on the tube and taking many journeys off our congested streets, including the Old Kent Road. Improving and expanding public transport options is also central to the Government&#8217;s plans to tackle the climate emergency and meet our carbon emission targets, a priority that is particularly significant given that COP26 is rapidly approaching in Glasgow later this year.<\/p><p pid=\"a422.2\/12\">It also has significant housing benefits. The extension of the Bakerloo line from Elephant and Castle would mean 20,000 new homes for the Old Kent Road alone, including 7,000 genuinely affordable homes in my constituency and that of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Camberwell and Peckham. Across London, it would mean the development of 110,000 new homes, which would be a significant contribution to the Government&#8217;s commitment to deliver 300,000 new homes a year. This is and should be seen as a partnership between national Government and the devolved authority in London.<\/p><p pid=\"a422.2\/13\">Of course, it brings many jobs: 10,000 new jobs in the immediate area of the extension, but 130,000 jobs across London. It would create a new work space along the whole route, generating a growth corridor from the  Elephant and Castle right out to Kent. That route takes the extension through some of the most disadvantaged parts of London. Parts of south Bermondsey and north Walworth have 40% child poverty. There is a reason why the Old Kent Road is the cheapest square on the classic Monopoly board.<\/p><p pid=\"a422.2\/14\">The next steps to success are to reach a single preferred option, and all of it is contingent on funding. Since 2016 Sadiq Khan has been an excellent Mayor for London. He has stabilised Transport for London&#8217;s finances, reduced the operating deficit by 71% and increased the cash balance by 30%, while delivering the Hopper fare, which has benefitted more than 200,000 people on routes through Southwark. All Londoners&#8212;millions of people on routine journeys&#8212;have benefitted from the fares freeze, but we cannot ignore the last year, which has been devastating for Transport for London&#8217;s finances.<\/p><p pid=\"a422.2\/15\">The pandemic has meant a 90% drop in passenger revenue in 2020, meaning a loss of &#163;2.4 billion in fares and rendering Londoners entirely reliant on Government for funding for future capital projects of this scale and for smaller projects. I hope that we are not going to see the Minister try to pass the buck for these costs on to Londoners. In his letter to the Mayor of London in October, the Transport Secretary acknowledged that Transport for London will need support for capital projects even when Transport for London becomes self-sufficient in running costs again under Heidi Alexander&#8217;s excellent leadership. That self-sufficiency target is set for 2023-24.<\/p><p pid=\"a422.2\/16\">The Government could help by returning the annual operating grant to the capital city. The last payment in 2015 was &#163;700 million, before the previous Mayor gave away the operating grant, which was perhaps a foretaste of his negotiating abilities. That money would go a long way to meeting the projected costs for the extension from Elephant and Castle to Lewisham, which are estimated to be between &#163;4.7 billion and &#163;7.9 billion. The range of cost reflects the contingency and uncertainty that a major capital scheme like this requires at this stage of the development.<\/p><p pid=\"a422.2\/17\">No other major city operates on this system. In Paris and New York fares account for just 38% of revenue, in Hong Kong for 37% and in Singapore for 21%. Londoners are being asked to shoulder far more cost for their underground system than people in any other major city. That system, built on uncertainty, has been added to in the last year by covid. On Monday, the Government agreed another short extension to the Transport for London funding deal, on the same conditions. This temporary extension will now end in May, with a new agreement needing to be negotiated by <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-05-18\">18 May<\/phrase>, following the mayoral election.<\/p><p pid=\"a422.2\/18\">The Minister may wonder why the Government&#8217;s candidate is languishing in the polls in London. It is partly because Londoners are not stupid. They have seen the contrast between being punished with a deal for Transport for London, which has restrictions and a cost imposed for Londoners that we did not see in any other deal for any other part of the country, and rail companies being provided with &#163;3.5 billion of public money with no conditions. Londoners were told to stay at home to protect the NHS. They did their bit and they are losing out through a deal with terrible conditions attached.<\/p><p pid=\"a422.2\/19\">As part of the current negotiations, Transport for London is making the case for continued funding to close out the current stage of design, to protect the  Bakerloo line extension safeguard from challenge, and to develop a single preferred option that would be shovel-ready. That would put the scheme in a position where it would be ready to be taken forward to planning, if and when funding was identified. Transport for London hopes to provide an update on that by the end of May, by which point the next funding deal should have been agreed.<\/p><p pid=\"a422.2\/20\">We obviously cannot ignore the context; we all know what has been happening. The vaccine is providing a jab in people&#8217;s arms, but the whole country needs an economic shot in the arm. We need an economic boost and the Bakerloo line extension would deliver just that for the whole country. By supporting London, the Minister would support the whole country. When London is operating at full capacity, it delivers a net contribution to the Treasury of &#163;39 billion a year. The Government need that money coming in and Londoners want to get back to work. The Bakerloo line extension helps to rebuild post-covid, and by investing in London&#8217;s infrastructure the Minister and the Government would support regeneration across the United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"a422.2\/21\">I will give just one example of how the Bakerloo line extension would contribute to the national recovery. The Prime Minister has visited the Siemens plant in Goole up in Yorkshire&#8212;more than once, I think. That site is the expected place of manufacture of the trains and carriages that would run on the Bakerloo line in London. Investing in the Bakerloo line extension provides a boost for London, but it also provides jobs in Goole.<\/p><p pid=\"a422.2\/22\">Of course, the Government talk a lot about levelling up. Levelling up does not just apply outside London. Ministers must not just talk the talk; they need to walk the walk, or better still take the tube, perhaps. I hope that the Minister will agree that the Bakerloo line extension is an excellent example of levelling up. I invite her to come and see these sites, to see where these jobs, housing and transport infrastructure would be. I hope that if she made such a visit, I and others who support the extension would be able to prove to her that the best way to level up is to get the Bakerloo line extension track down. That would be a fantastic opportunity for her to see.<\/p><p pid=\"a422.2\/23\">In conclusion, I look forward to hearing how the Minister will ensure that her Government meet their housing targets, environmental agenda, infrastructure plans and levelling up agenda, and I also look forward to hearing how we will work together to deliver this project to boost the national economy.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a924.0\/1\">First, let me take the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s distasteful comparisons to Windrush head-on. Members of the Windrush generation came to the UK lawfully to help rebuild Britain, and they were wronged by successive Governments, including Labour Governments. It is simply insulting to attempt to draw parallels between them and those entering our country unlawfully.<\/p><p pid=\"a924.0\/2\">Not only are this Government ensuring that Windrush victims receive compensation&#8212;the compensation that they deserve&#8212;but today I am announcing new measures to fix historical anomalies in British nationality law to ensure that members of the Windrush generation can receive British citizenship more easily. That is a Conservative Home Secretary, and a Conservative Prime Minister and Government, righting these wrongs. As I have set out previously in the House, the Home Office is absolutely committed to supporting victims of the Windrush generation, and that is why today I have launched the biggest and most wide-ranging consultation when it comes to this new plan for immigration.<\/p><p pid=\"a924.0\/3\">Secondly, the right hon. Gentleman commented on the record of Conservatives in government, so let me just set out some facts for him. From the expulsion of Ugandan Asians, such as my own family members, from a repressive regime; to proudly resettling more  refugees than any other EU country, as he heard me say in my statement; to supporting campaigners fleeing political persecution in Hong Kong&#8212;that is the record of Conservatives when it comes to humanitarianism. Under the Conservative leadership of this Government, the United Kingdom will always provide sanctuary to people who are having the light switched off on their own liberty and personal freedoms, and this new plan will build on that.<\/p><p pid=\"a924.0\/4\">Thirdly, I am quite astonished by the tone of the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s comments, repeatedly suggesting that we just turn a blind eye to people attempting to come into our country illegally&#8212;people being smuggled in small boats and in the back of lorries. He will well know that we in this House have stood too often to hear about the tragedy of people who have died, whether in the channel or the back of refrigerated lorries. I will not apologise for being abundantly clear that an illegal journey to the UK is not worth the risk. That is what this plan is about: tackling illegal migration, protecting lives, and, of course, alongside that creating new routes.<\/p><p pid=\"a924.0\/5\">Finally, the right hon. Gentleman accuses me and the Government of lacking compassion. He accuses me of taking an inhumane approach. I suggest politely to him that he should not resort to personal attacks of that nature. I, and my own family in particular, understand what oppression is like and, after fleeing persecution, sought refuge in the United Kingdom, just like millions of others who have successfully rebuilt their lives. That lack of substance is not surprising, because the Labour party has no plans to fix the broken system. In fact, I understand that last night, the Labour party&#8217;s response to my plan was very much to look at my plan. As long as Labour Members are devoid of a plan of substance, they are defending a broken system that is encouraging illegal migration and supporting criminality. They are defending a system that is enabling an established criminal trade in asylum seekers, and causing human misery. It is a system that disregards the world&#8217;s most vulnerable, elbowing women and children to the side. It is a system that all too often, as I have seen, results in the tragic loss of life.<\/p><p pid=\"a924.0\/6\">A family of five drowned on their way to this country&#8212;our country&#8212;only last year; in 2019, 39 victims were found dead in Purfleet in the back of a refrigerated lorry. That is inhumane. If the right hon. Gentleman and the Labour party are prepared to be associated with that criminal trade in asylum seeking and human misery, he is the one who lacks compassion. That is not a position that we will take, and I will not be complicit in defending the indefensible on that basis.<\/p><p pid=\"a924.0\/7\">Finally, it is extraordinary to hear lectures about our border from the right hon. Gentleman and the Labour party, when it is still official Labour party policy to maintain and extend free movement rights, as per its party conference motion. In effect, that is to have open borders. We are the only party that is prepared to tackle illegal migration, show compassion to those who have been trafficked in the world, and create safe and legal routes, so that we help to save lives.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a760.0\/1\">My Lords, I want to mention &#8220;Catch-22&#8221;. Many noble Lords who are old enough will remember that this is a novel by Joseph Heller that was made into a film. The title refers to a certain rule whereby you might not be required to take part in war if you are mentally impaired, but if you say that you are mentally impaired, it shows that you are not really mentally impaired, so you cannot claim this particular way out. I think we are infected here with the same thinking. Catch-22 is a problem whereby the only solution is denied because there is a rule that cannot be fulfilled. That, of course, is what we keep hearing repeated by the Foreign Secretary and Ministers: that the proper place to determine whether genocide is taking place is a court of law, a competent court, but the problem is that there is no competent court able to do so.<\/p><p pid=\"a760.0\/2\">I have mentioned this before, and the noble Lord, Lord Lansley, referred to it again: there is no competent court because using the International Court of Justice, which would normally determine whether a genocide was taking place, would involve one nation taking another nation before it. However, unfortunately, China has put in a reservation to the treaty establishing the court. A reservation is<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a760.0\/3\">&#8220;a declaration by a state made upon signing or ratifying a treaty that the state reserves the right not to abide by certain provisions of the treaty.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a760.0\/4\">So, the idea that China will say, &#8220;Yes, of course, take me to the International Court of Justice&#8221;, and not claim its reservation, is risible, as we all recognise.<\/p><p pid=\"a760.0\/5\">The other international court that might be able to deal with a matter of genocide is the International Criminal Court. But, as distinct from the International Court of Justice&#8212;a nation-to-nation court&#8212;this is   a court where individuals can be brought and held accountable for serious, egregious crimes against humanity, and indicted for genocide. However, as I said, it is individuals who are brought there. The treaty of Rome, which brought that court into existence, involved nations signing up to its jurisdiction; China did not sign up.<\/p><p pid=\"a760.0\/6\">So, there is no international competent court to which China can be brought. Determining whether a genocide is taking place is beyond the capacity of the international courts. So what were we to do? That is why the different possibilities were presented by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, in amendments to this Bill, and supported by many in this House. The suggestion was: with our courts and competent, able judges&#8212;and with one of the great prides of Britain being our legal system and senior judiciary, admired throughout the world&#8212;who better than judges in one of our own courts to determine whether there was a genocide? The alternative when that proposal failed was to say, &#8220;Well, what about getting our most senior judges, who sit in this House in retirement, to come together, look to the evidence, measure it and decide whether it reaches the standard threshold, which is high, to determine whether a genocide is taking place?&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a760.0\/7\">Unfortunately, we are left with very little. International law has acquired new teeth in the form of sanctions; I mentioned them in an earlier short debate. The fact that sanctions are now being used is to be welcomed. I would like to see our Foreign Secretary and Foreign Office at the forefront in persuading nations around the world to establish regimes to deal with international law in the same way: by creating sanctions regimes, as we, the United States, the European Union, Canada and other countries have done.<\/p><p pid=\"a760.0\/8\">Many noble Lords know that I run the International Bar Association&#8217;s Human Rights Institute. We engaged with Japan, Australia and other countries and sought to have them join this union of democracies in creating a sanctions regime to deal with serious breaches of international human rights. We are making some progress, but it is a source of great regret to me that we have not decided to confront what the noble Lord, Lord Lansley, referred to as this dilemma, this serious problem, that we have no venue to which we can bring this serious allegation of genocide. By and large, therefore, China can get off scot-free.<\/p><p pid=\"a760.0\/9\">We must have serious mechanisms for dealing with this. I hope that the Government are listening to the sensible and serious suggestions being made by the noble Lord, Lord Alton. They could take different forms, such as a Joint Committee of Parliament or a committee of our judges in this House established by this House. We have the power to make that happen. So, yes, we are seeing some advances being made but, really, they are very slow and very small.<\/p><p pid=\"a760.0\/10\">I have one other thing to say, which is on targeted sanctions. Go after the people who have the power. Go after the people who have salted away money and assets in different places. Go after them. Deny them visas. Make it uncomfortable for them. Shame is something that matters to the powerful. That is the purpose of targeted sanctions, but, so far, we have tended to use them in rather meagre ways&#8212;not for the top guys but  for the people in middle-ranking positions. We have to use them. Many noble Lords knows that I was involved in the investigation into the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. All the evidence points to where that decision to murder came from, yet we are not using targeted sanctions against the man who authored that horrible assassination and dismemberment. We are not using these sanctions in the way we should be in relation to Hong Kong, Belarus and other places.<\/p><p pid=\"a760.0\/11\">So I urge the Foreign Office to take up that challenge. The mantra being used now is that we are &#8220;global Britain&#8221;&#8212;having exited the European Union, here we are as global Britain. What does that mean? How do we have our stature, small nation that we are, in the world? We have many things that we can be proud of, but one of them is to do with law and having values that have meaning and moral authority. We really must use that, because it is where we can have traction in the world. It does not mean that you do not trade, of course, but it does mean that you stand by the things you believe in.<\/p><p pid=\"a760.0\/12\">I urge our Foreign Office to do this thing of joining up its policies on trade with its policies on aid. Regrettably, I am watching a diminution of trade to places where we should be putting some funding to preserve the rule of law and make it possible for people to create real democracies. Instead, we have China doing it all across Africa in its belt and road policy&#8212;which means, of course, that it has the backing of all those indebted nations when it comes to any international debate about calling China to heel. What a mistake we have made in allowing that to happen and not being the people who are helping the development of Africa, Pakistan and the other such places that are now in China&#8217;s pocket.<\/p><p pid=\"a760.0\/13\">So I say to the House that I am glad that we are making a bit of progress, but it is not enough. This will come back, and I hope that the Foreign Office, our Foreign Secretary and his Ministers will find good ways of making our standards real.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a733.0\/1\">My Lords, I am pleased that sanctions against Chinese officials have finally been confirmed. This is a welcome step. I also welcome the moves made yesterday by the EU and other partners, albeit many months after the Board of Deputies, the Uighur Congress, Members across this House and in the Commons called for their introduction. However, these designations are not enough and are certainly not a substitute for Parliament gaining the power to block trade agreements with China based on a determination of genocide. The sanctions do not represent a strategy; they are just one instrument in a foreign policy that is not nearly confident enough about our values. If the Government are truly serious about holding this barbarism to account, they must be consistent in their approach. That is why what the Foreign Secretary said earlier this month is so concerning &#8212;that he has no reason to think that we could not deepen our trading relationships with China. Boris Johnson said only last month that he is committed to strengthening the United Kingdom&#8217;s ties with China, whatever the occasional political difficulties.<\/p><p pid=\"a733.0\/2\">As a country, we can never turn a blind eye to human rights abuses. That means always standing with the Uighur people, not only when it is convenient for us to do so. The Foreign Secretary said that the persecution of the Uighur Muslims represents one of the worst human rights crises of our time and, for that reason, it requires one of the strongest international responses of our time, co-ordinated with our allies. Can the Minister therefore confirm why there are discrepancies between the designations in our sanctions and those of the US?<\/p><p pid=\"a733.0\/3\">Last Wednesday, the Financial Times reported Antony Blinken, the US Secretary of State, when he identified 24 CCP officials. He warned that any financial institution that had significant business with these officials would also be subject to sanctions. I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that we will mirror that action.<\/p><p pid=\"a733.0\/4\">Our actions must be swift and urgent, and these designations are neither. As a country, we must reflect our values on the world stage and at home, which means that these sanctions must be equipped with domestic legislation to prevent anyone in the UK being linked to this persecution. Will the Minister commit the Government to strengthening Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act to prevent forced labour being supported by UK business supply chains?<\/p><p pid=\"a733.0\/5\">Yesterday in the other place, despite the press reports I have referred to, the Foreign Secretary said<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a733.0\/6\">&#8220;that there is no realistic or foreseeable prospect of a free trade agreement and that the way to deepen our trade with China was for it to improve its human rights record.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class=\"offrep\" id=\", Commons, 22\/3\/21; col. 624.]\"><i>Official Report<\/i>, Commons, 22\/3\/21; col. 624.]<\/phrase><\/p><p pid=\"a733.0\/7\">I hope that the Minister can today give a cast-iron guarantee that the Government have no intention of pursuing trade negotiations with the Government of China during the course of this Parliament. Above all, if the UK is determined to face down the oppression of the Uighur people, we must build bridges with like-minded allies who share our ambition to end this persecution.<\/p><p pid=\"a733.0\/8\">Can the Minister tell us in more detail what steps the United Kingdom will take at the UN to raise the situation in the Xinjiang province? The House may also be aware that today marks the conclusion of the UN Human Rights Council&#8217;s main 2021 session, which will end without any condemnation of China&#8217;s action in Xinjiang, Hong Kong or elsewhere. The UK needs a foreign policy that is clear and confident about our values, but instead, for a decade now the Government have pursued an incoherent and inconsistent approach to the Chinese Government and the Chinese communist party. There is no greater display of this than the efforts to block the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, just as the Government announce these long-awaited sanctions.<\/p><p pid=\"a733.0\/9\">As I have warned before, there is a yawning chasm between the Government&#8217;s words and their actions. If they share the ambition of these Benches for the United Kingdom to be a moral force for good in the world, they must do more to stand against the barbaric events in Xinjiang. That means acting with greater urgency than we have seen with these sanctions, taking steps domestically to prevent the UK being linked in any way to these events, and working in tandem with our allies who share our values.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"d622.0\/1\">There is no question but that this is a welcome step, and I welcome the moves by the EU today and other partners. I am sure the whole House will stand in solidarity with our fellow European parliamentarians who have been sanctioned by the Chinese Government in response. This is an unacceptable attack on democratic lawmakers simply for highlighting the horrific evidence from Xinjiang.<\/p><p pid=\"d622.0\/2\">However, the Foreign Secretary has just read out the evidence that we have known about for years. He rightly called it barbaric, but when it has come to taking concrete steps, for years he has not listened. He did not listen to his hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Nusrat Ghani\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25354\">the Member for Wealden (Ms Ghani)<\/phrase> or his right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Iain Duncan Smith\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10180\">the Member for  Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith)<\/phrase>. He did not listen to us. He did not listen to the Board of Deputies. He did not listen to the World Uyghur Congress. Yet suddenly today the Foreign Secretary has discovered a new-found sense of urgency about the desperate plight of the Uyghur, despite that mounting evidence over several years. The truth is that the timing is grubby and cynical; it is designed to send a signal first and foremost not to the Chinese Government but to his own Back Benchers. It is motivated primarily by a desire to protect the Government, not the Uyghur. For all the talk of being a force for good in the world, it is only when this Government are staring down the barrel of defeat that they discover a moral centre. Only now that the US and the EU have acted has the Foreign Secretary finally moved to take this step.<\/p><p pid=\"d622.0\/3\">I urge all Members, especially those brave and conscientious Conservative Members, to think carefully before accepting that this signals a change of approach from this Government. This week we learnt that, despite his protestations, the Foreign Secretary has been talking up a trade deal with China in private at gatherings with Beijing officials. This week, the Prime Minister launched his global Britain policy, signalling a closer economic relationship with China. Members had eagerly awaited details of the Indo-Pacific tilt; we did not dream for a moment, from the talk over the last year, that it would be a tilt towards China.<\/p><p pid=\"d622.0\/4\">Today is perhaps the most acute example of the Government&#8217;s decade-long incoherent, inconsistent approach to the Chinese Government. On the day the Foreign Secretary finally announces sanctions on some of the officials responsible for human rights abuses in Xinjiang he is also pulling every trick in the book to stop Parliament gaining the power to block any bilateral trade or investment agreement with China based on a determination of genocide.<\/p><p pid=\"d622.0\/5\">I ask hon. Members to pause and ponder: if this is about co-ordination, why has it taken so long? The Government could have taken co-ordinated action with the United States when it brought sanctions in July last year, or if they felt so strongly they could have moved independently from the EU, as they have done in sanctions on other countries over the last year. Where are the sanctions on officials in Hong Kong when the US took that step this week? We should be taking a leadership approach given our historical commitments in the bilateral treaty, which China is in breach of. We are signatories to the joint declaration, not the United States. Where is the tougher sanctions regime that brings corruption into scope? Why did the Foreign Secretary say at a private gathering earlier this month that he had no reason to think that we could not deepen our trading relationship with China? Why did the Prime Minister say last month that he was committed to strengthening the UK&#8217;s ties with China<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"d622.0\/6\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;whatever the occasional political difficulties&#8221;?<\/p><p pid=\"d622.0\/7\">If this signals a change in approach, why on earth on the same day as the Government are announcing these sanctions are they twisting the arms of Back Benchers who want to support the genocide amendment?<\/p><p pid=\"d622.0\/8\">Today I urge all parliamentarians to stand firm: to stand with the public, who overwhelmingly support a principled stance on genocide; to stand with their  consciences; and most of all to stand with the Uyghur people. After a decade of rolling out the red carpet for Beijing and turning a blind eye to human rights abuses, this is the moment when we will finally force a change in Britain&#8217;s foreign policy, live up to our values as a country and be a force for good in the world.<\/p>",

World leaders will attend the conference, with the aim to agree how to tackle the threat of global climate change and deliver a resilient, net zero economy that protects and values the natural world.<\/p><p>The UK is a world leader on climate change. We were the first major economy to legislate for net zero by 2050. In November 2020, the Prime Minister set out our new Nationally Determined Contribution, committing to reduce our emissions by at least 68% by 2030 on a 1990 baseline, and in December 2020 we published the UK&#8217;s first Adaptation Communication.<\/p><p><strong>Ministerial team<\/strong><\/p><p>The Rt Hon Lord Goldsmith, Minister for Pacific and the Environment, will be the COP26 spokesperson in the House of Lords. The Rt Hon Anne-Marie Trevelyan MP, Minister for Business, Energy and Clean Growth, will also address COP26 questions in the House of Commons and is the UK International Champion on Adaptation and Resilience for the COP26 Presidency. Katherine Fletcher MP has been appointed as my Parliamentary Private Secretary.<\/p><p><strong>Role of UN COP President<\/strong><\/p><p>The COP President-Designate is responsible within the UK for delivering the COP26 summit in Glasgow. Ahead of the summit I am engaging with the UNFCCC Secretariat and the current COP President as they prepare the provisional negotiations agenda. I am working to increase ambition internationally, developing effective international relationships with countries, institutions, businesses and stakeholders to achieve the necessary commitments in advance of and at COP. I am regularly engaging with the members of the UNFCCC to understand their positions and work with them to reach consensus on the negotiations. I will continue my close engagement with a large number of civil society actors as we seek to deliver an inclusive COP.<\/p><p>With the will of all Parties, I will formally become COP President during the opening ceremony of the Glasgow Summit. At the summit, I will participate as COP President, under the authority of the COP and its 197 parties. I will lead the formal negotiations, preside over meetings and will facilitate proceedings in accordance with the COP&#8217;s draft Rules of Procedure. I will have oversight of the overall package of outcomes and will work closely with UNFCCC members to secure consensus. As COP President I will also lead the COP Bureau, which is an 11-member body that assists the President and supports the work of COP, for the duration of my term until COP27 in late 2022.<\/p><p>The Prime Minister has made the role full time and as a full member of the Cabinet. My Cabinet colleagues remain responsible for delivering on their respective policy responsibilities.<\/p><p><strong>Delivering a successful outcome<\/strong><\/p><p>At the Climate Ambition Summit on 12 December 2020, I set out four clear objectives for the UK Presidency.<\/p><ol><li>To ask countries to commit to net zero by mid-century, building on the 70% of world GDP covered by net zero targets today. To set the path to this, countries are being asked to come forward with ambitious 2030 emissions reductions targets (known as NDCs) which align with net zero goals. We will also be looking to accelerate the phase-out of coal, encourage investment in renewables, halt fossil fuel subsidies and pick up the pace on electric vehicle roll out. All of these areas are critical to stop average global temperatures exceeding 1.5C.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>To urgently protect and help adapt our communities and natural habitats from the destructive effects of climate change. This will involve enabling and encouraging countries affected by climate change to build defences, warning systems and resilient infrastructure to avoid loss of homes and livelihoods.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>To increase funding to support these aims, making good on the $100bn annual climate finance goal affirmed through the Paris Agreement. We need to be in a position to unleash the trillions in private and public finance to meet global net zero.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li>To close off the outstanding elements of the Paris Rulebook, and accelerate delivery of the Paris Goals through collaboration between Governments, Businesses and Civil Society.<\/li><\/ol><p>We will deliver these objectives through a major international engagement programme. I have briefed all UN Member States three times and have personally engaged with over 50 countries. In the last month I have visited Ethiopia, Gabon, Egypt, Nigeria, India, Nepal, Belgium and France, and have spoken to representatives from a wide range of other countries and organisations, including the United States and China and hosted virtual roundtables and engaged with civil society groups.<\/p><p><strong>Parliamentary scrutiny and engagement<\/strong><\/p><p>There will be regular Oral Questions, which commenced on 24 February. And written questions can be submitted to the COP26 President.<\/p><p>There will be full select committee scrutiny of the role. A BEIS Select Committee session was held on 19 January. The Chairs of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Environmental Audit, Science and Technology, Foreign Affairs, International Development, Treasury, Transport, Scottish Affairs, Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Liaison Committees have come together informally as a &#8216;Committee on COP26&#8217; which is an initiative I welcome and am committed to appearing in front of them alongside my ministerial colleagues, who will also be able to answer questions on their respective policy responsibilities.<\/p><p>My ministerial team and I will send a regular newsletter to colleagues in both Houses. I have agreed a programme of engagement activity with the Chairs of the Climate All-Party Parliamentary Groups.<\/p><p>We will be providing a digital toolkit to members in due course to support them to engage constituents in the Together for Our Planet campaign. We will also be working with partners to engage schools in COP26, including providing a tailored toolkit.<\/p><p>A range of opportunities are available for members and their constituents to get involved at COP26 itself. These include hosting events, creative installations and exhibitions within UK Government managed spaces.<\/p><p>We also expect there will be a range of fringe events and activities across the city of Glasgow and throughout the UK organised by stakeholders, civil society organisations and businesses.<\/p><p><strong>Domestic and Devolved Administration engagement<\/strong><\/p><p>We are working with the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure an inclusive and ambitious summit for the whole of the UK. All parts of the UK will have important roles to play in ensuring the summit&#8217;s success.<\/p><p>I have invited climate change Ministers from the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to participate in a regular Devolved Administrations Group to ensure effective engagement and collaboration on COP26 in support of the delivery of an inclusive and welcoming COP26 representative of the whole of the UK.<\/p><p>I also chair the COP26 UK Mayors&#8217; and Regions Advisory Council with mayors and council leaders from across the UK, including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. In addition to ongoing engagement with stakeholders across the UK, to ensure an inclusive, whole of society COP26, that is representative of all of the UK in Glasgow.<\/p><p>We have launched the Together for our Planet campaign which will raise awareness and understanding of COP26 and the work the UK is doing to combat climate change. The campaign aims to drive awareness and create opportunities for people across the UK to participate in the run-up to COP26.<\/p><p><strong>COP Unit governance<\/strong><\/p><p>The&#8239;Prime Minister chairs the&#8239;Climate Action Strategy Cabinet Committee (CAS), which determines the UK&#8217;s overarching climate strategy both domestically and internationally. I continue to chair the Climate Action Implementation Cabinet Committee (CAI), which supports the CAS to operationalise the Government&#8217;s climate strategy.<\/p><p>I am supported by the COP26 Unit which has over 200 posts and is based in the Cabinet Office. The COP Unit team brings together civil servants from across Whitehall and external expertise. International engagement, coordinated by the COP26 team in cooperation with the FCDO, takes place across all Departments and by all Ministers with an interest in the cross-cutting campaigns and our COP objectives, as well as by the Prime Minister.<\/p><p>As set out above, the regular processes are in place to ensure parliamentary scrutiny and support towards delivery of COP26.<\/p><p><strong>Progress so far <\/strong><\/p><ol><li><em>Reducing emissions:<\/em> countries representing around 65% of global CO2 emissions and around 70% of the world&#8217;s economy have now committed to reaching net zero emissions or carbon neutrality. When the UK took the role of incoming COP Presidency in December 2019, coverage was just 20% of global emissions and 26% of world GDP. On 12th December, over 90 countries, businesses, sectors, cities, including 75 world leaders, attended the Climate Ambition Summit, co-hosted with the UN and France in partnership with Italy and Chile. At the summit 45 leaders highlighted plans for new and more ambitious NDCs (covering 71 countries including all EU member states) and 24 countries announced new commitments, strategies or plans to reach net zero or carbon neutrality. The Summit delivered real steps forward - for example Colombia committed to an impressive 51% emissions reduction target; and Pakistan announced a moratorium on new coal plants.<\/li><\/ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><em>On helping protect communities and natural habitats from the impact of climate change: <\/em>at the CAS, 20 countries put forward plans for protecting their economies and communities from the impact of climate change. On 25 January we launched the Adaptation Action Coalition to bring together countries to identify the solutions, technologies and resources needed to protect people and nature as the planet warms. Action on nature is at the heart of our COP Presidency. At the UN General Assembly in September 2020 the Prime Minister signed the Leaders&#8217; Pledge for Nature committing leaders to take ten urgent actions to put nature on a path to recovery by 2030. The UK played a key role in pioneering and negotiating the Pledge, and which now has over 80 countries signed up. On 2 February 2021 we launched the Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade (FACT) Dialogue, which will bring together key countries exporting agricultural products and the countries consuming these products to agree global principles and a roadmap of actions to make global supply chains process greener and more sustainable, tackling one of the primary drivers of nature loss.<\/li><\/ol><ol start=\"3\"><li><em>On increasing climate finance:<\/em> there is an urgent need to get more finance flowing to support swift climate action. Developed countries must meet and surpass the $100bn of climate finance commitment, matching UK ambition to double UK ICF to at least &#163;11.6 billion between 2021 and 2025. Private finance is also key. So far we have seen major asset owners, representing over $5 trillion, and asset managers, representing over $9 trillion, commit to net zero targets by 2050. Climate-related Financial Disclosures are increasing and jurisdictions in Brazil, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Switzerland are taking action to make disclosure mandatory, complementing the UK&#8217;s announcement for a pathway to mandatory disclosure across the economy by 2025.<br\/><br\/><\/li><li><em>On making progress on the outstanding elements of the Paris Rulebook, and accelerating delivery of the Paris Goals:<\/em> we have been convening UNFCCC members in discussions to lay the groundwork for the negotiations, and we will be hosting, alongside Chile, a series of monthly multilateral consultations. More broadly, we have built partnerships to increase international collaboration on key issues, establishing the Energy Transition Council and Zero Emissions Vehicles Transition Council, as well as working through existing coalitions: the Powering Past Coal Alliance has grown to 114 members covering 20% of OECD coal power capacity.<\/li><\/ol><p>I look forward to engaging with you and continuing to update you over the coming months on the road to COP26.<\/p>",

I have a great deal of sympathy with his remarks.<\/p><p pid=\"b187.0\/2\">I believe that the UK has a historic responsibility to help resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to stand up for our friend, Israel, when it is singled out for such unfair criticism in international forums. The Foreign Secretary recently said that we have<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b187.0\/3\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;stood up for Israel when it has faced bias, and frankly, politicised attacks in the UN and other forums.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-03-02\">2 March<\/phrase> 2021; Vol. 690, c. 111.]<\/p><p pid=\"b187.0\/4\">Our voting pattern at the UN now needs to match these warm words.<\/p><p pid=\"b187.0\/5\">The subject of today&#8217;s debate is the UN Human Rights Council, which is currently meeting for its 46th session. The Council was established in 2006 to promote and protect human rights around the world, a laudable and just cause, which I am sure all of us would completely endorse. It is deeply regrettable that the Council has failed so comprehensively in its noble mission, while gaining a reputation as yet another politically exploited UN body. Consider that in the 15 years since its inception, the Council has passed 171 condemnations, of which more than half have targeted Israel. It is simply unjustifiable that 90 condemnations have been passed against Israel, while a mere 10 have been adopted on the world&#8217;s worst human rights abuser, Iran.<\/p><p pid=\"b187.0\/6\">Astonishingly, no condemnations have been adopted on China, Russia, Pakistan, Venezuela or other serial human rights abusers. Instead, many of those serial violators are Council members, which of course makes a mockery of the UN&#8217;s highest human rights body. As China crushes democracy in Hong Kong, and as Venezuela stands accused of crimes against humanity, both remain members of the Council. For proof of the Council&#8217;s inbuilt conscious bias, one need look no further than the existence of the permanent country-specific stand-alone agenda item at every session. I am sure it will come as no surprise which country is targeted.<\/p><p pid=\"b187.0\/7\">Permanent agenda item 7 is reserved for criticism of Israel, showing how deeply embedded this anti-Israel obsession has become. Motions adopted under item 7 have accused Israel of serious breaches of international law, while ignoring Palestinian rejectionism and terrorism. It is of course legitimate to highlight the plight of the Palestinian people, just as the national claims of other groups should also be given due attention. But when the blame is solely placed on Israel for the plight of the Palestinian people, with not even a superficial recognition of the numerous security challenges Israel faces, the failure of Palestinian leadership to prepare its people for a future peace agreement, and the countless peace deals rejected by the Palestinian leadership, it is clear that something has gone seriously wrong.<\/p><p pid=\"b187.0\/8\">There is no mention of Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which terrorise Israeli civilians with rocket fire. Those terror groups use Palestinian civilians as human shields, investing in weaponry rather than welfare. Just last month a Hamas-run court ruled that women required the explicit permission of a male guardian to travel. Where was the international condemnation?<\/p><p pid=\"b187.0\/9\">The violations of Palestinian rights in Lebanon are also conveniently forgotten by the Human Rights Council and other UN bodies, despite hundreds of thousands of Palestinians being denied the most basic freedoms, including the right to work. At each and every session of the Council, the likes of the Palestinian Authority, Syria and North Korea accuse Israel of human rights abuses, while escaping scrutiny of their own violations. Frankly, it is a student politics style stunt that is entirely unbecoming of a supposedly distinguished international forum.<\/p><p pid=\"b187.0\/10\">It is worth reflecting that such disproportionate singling out of Israel is one of the clearest examples of contemporary antisemitism, according to the world-leading definition. Such blatant bias will not change unless it is tackled head-on and rooted out. The UK&#8217;s decision in 2017 to put the Council on notice, stating that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b187.0\/11\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;If things do not change, in future we will adopt a policy of voting against all resolutions concerning Israel&#8217;s conduct...&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b187.0\/12\">was a hugely welcome first step.<\/p><p pid=\"b187.0\/13\">Our Prime Minister was right, during his time as Foreign Secretary several years ago, to describe the Council&#8217;s &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; focus on Israel as<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b187.0\/14\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;damaging to the cause of peace&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b187.0\/15\">In 2019, the UK said that item 7 amounted to &#8220;systemic institutional bias&#8221; and voted against all item 7 resolutions. That was another welcome step, but when an anti-Israel resolution previously adopted under item 7 was proposed under item 2 in the same session, the UK abstained rather than voting against it.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b135.1\/1\">I thank my hon. Friend for that point, and of course it is a national security issue. This is one of the biggest national security issues facing us over the next 10 years or so, and we need to have control of it.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/2\">Let me give more examples of why this is such an important matter. More than 75% of the world&#8217;s lithium-ion component manufacturers are located in China, resulting in more than 72% of lithium-ion batteries, and 45% of all global electric vehicles, already being produced in China. In December 2020&#8212;only a few months ago&#8212;the Chinese legislature passed a law on export control, allowing the Government to ban exports of strategic materials and advanced technology to specific foreign companies. A Chinese Government spokesman said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b135.1\/3\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;China may take countermeasures against any country or region that abuses export-control measures and poses a threat to China&#8217;s national security and interests&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/4\">This year alone, China has openly discussed the potential of cutting off the supply of rare earths or rare-earth components to the United States. Those are necessary for the US defence sector and, to put that into context, more than 400 kg of rare earths are needed for a single F-35 fighter.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/5\">Let me return to the example I often cite, which is the coronavirus pandemic. Last year, the UK imported most of its personal protective equipment from China, with only 1% of it made in the UK. When we needed it most, however, at the height of the pandemic, China decided to not fulfil its obligations, by sending us defective PPE, or by not even sending it to us at all. We now manufacture 70% of PPE domestically. It is a similar situation with critical minerals. When we take that together with China&#8217;s actions over Hong Kong, Taiwan, and its treatment of the Uyghurs, it is clear that we cannot, and should not, depend on the PRC for the future of our economy, energy, and defence sectors.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/6\">For the economy, the consequences of such supply chain instability for the United Kingdom are stark. Let me take the automotive sector as an example of the consequences. Some 70% of the value of an electric car is realised in its battery and motor. If those components cannot be manufactured in the UK because we do not have the minerals coming into the country, the consequences for the automotive sector alone are bleak: it could cost up to 500,000 jobs by 2030. There is no doubt in my mind that the Government must take immediate and assertive action to avert this potential disaster, which may strike just as we set out our post-covid-19 recovery.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/7\">The Government must adopt a two-fold approach, the first arm of which is to focus on relocating as much of the critical minerals supply chain as we can to the UK, thereby boosting the UK economy and creating jobs and opportunities. The second arm is to take a leading role in creating a Five Eyes critical minerals alliance to co-ordinate an overarching strategy to secure a stable network of interdependence.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/8\">On building a critical minerals industry in the UK, we already have some world-leading companies and research institutions in the sector, doing vital work. Of course, Britain has long been a pioneer in industrial innovation. If we look through history, we see that we have been at the forefront of industrial revolutions and part of revolutions in power supply, from early agrarian methods to steam to oil. What differentiates today&#8217;s power revolution is that we are not only looking for more powerful or cheaper sources of energy but developing renewable energy sources that meet our social objective of being less damaging to the environment. It is inescapable that critical minerals are the building blocks of this new economy, and the renewable energy sector will need them. The reality is that our future economy and green energy desires rely on a steady, secure and vertically integrated supply of critical minerals for the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/9\">The UK has a particularly long history of mining stretching over 2,000 years and more. Everyone in Britain is only too aware of the legend that Jesus himself visited our green and pleasant land more than two millennia ago precisely because of our mining heritage&#8212;his relative Joseph of Arimathea was a tin trader&#8212;as memorialised in the song &#8220;Jerusalem&#8221;. Our bulk mining capacity has been depleted because of decreased ore grades, but we are now seeing a growth in domestic critical mineral potential. Although this will never meet our entire critical mineral needs, the shortening of supply chains and production of feedstock domestically is the first step towards reducing vulnerability and tapping into the &#163;7 billion-per-year industry.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/10\">We know of UK critical minerals deposits in the south-west of England, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Cornish lithium is key to UK critical mineral potential, securing battery-grade lithium from geothermal brine. Elsewhere in the region, Tungsten West is reopening a globally significant tungsten deposit in Devon and Cornwall, and Cornish Metals has the potential to supply industrial levels of tin for the British economy. Not only are such projects significant to our industrial objectives, but they provide an alternative year-round economy to Cornwall and the south-west, where the community has rich mining heritage. In Northern Ireland, Dalradian Gold has the potential to deliver significant copper for the  UK economy. Such companies require support to unlock the potential in our regions and secure critical minerals sourced from home.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/11\">Domestic mining is just one small part of the greater picture. It is important to note that no one expects us to repatriate all upstream mining to Britain&#8212;quite simply, we do not have the geology to support that. It is key that we relocate to the UK other steps in the supply chain, particularly in the midstream. Crucially, by shortening our supply chain we can reduce our embedded carbon footprint, which is vital to the delivery of our green economy and to meeting our net zero target. The domestication of the critical mineral stream and investment in the circular economy is crucial. We are lucky to have in the sector leading British companies such as the Materials Processing Institute, Less Common Metals, TechMet and Technical Critical Minerals.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/12\">Let me turn to the second arm of the two-fold approach that I urge the Government to adopt. It is evident that the act of mining is determined by the geology in a nation. If we are to meet the UK&#8217;s industrial needs, we will need to secure sufficient critical minerals from other countries. It so happens that our Five Eyes partners are blessed with critical minerals in abundance, as are our Commonwealth friends.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/13\">I am a firm believer that the UK is a force of good in the world. In stable partner nations such as Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia the multiplier effect of a responsibly-run mine is somewhere between 10 and 25. In respect of Five Eyes, collaboration is vital for the mutual benefit of us all. We largely share the same economic and security objectives and we face the same global threats. Closer collaboration with our partner nations, especially Australia and Canada, will be vital to our upstream overseas critical mineral supply chain. As vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group for critical minerals, it was an honour to host the Australian high commissioner this morning to hear about Australia&#8217;s recently launched critical mineral strategy and how Australia seeks greater co-operation with the UK in this vital sector.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/14\">The high commissioner reiterated that neither country will get to net zero by 2050 through the development and deployment of low-emission technologies without a secure supply chain of critical minerals. His Excellency confirmed that the UK is at the front of the queue for critical minerals co-operation due to our shared environmental and ethical standards and commitment to a market that is diverse, robust, secure, and underpinned by good governance and environmental, social and corporate governance practice, driven by innovation, free market forces and co-operation.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/15\">Together, we can diversify the supply chain and complement each other to protect our economies and societies. However, we must secure a UK-Australia free trade agreement. I am pleased that we are already working to establish a working group on critical minerals with Australia. I urge my colleagues to study closely Australia&#8217;s critical minerals strategy as it is very much what we should doing in the UK, and the creation of a critical minerals facilitation office should be explored too.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/16\">The UK has an opportunity to take the lead on developing an overarching Five Eyes strategy that will safeguard our prosperity and security for decades to come. It is quite possible that we can work with our  mining counterparts to host the midstream and downstream parts of the supply chain, creating a supply chain balance across the Five Eyes alliance. Quotas, too, are particularly important in ensuring that our respective needs are met and that we do not face any shortages. One territory that Five Eyes must pay particular attention to is Greenland. As a member of the all-party parliamentary group for Greenland, I welcome the timely publication of the Greenland critical minerals report, which outlines the crucial role the UK has to play in leading the Five Eyes critical minerals alliance, and I urge the Government to enter into an enhanced partnership with Greenland for critical minerals and to prioritise a bilateral UK-Greenland trade agreement.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/17\">I now turn to the benefits of adopting my new strategy on critical minerals for the whole United Kingdom. We are at a crossroads, looking to a future dominated by the green renewables transition and the levelling up agenda. We have left the European Union and we are looking to turbocharge the economy post covid, as well as hosting the G7 and COP26 this year. The building of a critical minerals supply chain will spread huge opportunity to every corner of our country.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/18\">I have already spoken about the critical mineral potential of left-behind areas. I know from my own work on locating a hydrogen hub in my constituency of Rother Valley that the domino effect of such supply chains in a region is transformative. For example, Sheffield&#8217;s hydrogen giga-factory could be used as part of the electric vehicles and critical minerals supply chain, creating efficiencies and synergies between our burgeoning hydrogen economy and our critical minerals economy. That will not only safeguard existing jobs but create thousands more  jobs, providing well-paid employment in the region for generations to come and injecting much needed investment into our high streets in industrial towns such as Dinnington, Maltby, Thurcroft and Swallownest.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/19\">As more companies and educational institutions are attracted by that industrial cluster of critical minerals, steelmaking and hydrogen plants, prosperity is sure to follow. Repatriating the critical minerals supply chain is a vital part of our levelling up agenda, upskilling the local population and supporting our green programme. The more steps in the chain located in the UK, the more we control environmental standards, labour standards and ESG matters.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/20\">A circular economy underpinned by the expansion of industries such as recycling, repair and remanufacturing could also create over half a million jobs across the UK. Most of these would be in remanufacturing and most would not be in London or the south-east. It would be particularly important to give a second life to machinery that will enable a low-carbon future.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/21\">We are, of course, in a race for these manifold benefits. Our industrial objectives are the same as those of Europe and their companies are looking for the same critical minerals we are. The threat is that we will not secure the supply chain as the EU and other nations advance their strategies before we can. Companies looking to take advantage of the new industrial revolution are thinking regionally to maximise profits against the relatively high capital expenditure needed to start these businesses. As such, we find ourselves in a race against friends to secure a supply chain of critical minerals and secure the domestication of component manufacturers to deliver the industrial objectives.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/22\">The Minister will not be surprised that I have some policy asks of the Government. The first is to support the development of potential critical minerals by supporting upstream mining capability throughout the UK. The second is the development of a critical mineral midstream. The global supply chain bottleneck is at the midstream section. When the rest of the world focused on bulk mining, China looked to the future of the industry and cornered the market for the minerals we need now. It is a monopolised sector and therefore free market forces do not work. As a Government, we must find innovative ways to fund the right projects to ensure we overcome this global bottleneck. Our regional competitor for critical minerals, the EU, has already started a finance programme looking to raise &#163;16 billion off the back of an institutional &#163;6 billion investment. Unless we find a way to compete, companies will be attracted to where the investment exists.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/23\">The third ask is that we work with our international partners to produce a Five Eyes critical minerals strategy. I strongly believe that working with our cousins in Australia and Canada is the key to building that.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/24\">The fourth request is that the Government support university programmes, such as the Camborne School of Mines, to make sure that they look at critical minerals. The final ask is that the Government release a critical minerals strategy at the earliest opportunity, to give investors and industry certainty and to allow Members of this House to scrutinise the economic, environmental and societal benefits.<\/p><p pid=\"b135.1\/25\">I believe firmly in our 10-point plan for a green recovery and our net zero target, and I am a staunch supporter of the levelling up agenda. The UK has all the necessary skills and talent to be a world leader in the sector, working with our Five Eyes and Commonwealth friends. We just need the Government&#8217;s support, direction, and investment to unleash this potential, creating opportunity across Britain, boosting our green economy, and protecting our energy and defence interests. The critical minerals great game has begun. With the Government behind us, I know that the UK will be the winner.<\/p>",

In response to these worrying developments, the United Kingdom has already taken decisive action. This includes offering a bespoke immigration path for British nationals overseas, suspending our extradition treaty with Hong Kong indefinitely and extending our arms embargo on mainland China to Hong Kong. The United Kingdom has led international action to hold China to account. As recently as <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-02-22\">22 February<\/phrase>, the Foreign Secretary addressed the UN Human Rights Council to call out the systematic violation of the rights of the people of Hong Kong, making it clear that free and fair legislative elections must take place with a range of opposition voices allowed to take part.<\/p><p pid=\"b881.2\/2\">On the question raised by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Layla Moran\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25689\">the hon. Member for Oxford West and Abingdon (Layla Moran)<\/phrase>, this week meetings of China&#8217;s National People&#8217;s Congress are taking place behind closed doors. We understand that the agenda includes proposals for changes to Hong Kong&#8217;s election processes. Although the detail is yet to be revealed, these measures might include changes to the election of the Chief Executive, the removal of district councillors from the Chief Executive election committee and the possible introduction of vetting for those standing for public office to ensure that they are described as patriots who govern Hong Kong. Such measures, if introduced, would be a further attack on Hong Kong&#8217;s rights and freedoms.<\/p><p pid=\"b881.2\/3\">Ahead of possible developments this week, the United Kingdom has raised our concerns, including with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese embassy in London, as have many of our international partners. The Chinese and Hong Kong authorities can be in no doubt about the seriousness of our concerns. Given recent developments, including the imposition of the national security law last year, the imposition of new rules to disqualify elected legislators in November and the mass arrests of activists in January, we are right to be deeply concerned. We are seeing concerted action to stifle democracy and the voices of those who are fighting for it.<\/p><p pid=\"b881.2\/4\">There is still time for the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities to step back from further action to restrict the rights and freedoms of Hongkongers, and to respect Hong Kong&#8217;s high degree of autonomy. We will continue working with our partners to stand up for the people of Hong Kong and hold China to its international obligations, freely assumed under international law, including through the legally binding Sino-British joint declaration.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1508.0\/1\">My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow the well-made points made by the noble Lord, Lord Lancaster of Kimbolton, and I certainly take them on board. I am going to speak briefly to the opening amendments and the general feel of the Bill. I do so having also taken on board the wise words of my noble and gallant friend Lord Stirrup. I look forward to hearing more about his reservations on the Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"a1508.0\/2\">I was enormously impressed by what we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and the noble Baroness, Lady Chakrabarti. Their words are, I contend, in the interests of our armed services, given that clarity on the fairness that these matters require helps to give confidence that proceedings involving service personnel are thorough. We desire them to be thorough and universally admired. If they are, that only helps our service personnel. I look forward to hearing other speakers and the reply of the Minister to those concerns.<\/p><p pid=\"a1508.0\/3\">I turn to a slightly wider landscape. We hear virtually every week in your Lordships&#8217; House about disturbing events in, for example, Myanmar, Hong Kong and China, as well as, even nearer to home, the recent case of the American woman claiming diplomatic immunity after her tragic road crash. There were the cases of the assassination of Mr Khashoggi, the poisonings in Salisbury, Sergei Magnitsky and the current detention of Mr Navalny. The point that I am making is that in all those cases it takes time for the facts to emerge, even to be dug up. The case of Baha Mousa could easily have taken six years, but I salute the efforts that were made. I am afraid that the facts often take longer than five years to emerge. Still more importantly, I contend that our remonstrations about these cases is all the stronger if the way in which we deal with our own employees is as beyond reproach as possible. That is why I worry that five years is too short and why I have real concerns over the presumptions against prosecutions contained in the Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"a1508.0\/4\">Finally, I stress that I accept that the terrible things that happen in the heat of battle are quite different from the premeditated use of torture. It is that matter which particularly concerns me and to which I shall return when we reach Amendment 14.<\/p>",

It must never be allowed to tip into prejudice around people&#8217;s faith or ethnicity. It is vital that we keep focused on the issue that the protesters are protesting about. Mr Modi needs to recognise that the world is watching and that what  happens in India resonates here in our country. He must recognise his responsibility, in line with international law, to keep the Sikh community safe and confident in India&#8217;s law enforcement. Such recognition is important for the individuals and families affected, and also for those of us who are keen to see India flourish as the great, successful, multicultural nation that we know it to be.<\/p><p pid=\"c20.3\/2\">The UK Government naturally and rightly value their trade relationship with India, which stands at more than &#163;18 billion annually, but the UK-India relationship must be broader and deeper than just trade. It should be based on working in partnership on issues of security and climate change. Critically, it must be about the joint promotion of democracy, human rights and upholding international law.<\/p><p pid=\"c20.3\/3\">On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-02-01\">1 February<\/phrase>, I asked the Foreign Secretary to raise the issue of human rights with the Indian Government, and today I urge the UK Government to engage more actively and more urgently with New Delhi. What steps has the Minister taken to engage proactively with his counterparts in New Delhi to ensure that the right to peaceful protest is upheld? Secondly, what representations has he made to his Indian counterpart about the need to resolve the situation peacefully by working with all parts of Indian society, including trade unions, and the need to advance the negotiations that have stalled? Thirdly, will he publish a broader strategy to defend internet and media freedom, not only in India, but in other places such as Belarus, Hong Kong and Uganda? Fourthly, what steps have the UK Government taken to support the rights of Amnesty International, which was recently forced to discontinue its operations in India?<\/p><p pid=\"c20.3\/4\">Finally, the invitation to join the G7 in Cornwall represents a significant development in India&#8217;s role as a leading nation in global politics. Will the Minister confirm that the Prime Minister will take this opportunity to stress to Mr Modi the need for India to adhere to the high standards that are expected within the international community, particularly with regard to universal human rights and the rule of law?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>My Rt Hon friend the Home Secretary is today laying before the House a Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We have made a change to the Immigration Rules which will open the new Graduate route to enable international students to remain in the UK to work, or look for work, for two years (three years for doctoral students) after they have completed their studies. The route will open on 1 July 2021. All international students who have successfully completed a degree (or other qualifying course) at undergraduate level or above at a higher education provider with a track record of compliance, and who have valid Student (or Tier 4) permission, will be able to apply. The Doctorate Extension Scheme (DES) will close when the Graduate route opens. The introduction of this route, which was announced in September 2019, will significantly improve the UK&#8217;s offer to international students.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We are making changes to accommodate the launch of the new Graduate route. The first change is to expand the definition of a new entrant to include those switching from the Graduate route. Time spent in the Graduate route will count towards the maximum period of four years for which a person can be considered a new entrant. We are also making a change so those previously on the Student or Graduate routes, who make a short visit to the UK, do not disqualify themselves from being considered a new entrant.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We are also giving effect to some of the recommendations made by the Migration Advisory Committee in its review of the Shortage Occupation List (SOL) in September 2020. We are adding eight occupations in the health and care sector as well as modern language teachers to the UK-wide SOL. We are removing chefs from the SOL, although they will continue to be eligible for the Skilled Worker route due to the expanded skills threshold.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In addition, we are accepting the recommendation to add deck hands on large fishing vessels and vent chicken sexers, where those occupations meet experience requirements, to the list of occupations which are eligible for the Skilled Worker route.<\/p><p>We are updating the salary thresholds to include a minimum hourly rate to safeguard against employers who may require employees to work longer hours to make up for the lower rates of pay. We are including a transitional arrangement for those already on the Skilled Worker route in a job paying less than the minimum (&#163;10.10 per hour) to avoid anyone losing their job as a result of the change.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We are making a change to prevent employers from reducing their Skilled Worker salaries below the level of tradeable points which have been assessed and awarded by the Home Office. If a sponsor wishes to reduce a salary based on a different set of tradeable points, a new application will be required. This ensures the Home Office has assessed and confirmed that the Skilled Worker continues to meet the requirement of the route.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We are expanding the Academic Technology Approval Scheme to include those coming to the UK under a sponsored work route to work in an occupation which includes postgraduate research in an academic environment, in certain sensitive subjects where an individual&#8217;s knowledge could be used in programmes to develop advanced conventional weapon technology, weapons of mass destruction (WMD), or their means of delivery. This change is designed to protect UK research from exploitation and from inadvertently supporting the proliferation of WMD or advanced conventional weapon technologies.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Some adjustments are being made to the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) and the EUSS family permit. These will ensure their continued operability and the full implementation of the Citizens&#8217; Rights Agreements beyond the 30 June 2021 deadline for applications to the EUSS by those EEA citizens and their family members resident in the UK by the end of the Transition Period. By 31 January 2021, more than 5 million applications to the EUSS had been received and more than 4.5 million grants of status had been issued.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We are making changes to the Global Talent route to enable applicants who have reached the pinnacle of their careers to bypass the endorsement requirement and instead qualify if they have received a prestigious prize. An initial list of prizes have been identified and agreed by the endorsing bodies for the route based on their expert opinion and represent the leading awards in their respective fields.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Applicants meeting this requirement will not be required to apply for endorsement, which should expedite the application process. In all other aspects, the requirements and conditions applying to individuals relying on a prestigious prize will be consistent with those who qualify using an exceptional talent endorsement, including having a three year qualifying period for settlement and identical conditions applied to their permission.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>There are currently two separate schemes to assist current and former Locally Employed Staff (LES) in Afghanistan: the Ex-Gratia Scheme (EGS) and the intimidation policy. The existing intimidation policy is available to any current or former Afghan LES who have been employed directly by the UK Government in Afghanistan since 2001, from the first day of their employment, regardless of their role, job or length of service. This is being replaced with the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (ARAP) for current and former Afghan LES to reflect the changing security situation in Afghanistan and the risk faced by current and former LES there. The EGS will continue to operate without change until the closing date of 30 November 2022 already set out in the Immigration Rules.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The ARAP moves away from the present policy model which is based on the investigation of alleged cases of intimidation and requires discrete evidence, and into an assessment-oriented approach. This will be grounded in a recognition that the situation in Afghanistan has evolved and poses a latent threat to many current and former LES in particular roles. Other assistance, e.g. internal moves in-country and bespoke security advice, will still be available where appropriate and reflects that not all LES are able or willing to relocate.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>An amendment is being made to clarify the grounds for refusal policy intention that permission may only be refused or cancelled on the basis of rough sleeping where the person has repeatedly refused offers of support and engaged in persistent anti-social behaviour<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Finally, a change is being made to Appendix Hong Kong British National (Overseas) which will allow those on the British National (Overseas) route to apply to vary their conditions to have their no recourse to public funds condition lifted where they are able to demonstrate they are destitute or at imminent risk of destitution.<\/p><p> <\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a318.2\/1\">My right hon. Friend makes an entirely valid point. One of the points that I want to make in my short contribution is that we have to accept that the high street and small businesses have moved on.  The truth is that we have a very unequal tax system. Giants such as Amazon are paying an infinitely small proportion of their profits and turnover in business rates, and are driving small businesses and shops out of the high street. I personally think that there is something to be said for abolishing business rates all together. How would we pay for that? We could actually pay for it through a 3% increase on VAT on all businesses. That, of course, would hit the very large businesses such as Amazon, which pay derisory levels of tax, very hard indeed. My right hon. Friend makes a very fair point.<\/p><p pid=\"a318.2\/2\">May I repeat what I say in every Budget? Perhaps I am a bit of a broken record on this, but I do believe in transparency, and I believe that ultimately we should try to reform our whole tax system. The TaxPayers&#8217; Alliance has counted 1,651 tax changes since May 2010, including: 58 changes to air passenger duty; 130 changes to national insurance; 68 changes to stamp duty; 256 changes to VAT; 53 changes to tobacco duty; and 258 changes to vehicle excise duty. Our tax code is 17,000 pages long&#8212;or it was in 2015; it is even longer now. We should compare that with the tax code of an enterprise economy such as Hong Kong, which is only 350 pages long.<\/p><p pid=\"a318.2\/3\">As things get easier next year, my plea to the Chancellor is to make our taxes clear, simple and fair. Tax complexity creates a structural bias in favour of the very rich and the big corporations, and that is not fair. Global giants can hire entire departments of tax advisers. I therefore agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings: let us look after middle-class people, who pay PAYE and bear the brunt of all tax increases, and let us direct tax increases at those who can pay, namely the digital giants.<\/p>",

He was hiding in the Libyan People&#8217;s Bureau, which was in St James&#8217;s Square in London. In this debate, I want to remember her by talking about her life and her tragic death, as well as making a request that she, even now, be considered for a posthumous gallantry award.  I do not intend to speculate about who was responsible for pulling the trigger, as I believe there is now very little chance of bringing the murderers to justice, much as I would dearly like to see that happen.<\/p><p pid=\"b876.2\/2\">Yvonne Fletcher was born on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-06-15\">15 June<\/phrase> 1958. Her parents, Michael and Queenie Fletcher, lived in Semley, Wiltshire. Yvonne was the oldest of four daughters, and from the age of three, she told her parents that she wanted to join the police. It was her primary ambition in life. By the time she was 18 and a half, she tried, but she was  1&#189; inches too short to reach the height required; she needed to be 5 feet 4 inches, and she was 5 feet 2&#189; inches. Disappointedly, she applied for any police service that she could get into, which included the Royal Hong Kong police. Yvonne&#8217;s persistence paid off, and the Metropolitan police waived the height requirement in her case. She must have been very special for them to  do that.<\/p><p pid=\"b876.2\/3\">After training and a two-year probationary period, she was confirmed as a regular woman police constable. After being given her warrant, she spent most of her police service working from Bow Street police station. It was there that she became engaged to another police officer, Police Constable Michael Liddle. For some six years, Yvonne was based at Bow Street, where she was hugely respected and liked by her fellow officers. I gather she was called &#8220;Super Fletch&#8221;, and that was because, first, they liked her, and secondly, she was very good at her job.<\/p><p pid=\"b876.2\/4\">On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-04-17\">17 April<\/phrase> 1984, Yvonne was asked to reinforce a police operation monitoring a demonstration of mainly Libyan students who were protesting about the regime of Colonel Gaddafi. The main part of that demonstration was occurring in St James&#8217;s Square. A detachment of about 30 police officers was sent to St James&#8217;s Square, including Yvonne Fletcher, her fianc&#233; Michael Liddle, and members of the police diplomatic protection group. The anti-Gaddafi protesters consisted of about 75 people, and their demonstration started at about 10 am. Many of the demonstrators were wearing masks to make sure that they could not be identified by photographers standing at the windows of the Libyan People&#8217;s Bureau. Gaddafi&#8217;s regime had a habit of murdering opponents, wherever they were in the world, so this precaution was very sensible.<\/p><p pid=\"b876.2\/5\">The police had erected barriers. The demonstrators were behind them, and Yvonne and her colleagues were in front. The demonstrators carried anti-Gaddafi banners and chanted slogans against the dictator. I think that there was actually a pro-Gaddafi protest there as  well. Suddenly, at 18 minutes past 10, automatic gunfire was discharged from two windows of the People&#8217;s   Bureau. It was presumably directed at the anti-Gaddafi demonstration, but a round hit Yvonne Fletcher. I suspect that the gunman simply sprayed the area and did so without really looking out of the window, with their hands up so that they could not be identified. The bullet entered Yvonne&#8217;s back and tore through her body. She collapsed on the road. Several other people were wounded, although none was as badly hurt as Yvonne.<\/p><p pid=\"b876.2\/6\">The police shepherded the demonstrators into Charles II Street, while several of Yvonne&#8217;s police colleagues tried to save her. I quote from an email that I received from PC John Murray, who was with her at the time. Forgive me for quoting directly, but he did email me last week. He said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b876.2\/7\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Yvonne was shot from the bureau, and fell to the ground. I went over to her. I was only feet from her and cradled her head. The square quickly emptied, leaving three of us with Yvonne. We carried her into a nearby street and I went with her in the ambulance to hospital. In the ambulance there were other Libyan students who were bleeding from their wounds, but she seemed more concerned about them. &#8216;Keep safe. Be calm,&#8217; she said.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b876.2\/8\">What incredible courage and conduct for a young woman of 24 or 25. What an example&#8212;to the Metropolitan police themselves and to every one of us. I am in awe of that, and I suspect that anyone listening is too.<\/p><p pid=\"b876.2\/9\">At 10.40 am, Yvonne had been taken to Westminster Hospital. For some of the time going there, she was conscious but in huge pain. As she was being transferred from the ambulance on to the trolley in the hospital, the spent bullet that had travelled through her body fell out of her uniform. Yvonne was taken straight into the operating theatre, but it was too late; she died on the operating table at about midday.<\/p><p pid=\"b876.2\/10\">Yvonne&#8217;s hat and four other officers&#8217; helmets were left lying in the square during the ensuing siege of the bureau. At the time, I was a staff officer in the Ministry of Defence. In the days that followed, I remember&#8212;I suspect others do too&#8212;the images of the hats and helmets in St James&#8217;s Square being shown repeatedly in the media, on the television and in newspapers.<\/p><p pid=\"b876.2\/11\">Ten days later, on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-04-27\">27 April<\/phrase>, a police officer called Clive Mabry, acting against specific orders, ran in and retrieved Yvonne&#8217;s hat from in front of the bureau. Getting that hat back was hugely symbolic and doing that meant one heck of a lot to the policemen and policewomen. Typically for any uniformed organisation&#8212;I have been in one myself&#8212;Mabry was admonished, but praised too. He was fined seven days&#8217; pay by the police for his indiscipline, as well as being given the freedom of the City of London for doing the right thing. The hat was placed on Yvonne&#8217;s coffin for her funeral, which took place later the same day in Salisbury Cathedral. Six hundred policemen attended that funeral.<\/p><p pid=\"b876.2\/12\">Yvonne&#8217;s conduct exemplified the very highest standards of the Metropolitan police service. When she was mortally wounded, she seemed to care more about others who were with her in the ambulance than herself. What courage she displayed by saying to those trying to look after her that they should keep safe and stay calm. That was within minutes of her death. She did that when she must have been in the gravest of agony.<\/p><p pid=\"b876.2\/13\">From my own experience of writing citations, may I suggest that a posthumous award of the George Medal could be considered, despite the passage of years, and  because of Yvonne&#8217;s calm, courageous demeanour while she was grievously wounded, and dying? As so many of us remember, Police Constable Keith Palmer was murdered near here, in New Palace Yard, on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-03-22\">22 March<\/phrase> 2017. He was awarded the George Medal posthumously. I believe there should be such an award for Yvonne Fletcher, who showed valour of a similar nature to that of Keith. Keith tried to stop the madman, although he was unarmed; it cost him his life. Yvonne was saying things and showing, in the way she behaved, how courageous she was.<\/p>",

The first is that the Government&#8217;s position in saying that it should be for the courts to decide whether a genocide is taking place but not giving them any powers even to offer an opinion on that fact is a recipe for inaction. It is a recipe for inaction in one of the worst causes imaginable because we are talking about genocide. It is a striking fact that, historically, the British Government have never declared a genocide to be in progress before it has been completed. We have to wrestle with the legacy of history. We did not do it in respect of Stalin; we did not do it in respect of Hitler. We have afterwards taught our children in schools about the horrors of genocide against the Jews and against many other races which those dictators and others carried through, so we should learn the lessons and seek to stop genocides in future.<\/p><p pid=\"a748.0\/2\">The second powerful point made by my noble friend is that part of the reason why we should go down the route which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has so convincingly laid out for us is not simply to reveal a genocide that is currently in progress&#8212;or may be; that is to be determined, but there is very good circumstantial evidence which should be tested and courts are good at doing so&#8212;but to limit the further extension of that atrocity while it is happening. We should do that rather than doing what may well happen, which is that in 20 or 30 years&#8217; time, when people may talk about Xi Jinping in the same way as they talk about Stalin and Hitler, we ask: what are the lessons and why did we not learn them at the time?<\/p><p pid=\"a748.0\/3\">The course proposed today seems not only deeply moral but relevant in terms of our own capacity to avoid greater horrors and problems that we ourselves will have to face. The noble Lord referred to a red line that he has; we should be much more worried about the red wall which we face in respect of Xi Jinping. That will have to be addressed over time, and it is much better that we get the measure of it earlier rather than later. Surely the lesson from such dictators in the past is that there was a moment when it was possible to stand up to them and find a way through that did not involve extreme action. We could all look at it in due course. The noble Lord, Lord Blencathra, and I had a good-natured exchange last time about what he sees as the great weakness of the Foreign Office. It has not always been weak. My great hero is Ernie Bevin because he stood up to Stalin after 1945 and we did not have to repeat the horrors of another full-scale war. There is plenty of combustible material in respect of China that could lead to war in future. We have only to look at what is going on in Hong Kong and Taiwan, let alone what is going on inside China itself. These matters are weighty. My noble friend said that some votes matter more than others. One reason for that is the consequences of action and inaction, and there is no bigger set of issues than those that we are addressing today.<\/p><p pid=\"a748.0\/4\">The noble Lord, Lord Blencathra, said that the Minister, for whom we have a high regard, had been handed a poisoned chalice. We are very glad to see that he is still well on the Government Front Bench and will be in a condition to reply to this debate at the  end. However&#8212;if I may use a Chinese analogy&#8212;in trying to persuade us not to agree to this amendment, what the Minister has done is offer us a very Chinese artefact: a paper tiger. He has made all kinds of imprecations as to what might happen if we agree to the amendment. Apparently, the constitution is going to be ripped up forthwith, which we are doing by the back door&#8212;what a large back door; an extraordinary number of people appear to be walking through it in remarkable unison. We were told that the amendment would somehow go against the wishes of the elected House. On the previous amendment, where the Minister told us not to be seduced by the noble Lord, Lord Lansley, he said that there was a resounding majority in the other place, which was why we should not insist on it. Not only was the majority when the Commons voted on the first of these amendments only 15 but, as the noble Lord, Lord Blencathra, rightly said, there was not a vote on the amendment in the name of noble Lord, Lord Alton; there was a resounding silence on it from the House of Commons. We should therefore resoundingly ask the House of Commons resoundingly to resolve its silence; that is our duty in respect of the amendment before us.<\/p><p pid=\"a748.0\/5\">On the second element of the paper tiger the Minister put forward, he said, in establishing his red line, that the Government would not agree to expand the jurisdiction of the courts to assess the existence of genocide. But we are a parliamentary democracy. It is not for the Government to say whether the courts should assess whether genocide has taken place. It is for Parliament to legislate on whether the courts should have that power.<\/p><p pid=\"a748.0\/6\">The Minister gave us a constitutional lecture on the separation of powers. It is not for the Government to tell the courts what they will and will not consider. That is for Parliament, making the law, to determine. It does not matter what the Government&#8217;s red line is; the issue is what Parliament&#8217;s red line is, and we do not know that yet, because the House of Commons has not had the opportunity to give its opinion. This House has given its opinion twice, which is unusual, since, normally, in ping-pong, we start to become faint-hearted and susceptible to the arguments about the role of this House and all that. Unusually, this House has had larger majorities as we have considered this matter again. I suspect there will be a very decisive majority at the end of this debate, too. I strongly urge all noble Lords who sympathise with the arguments, but are in doubt about what they should do, to vote for the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, because that will ensure this has the best possible consideration by the House of Commons.<\/p><p pid=\"a748.0\/7\">I will make one final point about the red line and the red wall. The issues we face are extremely grave. If you read about the conversation between President Biden and President Xi Jinping, although there is a determination to have decent bilateral relationships, there is no clear meeting of minds between those two great powers. As the noble Lord, Lord Blencathra, rightly said, it would be disingenuous of Her Majesty&#8217;s Government to pretend that there in respect of the United Kingdom, too.<\/p><p pid=\"a748.0\/8\">Many noble Lords may read a thing called China Daily, which we have circulated free to us&#8212;the propaganda sheets of the Chinese Government. China Daily&#8217;s account  of that conversation should leave one in no doubt about what Xi Jinping said. According to its interpretation, he said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a748.0\/9\">&#8220;China hopes the US respects China&#8217;s core interests and cautiously deals with matters related to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang, which are China&#8217;s domestic issues concerning the nation&#8217;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a748.0\/10\">On the opposite page, in a remarkable story headlined &#8220;Reporting the truth about China&#8221;, there is a whole series of assertions and lies about what is going on Xinjiang, including the claim that there are no events that are out of order taking place there, that the re-education camps are to improve the employment prospects of the Uighurs and nothing more, and that in the BBC facts have been &#8220;twisted&#8221; and the situation<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a748.0\/11\">&#8220;has been angled to give a certain, preconceived message.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a748.0\/12\">Of course, since we last debated this issue, the BBC has been banned from China and Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"a748.0\/13\">That brings us back to the need to have a clear assessment of what is going on, attracting and weighing evidence. That is the fundamental purpose of this amendment. When this matter was last considered by the House of Commons&#8212;in the strange procedure that did not actually allow a vote to take place on the key issue&#8212;Greg Hands said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a748.0\/14\">&#8220;Fundamentally, it is right and proper that Parliament takes a position on credible reports of genocide relating to proposed free trade agreements rather than, in effect, subcontracting responsibility to the courts to tell us what to think.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Commons, 9\/2\/21; col. 219.]<\/p><p pid=\"a748.0\/15\">Parliament is not subcontracting responsibility to the courts. On the contrary, it is asking eminent judicial figures and the courts to report on and expose the facts, so we know what is happening. Once those facts have been exposed, it is for Parliament and the Government to decide what action should follow. But we will not get that action unless we have the facts. This is a circular process: we need the facts; we need proper inquiry; we need measured judgments made on them just so that Ministers, such as the noble Lord, Lord Grimstone, can make balanced judgments in due course.<\/p><p pid=\"a748.0\/16\">We do not want, in 20 or 30 years&#8217; time, to have to spend time in our schools teaching our young people about the genocide in China in the 2020s that we did nothing to resist, involving what could be terrible consequences in terms of the relationships between the great powers, because we were not even prepared to consider whether a genocide was taking place.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b769.0\/1\">I thank <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Anneliese Dodds\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25618\">the hon. Member for Oxford East (Anneliese Dodds)<\/phrase> for securing this debate, which is an important opportunity to take stock ahead of next week&#8217;s Budget. With the leave of the House, Mr Speaker, I shall also close the debate for the Government later.<\/p><p pid=\"b769.0\/2\">The hon. Lady, and Members from all parties, will appreciate that I cannot discuss any of the specifics of next week&#8217;s Budget, but I can say that although we may not always agree on the way ahead, I believe that we in this House all want the same outcome: a vibrant and prosperous economy that gives people everywhere the opportunities that they deserve.<\/p><p pid=\"b769.0\/3\">In responding to the motion, I intend to do three things. First, I shall briefly remind the House of the economic and fiscal situation that we inherited in 2010. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Good idea!&#8221;] It is a welcome motion for enabling that. Secondly, I shall examine the state of the economy a decade later, noting the difference, for  which the credit goes to previous Treasury Ministers&#8212;not current Conservative Treasury Ministers&#8212;who took difficult decisions in the national interest. Finally, I shall say a little about the Government&#8217;s ambitions now, with the obvious caveat that a Budget is imminent.<\/p><p pid=\"b769.0\/4\">As Members will recall, the outlook in 2010 was not good. The financial crisis had torn a hole in our country&#8217;s future, the economy was shrinking and the deficit was ballooning. As George Osborne said at the time of his speech in the Queen&#8217;s Speech: Economy debate in 2010 :<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b769.0\/5\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Getting over the worst economic inheritance any modern government has been bequeathed by its predecessor is not so easy.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b769.0\/6\">He also noted that the British economy had become<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b769.0\/7\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;deeply unbalanced&#8230;Unbalanced between different parts of the country&#8230;Unbalanced between different sections of society&#8230; Unbalanced between different parts of our economy&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b769.0\/8\">As set out by the most recent Labour Chief Secretary, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Liam Byrne\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11360\">the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Liam Byrne)<\/phrase>&#8212;I accept that it was a light-hearted note and that much of the criticism he has received has probably been unfair, but the substance remained&#8212;there was no money left.<\/p><p pid=\"b769.0\/9\">The coalition Government took power in 2010, at a moment when one thing mattered more than anything else: strong leadership prepared to make the right decision in the national interest. As hon. and right hon. Members will recall, in the years that followed the Government took steps to put this country back on a stable financial footing, because we need a strong economy to fund strong public services. The economy expanded in every year of the decade that followed. In fact, between 2010 and 2019, it grew by a total of 19.2%, which was faster than France, faster than Italy and faster than Japan&#8212;a reality not reflected at all in today&#8217;s motion. Achieving that success was about many things, not just fiscal discipline. In 2010, for instance, the Government created the Office for Budget Responsibility, which introduced independence, greater transparency and credibility to the economic and fiscal forecasts on which fiscal policy is based. Indeed, 10 years on, the OBR is considered by many of its peers to be the gold standard of independent fiscal institutions.<\/p><p pid=\"b769.0\/10\">Just as now, a key focus for the Government throughout that period was protecting, supporting and creating jobs; here, too, the numbers are impressive. Participation in the labour market reached a record high of 79.8% in the three months to February 2020&#8212;three percentage points higher than in 2010. In the same year, the UK had a higher employment rate and a lower unemployment rate than both the OECD and G7 averages. Between the 2010 election and the end of 2019, we saw over 3.8 million more people in employment&#8212;equivalent to an average of nearly 1,000 extra people in work every single day&#8212;and 85% of that growth was in high-skilled occupations. Importantly, that growth was across the board. The employment rate increased for all regions in the country, as well as for women, for young people and for poorer households. Indeed, prior to the pandemic, the employment rate among women was at a record high of 72.7%, and youth unemployment was down almost half on 2010.<\/p><p pid=\"b769.0\/11\">If hon. Members remember just one key statistic, perhaps it should be this: real household disposable income per head&#8212;the Treasury&#8217;s preferred measure of living standards&#8212;was 11.4% higher in 2019 than at the start of 2010, and incomes grew most strongly for  households on lower and middle incomes. Remember that this was also the decade when we made significant personal tax cuts and introduced the national living wage, which we have increased every year. Taken together, changes to the national living wage, personal allowance and national insurance contributions mean that an employee working full-time on the national living wage is more than &#163;5,200 better off than in April 2010. This is a track record of which any Government of any political persuasion should be proud.<\/p><p pid=\"b769.0\/12\">It was not just households across the country that understood the benefits; the world recognised them too. In 2018, the UK topped the Forbes list of best countries for business for the second year running. A year later, the World Economic Forum acknowledged our strengths in innovation capability, business dynamism, institutions and market size. Businesspeople everywhere felt the same. The UK has the third highest foreign direct investment stock in the world after the US and Hong Kong, and more foreign investment than Germany and France combined. None of this reflects today&#8217;s motion; indeed, it reflects strong leadership, fiscal responsibility and a Government prepared to act in the national interest.<\/p><p pid=\"b769.0\/13\">Coronavirus has been a great challenge that we, as a country, have had to face together. Every country has had to reckon with the virus&#8217;s economic impact, but because of the decisions made by successive Chancellors over the past 10 years, our economy and public services were strong when the pandemic hit. The markets understood that we were a Government who could plan for the future and make decisions when they mattered. As a result, we have been able to respond in the way in which we have. This House has heard about that response numerous times. It is one of the largest and most comprehensive responses in the world, totalling more than &#163;280 billion since March 2020. Millions of jobs and livelihoods have been supported through the furlough scheme and the self-employment income support scheme. We have allocated billions of pounds in loans and grants to businesses across the UK. It is a response that the IMF singled out as<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b769.0\/14\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;one of the best examples of coordinated action globally&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b769.0\/15\">It called the response &#8220;aggressive&#8221; and &#8220;unprecedented&#8221;&#8212;that is a frequently used word, but I do not apologise for using it again. Indeed, the Resolution Foundation has said that the response<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b769.0\/16\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;prevented an unprecedented collapse in GDP from turning into a living standards disaster.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b769.0\/17\">The fact that we had rebuilt the public finances in recent years, combined with the UK&#8217;s strong institutional framework, gave us the wherewithal to borrow to provide the significant economic support that was required. Our decade of economic success made all of that possible.<\/p><p pid=\"b769.0\/18\">I know that the Opposition wish to keep talking about the past, which is surprising given that many of those years were spent supporting the economic policies of the previous Leader of the Opposition. I am always more than happy to speak about our record over the past 10 years&#8212;I welcome today&#8217;s motion as providing an opportunity to do so&#8212;but I, like this Government, want to look forward to the future.<\/p><p pid=\"b769.0\/19\">Last year&#8217;s spending review tells us everything we need to know about this Government and this Chancellor&#8217;s direction of travel. There was significant additional  funding to help our public services in their continuing fight against the pandemic&#8212;we are making record investments in public services, including an historic settlement for the NHS, which provides a cash increase of &#163;33.9 billion a year by 2023-24; we are providing better lifelong learning, such as through the &#163;375 million to deliver the Prime Minister&#8217;s lifetime skills guarantee; we are recruiting more police officers to make our streets safer, with more than 6,600 already recruited towards our 20,000 target; we are implementing our 10-point plan to tackle climate change, mobilising &#163;12 billion of Government investment, which will in turn create hundreds of thousands of green jobs across the country, including in carbon capture and storage, electric vehicles and renewable energy; we are investing in technology, innovation and the digital economy, as part of our goal to make the UK a science superpower&#8212;this Government are increasing investment in research and development at the fastest speed and greatest scale since records began; and we are investing in the UK&#8217;s economic recovery, with more than &#163;100 billion of capital investment next year to spread opportunity, create jobs and drive economic growth.<\/p><p pid=\"b769.0\/20\">The motion states that the last decade &#8220;weakened the foundations&#8221; of the economy, yet we saw nine years of continuous growth, while we reduced the deficit from 10% to below 2%, The motion says that the UK was &#8220;particularly vulnerable&#8221;, yet we have consistently protected our NHS, with the 2018 NHS settlement being the biggest cash increase in public services since the second world war. The motion says that our actions during the pandemic have &#8220;exacerbated the problems&#8221;, yet we have vaccinated more than one in three adults, which is far more than any other European country. The motion says that the UK has suffered<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b769.0\/21\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;the worst economic crisis of any major economy&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"b769.0\/22\">yet independent bodies such as the IMF have praised the UK&#8217;s response, which in turn was possible only because of the economic decisions of the last decade. The motion talks of &#8220;inequalities&#8221;, yet distributional analysis of the Government&#8217;s interventions shows that we protected the poorest working households the most, through schemes such as the furlough. It is because of our economic record that we have been able to place the protection of jobs at the heart of our covid response, with the furlough and the other business support measures.<\/p><p pid=\"b769.0\/23\">As the Chancellor said last month:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b769.0\/24\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Sadly, we have not been and will not be able to save every job and every business, but I am confident that our economic plan is supporting the finances of millions of people and businesses.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-01-11\">11 January<\/phrase> 2021; Vol. 687, c. 23.]<\/p><p pid=\"b769.0\/25\">He was right, and jobs will remain at the heart of his economic plan, as we work together to build back better and level up the whole of the UK.<\/p>",

The pandemic has changed our way of life. It has created problems with how we participate in democracy and it has already drastically changed how we do politics. On top of that, there have been assaults on democracy around the world: a military coup in Myanmar, mass protests in Hong Kong and the storming of the US Capitol by far-right activists&#8212;all that and more in a very short space of time. Such drastic events in our world should highlight why the principles of deliberative democracy and their use in Scotland should be welcomed. More democracy is no bad thing, and in its absence we sometimes see terrible impacts.<\/p><p>I noted back in 2019 that the use of citizens assemblies is a proven and respected method when it is done correctly. They can help services to work together and allow us as a country to develop our culture of citizenship. One of their key benefits is that they can allow complex issues to be explored in depth by the people who are directly affected by them. I remember hearing from those involved in the Irish citizens assembly who had advice and lessons for us. Although the assembly has done well, there is definitely room for improvement and there are opportunities to learn from the assembly, particularly for the Scottish Government.<\/p><p>One of the key pieces of advice from the Irish assembly was to ensure public participation and media buy-in. I think that that has been somewhat missed, as the public were not particularly aware of the citizens assembly and the media seemed to be uninterested. That is not to criticise the work of the assembly&#8212;I acknowledge that we have come through a difficult time when the focus has been on Covid&#8212;but it is important that, where improvements can be made, they must be made, if we are to continue using this method of participative democracy effectively.<\/p><p>Those issues were known beforehand, and the Scottish Government could have done more to ensure greater engagement and wider promotion, because it is crucial, if this is the way forward, that the public are aware and engaged and that the press want to report these things. Further to that, the success of the assembly will only be truly known if the Government takes on board at least some of the recommendations and is able to explain what it is taking on board and why. It is all well and good having participative democracy for the sake of it, but proof of its success will be the action that is taken based on the assembly&#8217;s recommendations.<\/p><p>Labour&#8217;s amendment welcomes the bold and ambitious recommendations that have been put forward to tackle inequality in Scotland, including capping private sector rents, making energy efficiency measures more affordable and investing in green infrastructure, and it calls on the Scottish Government to give an annual statement to the Parliament on what action has been taken in response to the work of the assembly. If we do that, we can build confidence in the assembly and confidence that, when people give up their time and energy, it will be worth while.<\/p><p>As they say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and the proof of the success of the assembly will be whether it makes a difference. Did the Government listen? Did other political parties listen and what action did they take? The answers to those questions will take time but, if we truly want to change the way we do politics and the way our democracy works, we will have to demonstrate that we have listened and that people giving up their time to participate in citizens assemblies are not wasting their time but are contributing to tackling the big issues or at least building consensus in the country on how to tackle the big issues of our time. I thank everyone who gave up their time to bring forward the report.<\/p><p>There are some big issues in our country on which there is not only division but outright conflict. If, as a nation, we want to address such issues, the approach of bringing people together to examine the issues, find ways through and build consensus has to be the way forward.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I thank everyone who was involved. It is now over to the politicians and political parties to demonstrate that we have listened and are committed to acting on the report and, even more, to a new way of doing politics. Time will tell.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a521.0\/1\">My Lords, I very much agree with the last things said by the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, and I welcome his comments.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.0\/2\">I should declare two interests before I go any further. The first is that I have a son in the Army. He is currently enduring sleeping out in the snow in the Sennybridge training area, poor chap&#8212;but I like to bask in his reflected glory when people pay tribute to the Armed Forces. The second, more pertinent interest is that I have been in the receipt of an Army pension for over three decades.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.0\/3\">I of course support this continuation order. Indeed, I think I took it through the Commons in 2011, although I have not checked Hansard. I pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Lancaster&#8217;s comments: he is absolutely right that this is about the relationship between Parliament, the people and the Armed Forces. That may be historic, but this is an extraordinarily important measure, because without it we would be in a very different position.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.0\/4\">I will take this opportunity to look at wider defence and Armed Forces issues. I welcome the Government&#8217;s pledge of an extra&#8212;I think&#8212;&#163;16.5 billion over the next four years but, regrettably, and I hate to say this, it is  not enough. Yes, we need to have good equipment and ships. Defence procurement, by the way, is always a mess; we thought we had got it sorted about eight years ago when I was working at the Ministry of Defence, but I am afraid that cost overruns continue to be absurd and it always needs to be sat on very closely.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.0\/5\">I follow what the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, said because I fear that the reduction people have been speaking about&#8212;the plans to cut the army to a ceiling of 72,000&#8212;are true. Now, this is nuts. It is completely bonkers. I would like to quote Kim Darroch, who was our ambassador in the United States and is now the noble Lord, Lord Darroch. He was addressing a defence committee recently, and I thank the right honourable John Spellar for pointing this out to me. The noble Lord, Lord Darroch, said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a521.0\/6\">&#8220;I would be really worried about reducing further the size of the British Army. I say that in part on the basis of my experience in Washington. I would go into the Department of Defense and occasionally to see General Mattis myself or to take people in to see him and his predecessor under the Obama Administration. One of the things that both would say consistently is, &#8216;You are already too small&#8212;in terms of your Army. I mean, 80,000 just isn&#8217;t good enough. You need to be above 100,000. It is a big mistake to reduce to the level you are at. For goodness&#8217; sake, do not go down any further and expect to retain your current level of credibility in Washington.&#8217;&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a521.0\/7\">Those are powerful words from a noble Lord who sits as a Cross-Bencher, not as a Conservative.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.0\/8\">The current coronavirus crisis shows the need for manpower&#8212;perhaps we call it people power in these politically correct days&#8212;in helping to organise the Nightingale hospitals, as my noble friend mentioned, and for the vaccinations that are still being done through military personnel. I think we used to call it military aid to civil authority. You need a disciplined force for that, and as an insurance policy to cope with the unexpected. By the way, we are about to face rocketing unemployment levels, so recruitment should become easier. We do not want to add to that unemployment.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.0\/9\">I turn briefly to the threats. Have we forgotten that President Putin has invaded Ukraine and seized Crimea? Have we forgotten MH-17, the airliner shot down over Ukraine by Russian rockets in 2014, or the poisonings in Salisbury with Novichok, which was then used against Mr Navalny in Russian territory? Do we not understand that President Putin thinks in Cold War terms, as a former KGB officer? He wants to make Russia great again, to coin a term. China is also flexing its muscles with cyberattacks while building bases on reefs in the South China Sea, threatening Australia and now us over Hong Kong. There is also the recent ban on the television network CGTN. It talks about civil-military fusion; Chinese trade, by which we all benefit, is linked to its plans for aggrandisement.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.0\/10\">I was born after the Second World War and we have been cutting the Armed Forces ever since, often for very good and sensible reasons: the end of the war and of national service, the withdrawal from empire and the end of the Cold War. In 2010, the strategic defence review, in which I was a participant, talked a lot about asymmetric warfare but I do not recall any serious discussion about resurgent military power in either Russia or China. We fondly imagined that the world  was getting safer. We may not like it, but it is actually getting more dangerous. As the world changes, so we must change too in our own interests. There is a report in the press today that France and Germany spend more on defence than we do, which rather undermines our proud boast to be the second-largest defence spender in NATO. I rather hope that my noble friend the Minister might be able to comment on that. By the way, my Army pension comes out of the defence budget, which is absurd.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.0\/11\">We need to acknowledge these threats&#8212;I have not mentioned ISIS or terrorism&#8212;and the utility of a flexible Army. It will be more worrying if there is a further reduction in our forces. We will not be taken seriously by our allies in the United States and in NATO itself, nor by the rest of the world, including China and Russia, if we send the wrong message. Of course, we need cyber and space programmes; we need new technology such as unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones as we usually call them. But we also need people&#8212;boots on the ground and trained personnel able to defend our country and our interests.<\/p>",

Lady&#8217;s questions and the point about Westminster Hall. She must remember that she was keen that it should be closed, and in bringing forward that motion I was acting only in response to representations from across the House that it was felt necessary that it should be closed. I was probably the most reluctant person to close it, because I believe in the importance of scrutiny. It has to be borne in mind that to bring it back would require extra people on the estate. I would certainly think that was reasonable, because I think it is important that we have democratic scrutiny, but those who asked for Westminster Hall to be closed must make it clear that they think it is right that more people should come back on to the estate. If that is the clear message that I get, of course I will do everything I can to facilitate its return.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c250.1\/1\">I agree with the right hon. Gentleman; there are knock-on consequences to delaying decisions, and to changing the promises and commitments that were made in previous reviews.<\/p><p pid=\"c250.1\/2\">Yes, the MOD received an additional &#163;16.5 billion in December for the rest of this Parliament, but the Office for Budget Responsibility confirms that there is a &#163;7 billion shortfall in the 10-year equipment plan. Of course we want to seek to retain full-spectrum capability, but investment in the new cyber and space programmes has been paid for by cuts to our conventional capabilities. If the pandemic has taught us anything, it is the need for resilience and flexibility. I therefore stress that it would  be a grave error to reduce the size of the Army by the speculated 10,000 troops. I suspect that the Whips might have a problem if that were put to a vote in this House.<\/p><p pid=\"c250.1\/3\">Let me step back; what Britain has traditionally brought to the table is our leadership. Our diplomatic reach, agency work and overseas aid programmes have allowed us to offer workable solutions to problems and to lead the alliances to fix them. I am genuinely concerned that Whitehall has lost the bandwidth&#8212;or, indeed, the appetite&#8212;to do this. I hope that the publication of the integrated review will prove me wrong.<\/p><p pid=\"c250.1\/4\">Finally, I want to turn to China, our biggest geopolitical long-term threat, which warrants its own chapter in the review. For decades, the west has turned a blind eye to China&#8217;s human rights abuses and democratic deficit, hoping that it will mature into a global responsible citizen. Well, we now realise that that will not happen. China&#8217;s conduct in the pandemic, in Hong Kong, in the South China sea, along with its continued abuse of World Trade Organisation rules and the way it has saddled dozens of countries with debt confirms that it is pursuing a competing long-term geopolitical agenda, which, left unchecked, will progressively see our world splinter into two spheres of influence.<\/p><p pid=\"c250.1\/5\">Economically, technologically and militarily, China will challenge and possibly overtake US dominance in our lifetime. Militarily, China&#8217;s navy grows by the size of our Navy every single year. It is now introducing its own fifth generation air force, and its army is now the largest in the world. It is sending more rockets into space than all the other nations combined and perfecting space-based weapons.<\/p><p pid=\"c250.1\/6\">In my view, cold war two has already begun, but we are still in denial and too timid to call it out, because of China&#8217;s mighty economic clout. This time, it will not be a build-up of military hardware, troops and nuclear weapons either side of an iron curtain. It will be fought on two very different fronts. First, nations will be forced to take sides, and China is winning here. It is neutralising countries by ensnaring them in long-term debt, controlling states by owning their data and paralysing the international apparatus, such as the United Nations, so removing global scrutiny. Secondly, it involves so-called short of war operations, bypassing direct military engagement through the use of cyber weapons to hit societies directly, as every aspect of our lives goes online. This is the modern battlefield: interference in our critical national infrastructure, including eventually satellites; misinformation via social media; and data theft, including personal data. This is the new reality that the integrated review must address.<\/p><p pid=\"c250.1\/7\">I hope that I have articulated to the Minister why this review of all reviews in our generation is arguably the most important for us to publish. It was a brave Churchill in 1946 who warned the west in his iron curtain speech of the advancing Soviet threat. This review offers our Prime Minister today an opportunity to do something similar, starting by expanding the G7 permanently to include Australia, India and Korea, which would represent more than half the world&#8217;s GDP, the basis on which we could reform our international trade and security standards. For China&#8217;s Achilles heel is its economy. Global trade is critical for China&#8217;s advancement. During the last war, the UK and the US got together to write the Atlantic Charter, which formed the basis for so many of the Bretton Woods organisations that built up our world order and which has served us so well for the past few  decades. They now need attention. Perhaps it is time for us to look at an Atlantic Charter 2.0. Again, this is something on which the integrated view could focus.<\/p><p pid=\"c250.1\/8\">In conclusion, it is time to up our game. The integrated review is a critical statement of intent, re-establishing our post-Brexit credentials and setting out a coherent vision of the UK&#8217;s place in the world. It is vital that the Government produce this roadmap, because it is currently missing. I hope that the Minister and the Government are listening carefully to the impressive list of parliamentary colleagues who will be speaking today, no doubt supporting this publication. I hope that there will be no further delay in the integrated review. It must be not another exercise to salami-slice capabilities, manpower, or indeed defence spending but a genuine appraisal of our defence posture and the formal confirmation of our nation elevating its global ambitions and its desire to play a more proactive role on the international stage.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c2359.0\/1\">My Lords, I welcome the Bill. It has been a long time in coming. I intend to look at the context of the Bill and its genesis. Over a decade ago, when I was working in the MoD, we saw newspaper reports that 90% of cyberattacks on the UK came from one house in Shanghai. This Bill is largely about Chinese influence being embedded in our critical national infrastructure and that is why we should concentrate on China. I wish the Chinese people well but the Chinese Communist Party is pursuing a policy of hegemony and aggrandisement. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, agreed that this has been generated by China.<\/p><p pid=\"c2359.0\/2\">I will cite a few examples. The Chinese have been building military bases on reefs built out of concrete on islands in the South China Sea, which they now claim to have territorial waters around. The belt and road initiative, which is eight years old or thereabouts, was welcomed by the media and, seemingly, western Governments. But, in fact, China has been buying up Africa, Sri Lanka and elsewhere with its belt and road initiative. I was in Ethiopia 15 months ago, where there is a brand new airport in Addis Ababa. Ethiopia may find that some of these debts do not get repaid but that is for another day. Over a decade ago, we knew about Chinese reverse engineering whereby they get hold of sophisticated technology and military equipment, work out how to build the stuff themselves and then use western secret technology against us. I hope we understand that now the scales have fallen from our eyes at last. Charles Parton of the Royal United Services Institute, speaking to the Commons Committee on the Bill, described the Chinese Government as pursuing a policy of &#8220;civil-military fusion&#8221;. That sums it up.<\/p><p pid=\"c2359.0\/3\">As we can now see, we can believe reports about Chinese treatment of the Uighurs, which perhaps we denied for some time. There are BBC reports today about systematic rape. We know about organ theft [Inaudible] million people. We can see what is happening in Hong Kong, where the Chinese are breaking the terms of the joint declaration, a legally binding international agreement. We can see the military threat to Taiwan and, I fear, the chance of war. We can see Chinese moves to building a military and commercial empire, and using threats and economic muscle against, for instance, Australian wine exports after that country dared to criticise the Chinese and suggest that the virus came from Wuhan.<\/p><p pid=\"c2359.0\/4\">I support the Bill for those reasons because our national security is under threat. The Government have got the message rather late&#8212;Huawei being excluded from 5G is a particular point that I raise&#8212;but it is not six years since Xi Jinping was entertained here and declared the UK to be the best Chinese partner in the West. Indeed, George Osborne said that this would be<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c2359.0\/5\">&#8220;a golden decade for the UK-China relationship&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"c2359.0\/6\">Today, Manchester University has cancelled an agreement with a Chinese electronics technology company because of that company&#8217;s involvement in surveillance  in Xinjiang. Ofcom has&#8212;again, this day&#8212;revoked the licence of Chinese broadcaster CGTN because the company is<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c2359.0\/7\">&#8220;ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist party.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c2359.0\/8\">Although Cambridge University has helpfully sent us all a briefing paper saying how important Chinese money is to it, I should have thought that the exposure by the noble Lord, Lord Moore, of Jesus College and others in Cambridge and their close ties with China would have shamed it a little, at least.<\/p><p pid=\"c2359.0\/9\">Surely nobody can doubt any more the unfriendly intent of China. The genocide amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, two days ago showed that the House of Lords understands that the behaviour of the Chinese needs, at the very least, close examination. Sadly, the EU has just signed a huge trade agreement with China, which is regrettable. Yes, we want inward investment, as my noble friend Lady Noakes said, and economic growth. We want to trade with the world, including China, but we need to protect ourselves and peace first, and the Bill goes some way towards doing that. I know that Governments do not always get legislation right, so we will watch the progress of the Bill, and amendments will certainly be needed as it progresses, but its spirit is correct and I support it.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b979.2\/1\">I will come to that point in due course. The right hon. Gentleman has made some important points, and he knows that those concerns are shared across the House, particularly with regard to the Uyghur minority and the shocking revelations that are coming out.<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/2\">As a member of the European Union, the UK played a leading role in designating individuals and entities for targeted sanctions. We hope that, in seeking to maintain a close friendship with the European Union and our partners now that we have left, the Government will work closely with them as well as other like-minded countries and global institutions. We also hope that the Government will do more with the powers that we now have at our disposal through the Magnitsky sanctions regime, expanding their scope and usage, as well as increasing the transparency to the House, including about the processes by which decisions are made on designations for sanctions. I hope that the rolling over of these sanctions is a sign of the Government&#8217;s intention to maintain a collaborative and friendly approach with our friends in the EU.<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/3\">Before turning to the individual countries and thematic sanctions that the Minister has outlined, I want to ask him a question. The transition period ended on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-12-31\">31 December<\/phrase> last year. What has been in place in the interim weeks? Have these sanctions continued to apply? It is obviously very important that there have not been loopholes in the last few weeks, before these measures were brought before us.<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/4\">First, on Burundi, we are fully supportive of rolling over the sanctions. The EU extended the sanction regime last year to last until <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-12-31\">31 December<\/phrase> this year. The last five years have unfortunately seen significant problems in respect of democracy and human rights. We hope that the new Government will seek to reverse many of the dangerous steps that the previous President and Government took. We saw the police, the National Intelligence Service and the ruling party&#8217;s youth wing carrying out extensive human rights violations, with allegations of extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and torture. In October 2019, four members of the Imbonerakure were convicted for killing a member of the opposition party, the National Congress for Freedom.<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/5\">We believe that the Burundi Government must seek to release human rights defenders and journalists arrested under a crackdown on opposition. That includes Germain Rukuki, a former employee of Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture, human rights defender Nestor Nibitanga and four journalists from the Iwacu press group who were arrested in October 2019, whose names I can provide to the Minister. We very much hope that Burundi will follow a process of re-engagement with international bodies on human rights, including allowing the UN human rights office to be reopened in the country and engaging with commissions from the UN Human Rights Council, which the UK has a key sea-t on.<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/6\">On Guinea, we agree with the Government on rolling over these sanctions, which relate back to the significant violence we saw in 2009, in which 150 people were brutally killed in a stadium in the capital, Conakry, and hundreds more were wounded, with women being victims of rape and other forms of sexual violence. It was a deeply distressing time for the people of Guinea, and there was widespread condemnation from the international community. There was some progress in 2014, and some sanctions were released. Could the Minister say a little bit about what progress there has been since then and whether these sanctions have had the impact that we want to see?<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/7\">On Bosnia, I visited Srebrenica with <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Bob Stewart\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24907\">the hon. Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)<\/phrase>&#8212;I believe you were on that trip, Mr Deputy Speaker&#8212;and we saw for ourselves the legacy of that terrible conflict in our own continent. I agree with the Government: it is vital that we continue to make clear our intent to stand against any of those who would undermine the security and peace that was so hard won by the general framework agreement for peace&#8212;the Dayton agreement&#8212;in 1995. That allowed for much progress, but significant tensions and concerns remain. Could the Minister clarify whether individuals have been or would be designated under this framework, or are we saying that the framework is in place to underpin the Dayton agreement and that we would not hesitate to use it with others to ensure peace and stability in that country, which is crucial for not only the people of Bosnia but the wider Balkan region?<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/8\">On Nicaragua, the explanatory notes set out clearly some of the very serious allegations that have been made about the descent into repression and violence there, so it is right that we roll over these sanctions. The social security reforms announced in April 2018 triggered ongoing protests that have continued for nearly three years. The allegations are that by the end of 2019, at least 328 people had been killed, primarily by state  security forces and pro-Government armed groups, and more than 2,000 others injured. There have been truly shocking allegations regarding mass graves, clandestine facilities, detention of political prisoners and attacks on members of the Catholic Church. The Government have also apparently banned the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights from the country and rejected the report of Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. That is deeply concerning, and we welcome these measures.<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/9\">On cyber sanctions, clearly there is an increasing factor of threats to global security, our own national security, and our commercial security. Threats and attacks on our financial institutions, democracy and security have become very clear in recent years, and they will likely only increase. The EU&#8217;s first ever sanctions last year made this a vital defensive tool in our arsenal against cyber-attacks.<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/10\">I understand that the targeted individuals include those from China working on Operation Cloud Hopper. They are alleged to have stolen intellectual property and sensitive commercial data over many years, targeting companies across six continents and sectors including banking, finance, government, aviation, space, satellite technology, manufacturing, medical, oil and gas, mining, communications, computer processing and defence. This is a huge range of measures that these hostile individuals are attempting to attack. I also understand that they target intelligence officers from the Russian general main intelligence directorate and, in April 2018, attempted to gain access to information systems of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. It is absolutely crucial that we work with our EU allies, the United States, our NATO allies and, of course, the Five Eyes community to take the most robust actions against those individuals involved with the Chinese and Russian regimes to ensure that they do not threaten our security or that of the globe.<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/11\">In the miscellaneous amendments regulations, a whole series of measures are set out to clarify sanctions relating to Iran, Venezuela, Belarus, Myanmar, Zimbabwe, Syria, Russia, Guinea-Bissau, the chemical weapons convention and many other aspects. Will the Minister be clear about whether they simply ensure the applicability and effectiveness of these measures, or expand or alter them in any way? One challenge in scrutinising these measures&#8212;I hope the Minister refers to this matter&#8212;is that sanctions are often complex, and rightly so, and we need to ensure that we understand the full intent of what the Government are trying to achieve with them.<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/12\">The second set of miscellaneous regulations deal with the issues relating to the overseas territories and Crown dependencies. I understand the Minister&#8217;s point that we do not want to see double prohibition and therefore a double licensing burden on individuals through those regulations. However, it is absolutely crucial that we ensure that there are no loopholes and no lack of oversight, so that individuals do not seek to exploit any gaps or administrative gaps. Will the Minister say a little bit more about what support is being provided to the overseas territories to ensure that they can apply the sanctions regimes, and that there is a commonality across the whole British family of the overseas territories to ensure that we have one approach? Unfortunately, we know that in the past regimes have been used, whether  financially or otherwise, to escape scrutiny and transparency, not least in the light of the current investigations into governance in the British Virgin Islands. Indeed, I have supported the Government on their commission of inquiry there. It is absolutely crucial that we have assurances on that front.<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/13\">On misappropriation, this applies mainly to individuals and entities related to Tunisia and Egypt in 2011 and Ukraine in 2014. Can the Minister further comment on how effective those have been? Will he confirm that the two persons and four entities added to the EU sanctions list in October 2020, related to the construction of bridge and railway tracks linking Russia to the illegally annexed Crimean peninsula via the Kerch Strait, will be included? Will the Government seek to work with our allies to target individuals who further seek to isolate Crimea from Ukraine? That is obviously critical.<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/14\">On the unauthorised drilling activities in the eastern Mediterranean, again, we wholeheartedly support the rolling over of sanctions and welcome its extension by both the European Union and the UK Government. Unauthorised drilling activities in the eastern Mediterranean are in direct contravention of the sovereign rights of Cyprus, within its territorial sea, exclusive economic zone and continental shelf, and they threaten the process of reaching a delimitation agreement and a bizonal, bicommunal political settlement for the whole of Cyprus. We hope that the UK Government will continue to work with the EU to maintain our full solidarity with the Government of Cyprus and work on restrictive measures to prevent further violations of the rules-based order that governs our seas and oceans. That is an absolutely crucial set of rules and guidance to which we are one of the key parties, and it is crucial that we ensure that they are applied in relation to Cyprus.<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/15\">Finally, let me make some broader points in relation to these measures today. The sanctions before us show the benefit of a collaborative international approach to sanctions, and one that has support from all parts of this House. The question remains why, with such long-standing and overwhelming evidence growing of systemic human rights abuses on an industrial scale against the Muslim Uyghur people and other minorities in China, with the attacks on the democracy and freedom of the people of Hong Kong and with the United States Government having already barred members of the Communist party of China from the US, we have not seen further designations of Magnitsky-style sanctions against officials of the Communist party of China.<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/16\">We have repeatedly called on the Government to impose sanctions against senior officials and entities directly responsible for appalling human rights abuses in Xinjiang. We have pressed for that for months but no action has been taken, so I hope the Minister can assure us that such sanctions are under consideration and explain what discussions we have had about them with our allies.<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/17\">Similarly, the Labour Opposition have consistently urged the Government to go further in their sanctions on the Myanmar military, including by targeting its business interests. I know that some of these regulations relate to previous sanctions on Myanmar. The Government failed to follow the recommendation made last year by my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Stephen Kinnock\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25297\">the Member for Aberavon (Stephen Kinnock)<\/phrase>, the shadow Minister for Asia and the Pacific, on the basis that such sanctions could have a negative  impact on foreign investment in the Myanmar economy. Not least given the events of the last few days, we believe that the Minister should move immediately to target military officials who are responsible for a brazen attack on the democratic rights of the Myanmar people, and support Magnitsky sanctions on individuals involved.<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/18\">As shadow Minister for Africa, I welcome the targeted designations against senior individuals in the Zimbabwe Government who were involved in state-backed attacks on protesters in 2019 and violence in 2018. Will the Minister confirm that those sanctions are effective immediately? We are seeing significant violence and political repercussions elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, as I said in a Westminster Hall debate about the shocking events surrounding the #EndSARS movement and the massacres at the Lekki tollgate plaza and elsewhere. I hope that Ministers are giving serious consideration to the recommendation made in that debate of targeted measures against any individuals who were involved in such shocking attacks or repression of the Nigerian people, and I hope that Ministers are listening to the wealth of evidence out there from independent human rights organisations.<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/19\">In Uganda in recent days, the presidential election has been marred by the continual arrests of Opposition Members and journalists, as well as by violence and human rights abuses. I have had some quite shocking evidence put to me. The Opposition leader was arrested multiple times and put under house arrest, with the military invading his home after the election, and there has been intimidation and attacks on journalists. It is alleged that the Uganda chief of police, Martin Okoth Ochola, stated:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b979.2\/20\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Yes, we shall beat you for your own sake to help you understand that you do not go there&#8230;I have no apology&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/21\">What are the Government going to do to stand up for the rights and freedoms of the people of Uganda? What consideration has been given to targeted sanctions against any individual involved in the violations and repressions in Guinea and elsewhere, which are rightly being targeted? It is important that we have consistency.<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/22\">We continue to see the horrific consequences of conflict in the Tigray region in Ethiopia. Hundreds have been killed, and thousands have fled to neighbouring Sudan. There is regional instability involving Eritrea and others, and a range of very serious allegations are being made about atrocities that have been committed. What assessment have the Government made of those atrocities and whether there are grounds for individual sanctions against any individual involved&#8212;from whatever side or whatever background in that conflict&#8212;who is responsible for violations of human rights or humanitarian law?<\/p><p pid=\"b979.2\/23\">Finally, I hope that we will have an honest conversation about how a UK sanctions regime will work. The EU and the US work together co-operatively to secure strong applicability of measures, and the UK must be part of that process. Ultimately, as the Minister indicated, the strength of sanctions is dependent on a unified, agreed and consistently applied framework across multiple jurisdictions. If we veer from common positions&#8212;whether in Europe, across NATO or with our Atlantic allies&#8212;that will be of huge detriment. I hope the Government will give a firm commitment to acting in all these areas, and  to ensuring consistency in the measures that the United Kingdom applies in our overseas territories and in working with our allies.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c2107.1\/1\">My Lords, we have heard many powerful speeches today. If I may say so, the speech by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, is one of the most powerful I have ever heard in the House. He made an utterly compelling case for sending this issue back to the House of Commons. Purely as a matter of parliamentary protocol, we should do so, and not only because, as the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, rightly said, the opportunity for the Government to honour their own commitment to seek a compromise can arise only if this matter goes back to the Commons, but because the current amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has addressed  the points made in the Commons speech last week by Greg Hands, the Minister for International Trade, about why we should not agree to the earlier Alton amendment.<\/p><p pid=\"c2107.1\/2\">Greg Hands said in the House of Commons last Tuesday:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c2107.1\/3\">&#8220;Nobody denies the importance and seriousness of the situation in Xinjiang &#8230; or that human rights cannot and should not be traded away in a trade agreement or anything like it.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c2107.1\/4\">He went on to say that the Government are clear<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c2107.1\/5\">&#8220;that doing more trade does not have to come at the expense of human rights. In fact, as I am sure my hon. and right hon. Friends will agree, there is a strong positive correlation between countries that trade freely and human rights&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"c2107.1\/6\">However, he said that the House of Commons should not agree to the then amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, because it<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c2107.1\/7\">&#8220;would, in effect, take out of the hands of Government their prerogative powers to conduct international relations with regard to trade&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class=\"offrep\" id=\" Commons, 19\/1\/21; cols. 796-97.]\"><i>Official Report,<\/i> Commons, 19\/1\/21; cols. 796-97.]<\/phrase><\/p><p pid=\"c2107.1\/8\">The current Alton amendment meets that point entirely. It does not take prerogative powers out of the hands of the Government; rather, it enables Parliament and government to be better informed. They could not be better informed than by the advice and judgment of the High Court, and other courts in the land, on the specific issue of whether genocide is being committed. It does not even matter whether the Government intend to come back with further proposals. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, has already met the test which Greg Hands set last week.<\/p><p pid=\"c2107.1\/9\">On the wider question, where I have some sympathy with the Minister, there are wider issues involved here &#8212;of course there are. When I was a Minister, I visited China and had substantial dealings with them. Those who of us who have been engaged in these events for many years are aware that we have a growing China problem, which is not just about the Uighurs and potential genocide. It is also about Taiwan, Hong Kong and China&#8217;s belt and road initiative. What we have in Xi Jinping is essentially a leader who is not so new now&#8212;his leadership is 10 or 11 years old&#8212;but who is increasingly Stalinist. It was reasonable to think in the decades after Deng&#8212;although, of course, Tiananmen Square was a wake-up call&#8212;that China might be on a more liberal path and that we should move accordingly. It turns out that that was a mistake. We all make mistakes, and there has been a significant change in circumstance. The Xi Jinping decision to essentially abolish what passes for the Chinese constitution at the end of his original 10-year term was clearly a massive wake-up call. Many of the worst atrocities being reported now, which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, referred to, have flowed from the radicalisation of his regime, and we have to respond accordingly.<\/p><p pid=\"c2107.1\/10\">We have been here before. I said that the regime was increasingly Stalinist. The noble Lord, Lord Blencathra, in a powerful speech, did not exhibit himself to be a great fan of the Foreign Office. He used certain epithets about it, which might indicate its weakness or pusillanimity, and so on. I have spent a large part of the last two years researching and writing about Ernest Bevin who, I can assure the noble Lord, was in no way weak as Foreign Secretary. He stood up to Stalin with determination, well before that was fashionable either in this country or, crucially, the United States, where  the early years of the Truman Administration sought to appease Stalin. Bevin stood up with a relentlessness for which we should all be grateful; maybe our freedom depends upon it. Great departures such as NATO certainly depended upon his actions.<\/p><p pid=\"c2107.1\/11\">However&#8212;and this goes straight to the point of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Alton&#8212;although two situations are never alike and there are differences between the situation with China today and with the Soviet Union in the 1940s and 1950s, one hugely important commonality is that there was then a distinct absence of knowledge about, and much controversy about, what was actually going on in Russia. Many people, predominantly but not exclusively on the left in politics, I am ashamed to say, thought that Soviet Russia was &#8220;a new civilisation&#8221;&#8212;to use the phrase in the famous book by the Webbs. They thought that it had found a new pathway to success and prosperity which we should honour. What goes straight to the point of this amendment is that they constantly poured cold water on reports coming out of Russia that there were massive abuses of human rights which verged on genocide, and which we now know were genocide.<\/p><p pid=\"c2107.1\/12\">On the point from the immensely powerful speech of my noble friend Lady Kennedy, the same was true of Nazi Germany in the 1930s. Many people, including reputable people&#8212;mainly on the right, as it happens&#8212;such as Foreign Secretaries and distinguished leaders of society and business, constantly poured cold water on the atrocities which we now know were taking place in Germany and paved the way for genocide. It would have been better if we had had these provisions in place so we could have had open and transparent debate and some legal, formal process of testing evidence. It would have made it easier for Governments&#8212;who are, as the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Rolfe, said, subject to public opinion&#8212;to shape that public opinion and respond to it. That is precisely what the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, does. It makes the business of establishing facts transparent and open so that we can have a wider debate. The courts are quite good at eliciting and elucidating facts.<\/p><p pid=\"c2107.1\/13\">I agree with the Minister that these issues are difficult. We have had his different opinions recycled in the last few days. At one and the same time, he thinks we should be cracking down hard on a regime that abuses human rights while continuing to trade with it more. I do not wish to make a party-political point; that dual mentality is precisely the dual mentality of the West at the moment. It is not just Britain; it is the European Union, which has just done another trade agreement with China, and it is also the United States. This is the situation we have got ourselves into over the last 30 years, and we must seek to resolve it.<\/p><p pid=\"c2107.1\/14\">I do not come to the House with great ideas of how we resolve this. I am not much in favour of slashing our trade with China&#8212;I hope that we can establish a basis for improvements in the Chinese regime so that that is not necessary. But the crucial point, on which I so strongly support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, is that we must have an open, factual debate based on what is actually happening and not sweep anything under the carpet.<\/p><p pid=\"c2107.1\/15\">Ernie Bevin was making these arguments about Russia in the 1930s, because, as a trade unionist, he saw what Soviet Communists were up to in the trade union movement. That is what turned him strongly against dealing with Russia. The biggest problem he had was getting agreement on what was actually happening in, first, Nazi Germany, then Russia. When I was searching in his papers, I came across correspondence between him and Charlie Chaplin. Charlie Chaplin produced a great film, &#8220;The Great Dictator&#8221;, which exposed and ridiculed Hitler and Nazi Germany and had a huge impact on opinion across Europe and the United States. However, the film was nearly not made, because the financial backers of Charlie Chaplin in Hollywood were worried it would be banned in Britain. We should support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Alton.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1822.0\/1\">My Lords, it is a great pleasure indeed to welcome my noble friend Lord Hammond of Runnymede to this House and to congratulate him on his excellent speech. Runnymede is, of course, a place where a bunch of irate barons got together, incensed by high levels of tax they were having to pay to fund the war with France. Disgruntled Peers, cross about the impact that relations with Europe were having on their nation&#8212;not much changes, does it?<\/p><p pid=\"a1822.0\/2\">I turn to the matter in hand and draw your Lordships&#8217; attention to my entry in the register of interests. As has been said, the Bill arrives in this House at a key juncture for the UK&#8217;s financial services sector. In the post-Brexit world, it is more critical than ever that we keep our financial services competitive, as others have said, and remain a globally competitive financial centre. Some may think that the best way to do that is to ensure that our regulations remain, as far as possible, aligned to the EU&#8217;s. That approach overall would be unwise and unrealistic. It would be unwise because it is in our national interest to chart our own course for our financial services sector&#8212;a goose that lays so many of our golden eggs. The approach would be unrealistic because the EU wants to build up its own financial services and therefore, in the words of my noble friend Lord Hill, whom the noble Lord, Lord Reid, quoted a moment ago, the EU will not seek to do us any favours. We would soon find out that our interests and those of our EU friends would be at odds.<\/p><p pid=\"a1822.0\/3\">Instead, we need to have the confidence that comes from the City being&#8212;to quote Mark Carney&#8212;the EU&#8217;s investment banker and a global financial epicentre that existed well before the European Union was dreamt of. We need to look to a future that is green, a future that is digital and a future that is full of opportunities. We must strengthen our position in this new world. To achieve that, Ministers and regulators must focus on how our regulatory system can help to strengthen our competitiveness. As my noble friend Lord Hunt has just said, competitiveness was one of the regulator&#8217;s objectives but was removed after the financial crash and, as has been mentioned, the Government are now consulting on whether to reinsert competitiveness as an objective. It is a pity that that consultation is still underway, given its relevance to the Bill. I will be pressing the Minister on that point.<\/p><p pid=\"a1822.0\/4\">Of course&#8212;let me make this very clear&#8212;we should not forget the lessons that we learnt from 2008, nor should we race to the bottom in terms of regulations. Robust regulation is the bedrock of strong financial services but we must not get trapped in the past and regulate entirely via the rear-view mirror. Look overseas: regulators&#8217; objectives have been adjusted since the financial crisis but without abandoning competitiveness altogether. Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and Malaysia have competitiveness or growth as a regulatory objective or principle.<\/p><p pid=\"a1822.0\/5\">We need to look ahead and plan ahead. We must properly balance the need for stability with the need to be competitive so that the UK is innovative, dynamic and a great place to do business. I do not agree with the false choice contained in the Government&#8217;s consultation, which states that,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1822.0\/6\">&#8220;a new competitiveness objective could distract from or dilute the key stability, market integrity and consumer protection objectives.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1822.0\/7\">We can and should strive to be both competitive and stable as a financial centre. Nor is the new so-called accountability framework sufficient. Requiring the PRA to consider the impact of its actions on competitiveness is no substitute for making competitiveness a core objective.<\/p><p pid=\"a1822.0\/8\">That brings me to the issue of accountability and scrutiny. Our regulators are getting more power and the Government are perfectly open about that. They have stated that they are,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1822.0\/9\">&#8220;delegating a very substantial level of policy responsibility to the UK financial services regulators.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1822.0\/10\">If regulators are being given additional powers, there should surely be a commensurate increase in scrutiny. I therefore argue and agree with others that we need to look carefully at how regulators will be scrutinised by Parliament. Of course, getting the balance right is critical but we do not want Ministers or Parliament micromanaging regulators. There are questions as to whether enough is being done to hold unelected regulators to account.<\/p><p pid=\"a1822.0\/11\">That brings me back to where I began. The best way for Parliament to make regulators accountable is for elected MPs to set unelected regulators very clear objectives. At the moment, those objectives will not achieve our aim to strengthen our competitiveness. That needs to be addressed.<\/p>",

The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office swiftly discouraged all but essential travel to China and announced that anybody entering the UK from Wuhan should self-isolate for 14 days.<\/p><p pid=\"b173.2\/2\">In February, advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies recommended that those from Thailand, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Macau, and those who were symptomatic, should also self-isolate, and regulations were introduced to allow officers to detain and direct individuals. In March, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office advised against all non-essential travel, initially for 30 days. On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-03-23\">23 March<\/phrase>, the Prime Minister advised that everyone should stay at home and travel only for essential purposes.<\/p><p pid=\"b173.2\/3\">A raft of measures followed in May, including 14 days&#8217; self-isolation, passenger locator forms and fines for those who failed to comply with those mandatory conditions. In July, the Government announced the introduction of the international travel corridors. The countries on those travel corridor lists were kept under constant review and removed as the risk of importing covid-19 increased.<\/p><p pid=\"b173.2\/4\">However, as the safeguarding of the vaccine roll-out has become the Government&#8217;s priority, we have introduced stricter controls. In December, following the identification of the new variant of the virus, we introduced a travel ban on arrivals from South Africa, later extending to a ban on South America and Portugal. We suspended travel corridors and required all passengers to show proof of a negative coronavirus test before they embark on their journey to the UK. Anyone arriving must also self-isolate for 10 days.<\/p><p pid=\"b173.2\/5\">Those new measures are being robustly enforced to keep the public safe. Passengers must continue to fill in a passenger locator form, and those who fail to comply face a &#163;500 fine. Carriers are under a legal obligation to check that each passenger has proof of a negative test, and are liable for a fine of &#163;2,000 for not complying. To date, Border Force has checked an estimated 3.7 million passenger locator forms, issued more than 2,300 fixed penalty notices and referred more than 22,000 cases to the police.<\/p><p pid=\"b173.2\/6\">The UK has a world-leading vaccination programme that should all be proud of. It is therefore right that the Government continue to do everything we can to protect the roll-out of the vaccine from new strains of the virus. We keep all measures under review and will not hesitate to take further action to protect the public.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c1228.0\/1\">My Lords, it is a great pleasure to speak after the noble Lord, Lord Hendy, whose powerful account the Government would do well to listen to.<\/p><p pid=\"c1228.0\/2\">In introducing this debate, the Minister referred, with apparent disapproval, to the increasing judicialisation of war. That surprised me. Over a significant period, this party in government has shown strong international leadership against rape as a weapon of war. I hope that the Minister&#8217;s words do not signal a move away from that; perhaps she can reassure me on that point.<\/p><p pid=\"c1228.0\/3\">My noble friend Lady Jones of Moulsecoomb, who has considerable experience and expertise in the oversight of criminal investigation and policing, focused on the detail of the Bill, so I will focus more on what it could do, if passed, to our international position and standing. I say &#8220;if passed&#8221; because, while other noble Lords have talked about seeking to improve it, it has become clear that the Bill is profoundly ill conceived. Many respected human rights organisations are calling for it to be stopped, as the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, noted.<\/p><p pid=\"c1228.0\/4\">It is worth thinking for a second about the international context in which this Bill appears before us. What does the UK look like to the rest of the world? From today, Boris Johnson is vying with Jair Bolsonaro as the most prominent remaining global leader of Trumpism, and is demonstrating that with his plan to reverse election promises on international aid. We also have the continuing chaos of Brexit and the tragically world-leading disaster that is our Covid-19 death rate. In summary, the UK is not starting from a great place in the international arena&#8212;a point made powerfully by the Prime Minister&#8217;s predecessor on the front page of today&#8217;s Daily Mail.<\/p><p pid=\"c1228.0\/5\">This Bill is clearly in line with the Trumpisation, tabloidisation, coarsening and simplification of our national dialogue&#8212;reduced down to slogans and knee-jerk reactions&#8212;that has marked the past few years, as the noble Baroness, Lady Chakrabarti, noted. We have been in line with developments in other parts of the world but, if we continue down this path, we will look increasingly isolated. The threat to our reputation was noted even by a supporter of the Bill&#8212;the noble Lord, Lord Lancaster of Kimbolton&#8212;as well as by the noble Baroness, Lady Blower, who highlighted the risk it presents in encouraging other human rights abuses around the world.<\/p><p pid=\"c1228.0\/6\">The Bill does not square with some of the other directions that the Government are taking on human rights&#8212;notably their stance on China, where they are showing tentative signs of stepping up over the genocide against the Uighurs. I am confident that your Lordships&#8217;  House will try to assist the Government with that in the Trade Bill, speaking out as a signatory to the Joint Declaration on Hong Kong over China&#8217;s breaking of that international treaty. I declare my position on the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"c1228.0\/7\">It is almost as though we have two different Governments tugging in opposite directions. It is a great pity that the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy has been delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic. It will surely look at these issues and whether it is, as I strongly suggest it is, in the interests of our national security and the stability of the global order on which we depend for us to line up with nations that are seen as global leaders on human rights, sustainability and poverty alleviation. This includes nations such as New Zealand, Norway and Costa Rica, whose diplomacy would be greatly boosted by the presence of the UK among the ranks of those who understand that co-operation, not competition; peace, not war; aid, not weapons; healthcare, not corruption; and stability, not runaway climate change, are the way forward to a genuinely secure world.<\/p><p pid=\"c1228.0\/8\">However, this Bill points absolutely in the opposite direction. The highly regarded Nation Brands Index already has us ranked relatively low for governance. The Bill would surely be a huge blow in that regard. To quote no less a body than the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the Bill runs the risk of<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1228.0\/9\">&#8220;harming the UK&#8217;s reputation as a global leader on human rights, and weakening our compliance with universal standards&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"c1228.0\/10\">So, we are at a crunch point. There is a real risk that, even if the integrated review comes up with a truly transformative visionary plan for the UK to become a leading force for peace and democracy&#8212;living within the planetary limits&#8212;we have already damaged so badly the world&#8217;s view of us with this Bill, the CHIS Bill and the Trade Bill that such a plan is not possible.<\/p><p pid=\"c1228.0\/11\">Finally, the Minister talked in her introduction about reflecting the governing party&#8217;s commitment to armed forces personnel and veterans. How much more that might reflect reality if it were a move to provide better wages and conditions&#8212;particularly better housing and mental health services&#8212;and to ensure that they are not put into deadly situations without better planning and equipment, as the noble Baroness, Lady Chakrabarti, noted, rather than to take away their rights, as the noble Lords, Lord Touhig and Lord Hendy, pointed out.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b855.1\/1\">I am going to try to summarise all the points that have been made.<\/p><p pid=\"b855.1\/2\">The amendment in front of us says:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b855.1\/3\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;International bilateral trade agreements are revoked&#8221;&#8212;<\/p><p pid=\"b855.1\/4\">it is not a suggestion&#8212;<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b855.1\/5\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;if the High Court of England and Wales makes a preliminary determination that they should be revoked&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b855.1\/6\">That is an absolutist position as expressed in the Alton amendment. More to the point, there is not a bilateral free trade agreement with China to revoke. I will come back to that point shortly.<\/p><p pid=\"b855.1\/7\">My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Richard Graham\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24921\">the Member for Gloucester (Richard Graham)<\/phrase>, who has been to Xinjiang and spoke strongly against what is happening there, made the point that the amendment, which may have China in mind, could well be used for countries with whom we do have trade agreements. I agree on finding a balance,  but the Bill, as he rightly points out, is all about continuity trade agreements and agreement on Government procurement and so on.<\/p><p pid=\"b855.1\/8\">My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jonathan Djanogly\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10854\">the Member for Huntingdon (Mr Djanogly)<\/phrase> quoted the amendment of the LibDem peer Lord Purvis. I say to him that parliamentarians can have their say through the CRaG process on any future trade deal, if Parliament has concerns. That is a key part of our scrutiny arrangements that are set up.<\/p><p pid=\"b855.1\/9\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Paul Girvan\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25629\">The hon. Member for South Antrim (Paul Girvan)<\/phrase> questioned whether Northern Ireland would benefit. It is absolutely clear that Northern Ireland will benefit from UK trade deals. The UK says that. The EU says that. The 63 continuity trade deals all apply to Northern Ireland and the withdrawal agreement and protocol are clear that Northern Ireland will benefit from UK FTAs.<\/p><p pid=\"b855.1\/10\">My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Damian Collins\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24744\">the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins)<\/phrase> spoke on platform liability. He asked us to agree that what happened with the US in relation to the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, which the right hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury quoted earlier, will not take effect in the UK. We have been absolutely clear that those provisions will not take effect in the UK. He also called for a formal role for the Information Commissioner. I met her recently and I am considering what she has to say on the matter.<\/p><p pid=\"b855.1\/11\">My right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Edward Leigh\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10352\">the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh)<\/phrase> made a powerful point about the importance of the issue, but the flaw is in the amendment in front of us today. It is not for the courts to revoke trade treaties. That is a denial of the fundamental supremacy of Parliament. He is absolutely right on that, while being passionate about what is going on in China and other parts of the world. He asked for more parliamentary debate. Determining the parliamentary timetable is not always entirely in any Government Department&#8217;s hands, but we at the Department for International Trade always welcome more debate on trade deals, wherever parliamentary time allows. It is great to have Members passionately interested in trade deals.<\/p><p pid=\"b855.1\/12\">My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Gary Sambrook\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25887\">the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Gary Sambrook)<\/phrase> made a powerful speech on the 63 deals done. My right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jeremy Wright\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11791\">the Member for Kenilworth and Southam (Jeremy Wright)<\/phrase>, a former Attorney General, raised some really strong points about the legal language of the genocide amendment. What does a preliminary hearing mean? Who is the respondent? Would it be the foreign Government, or would the UK Government have to respond for that foreign Government, which in almost all conceivable cases would be a Government that the UK Government would have been very critical of? He raised serious points that get to the heart of the amendment and how it is not appropriate in our constitutional settlement for the High Court to be doing such as thing as trying to revoke an international treaty. On online harms, I am very happy to engage with him further.<\/p><p pid=\"b855.1\/13\">There were excellent speeches from my hon. Friends the Members for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, for Hertford and Stortford (Julie Marson), for Dudley North (Marco Longhi) and for Milton Keynes North (Ben Everitt) on the importance of our trade agenda.<\/p><p pid=\"b855.1\/14\">My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Tom Randall\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25837\">the Member for Gedling (Tom Randall)<\/phrase> is quite right. He is passionate&#8212;he is the vice-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on Hong Kong&#8212;but  he also said that lawmaking is about workable rules and doubted whether a court should have the right to automatically revoke an international treaty.<\/p><p pid=\"b855.1\/15\">May I also say a few words about some of the Opposition contributions? I do not have time to reply to all of them, but it is good courtesy to try to reply to as many as possible. I think <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Stephen Kinnock\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25297\">the hon. Member for Aberavon (Stephen Kinnock)<\/phrase> was making an argument about whether courts should pronounce on genocide, and that is a relevant topic for debate. However, what we have in front of us is not the question of whether courts should pronounce on genocide; the question is whether the courts should have the right to automatically revoke an international trade agreement. That is the amendment that is in front of us, and that is the amendment that I urge my colleagues to reject. It is not for a court to revoke international treaties.<\/p><p pid=\"b855.1\/16\">The NHS was raised by Opposition Members including the hon. Members for Vauxhall (Florence Eshalomi), for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy) and for Wirral West (Margaret Greenwood). The Government have been consistently clear about their commitment to the guiding principles of the NHS: that it is universal and free at the point of need. The Government&#8217;s position is definitive: the NHS is not and never will be for sale. The NHS is of course the most beloved of British institutions and is not in anyone&#8217;s interests, including this Government&#8217;s, to change that. No UK trade deal will change that either.<\/p><p pid=\"b855.1\/17\">Let me just say a few final words about Lords amendment 3 on genocide from Lord Alton. I know Lord Alton well. I have worked with him closely on a lot of these issues. He and I were instrumental in the all-party parliamentary group for North Korea, and I know his absolute passion on these issues. I also know from my own involvement in these questions in relation to central Asia, including here in Parliament in 2006, and in articles that I wrote in 2011, how passionate he is about these issues. Being passionate about an issue is why we are in this place, but it is also incumbent on us to make good law, and that is fundamentally the question in front of us tonight with the Alton amendment.<\/p><p pid=\"b855.1\/18\">I want to make three other points quickly. The first is that there is no bilateral free trade agreement with China to revoke, so even if the High Court decided to do so, that would not bring any comfort to the Uyghurs. Secondly, as I have mentioned, is it a matter for the courts automatically to revoke international treaties negotiated by this Government and approved by Parliament? I do not think that can be right. Thirdly, we do not have a bilateral free trade agreement with China, but we do have such agreements with dozens of other countries. I am not at all sure that it is the right role for the High Court to be potentially clogged up with questions of other countries, international relations and international treaties. I ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to consider carefully whether that is the route they wish to go down.<\/p><p pid=\"b855.1\/19\">The amendments introduced into the Bill by the other place were undoubtedly done with good intentions, and I hope that I have spoken to all the points arising in this debate and to the speakers and the amendments. But it is our strongly held position that these amendments would, in the aggregate, be to the detriment of the Bill rather than to its advantage. I hope that what I have said here provides the House with clarity regarding the Government&#8217;s position on the amendments we are discussing today, and that it will vote to reject them.<\/p><p pid=\"b855.1\/20\">Question put, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 1.<\/p>",

I say this very clearly: the situation in Xinjiang and the action we have taken is demonstrable of not just our concern but, as the Foreign Secretary has said in the other place, the dire situation faced by the Uighur Muslims and, let us also not forget, other minorities within Xinjiang. We have acted. Of course, I take note of the issue around sanctions, but the actions we have taken&#8212;in Hong Kong, in engaging and showing international support, on the issues and limitations on extradition treaties with Hong Kong, arms exports and the recent provisions we have announced on forced labour&#8212;show that the Government are not sitting back.

            "body": "<p pid=\"a186.1\/1\">Thank you very much, Mr Davies. I congratulate <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Sarah Owen\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25823\">the hon. Member for Luton North (Sarah Owen)<\/phrase> on securing this important debate, and I agree with absolutely every word that she said in respect of this issue.<\/p><p pid=\"a186.1\/2\">The voices of individual MPs in different parts of the country are so important. I have a large Kashmiri diaspora in my constituency. Throughout the general election campaign, the most important issue for that section of my population&#8212;they are the friendliest, most entrepreneurial and most positive, decent people whom I have had the pleasure to meet&#8212;was the issue of Kashmir. It came back to the issue of human rights, which is what I want to talk about today.<\/p><p pid=\"a186.1\/3\">It will not surprise you, Mr Davies, that the first speech I wrote was far too long and wordy. It was a history lesson that we do not need to hear today. What we need to concentrate on is that this is a human rights issue. I am lucky enough to be an officer of the all-party parliamentary Kashmir group. It seems a long time ago, but we went to Kashmir in February and March of last year. I went with my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Sara Britcliffe\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25876\">the Member for Hyndburn (Sara Britcliffe)<\/phrase> and Labour Members. The reason we went&#8212;I hesitate to speak on behalf of my hon. Friend&#8212;is that it is not enough to say to our constituents, &#8220;Yes, I can read about this in a book.&#8221; After speaking to my constituents during the general election, I wanted to go to the frontline to ask people who are affected by the crisis and the ongoing human rights disaster what was going on. As one example, we went to a refugee camp in Kotli and met people who had suffered the most grievous injuries. We are talking about hundreds of people, not people who were in a queue provided by some political organisation. They told us that these appalling acts are happening.<\/p><p pid=\"a186.1\/4\">The hon. Member for Luton North was absolutely right to say that the lockdown in Kashmir is not like our lockdown. It is a lockdown that attacks the fundamental rights that we all take for granted in this country. The Government have quite rightly expressed in the last few days their views on China&#8217;s treatment of the Muslim population in that country. We must take a similar stance in respect of Kashmir and put the obvious human rights abuses at the top of our agenda. Thousands of our fellow citizens are from a Kashmiri background and have family members there who are affected on a daily basis by the acts that take place.<\/p><p pid=\"a186.1\/5\">As a lawyer, I have a long list of human rights abuses&#8212;things such as detention without trial. There are people in Kashmir who have been waiting 15 years for a trial&#8212;15 years! There is not a word from the international community in respect of that. Torture is commonplace, and young people are disappearing, yet we do not see that on television screens in the western world&#8212;we do not see it on the BBC. Quite rightly, we recently saw coverage of the issues in Hong Kong and other places. Kashmiris are people who we represent&#8212;they are our friends, and this issue affects their daily lives. We must take a stand.<\/p><p pid=\"a186.1\/6\">All I ask from the excellent Minister&#8212;I know how committed he and the Government are to standing up to human rights abusers throughout the world&#8212;is that whatever our relationship with other countries, and whatever the political dimension to this, we cannot be deflected from the task of working with our international partners to come up with an appropriate way to protect the interests of children. I have heard appalling stories of rape and sexual violence against women&#8212;it is absolutely appalling. As an international community working with our European partners with President-elect Biden in America, we have the opportunity now to come up with an international programme through the United Nations that will give succour and hope to those poor people in Kashmir who for 70-plus years have been going through the most awful, appalling hell.<\/p><p pid=\"a186.1\/7\">There is always a temptation, in all debates, to blame this or that person. I would like to finish by saying we can draw a line in the sand and join together on a cross- party basis. We can be united by a determination to help, with regard to anti-Muslim persecution in Kashmir. We can be united in our desire to protect human rights  everywhere but certainly in that region. The geopolitical issues there are perhaps the most severe in the world, with two nuclear powers. Therefore I welcome this debate. I know that the Government are committed to human rights, and that the Minister is. I thank all colleagues for their contributions. Let us all stand and do this together again and again.<\/p>",

In the UK-EU trade agreement, that is what we have achieved. We have continuing trade with our European friends and allies, and the ability, as we heard from the Secretary of State for International Trade in her opening remarks, to forge global trade deals with countries as far afield as Canada, Japan, Singapore, Turkey, Mexico and elsewhere. I know that in the coming months and years, more trade deals will be achieved.<\/p><p pid=\"c100.0\/3\">Global Britain is not just about trade; it is about using our other strengths, which we have had historically as an island nation that is outward looking&#8212;whether they be in defence, intelligence, our soft and cultural power or our international aid commitments.

The essence of democracy is that, as we all know, it allows for change; it allows the pendulum to swing in accordance with the people&#8217;s will as expressed through the ballot box&#8212;a fact that, in the case of our own referendum, some in the EU found almost impossible to accept.<\/p><p pid=\"a382.0\/3\">When I think of the Muslim Uighurs butchered by the racist, criminal regime of Xi Jinping, or the brave democrats of Hong Kong, whose universal human  rights are being brutally quashed by his puppet, Carrie Lam, I hope our approach to trade and co-operation will be about more than just money. In conclusion, ballot boxes, respect for universal human rights and a commitment to intersectional equality should also figure large among our exports, as the best guarantee of global stability and prosperity.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1901.0\/1\">My Lords, I respect those who have devoted their lives to integrating Britain into the European project. Their evident sadness today is the one downside to the joy I feel but, as good parliamentarians, I hope that they&#8212;like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Judge, and the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, at the beginning of this debate&#8212;will see some upside in the restoration of parliamentary sovereignty.<\/p><p pid=\"b1901.0\/2\">I served on the committee scrutinising the transfer of European law into British law. There were tens of thousands of pages of regulations, accumulated over four decades, few of which have ever been debated, and none voted on. Indeed, had every parliamentarian voted against them, they would still have become the law of the land. Tomorrow, that changes. We will be free to amend, repeal or enhance any of these measures, but it is a mistake to believe that the only choice is between high standards and lower ones. There are many ways in which rules and regulations can be improved without affecting the level of environmental, social or other protection, none of which anyone wishes to reduce, despite what the noble Baroness just implied.<\/p><p pid=\"b1901.0\/3\">When negotiating in the Council of Ministers, I&#8212;and, I gather, my Labour successors&#8212;brought a different regulatory philosophy to that of our European friends. We focus on outcomes; they focus on process. We set principles; they try to legislate for every conceivable eventuality. We allow everything that is not forbidden; they tend to forbid anything that is not specifically allowed. Our priority is to protect consumers; theirs is protecting producers. The result is that our approach encourages innovation, stimulates competition, facilitates new entrants to a market and minimises the burden of compliance without reducing standards. As a result, it creates a more dynamic and enterprising marketplace while maintaining high standards.<\/p><p pid=\"b1901.0\/4\">The clearest example of this different approach is the complete trust between British common law and continental Roman law. It is no coincidence that the world&#8217;s four leading financial centres&#8212;London, New York, Hong Kong and Singapore&#8212;are all based on common law, whereas the EU&#8217;s biggest financial centre, Frankfurt, ranks only 15th in the world. However, in the EU, detailed prescriptive laws such as MiFID, with its 2 million paragraphs, have steadily overwritten common law. That is why the Bank of England said that the overriding priority for the UK was to become a rule maker, not a rule taker.<\/p><p pid=\"b1901.0\/5\">We can make a success of Brexit if we bring that same spirit of rule-making, not just in financial services or common law but to the whole acquis communautaire, to make Britain&#8217;s economy more innovative, competitive, dynamic and prosperous. Your Lordships&#8217; House will play a key part in this.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b468.0\/1\">Before I start, can I wholeheartedly endorse the expression of appreciation for <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jim Shannon\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/13864\">the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)<\/phrase>? It has been my great pleasure to work with him on a number of issues, especially freedom of religion or belief. He is an inspiring leader on that issue, in particular in his role as chair of the all-party parliamentary group.<\/p><p pid=\"b468.0\/2\">As my term of office serving as chair of the Conservative party human rights commission comes to an end shortly, I would like to pay tribute to all who over the past few years have contributed to our inquiries and reports, in particular the brave people who have given evidence to us, many at personal risk, and who either themselves or through their families have suffered greatly, often at the hands of their own Governments. I want to put on record my thanks and respect to them. Many are named in our reports. Without them, we as commissioners could not have highlighted the human rights concerns in those reports.<\/p><p pid=\"b468.0\/3\">The commission&#8217;s reports include a 2016 report on human rights in China, 2013 to 2016, entitled &#8220;The Darkest Moment&#8221;&#8212;sadly, now a misnomer. That was  followed later that year by a report on forced organ harvesting in China. Under a year later, there was a report on human rights in Russia today. In 2019, there was a report on China&#8217;s Confucius Institutes, as well as a report entitled &#8220;The Limits of Consent on Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery and their Impact on Prostitution in the UK&#8221;. This year, we have held nine sessions to inform a further report, which we will shortly publish on human rights in China 2016 to 2020, entitled, sadly, &#8220;The Darkness Deepens&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b468.0\/4\">Promoting and protecting freedom and human dignity should be at the heart of foreign policy. The Conservative party human rights commission was set up by my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Liam Fox\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10213\">the Member for North Somerset (Dr Fox)<\/phrase> to highlight international human rights concerns; inform, advise and enhance the party&#8217;s foreign policy; and ensure that fundamental human rights are kept high on the political agenda. A number of Members of Parliament have been the chair of the Conservative party human rights commission since its creation, but the deputy chair has throughout this 15-year period been the same person, Benedict Rogers, to whom I pay particular tribute. I want to put on record my profound thanks and respect to him. He has not only carried the bulk of the commission&#8217;s work throughout this entire period, organising witness sessions and producing the first draft of most of our reports, but he has also travelled to dozens&#8212;probably hundreds, I have lost count&#8212;of places across the world, often at great personal danger. He has been refused entry to one place and arrested and detained in others, meeting directly with those subject to human rights abuses to ensure that our reports are as reliable and authentic as they can be. I know that my respect for Ben is shared by very many parliamentarians in both Houses, and it has been a true privilege to work closely with him in this role.<\/p><p pid=\"b468.0\/5\">Four years ago, the Conservative party human rights commission was a canary in the coalmine in Westminster, calling attention to China&#8217;s human rights crisis almost as a lone voice&#8212;in fact, an urgent question I raised  in 2015 prompted a furore from some parts of Government&#8212;although, of course, many other courageous voices, such as Bob Fu of ChinaAid, have been raising such concerns for years well beyond Westminster. Today, it is heartening that the Conservative party human rights commissioners are but one of many such voices here in the UK Parliament, as yesterday&#8217;s urgent question on the Uyghurs demonstrated&#8212;including voices from within the current Government. We welcome that.<\/p><p pid=\"b468.0\/6\">As mentioned, we will shortly be launching a further report expressing concerns on the deepening deterioration of human rights in China, which we hope will serve to continue to highlight these issues and inform further debate&#8212;a debate it is critical we have if we are to better understand how, as parliamentarians, we can help to shape a new international order in which the value  of human rights and human dignity, the rule of law, democracy, international treaty promises, and freedom of expression, association and religion or belief are better promoted and defended. It is heartening to  me how, over my 10 years in this House, expressions  of concern by parliamentary colleagues on these  issues have noticeably increased, and with impact and effect, not least as we have seen recently with regard to Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"b468.0\/7\">Sadly, any such impact cannot yet be said to have happened with regard to the deteriorating human rights situation in China. Among the most dramatic evidence of the decline in human rights there since our commission&#8217;s last inquiry in 2016 are the violations of the right to freedom of religion or belief. These have become even more egregious, widespread and systematic, according to evidence received by the Conservative party human rights commission this year. As we now know, some of the most egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief affect the Uyghurs, and they encompass an almost total denial of every basic human right. They include their own Government&#8217;s attacks on the Uighur identity, culture and religion, the breaking up of families, the destruction of thousands of mosques and the recent heart-rending sight of people being loaded on to trains to be transported to prison camps with purpose-built factories alongside them. This was all too reminiscent of the holocaust.<\/p><p pid=\"b468.0\/8\">However, it is by no means only the Uyghurs who are being persecuted. For every major religious community in China today&#8212;Christians, both Protestant and Catholic, Muslims, Buddhists, practitioners of Falun Gong and others&#8212;the situation has become more restricted. Believers across the faiths have been arrested, imprisoned, tortured and even killed in connection with their religion or belief. There are other Muslim groups as well as the Uyghurs in Xinjiang that are affected, as well as the Buddhists in Tibet. Violations against Christians have intensified with the imprisonment of pastors and the desecration or destruction of hundreds of  churches.<\/p><p pid=\"b468.0\/9\">Accounts to the independent China tribunal, chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice, QC, which delivered its final judgment in March this year on the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, were truly heart-searing. We are told that persecution by way of forced organ removal is taking place on an industrial scale. It is almost too horrible for the human mind to comprehend. Human beings are being cut open while still alive, without anaesthetic, for their kidneys, livers, hearts, lungs, corneas and skin to be removed and turned into commodities for sale.<\/p><p pid=\"b468.0\/10\">We, as commissioners on the Conservative party human rights commission, have found that human rights concerns do not always come neatly packaged and presented. Engaging can be messy, awkward and risky, and speaking truth to power is not comfortable, often as much for the hearer as for the speaker. So, why raise these concerns? It is because, whether we agree with their beliefs or not, these are fellow human beings who are being affected. It is because we should respect the worth of every human being, and because every created individual has value. It is because once we have heard of these things, we should not stay silent. As the holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b468.0\/11\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Whoever listens to a witness, becomes a witness&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b468.0\/12\">We speak simply because we should, and because, however distant the sufferings of those who hurt might be, we share in their common humanity. In this House we have been granted the profound privilege of having voices that can resonate across the world, and we must use them to speak out on behalf of the most vulnerable, afflicted and oppressed.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1682.1\/1\">My Lords, I was going to say that it was a great pleasure to follow the noble Baroness, Lady Wheatcroft; as former newspaper editors we could both have reflected on how there was once a silly season where we were not dealing with such serious issues this close to Christmas&#8212;but I have said it anyway. I also welcome the noble Lord, Lord Sharpe of Epsom, to this House. I declare my position as co-chair of the All-Party Group on Hong Kong. There may be many things on which we do not agree, but I hope that we can agree on ensuring the rights of those Hong Kongers who wish to come to the UK, and on standing up for Britain&#8217;s position as a signatory to the joint declaration on Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"a1682.1\/2\">I wish to start my reflection on the Bill with a couple of numbers. There are 112 pages, 29 pages of Explanatory Notes, and, depending on how you count it, four or five working days until Christmas. I feel I am repeating myself but it must be said, reflecting the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, who is not currently in her place: after a horrendous year, small-business people might have been thinking of winding down and finally getting a bit of a break, but they will have to plough through all that paperwork and seek expert advice at this point in the year. I usually try not to repeat what others have said in your Lordships&#8217; House, but I must join many others in celebrating the Government&#8217;s U-turn on the &#8220;notwithstanding&#8221; provisions of this Bill. That a UK  Government could be planning to break an agreement that they signed only 12 months ago will long resonate on the world stage. Every time we hear from the Government Benches, as we do so often about amendments to Bills, &#8220;This does not have to be on the face of the Bill&#8221; and &#8220;You can trust us, we&#8217;ve said this is our policy&#8221;, we can reflect on where we are today.<\/p><p pid=\"a1682.1\/3\">We must also reflect on the Brexit ultras having to face up to reality. The &#8220;easiest negotiations in history&#8221; is a phrase that we must remember being said. Drawing a couple of parallels, I reflect on Erasmus Wilson, the Oxford professor who said in 1878:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1682.1\/4\">&#8220;When the Paris exhibition closes, electric light will close with it and no more will be heard of it&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"a1682.1\/5\">and the president of the Michigan savings bank saying to Henry Ford:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1682.1\/6\">&#8220;The horse is here to stay but the automobile is only a novelty, a fad&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a1682.1\/7\">We are in that territory, for this legislation lays bare the emptiness of &#8220;taking back control&#8221;. Your Lordships&#8217; House is passing this Bill in one day, while the other place passes the new Trade (Disclosure of Information) Bill which, as of last night, no one had even had the opportunity to read. We will do our best to scrutinise so many things, but as we have been seeing, particularly in the Grand Committee, statutory instruments are being looked at that modify previously passed Brexit statutory instruments. I fear we will see the same cycle again early in the New Year.<\/p><p pid=\"a1682.1\/8\">I join the noble Baroness, Lady Altmann, in welcoming the modest measures in this Bill against tax dodging. I hope that this is the sign of much more to come from the Government Benches. It tackles a very small part of the issue; there are very large factors to be tackled here. I am happy to see the increase in aviation and gasoline tax, but it is nowhere near enough, particularly after the disastrous ruling in the Supreme Court today on Heathrow expansion. Flying is the most carbon-intensive form of travel, but it is undertaxed and inadequately dealt with in the Paris agreement.<\/p><p pid=\"a1682.1\/9\">In reflecting on that, I also note that today sees the tragic but terribly important coroner&#8217;s conclusion that air pollution was a cause of Ella Kissi-Debrah&#8217;s death at the age of nine. It is the first time that such a finding has been made in the UK. I ask the House to take a moment to pay tribute to her mother, Rosamund, for her long fight to get this medical reality recognised.<\/p><p pid=\"a1682.1\/10\">I shall finish with a question for the Minister. I do not know whether, at this late hour, he can ride to the rescue of Boris Johnson in offering an explanation of how the people of the UK will benefit from Brexit: those people who, right now, are making a weary trudge to the food bank to get food for Christmas; the self-employed who have been left for so many months without any money at all through the gaping holes in the Government&#8217;s Covid rescue packages; and the weary teachers struggling to provide education and security for their pupils amid the chaos. How will they gain from Brexit, whether it is no deal or the scantily patched-together thin deal that is now our best hope? We know that the surfers of disaster capitalism, the hedge fund traders and the purveyors of fancy financial instruments will benefit from the chaos&#8212;they always do. A few people will profit and the rest of us will pay.<\/p>",

It is about the abuses of the dictatorial Chinese Communist Government and its ruling elite. On Monday, Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China adviser Adrian Zenz published research taken from internal Chinese Government files, which showed that in 2018 the prefectures of Aksu and Hotan sent 210,000 workers via coercive labour transfer to forcibly pick cotton for a Chinese paramilitary organisation, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. That is, in effect, slave labour. Furthermore, Mr Zenz and IPAC have also shown that the Chinese Government forced Uyghur women into sterilisation. As a result, the Uyghur population in those regions fell by as much as 84% between 2015 and 2018. That is action verging, I believe, on genocide.<\/p><p pid=\"b292.0\/2\">Meanwhile, the peaceful proponents of democracy in Hong Kong are locked up and forced to flee their homes; Christians and Falun Gong have suffered organ harvesting, while half a million Tibetans have been forced into labour camps. The Chinese Communist party is oppressive at home and bullying abroad&#8212;just look at the its actions in bullying Australia for calling for an independent inquiry into the origins of covid, and the revelations over the weekend that supposedly secure institutions such as even the Foreign Office have been penetrated not only by CCP members, but by members of the fanatical United Front. The security issues are paramount.<\/p><p pid=\"b292.0\/3\">I ask my hon. Friend when he will announce that those responsible for all these evils will be sanctioned under the Magnitsky regimes. We have been going on and on about that, without answer. Will he commit to reviewing all our dependency on China and to putting that on a secure basis? May I ask what he is doing now about the penetration by those United Front entryists into the embassy and other secure institutions in the United Kingdom? Will his Department support the forthcoming genocide amendment that is now in the other place?<\/p><p pid=\"b292.0\/4\">I simply say to my hon. Friend that we must condemn&#8212;not just criticise, but condemn&#8212;the actions being taken by this abusive Government. We have learned in the past that appeasement does not work. That is why we must take this head-on, right now, before it becomes too big to manage.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1599.0\/1\">My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, and my noble friend Lord Stevenson, for moving and speaking to Amendments 15 and 19, respectively. They significantly improve, but do not eliminate, ISDS. On that basis, I support them, since my assessment is that the elimination of ISDS is not currently politically feasible.<\/p><p pid=\"a1599.0\/2\">We now know a lot about ISDS, which is relatively common in international trade agreements. We know how objectionable it is and the chilling effect it can have. It is objectionable because it overrides the supremacy of Parliament, defeats the rule of domestic law&#8212;a concept familiar to all of us after recent debates&#8212;and discriminates on grounds of nationality. Far from taking back control and asserting British sovereignty, the current catchwords of government, ISDS surrenders both.<\/p><p pid=\"a1599.0\/3\">A couple of years ago, a petition against the inclusion of ISDS in the then-proposed EU-US trade deal, TTIP, attracted 3 million signatures&#8212;500,000 of them in the UK. The legitimacy of ISDS in EU agreements is now doubted by the Court of Justice of the European  Union as well as by EU citizens. In Slovak Republic v Achmea, the court held that ISDS in the Netherlands-Slovakia trade agreement<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1599.0\/4\">&#8220;has an adverse effect on the autonomy of EU law&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1599.0\/5\">and is therefore incompatible with it. By like reasoning, ISDS in UK trade deals will adversely impact the autonomy of UK law.<\/p><p pid=\"a1599.0\/6\">ISDS is a mechanism whereby a corporation of one state party to the international trade agreement can bring a claim for compensation against the other state. It sounds fair, but it is not fair. ISDS claims bypass the courts of both state parties, and bypass the laws of both states. ISDS is a special privilege accorded only to foreign corporations, for use, in the case of the UK, against a democratic sovereign Government. ISDS is a right to claim compensation against the host state in which the corporation has made its investment&#8212;a right denied to the corporations and citizens of that state. That point is important and goes beyond the insult to sovereignty.<\/p><p pid=\"a1599.0\/7\">ISDS offends against the rule of law because a right and remedy against a host state is given to one class of putative claimant&#8212;foreign investment corporations&#8212;and denied to all the citizens, companies, co-operatives, trade unions and other organisations in the host state. ISDS offends against the rule of law, whereby that right and remedy is exempt from the courts and the legal system of the host country. It offends the principle of non-discrimination because that right and remedy is only available to non-nationals of the host state.<\/p><p pid=\"a1599.0\/8\">An ISDS claim is never that the host state has breached the law of the land. Indeed, it is invariably the converse: that a provision of domestic law has caused the foreign corporation loss of hoped-for profits. I refer again to the Philip Morris case as an exemplar, much cited in Committee. The Australian parliament passed legislation requiring plain-paper packaging for cigarettes. It was a democratic decision of a sovereign parliament. Philip Morris challenged the legislation in the Australian courts. It failed at every level, up to and including the High Court of Australia. Philip Morris then transferred ownership of its Australian companies to a subsidiary that it had set up in Hong Kong to enable an ISDS claim under the Australia-Hong Kong trade agreement. That claim ultimately failed but only because the transfer of ownership of the companies to Hong Kong post-dated the legislation giving rise to the claim.<\/p><p pid=\"a1599.0\/9\">Successful or not, ISDS claims can override the sovereignty of a parliament and domestic law by the chilling effect of the size of the compensation sought and often awarded. These amounts can be so large that even wealthy states shudder. The UN Conference on Trade and Development monitors international trade agreements and ISDS claims and awards. Although most ISDS proceedings are secret, of 1,023 known claims, UNCTAD has provided detail on 710. Your Lordships should know that no less than 104 of them&#8212;nearly 15%&#8212;were claims in excess of US $1 billion. In Committee, I gave an array of examples of multi-billion dollar claims and multi-billion dollar awards. I will not weary your Lordships by repeating them; they are set out in Hansard for <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-10-06\">6 October<\/phrase>. I am grateful for the  generous comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Bennett, and the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, for their endorsement of some of the points I made then.<\/p><p pid=\"a1599.0\/10\">It is sometimes asserted that ISDS is necessary to allow the corporations of developed states to avoid having to litigate in the corrupt or ill-administered courts of developing countries. However, UNCTAD&#8217;s analysis undermines that justification. As the noble Lord, Lord Lansley, indicated, corporations have brought multiple claims against the USA, Canada, Australia, Germany and other states with well-developed legal systems, which have been bypassed in favour of using the special privilege of ISDS. The UK, under the wing of the EU, has so far been sheltered, but in future it will not be immune. For example, the UK seeks a trade deal with the USA. US corporations, as the noble Lord pointed out, have been frequent users of ISDS. We know that corporations have been establishing subsidiaries in other countries to facilitate possible claims against the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a1599.0\/11\">The nature of ISDS claims is well established. The usual basis is that the accused state has failed to ensure fair and equitable treatment or has expropriated some asset of the investing corporation. Reported cases, such as that involving Phillip Morris, show how ISDS claims threaten Governments that exercise their democratic mandate to do such things as phase out nuclear power, renationalise a metro, exclude mining from national parks, limit pharmaceutical charges and so on. A future UK Government seeking to renationalise domestic power, water or railways, or, for example, to bring the disastrous and exorbitant track and trace regime into NHS ownership, could be at risk of ISDS. Such policies are controversial, but those who oppose them should defeat them at the ballot box&#8212;as, indeed, they have done so far&#8212;rather than by legitimating the offensive machinery of ISDS.<\/p><p pid=\"a1599.0\/12\">Nor should we support ISDS for use by UK corporations against other states. The ISDS challenge to our state cannot be justified by permitting similar challenges to other states. In any event, when UK corporations make investments overseas, they evaluate the risk that things could go wrong or that the state might change the law. That is a matter for them. Why should we risk our democratic decision-making to give UK commercial investors overseas a special legal privilege?<\/p><p pid=\"a1599.0\/13\">Finally, I note the benefits of the proposal for a multinational investment court in place of secret arbitration under ISDS. Transparency instead of secrecy and a fixed body of professional judges in place of ad hoc arbitrators, drawn often from those who conduct ISDS cases, are improvements. However, the central evil of ISDS is not resolved. ISDS before a panel of judges still remains an assault on the rule of law, parliamentary sovereignty and the principle of non-discrimination.<\/p>",

That is why we are seeking to include and to set out points that the Secretary of State may take into account. The hon. Member should recognise that the Government&#8217;s statement of intent is designed to give guidance as to how the Bill will work and be used in practice, and what might be taken into account. The guidance is there. It is just that it is very limited.<\/p><p>We are deliberately not seeking a prescriptive definition of national security. We recognise, as Sir Richard Dearlove did, that it can and must evolve over time. We are seeking to give greater guidance and to promote a better understanding of the remit of the Bill, so that it can be better interpreted and better implemented and so that all those who come under its remit can share that understanding. That is what other nations do. The new clause takes our security context seriously, and signals to hostile actors that we will act with seriousness, not superficiality.<\/p><p>Paragraph (f) bridges the gap between the Government&#8217;s defined sectors and focus and the critical national infrastructure that we already define and focus on in our wider intelligence and security work. It brings us in line with allies. Canadian guidelines list the security of Canada&#8217;s national infrastructure as an explicit factor in national security assessments. In Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States cases, Congress lists critical infrastructure among the six factors that the President and CFIUS may access.<\/p><p>The provision also acts on the agreement of the ex MI6 chief. In relation to having a critical national infrastructure definition in the Bill, he said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\">&#8220;I would certainly see that as advantageous, because it defines a clear area where you start and from which you can make judgments&#8221;.&#8211;&#8211;[Official Report, National Security and Investment Public Bill Committee, Tuesday <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-11-24\">24 November<\/phrase> 2020; c. 24, Q31.]<\/p><p>Some of the interventions have been about whether the new clause hits the right spot between prescribing and defining what national security is and giving greater clarity and focus. We would argue that the evidence that I have just set out shows that it does.<\/p><p>Paragraphs (g), (h) and (i) recognise that national security is about more than a narrow view of military security; it is about human security, clamping down on persistent abuses of law&#8212;as other countries do&#8212;and recognising that a party that consistently abuses human rights abroad cannot be trusted to do otherwise at home.  It is about knowing that the single greatest collective threat we face, at home and across the world, lies in climate risk. It is about acting on illicit activities and money-laundering threats that underpin direct threats to national security in the form of global terror.<\/p><p>I recognise that many Government Members have recently raised the importance of human rights, illicit activities, money laundering and climate change in our security. In the statement on Hong Kong this week, the Minister for Asia acknowledged that human rights should be part of our considerations when it comes to trade and security but said that he did not feel that the Trade Bill was the right place for such provisions. I argue that today&#8217;s Bill is the right place for them because it deals with our national security.<\/p><p>The new clause would show the world that the UK is serious about national security. We must protect our national security against threats at home and abroad, and build our sovereign capability in industries that are the most strategically significant for security. We must view security in the light of modern technologies, climate and geopolitical threats. None of those constrain the Government&#8217;s ability to act; they simply sharpen the clarity of that action, and its signal to the world.<\/p><p>When we began line-by-line scrutiny, I spoke of my astonishment that the Government&#8217;s impact assessment referred to national security as an area of market failure that therefore required Government action. I hope that the Minister can confirm that he does not believe that national security is an area of market failure, but that it is the first responsibility of Government. The new clause sets out to give bones to that assertion and to demonstrate to the world that we understand our national security and the interests at play in promoting and securing it, and that we will act decisively in the interest of national security, taking into account this range of factors to protect our citizens, our national interest and our economic sovereignty, now and in the future.<\/p>",

In those countries, where they are worn habitually &#8212; South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and so on &#8212; the rate of transmission of the virus and, indeed, deaths as a result of COVID-19, is much lower than here.<\/p><p>There are other reasons for that: their contact-tracing operation, controls at ports and airports, and enforcement of isolation, for example. I am not suggesting that face masks, on their own, are responsible for lower transmission rates; however they are a significant factor. Over recent months, the evidence in support of wearing masks has increased. I have heard a few Members saying that you have to bear in mind that some people cannot wear masks for medical or psychological reasons. I heard a reputable doctor on TV recently say that there really is no reason why anyone should refuse to wear a mask. There may be a small number of exceptions, but, by and large, everyone should be wearing masks or face coverings, particularly indoors and when they are coming into contact with other people.<\/p><p>My criticism about the fact that we did not introduce face masks earlier is, again, because the countries that have been most successful in dealing with the virus are the ones that acted with speed. They did not wait for the science to be absolutely 100% sure. If there was any suggestion at all that a measure was going to work, they moved quickly. When the virus first arrived in South Korea, the Government there called in all the pharma companies and told them to develop a test. The pharma companies came back and said that they could only develop a test that was 90% accurate. The Government told them to go ahead. Better 90% accurate than not carrying out any tests.<\/p><p>It is the same with these other issues such as face masks. Speed is of the essence. We need to move quickly; we cannot sit and discuss. It is similar with these regulations. We cannot introduce them here in the Assembly and thrash them out and debate them until we are blue in the face. We need to move quickly. In those circumstances, sometimes mistakes will be made, but that is what happens.<\/p>",

It is one of the most profound and important amendments to be discussed in your Lordships&#8217; House for a long time. We have an obligation under the genocide convention to prevent and punish genocide and its perpetrators, but if we rely on the Security Council or the International Criminal Court, we are dodging our obligations. We know full well that China&#8217;s seat on the Security Council means that it would veto any such move against itself. What a terrible indictment of the international order today, especially the UN and its constituent bodies. Instead of living up to their original ideals of maintaining international peace and security, better living standards, friendly relations and social progress, action&#8212;or, more likely, inaction&#8212;by the UN has come to represent quite often the very opposite of those ideals: self-seeking and looking for a scapegoat, a cover for some of the most reprehensible Governments in the world.<\/p><p pid=\"b1072.0\/3\">This amendment possesses the advantage of bringing the UK into compliance with its obligations under the genocide convention. Several states have argued, like the UK, that it is for the international and judicial systems to make the determination of genocide. This argument is profoundly flawed, as it neglects the basic fact that it is the state that is the duty bearer under the genocide convention&#8212;hence the states that are parties to the genocide convention must act to ensure that the determination is made by a competent body and that decisive steps follow to fulfil the states&#8217; obligations under the convention to prevent and punish. Moreover, to have the issue of genocide, or not, examined in our courts would be a good thing.<\/p><p pid=\"b1072.0\/4\">It will likely be argued that the amendment may jeopardise relationships with states accused of genocide in the UK. It should be emphasised that positive genocide judgments are exceptionally rare, owing to the extremely high evidentiary standard. A formal legal examination and determination of genocide in  court, to which the trade signatories might make representations, should not be any more diplomatically upsetting than, for example, the UK making complaints at the United Nations against nations such as China for their alleged human rights abuses. The amendment&#8212;if passed, as I hope it will be&#8212;will in time become a matter of diplomatic pride, sending a strong signal about the values of the UK as a leader in global human rights.<\/p><p pid=\"b1072.0\/5\">Owing to the rarity of genocide judgments, very few countries would fall within the purview of these provisions. It is difficult to envisage, therefore, that the Government&#8217;s ability to trade will be significantly affected. Generally speaking, Governments tend to seek to strike trade deals with nations with which they share common values. The UK does not currently have a trade deal with a country credibly accused of genocide, I believe, and one is not in prospect.<\/p><p pid=\"b1072.0\/6\">As it happens, we are unlikely to achieve or even want a trade agreement with China. The experience of Canada shows why. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had been expected to come away with an agreement to formally start trade talks, but he insisted that any talks include gender and labour rights and environmental standards. He also raised human rights and China&#8217;s use of the death penalty. Basically, he was shown the door and was told no&#8212;that there would be no negotiation of a free trade agreement.<\/p><p pid=\"b1072.0\/7\">Likewise Australia, which, along with many other countries, has been a vocal critic of China&#8217;s treatment of the Uighurs in Xinjiang, its suppression of democracy in Hong Kong, and its military activities in the South China Sea. The anti-climax came in April when the Australian Prime Minister took the lead in calling for a thorough investigation into the source of the coronavirus. That incensed China. Since then, the deterioration of the China\/Australia relationship has been swift. China is barring Australian goods and putting punitive tariffs on them.<\/p><p pid=\"b1072.0\/8\">As for the attempted EU-China comprehensive agreement on investment, it is only to be expected that the EU will put finance ahead of human rights, and even the mildest rebuke from the EU about human rights in China elicits a response from China that it should not be meddling in China&#8217;s internal affairs&#8212;that the Chinese people will not accept an instructor on human rights and oppose double standards. It will all likely end in tears.<\/p><p pid=\"b1072.0\/9\">This amendment embodies the only thing that we can do. International courts are ineffective; international arrest depends on the perpetrator coming here. It is insulting to the victims of genocide to imagine that putting up monuments, especially after the catastrophe, will make any difference. Nor will lighting candles or pulling down statues&#8212;all empty gestures.<\/p><p pid=\"b1072.0\/10\">If captains of industry and politicians had adopted the practice outlined in this amendment in the 1930s, history might have been very different. For example, IBM had immoral commerce with the Third Reich, supplying it with tabulating machines and punch cards, so useful in rounding up victims.<\/p><p pid=\"b1072.0\/11\">Can there be any doubt now about the genocidal moves of China? Modern communications ensure that no one can hide from their senses the genocidal policies that it is pursuing against the Uighurs. Foreign companies have wittingly or unwittingly helped China with facial recognition technology and artificial intelligence to  enable social control. Trade with any part of China should be under the microscope, and let us not forget Tibet and the danger that now faces Hong Kong. Governments have the power to influence this. If China&#8217;s trade and investment are cut down, it may not be able to finance its barbaric projects. Not only should this amendment be passed with acclaim, but other Governments should follow suit.<\/p><p pid=\"b1072.0\/12\">We must remember the genocide against the Tutsis in Rwanda. The world failed to react to the events while they were unfolding. What did the Security Council do? It removed its peacekeeping mission and allowed bureaucratic foot-dragging to obfuscate the need for prompt&#8212;indeed, advance&#8212;action. That has weighed heavily on the international community, which now realises that it must do more. Advance action is needed to prevent genocide. Once it is happening it is too late. That is why this amendment is so well crafted and so deserving of support from your Lordships.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1049.0\/1\">My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow the noble Lord. I remember very clearly the debate that he led in Committee. I think it was just the two of us and the Minister in the Chamber, shortly before midnight, when we debated a framework for human rights and trade. That is the point that he was trying to make, and I agree with him very strongly. That is why I commend the noble Lord, Lord Collins, for tabling this amendment to try to persuade the Government that there will be support if they bring forward a trade and human rights policy that we can engage in and work on with them. That is an appeal. I commend the noble Lord for bringing the amendment forward and I am delighted to have added my name  to it.<\/p><p pid=\"b1049.0\/2\">With regard to a list of countries, we are yet to roll over an agreement with Algeria, which Freedom House has classified as &#8220;not free&#8221; or similarly with Cameroon, Egypt or Eswatini, which are also classified &#8220;not free&#8221;. We would not engage in this with Syria&#8212;although if we were rolling over all agreements, that could include an agreement that did exist but is not in place because the country is under sanction. We have arrangements with the Palestinian Authority, which Freedom House indicates is &#8220;not free&#8221;; Zimbabwe again is &#8220;not free&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b1049.0\/3\">We have separate debates over Turkey and Vietnam. When it comes to Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, we know that those two countries have had year-long disputes over the definition of genocide within the international tribunals. I agree to an extent that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, indicated, this is a grey area. That is not, however, a reason not to progress into a framework to continue to seek improvements.<\/p><p pid=\"b1049.0\/4\">I hope the Minister does not mind if I remind  him that he has twice been referred to in this way  as a private citizen and business leader. As chair  of a British financial company he commended the authoritarianism of President Xi over protests in Hong Kong, stating that this ensured economic continuity in Hong Kong and was in the UK&#8217;s interest. He has now migrated from business leader to political leader. In many respects, that is illustrative of the challenges that we all face about choices that we make in the business community as well as the political community&#8212;it is illustrative of this wider debate.<\/p><p pid=\"b1049.0\/5\">I serve on the International Relations Committee, as does the noble Lord, Lord Alton. We said in our report on the Middle East that the British Government were on the wrong side of international human rights law in continuing to sell arms to Saudi Arabia as the Yemen tragedy ensued. We have high standards in this country and I believe we are a force for good around the world, but we should not delude ourselves about how others see us: inventor of concentration camps, holder of weapons of mass destruction and declarer of illegal wars. I love my country, but I am not totally rose-tinted about our history.<\/p><p pid=\"b1049.0\/6\">Still, we have had a proud record post war as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, said. We have helped to shape international norms on human rights, in which we can take particular pride. One of the theatres where we have done so was in the European context when we were a member of the European Union. The noble Lord, Lord Collins, quite rightly said that a common approach on the use of political clauses was agreed in the European Union in 2009, to ensure that there would be systematic references of human rights clauses in all agreements going forward. I will come back to that.<\/p><p pid=\"b1049.0\/7\">I want to make it very clear what I am calling for, so that the Minister understands that there is no equivocation: a human rights and trade policy which has proper indicative measures and triggering mechanisms, so that we can replace what we had within the European context and have a distinct United Kingdom approach for all trade. The noble Lord, Lord Lansley, referred to proposed new subsection (6). I am pleased that the amendment outlined the breadth of the type of agreements that we have. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Alton, does not mind me saying that Amendment 9 would have been strengthened if it had been more specific about the areas which we will be covering.<\/p><p pid=\"b1049.0\/8\">The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, asked about what proposed new subsection (5)(d) means by some of those<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1049.0\/9\">&#8220;other &#8230; violations of human rights &#8230; including &#8230; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b1049.0\/10\">One example is that we hold strongly to the view that countries should not have the death sentence for people who have a mental illness, or for children. That is  within the ICCPR and there should be no disagreement that it is a serious human rights violation. If such a violation is being practised, the question is what impact that should have on our trading relationships.<\/p><p pid=\"b1049.0\/11\">This is all about the trade relationships that we have through agreements, whether it is a full free trade policy or one of the other agreements outlined in proposed new subsection (6). Those all invariably involve preferential access for that third country to our economy: preferential either because there is less tax or because they have access to our markets or partnerships which we would deny to others except, in general, the WTO. As my noble friend Lady Smith asked: what value do we put on that preferential access? One part is economic; the second part is the value that we have for our wider rights.<\/p><p pid=\"b1049.0\/12\">I return to the common approach in the European Union and the use of political clauses. The agreements with third countries included human rights and they were all under what was termed &#8220;essential elements clauses&#8221;. Free trade agreements would be linked to the political framework agreements with that country, encapsulating all the agreements that we have. If they did not exist in the framework, this would be included specifically in a free trade agreement. I would be interested to know whether the Government believe that this is of merit too. Should we include our human rights element in our trading agreements, linked with the other partnership agreements that we have with that country? Labour rights have been included in specific trade and sustainable development chapters. I tried my hardest in Committee to get the Government to state their position on the inclusion and sustainable chapters in future agreements. They did not do so; I hope that the Minister can be clear about it today.<\/p><p pid=\"b1049.0\/13\">The fact that there has been a standard approach since 2009 meant that, during negotiations on agreements with countries, the EU was able to proactively assess the overall positive and negative impacts on trade agreements, including human rights, and the totality of the human rights record and domestic legal frameworks of that country. That informed the negotiations with those countries. It is not necessarily a case of seeking to impose a legislative framework on that country, but we assess what it is. At the very least, we determine how many international obligations, from labour rights to a whole set of legislative requirements on human rights, they have domesticated into their law. In the European context, it is interesting how many countries revised their domestic legislation during the process of negotiations with the EU, and domesticated international obligations&#8212;something they had not done up until then.<\/p><p pid=\"b1049.0\/14\">Up until that point, most of the agreements had the ability to either pause or suspend. It is only in the recent EU-Canada agreement that, for the first time, there is a specific mechanism where, if there is a gross violation of human rights, or non-proliferation, that could serve as grounds for termination of the entire agreement. We will get into this in the next group, but given that this is the first time, I would like to know from the Minister whether that element has been replicated in the UK-Canada agreement? If it has, it would be the first time that the UK has done this. If  the Government have not replicated it, that is, in my mind, a very clear signal that they are departing from the approach that we had led up until now.<\/p><p pid=\"b1049.0\/15\">I hope that the Government will listen carefully to calls from across the Chambers. We need a UK Government impact assessment tool for the UK that is cross-departmental, including the Department of International Trade, the FCDO and BEIS, so that we can take a considered approach to human rights clauses in our trade agreements, sanctions regimes on human rights from our Foreign Office, and, potentially, remedial acts from the Department for Business. Without a proper impact assessment tool, it is very hard for us to consider this. We need mechanisms and we need frameworks. I hope noble Lords do not mind me saying so, but I believe that this is more important at this stage in this Bill than simply referring to individual examples of human rights abuses around the world that we know, to our shame, have existed.<\/p><p pid=\"b1049.0\/16\">I hope that the Government will respond positively to Amendment 8 and, before Third Reading, set out clear draft human rights clauses for future trade agreements, draft trade and sustainability chapters, and the mechanisms for escalating concerns around the implications of human rights, and the mechanisms that will then be triggered for us to judge not only whether we believe that the relationship should be questioned but what mechanisms can be put in place. At the end of the day, all of this is about the people and the victims. Unless we have a clear framework and a clear position from the Government, we are letting those people down in the countries with which we trade.<\/p>",

The first is that it is very difficult to define what level of debt ownership constitutes control, because technically there is no control in law. It is possible to have an influence, but we cannot define what control is.<\/p><p>The second point is that tradeable debt, as in bond market debt, is something that is usually stuck to quite a sophisticated company.

The sentiment behind the amendment is really important, because there is a lot of control by debt owners, be they banks or bond holders. However, it is too complicated to support at this level, because it needs much more debate and scrutiny, and we would need a much more cleverly worded amendment to support this.

            "body": "<p>I thank the hon. Member for Clwyd South for his intervention. I take that point absolutely, but I think it is important sometimes to go back to the mindset we have around this legislation. The Opposition feel that there are opportunities to strengthen the Bill. Every single Bill that the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy puts forward should be informed by that need to strengthen our sovereign capability and make us less reliant on risky supply chains, and to be somewhat more realistic about the way that the world and globalisation work. It really was just contextual, but I do take the hon. Member&#8217;s point that we should remain within those parameters. I think the mindset is really important.<\/p><p>On the issue of exposure to highly extended supply chains and the way in which we have had the floodgates open for hostile foreign takeovers, this country has the highest number of hostile foreign takeovers in the entire OECD. That really speaks volumes about our economic model.<\/p><p>In terms of relations with China, the Bill is not an anti-China Bill as such, but we all know that the key economic development of the last few decades has been the rise of China. The reality is that we have been na&#239;ve and complacent&#160;in the way we have dealt with China. Previous Prime Ministers announced a so-called golden era, whereby we were going to open our markets to China, the Chinese were going to do the same, and they would gradually align with the international rules-based order, its norms and even its values, some thought.<\/p><p>That has been an unmitigated disaster. None of that has happened. In fact, what we have seen is that the benefits of the golden era have flowed almost exclusively from west to east. We are still running a &#163;19 billion trade deficit with China and we are still seeing extremely hostile political acts, not least what is happening in Hong Kong and the persecution of the Uyghur people in Xinjiang. Both economically and politically, the strategy has failed.<\/p><p>It is heartening to see in the Bill some evidence that the Government are learning that lesson. I think the Bill is the Government saying, &#8220;Yes, we have been na&#239;ve and complacent. We do need to take a more hard-headed, realistic approach to China in particular, so we are going to take some action.&#8221; But as I said, the Bill could do so much more and be so much better. It is in that spirit that we have tabled our amendment.<\/p><p>There is also an added element of urgency: the  covid crisis will leave many British businesses distressed  and vulnerable. They will be vulnerable to more hostile  foreign takeovers, including those backed by state-owned enterprises and state-backed investment vehicles. When we talk about China, there is, of course, no difference between business and the state&#8212;business is the state. The Chinese Communist party has a membership of 90 million people. It is absolutely clear that any time a business takes a decision, regardless of whether it is ostensibly or nominally in the private sector, it is the CCP that makes the call. We are dealing with a situation in which our business community&#8212;distressed, vulnerable and potentially with huge cash-flow issues&#8212;is going to be susceptible to those kinds of hostile foreign takeovers.<\/p>",

I will also say what the Bill does not do: it does not take away any rights that we may have to go to court on any issue, but it does introduce an element of civility and common sense back into society. It allows an apology to be given that is genuinely and sincerely meant without creating a legal liability that would run into millions of pounds.<\/p><p pid=\"c158.2\/4\">Simply put, an apology that does not create a legal liability will often settle a dispute, rather than being seen as a way to take the accused for every penny they have. It should be the mark of a mature democratic society and of its dispute resolution system that an apology, whether made publicly or privately, can and should be allowed to be meaningful and helpful rather than simply a necessary yet tokenistic gesture. An apology can truly change atmospheres, the nature of conversations and outcomes. Used appropriately, it can help to avoid a dispute going to court. Equally, it can assist the resolution of a case by changing the approach being taken.<\/p><p pid=\"c158.2\/5\">The policy driver behind the initiative is that apologies can often unlock disputes and lead to settlements without recourse to formal legal action. Since parties may be reluctant to do anything that may be construed as an admission of liability, apologies have to date seemingly been sparse, except in cases of NHS clinical negligence. A culture has emerged of people and organisations not wanting to offer an apology in case it is detrimental to their legal position or deemed to be a weakness. With tragic incidents such as that of Grenfell Tower, and the need to improve multicultural community cohesion, the time has come to extend the current limited legislative provisions.<\/p><p pid=\"c158.2\/6\">A fresh apologies Act would be a clear statement from Westminster and a simple legal mechanism to help to improve our country&#8217;s conversations. It could incentivise disputing parties to make apologies whether in the direct aftermath of an accident, mistake or other dispute, or further down the line, should the dispute escalate, with a view to achieving a more amicable resolution.<\/p><p pid=\"c158.2\/7\">An NHS publication, &#8220;Saying sorry&#8221;, published in June 2017, reminds of a little-known provision in the Compensation Act 2006, which provides that:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c158.2\/8\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;An apology, an offer of treatment or other redress, shall not of itself amount to an admission of negligence or breach of statutory duty.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c158.2\/9\">More significantly, in the same medical context, there is the duty of candour under the Health and Social Care Act 2008, which is more fully described in a leaflet published by Action against Medical Accidents and endorsed by the Care Quality Commission. The General Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Council advise that that means that healthcare professionals  must tell the patient when something has gone wrong; apologise to the patient; offer an appropriate remedy or support to put matters right, if that is possible; and explain fully to the patient the short and long-term effects of what has happened.<\/p><p pid=\"c158.2\/10\">How has such common-sense advice worked in practice? A search during the preparation of this speech found that there was limited empirical research through acknowledgements of the benefits and anecdotal examples of its successes. In fact, the most helpful insight into the successful outcomes of medical apologies comes from an article in the National Law Review, a US professional publication, dated <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-11-06\">6 November<\/phrase> 2018. Although the majority of US states have, on the one hand, apology legislation, but on the other, a highly litigious approach to life&#8217;s adversities&#8212;from the current President downwards &#8212;none the less:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c158.2\/11\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Physicians typically recall, with stunning clarity, the moment a patient&#8217;s treatment went wrong. Following an adverse event, physicians often are tormented by competing desires to apologize and instincts to forge ahead without acknowledgement. A patient&#8217;s decision to file a malpractice action may be triggered by the physician&#8217;s response to a problem&#8212;or lack thereof&#8230;Apologies may decrease feelings of frustration and anger that drive some plaintiffs to file lawsuits. A study published in the Journal of Patient Safety and Risk Management found that&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c158.2\/12\">those engaging in a<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c158.2\/13\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;&#8216;collaborative communication resolution program&#8217; experienced a significant decrease in the filing of legal claims, defense costs, liability costs and time required to close cases&#8230;Events with medical errors were resolved by apology alone in 43% of the cases. Similar programs have cut the number of malpractice lawsuits and yielded dramatic litigation cost savings.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c158.2\/14\">Not only do the majority of US states have apology statutes, but so do Australia, Canada and even Hong Kong, whose legislature was the first jurisdiction in Asia to enact apology legislation through the 2017 ordinance, but was unable to put its best intentions into effect due to the growing restrictions from mainland China on its governance and judicial systems.<\/p><p pid=\"c158.2\/15\">Closer to home, there is the approach taken by Holyrood with a short yet powerful statement: the Apologies (Scotland) Act 2016, which contains only six clauses, including its commencement and short title. It defines an apology as:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c158.2\/16\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;any statement made by or on behalf of a person which indicates that the person is sorry about, or regrets, an act, omission or outcome and includes any part of the statement which contains an undertaking to look at the circumstances giving rise to the act, omission or outcome with a view to preventing a recurrence&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"c158.2\/17\">For an apology to be constituted within the terms of the Scottish Act, it must include an acknowledgment that there has been a bad outcome, an expression of regret, sorrow or sympathy, and a recognition of direct or indirect responsibility. In addition, there may also be an undertaking to review the circumstances of the incident with a view to making improvements or learning lessons. The Act applies to all civil, not criminal, legal proceedings, with some exceptions.<\/p><p pid=\"c158.2\/18\">The following considerations are worth noting. Qualifying apologies may be oral or in writing. The core element of an apology as defined in the Act is an indication<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c158.2\/19\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;that the person is sorry about, or regrets, an act, omission or outcome&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"c158.2\/20\">Where the statement includes<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c158.2\/21\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;an undertaking to look at the circumstances&#8230;with a view to preventing a recurrence&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"c158.2\/22\">it qualifies as part of an apology. An apology does not include statements of fact or admissions of fault, so in any statement that includes both an apology and a statement of fact and\/or an admission of fault, only the apology is inadmissible as evidence of liability. The Act makes it possible to apologise without fear of prejudicing the person making the apology or of the apology being used to attribute blame in litigation. It applies to all civil proceedings except four types of specific actions. As I said, it does not apply to criminal proceedings.<\/p><p pid=\"c158.2\/23\">In a subsequent article written by Scotland&#8217;s most high-profile mediator, John Sturrock QC explains how that piece of legislation achieved the rare distinction of attracting enthusiastic cross-party support:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c158.2\/24\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Over more than two years, Margaret Mitchell&#8221;&#8212;<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c158.2\/25\">a Conservative MSP&#8212;<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c158.2\/26\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;has piloted this legislation through the Scottish Parliament with skill and tact&#8230;As one member noted: &#8216;&#8230;Both sides have been pretty consensual in trying to ensure that we end up with something that the Parliament can be genuinely proud of.&#8217;&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c158.2\/27\">The essence is<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c158.2\/28\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;that apologies have the great value of acknowledging that something has gone wrong and demonstrating that lessons have been learned. We all know that mistakes happen&#8212;that is a sad fact of life&#8212;and that they can often have tragic and long-lasting consequences. However, it is how we deal with those mistakes that makes the difference.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c158.2\/29\">John Sturrock continues:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c158.2\/30\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;It is clear that legislation alone cannot remove social barriers to apologising, but the bill is an important step in changing attitudes to apologies.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c158.2\/31\">As my fellow officer of the all-party parliamentary group on alternative dispute resolution, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"John Spellar\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10558\">the right hon.

An ever-wider and ever-deeper range of dispute resolution options should be pursued. We must also think about disputes in a way that goes beyond the legal conceptual framework and encompasses all aspects of commercial relationships.<\/p><p pid=\"c158.2\/32\">I commend the Scottish approach to the House.

            "body": "<p pid=\"b100.1\/1\">Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker&#8212;does that mean that I get 16 minutes to speak? That is fantastic. [Interruption.] That is my first intervention, so it is now 17 minutes. It is good to catch your eye in this important debate, Madam Deputy Speaker, and to see present so many colleagues who were there at the start of the journey&#8212;I referred to this in the first intervention I made&#8212;when we first discussed Huawei in the Chamber.<\/p><p pid=\"b100.1\/2\">The Defence Committee looked at this subject because the security of 5G is now critical, given our ever-growing reliance on data movement. To establish a new security framework for the UK telecoms sector and to ensure that telecoms providers operate a secure network and resilient services and manage their supply chains is absolutely fundamental to our new way of life. The completion of 5G over the next decade will be nothing short of revolutionary. Every aspect of our lives as we know them, including how we communicate, socialise, work, travel and manufacture things, will become increasingly dependent on lightning movements of wireless data. The advantages of such scope and scale in our growing online world have very much been appreciated during this pandemic, but, equally, we must recognise how our reliance leaves us very much exposed to those who might choose to cause us harm.<\/p><p pid=\"b100.1\/3\">The backdrop of this was of course the lively debate, which I have referred to, over Huawei. Perhaps that was a wake-up call on just how powerful and tech savvy China has become. The Minister and the Secretary of State have made it very clear that this is not just about China&#8212;other non-state and state actors are now developing capabilities to interfere with our online world&#8212;but I make it very clear indeed that what we are discussing today exposes the wider uncomfortable reality of the gradual geopolitical shift in global power from west to east.<\/p><p pid=\"b100.1\/4\">In our lifetimes, China is on course to become more powerful economically, technologically and militarily than the United States of America, and how we handle this so-called Thucydides trap is yet to be reckoned with. This is a usually disruptive transition of influence from one ruling power base to a rising power with eventually more dominance&#8212;a transition that history suggests is rarely peaceful. The only example of a peaceful transition is that from the British empire to the American superpower. If we are honest, this Bill is about exactly that. This is the starting point of a bigger conversation about how we manage such a transition. We are placing protections on our country against China, which we privately no longer trust, but I have to say that, publicly, we may be in denial about what we need to discuss.<\/p><p pid=\"b100.1\/5\">We should finally come to terms with the fact that China has not matured into the responsible global citizen that, a decade ago, we hoped it would be. Instead, China offers a competing authoritarian ideology, leveraging its colossal economic growth to undercut western competition and ensnare dozens of countries into infrastructure projects and high-tech plans on terms that they can ill afford. Our growing dependence on the online world has created a new virtual theatre of war. The actual character of conflict has been changing in front of us: it is less about terrain, and now more about data. We are becoming increasingly vulnerable, with cyber-attacks, disinformation campaigns, interference in elections, manipulation of social media, data theft, online espionage and sabotage. These are the new battlegrounds that we must prepare for and defend against. Our international rules-based order was crafted in the pre-digital age. A major cyber-attack, for example, could cause more damage than a dirty bomb, but would not technically trip a NATO article 5 response. International law must catch up, and this legislation is a small line of defence in a far wider geopolitical battle that we need to embrace.<\/p><p pid=\"b100.1\/6\">Britain is rightly seeking to remain on the cutting edge of this fast-developing digital world, but this can only be achieved with greater protection and, indeed, investment in our critical national infrastructure. Our 5G capability must leave no virtual backdoors left open. Consequently, phasing out high-risk vendors, such as Huawei, from our 5G programme is the right call. However, we have to ask the question: why is it that a decade ago there were 12 vendors that can provide this support, yet today there are only six? There are two in Europe, with Ericsson and Nokia, two in the far east, with NEC and Samsung, and then of course two in China&#8212;Huawei and ZTE&#8212;and there the question lies. What we need to do about it is to make sure we have that capability to move forward in a secure environment.<\/p><p pid=\"b100.1\/7\">We must accept that Huawei has grafted its way into our telecoms network partly because the UK vendor market is not diverse enough. Regaining the secure technological capability on which our new digital world will depend requires more than just legislation to block high-risk vendors from entry; it needs the advancement of our own technological capabilities. Open RAN has been mentioned, but it is still a long way off. OneWeb has been purchased as a possible capability for communications. We have yet to hear what the Government plan to do with that.<\/p><p pid=\"b100.1\/8\">Ultimately, we must recognise that Huawei, ZTE and others are so powerful because they are state funded. Perhaps it is time for an Apollo moment: when the United States knew it was losing the space race, a combination of state aid and the commercial sector allowed it not only to catch up with but to overtake the Soviet Union. We need the same penny to drop here and to recognise what China is all about.<\/p><p pid=\"b100.1\/9\">It is good to hear growing talk of the D5 trusted alliance of nations. It has been mentioned as an advancement of the Five Eyes community and I very much welcome that. We need to provide an alternative to the cheap solutions that the Chinese are rolling out, which continue to be peddled across the road. They are high-tech versions of the one belt, one road programme. Only with greater western resolve can we design and build the secure foundations for the profound new technological world we are about to experience.<\/p><p pid=\"b100.1\/10\">I will underline the elephant in the room: what do we do about China? Unless we in the UK and collectively in the west address China&#8217;s conduct, there will be a geopolitical clash. That is inevitable and will slide us towards another cold war.<\/p><p pid=\"b100.1\/11\">We should make it clear that the UK has huge respect for the Chinese people. Our histories are intertwined, perhaps more than many of us appreciate. The opium wars, the ceding of Hong Kong, the Boxer rebellion, the century of humiliation&#8212;perhaps Britain glosses over many of those historical footnotes, but for those in China, they influence their thinking and their attitude towards the west today.<\/p><p pid=\"b100.1\/12\">However, today, the west is recalibrating its view of China. China&#8217;s conduct in the pandemic, from its initial efforts to hide the outbreak to rejecting any independent investigation, has exposed a dangerous agenda that we can no longer ignore. During China&#8217;s incredible economic ascent, western policy focused on deepening engagement in the hope that China would evolve into a responsible global citizen that embraced hard-fought principles of liberty, democracy and open trade. It is clear that the Chinese Communist party has something very different in mind. As it has increased its economic power, Beijing has deliberately shunned international accountability and rules. It may be gaining superpower status, but it avoids any sense of duty to uphold core values of freedom and the rule of law. Knowing that its conduct repudiates those values, it now pursues a geopolitical authoritarian agenda, as illustrated in the crackdown in Hong Kong, the terrible treatment of the Uyghur minority and its manipulation of the digital world, which mimics its one belt, one road initiative.<\/p><p pid=\"b100.1\/13\">With countries becoming locked into long-term commitments with reduced autonomy and little prospect of withdrawal, more and more countries are becoming ensnared in China&#8217;s authoritarian sphere of influence. The US now publicly confirms that China is a strategic and geopolitical threat to the west, while here in the UK we have yet to say so, though I am pleased that the Secretary of State pointed out concerns about China.<\/p><p pid=\"b100.1\/14\">I hope that the full publication of the Government&#8217;s integrated review will confirm that China now is a geopolitical threat. We require a turning point&#8212;another Sputnik moment, where we no longer pretend and we do not just legislate on high-risk vendors, but hold the regime behind the state-owned companies to account.<\/p><p pid=\"b100.1\/15\">I hope that, with the changing of the guard in Washington, there will be a rejuvenation of the west&#8217;s collective resolve about what we stand for, what we believe in and what we are willing to defend. The next decade will be very bumpy indeed. If we are to avoid another cold war, protecting our telecoms infrastructure must be the first step of many.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a596.0\/1\">I thank the Minister who is going to respond to this Statement.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.0\/2\">The first case of this coronavirus was just over  a year ago, on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-11-17\">17 November<\/phrase> 2019. Since then, over 1.3 million people have died worldwide and over 50 million people have been infected. The first case here in the UK was on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-01-29\">29 January<\/phrase> this year. We watched Italy deal with the cases in late winter, and I am sure that plans were being fetched out of the archives on how we might deal with a pandemic. I know that in 2015 there was a pandemic plan published for an influenza outbreak. Will the Minister tell the House what lessons were learned from that exercise?<\/p><p pid=\"a596.0\/3\">I remember walking back to my flat in London on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-03-17\">17 March<\/phrase> and my son, who was living with me then, said, &#8220;You either go home today, or you stay until this clears&#8221;. I went home, and on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-03-23\">23 March<\/phrase> lockdown started. Along with many other noble Lords, I stayed away for some considerable time, and Zoom, Teams and virtual working became the new normal.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.0\/4\">Hong Kong, which is always waiting for a SARS outbreak, keeps a stock of PPE for all care homes in the event of a pandemic. Is it too early to ask the Minister whether that is something he would now consider for England? I think it was a recommendation of that pandemic preparedness document in 2015.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.0\/5\">One area where I would also be grateful for clarification is that of test, track and isolate. At what stage was it decided not to involve the local experts and local authorities? This caused much regional frustration, as this was the biggest public health crisis for many years, and local public health leaders were being sidelined. They know their regions well, and in areas where they did work, it worked well. Let me be clear that in a Lib Dem world, local authorities would test then track those with a positive result and support them practically and emotionally in their isolation.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.0\/6\">As the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, has articulated, many of the public have said that they did not fully understand restrictions. When putting messages together, who did the Government picture they were talking to? From whom did they get their advice? Who did they test their messaging on? This is a case where conversations with the Plain English Campaign, or perhaps the Canadians, would have been helpful.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.0\/7\">The last time tiered restrictions were in place, less than half of people in the UCL Covid-19 Social Study said that they fully understood the rules. With changes to the tier system and a five-day relaxation, will the Secretary of State make changes to the Government&#8217;s communications strategy to aid compliance?<\/p><p pid=\"a596.0\/8\">Some of the Covid economic measures have helped people in the short term, such as the furlough scheme, which our colleagues in the other place fought so hard to get. However, the Government excluded more than 1 million people from Covid support and froze pay for local authority staff, who have also played a vital role in combating this pernicious disease. It is an assault on local authority workers and services.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.0\/9\">Nurses too have been hoping for a pay rise. The Chancellor stated:<\/p><p pid=\"a596.0\/10\">&#8220;Our health emergency is not yet over and our economic emergency has only just begun&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.0\/11\">He explained that the<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a596.0\/12\">&#8220;immediate priority is to protect people&#8217;s lives and livelihoods&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"a596.0\/13\">and that the spending review is set to deliver stronger public services. He continued:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a596.0\/14\">&#8220;taking account of the pay review bodies&#8217; advice, we will provide a pay rise to over a million nurses, doctors and others working in the NHS.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a596.0\/15\">He promised<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a596.0\/16\">&#8220;the 2.1 million public sector workers who earn below the median wage of &#163;24,000&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a596.0\/17\">that they<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a596.0\/18\">&#8220;will be guaranteed a pay rise of at least &#163;250.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class=\"offrep\" id=\", Commons, 25\/11\/20; cols. 827-28.]\"><i>Official Report<\/i>, Commons, 25\/11\/20; cols. 827-28.]<\/phrase><\/p><p pid=\"a596.0\/19\">That should include porters, auxiliaries, and other key, low-paid hospital workers.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.0\/20\">Countless families are facing serious financial hardship. More than 1 million people have lost their jobs, and the devastating impact of this pandemic will continue to be felt acutely throughout the next year. We are also facing big challenges in deep-seated inequality. We must ensure that no one is left behind. The Government win plaudits for the furlough scheme, but they have failed to provide a serious economic strategy for dealing with unemployment, climate change and inequality. I fear the Government&#8217;s Brexit plans will make job losses and business closures much worse. No deal or a bad deal would be a huge blow for businesses and jobs just when we need to be recovering from this crisis.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.0\/21\">Although the winter plan broadly outlines the five criteria used for determining the tier system, would the Minister be more transparent about what the exact entry and exit points of the tiers will be? I understand it is not always possible to give exact criteria, but even a rough idea would help the public know what they are aiming for when the Government are asking them to make so many sacrifices.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.0\/22\">This has been relentless since the middle of May. At a briefing meeting today, we heard that the acute care sector was at full pelt, and this is before winter sets in. The Minister is rightly proud of the Nightingale units. Do we have staffing for them? Should we need them? Many clinical staff are totally exhausted. Many question whether they want to carry on in the profession. Are the Government making sure that a safety-critical profession can reach safe staffing levels by filling tens of thousands of unfilled nursing jobs?<\/p><p pid=\"a596.0\/23\">Children are the most vulnerable to the social impacts of local restrictions and have had formative years of their lives severely affected. With the rule of six being reinstated after national lockdown, will the Minister commit to an exemption from the rule of six for children under 12? It really does make sense.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.0\/24\">What is the Minister&#8217;s current estimation of the likely length of the restrictions? Being open and transparent on likely timings and not creating false hope are critical to maintaining public support for any public health measures. After all, the PM said earlier this year that we would be back to normal by Christmas, and how wrong he turned out to be.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a368.2\/1\">I beg to move,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a368.2\/2\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">That this House has considered business and economic opportunities after Huawei&#8217;s exclusion from the 5G network.<\/p><p pid=\"a368.2\/3\">It is a privilege to serve under your chairmanship, Ms Eagle. I am grateful to the Members present for their interest; I am sure that there will be cross-party support for my objective. I want to use the UK&#8217;s excellence in areas of new technology as an opportunity to help to grow the UK economy and to support the Government&#8217;s levelling-up agenda across the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a368.2\/4\">Some time has passed since the decision was taken to exclude Huawei from the UK&#8217;s 5G network. Governments around the world faced challenges over Huawei&#8217;s dominance in this field. Concerns around security contradicted the will or demand to roll out the technology as quickly as possible. A tension between the two was created. We all know the difficult decision that the Government took to exclude Huawei&#8217;s influence, and we look forward to the Telecommunications (Security) Bill, which will be presented shortly.<\/p><p pid=\"a368.2\/5\">Alternative providers need to be found and developed, and that is an opportunity for the UK to step up in specific areas. As a free marketeer, my instinct is to let the market decide, and that remains true, but with  the UK having considerable expertise in the field, the Government can play an active part in setting the direction, creating the parameters and providing the greatest certainty to allow for private investment, particularly in the  fields where as a nation we are in a leading position. Announcements on open standards such as Open RAN&#8212;radio access network&#8212;highlight that the Government understand that, and their focus should be recognised. It will diversify the market, improve resilience and innovation and facilitate the UK to play a leading position in a field recently dominated by the Chinese.<\/p><p pid=\"a368.2\/6\">The reach and influence of 5G technology will extend much further than previous generations of communication. Its capacity to carry much larger volumes of data at very high speeds means that our connected lives will be   taken to a new plane, from the internet of things to connected vehicles and smart cities, and many more areas that we have not even thought of yet.<\/p><p pid=\"a368.2\/7\">There are several fundamental elements needed to achieve that, including a range of areas, such as radio frequency and satellite communications, 5G and base station capabilities, backhaul technologies and cyber-resilient networks among others. I highlight those elements, because I believe the UK already has specific expertise there, which can be developed further, as I will comment on later. All of them come together using compound semiconductors. These very high capacity chips enable more data to be managed effectively.<\/p><p pid=\"a368.2\/8\">It was once described to me that if a silicon chip is a country lane, a compound semiconductor is a great big highway. That encapsulates the opportunity and possibilities 5G will create. Interestingly, they also minimise energy consumption and will play a big part in our net zero target. It is with great pleasure that I can say that the world&#8217;s first cluster of compound semiconductor technology is in south Wales, developed from companies such as IQE, SPTS Technologies and Newport Wafer Fab. Many others have followed since. All are supported by the Compound Semiconductor Applications Catapult.<\/p><p pid=\"a368.2\/9\">I want to pay particular tribute to the work of Dr Andy Sellars from the Catapult, who first sparked my interest in this field when I was the Secretary of State. Government investment has been significant through the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, UK Research and Innovation and the Cardiff capital region city deal. It was a privilege to play an active part in supporting the projects and to see Swansea University and Cardiff University research play its part, along with other universities from Bristol to Cambridge and many more. I also had to ensure that the Department for International Trade was also aware of their expertise. It was good to see Andy Sellars in a prominent position at the GREAT Festival of Innovation in Hong Kong, highlighting the possibilities and seeking to attract interest and investment globally. It was an extremely impressive show, as recognised by everyone. It was a privilege to be there to see it in action.<\/p><p pid=\"a368.2\/10\">The fundamental elements I have highlighted, however, are also areas where the UK has specific expertise that can be developed with an appropriate framework. The high-speed radiofrequency technology along with satellite communications needed to maximise coverage is one example. The UK&#8217;s investment in OneWeb shows that the Government understand the opportunity. There is also a cluster of complementary technology companies in the north east, such as VIPER RF, Diamond Microwave and aXenic. These are all supported by the Satellite Applications Catapult in the region. Elsewhere in the UK, iconicRF has a very strong reputation internationally.<\/p><p pid=\"a368.2\/11\">I pay tribute to the Minister for his active interest in this area, which has given a lot of support to the industry and encouraged further investment, but there is more to do. As part of the network improvements, there will be a need to upgrade base stations with the specific need to develop small cell technology. Blu Wireless in Bristol is an example of the UK&#8217;s expertise that also benefits from the compound semiconductor cluster that I have already referred to, which also forms part of the western gateway region. Also in the western gateway economic region lies the UK&#8217;s strength in cyber-resilience, including Airbus, Thales, GCHQ and Bristol University&#8217;s quantum optical network strength, among others.<\/p><p pid=\"a368.2\/12\">Another essential element is backhaul, which takes data from the cellular base stations and feeds into the network. The introduction of 5G applications will mean a need to develop from its strength beyond 400 gigabits per second. Filtronic in Durham and Cambridge Broadband Networks are forerunners in this area, too. The final piece of the jigsaw is test and validation. This is critical to guarantee the interoperability between the vital elements that I have already referred to. The world&#8217;s leading test and validation company, Spirent, has its headquarters in the UK. It also operates in the United States. Bringing all those together highlights our expertise in discrete areas of 5G apparatus&#8212;a technology and infrastructure project for which demand will grow exponentially. We have an opportunity to develop a plan to ensure that those companies and others are well positioned to benefit from that opportunity, but how do we do that?<\/p><p pid=\"a368.2\/13\">There are examples of support across Government, such as for the automotive sector, that offer a model of how to engage with the industry to develop the necessary clusters of consortia. For example, the Advanced Propulsion Centre plays a role in facilitating the shift to electric vehicles. Its modest budget has attracted significant private sector investment in the field. In one case, the APC supports a consortium of 13 companies that work with the Compound Semiconductor Applications Catapult in south-east Wales, to which I have already referred, to create the UK semiconductor supply chain to power McLaren&#8217;s electric sports car.<\/p><p pid=\"a368.2\/14\">On the back of that project, further consortia have been formed with BMW and Mini to benefit from UK technology. In total, the catapult is working on approximately &#163;100 million-worth of projects, 50% of which have been funded by the private sector. I suspect that the private sector proportion will continue to grow because of the cluster of excellence that has been created.<\/p><p pid=\"a368.2\/15\">Another model, in a different field, is the ventilator challenge that the Government set up in response to covid-19 to encourage manufacturers to innovate to meet the global shortages of ventilators. A consortia  of companies brought together by the High Value Manufacturing Catapult built more than 15,000 ventilators, which represents five years of production, in just three months. That was pulled together in the national interest and would not have happened if the Government had not played a facilitating role.<\/p><p pid=\"a368.2\/16\">A third example is the development of energy generation projects, which have received similar support. The certainty that the Government gave to offshore wind energy installation has allowed the UK to dominate the engineering field in that sector. Similarly, the commitment to small modular nuclear reactors is leading to a world-first in the UK that has the potential to be a major export. Again, I pay tribute to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the DIT and the Wales Office, when I had a personal interest in it, because Wales has a strong presence in the opportunity.<\/p><p pid=\"a368.2\/17\">The Minister will be pleased that I am not calling for a new agency or for identical models to be used, but I am asking for the same principles to be applied that were established for electric vehicles, ventilators, offshore wind and SMRs to prompt further investment from the private sector. The Government have a part to play in providing certainty on policy. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport is playing a significant part,  but it also needs to act as a facilitator to bring some of those excellent companies together and to work with BEIS because of the cross-departmental agenda.<\/p><p pid=\"a368.2\/18\">I also gently say to the Minister, and other hon. Members, that not all Government Departments are as joined-up as we would like them to be. Sometimes there needs to be an able Minister with a great pedigree who has the opportunity to bring people together, such as the Minister before us. The market potential is significant and would be a welcome boost to many parts of the United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"a368.2\/19\">Companies have a part to play too. If I have any criticism of them, it is that they do not shout loud enough about their expertise or their potential. I deliberately stated where most of those companies are based, because their siting is relevant to the Government&#8217;s levelling-up agenda. The western gateway that I referred to is sited in some of the most deprived parts of the UK, but there is the excellence in that region to bring together complementary expertise that does not exist anywhere else in the world. Similarly, the north-east has a leading position in radio frequency and satellite technology, as I have highlighted, and we all know about the Government&#8217;s ambitions to grow the economy in that part of the country.<\/p><p pid=\"a368.2\/20\">The Government&#8217;s decision on Huawei could be a pivot to develop our expertise further and to scale up research in manufacturing, which would lead to a major increase in UK components for our 5G network and a huge export market. At the same time, that would remove the security risks that many hon. Members were concerned about. I look forward to the Minister&#8217;s response.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p class=\"unknownspeaker\">Sir Richard Dearlove:<\/p> <p>Wow. That is a massive question. Bear in mind that a large part of my career related to the cold war. In that period, our main concern was the Soviet Union and the members of the Warsaw Pact. It was characteristic of that period that there were heavy controls, mainly exercised through NATO structures, to prevent strategic material from leaching, as it were, into the economies of the Warsaw pact. I will not go into all the mechanisms. Historically, one does not need to worry about those now, but it was very much an issue that was at the forefront of people&#8217;s minds during that period of the cold war. Bear in mind also&#8212;I think this is important in looking at the broader context of what you are interested in&#8212;that the Soviet Union had hugely sophisticated what&#8217;s called S and T operations: science and technology. A whole line of Soviet intelligence of the KGB was devoted to obtaining strategic material that would help the Soviet economy, particularly in the military industrial complex.<\/p><p>This is now in the public domain: in the mid-1980s, there was a major intelligence success, which, interestingly, was conducted by the French, but in which the UK had an important role. We completely dismantled, or learned, exactly what the Soviet Union and its allies were up to on a global basis. We knew before, but we did not know the detail to that extent, and what we learned was pretty shocking. That case has not been greatly publicised, but it was probably one of the most important intelligence cases of the cold war.<\/p><p>With the break-up of the Soviet Union and the disintegration of the Soviet empire, particularly the economic structures that bound the Warsaw pact countries together, in the West our attitudes towards those issues changed very significantly. There was a much more laissez-faire situation and, as countries broke away from the Soviet empire, an enthusiasm to trade with them without the same degree of control.<\/p><p>During that period, you had the emergence of China, which was still very much a regional power but with aspirations to become a global power. To short cut, we  have now transferred to China the concerns we had about the Soviet Union and its allies, but the problem with China in some respects is much more serious than the problem with the Soviet Union, although that was bad enough. Charlie Parton, who was talking to you before, is an expert on China specifically. I am not, and my view is maybe more strategic, although I had a lot to do with China when I was head of MI6.<\/p><p>If you look back at the emergence of China as a regional power, from the very start&#8212;when Mao was still alive and was then succeeded by Deng Xiaoping&#8212;its intelligence community focused on China&#8217;s economic growth. It was not particularly interested in what we would see as strategic or political intelligence. There is a famous passage in Kissinger&#8217;s book on China in which he is talking to Mao and Mao says to him, &#8220;We&#8217;re not interested in your politics because we have our own ideological view of the world, and I don&#8217;t really care what our intelligence service reports about what&#8217;s going on in the west.&#8221; What he did not say, but what was quite clear because it became evident subsequently, particularly under Deng Xiaoping, was that the primary purpose of the Chinese intelligence machine outside China was to contribute to the economic rebuilding of China.<\/p><p>We in the West have been, over a longish period of time, pretty naive and had forgotten the fundamental dangers of having a close relationship with China. I am not anti-Chinese or a cold warrior. I understand&#8212;and this is the complexity that lies at the heart of this legislation&#8212;that our economies in the West are tied to China&#8217;s. They are intertwined in a manner that did not exist during the cold war between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. Of course there were economic links with the Soviets but essentially the relationship was one of separation. But that is not the case any longer. We are intimately engaged with the Chinese economy. Our enthusiasm&#8211;&#8211;I am using &#8220;our&#8221; in the broadest sense of the West&#8217;s enthusiasm&#8211;&#8211;to trade with China and to have a close relationship and to build that relationship is thoroughly understandable, but in the process we have let down our guard and we have been extremely laissez-faire, as it were, in our attitude towards the commercial threat from China.<\/p><p>I remember very well on one of my visits to the far east, when I was coming out of China through Hong Kong, talking to a British lawyer who had been head of a legal office in Shanghai for a long time. He said, &#8220;Richard, you have got to understand one thing about the Chinese attitude to us: they don&#8217;t understand win-win. All they understand is &#8216;We win, you lose.&#8217;&#8221; However intimate and successful your relations with China may be economically, if you are too successful, you can absolutely guarantee that the Chinese will transfer  that success to themselves in their own economic structures, having allowed you to run successfully for a period of time.<\/p><p>What we now know and understand is that the Chinese are highly organised and strategic in their attitude towards the West and towards us. For example, some of the thousands of Chinese students who are being educated in Western universities, particularly in the UK and the United States, are unquestionably organised and targeted in terms of subjects&#8211;&#8211;I am thinking more about graduates, PhDs and post-docs&#8211;&#8211;looking at areas of strategic interest to the Chinese economy, and they are organised by Chinese intelligence.<\/p><p>We need to conduct our relationship with China with much more wisdom and care. The Chinese understand us incredibly well. They have put their leadership through our universities for 20 or 30 years. We in comparison hardly know anything about China because we just do not have that depth of knowledge and experience. You have people such as Charlie Parton and many wonderful Chinese scholars who understand intimately, in particular, the workings of the Chinese state, but they are rare individuals who are now massively in demand in trying to educate people about the problem that we have on our hands.<\/p><p>I am not one who is saying that we have to hold China at arm&#8217;s length. It is impossible to do that because they are so intimately involved in our economy, but we have to understand where we restrict their access, where we control their access and where we do not allow them to build strategic positions at our expense and literally take us for a ride. If you go back a little way, we were incredibly naive about this, which accounts for the position we got into with Huawei. It was completely ridiculous that we should even have been considering Huawei to build our 5G. That is probably why you called me. I was heavily involved in lobbying MPs through these various structures. I am delighted that the Government have now taken a grip on this issue.<\/p>",

I am anti-party, as anybody should be if they saw what it does in places like Xinjiang or Hong Kong. I am not anti-Chinese. I think the Chinese Communist party itself deliberately muddies the waters on that one and says, &#8220;You are anti-China,&#8221; when, actually, you are opposing the policies of the Chinese Communist party. That said, I began the session saying that we want investment from China, trade with China and good relations with China. China is a major player. This must not be a cold war. If America or China decides to pursue that, we must try to avoid it.<\/p><p>I always talk about the holy trinity of national security, UK interests and UK values. We should establish those with the Chinese and say, &#8220;Sorry, those are non-negotiable. Just as you sometimes come and say, &#8216;These are our core interests and we are not negotiating them,&#8217; we have the right to do that too.&#8221; But beyond that, we want open trading relations and open investment relations. What is wrong with China buying London Taxis International? Nothing. If it wants to invest and that is mutually beneficial, great.<\/p><p>We want an open China as much as possible. We certainly want a much more level playing field than there is at the moment. China runs a series of negative lists and there is much on them, particularly in the area of services, which we would want opened up. We must press for that in conjunction with the Americans, the EU, Australia and all the other democracies that wish to trade with China. In many ways, that is in China&#8217;s interest. It is certainly in the interests of its people. A closed market, with China just relying on its own consumption&#8212;it is a big market&#8212;is not going to be good for China any more than it is good for us. I fully go along with that. I do not think we should be anti-China in any circumstances. That is, in a sense, racist. We should be anti-Communist party, or certain against its policies, but with the Chinese people, and in trading, we should maintain a perfectly normal relationship.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a164.2\/1\">I beg to move,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a164.2\/2\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">That this House has considered the future of the aviation industry.<\/p><p pid=\"a164.2\/3\">It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Sir Edward. Before I start my remarks, I offer my congratulations to the Minister on his recent appointment. He was a very good member of the Select Committee and he is a very welcome addition to this role, even if the challenges he faces in it are pretty big at the moment. I wish him well.<\/p><p pid=\"a164.2\/4\">The aviation industry is a vital part of our economy. It employs&#8212;or rather it did employ&#8212;hundreds of thousands of people around the country. It is an essential part of regional economies, which is why we see colleagues from around the United Kingdom here today, and it provides vital connections from the United Kingdom around the world. Today, it is a sector on its knees. Last weekend, I cast a quick glance at the Plane Finder app that some of us have on our phones. That afternoon, there were three aircraft in the air over the south of England&#8212;just three aircraft, and one of those was en route from France to the United States.<\/p><p pid=\"a164.2\/5\">That is a disaster for this country. It is a disaster for all the staff and airline personnel who have lost their jobs, a disaster for the airport services companies and all their people, and a disaster for the suppliers to the industry, such as the catering services firms and the construction workers, who should be preparing to work on capital investment projects at our airports in the coming months but capital budgets have evaporated. They now face a bleak year ahead. The entire future  of individual UK airlines is now under threat, and of course there is the broader issue of the impact on the aerospace sector as a whole.<\/p><p pid=\"a164.2\/6\">We all accept that there was no way this pandemic could have passed without a major impact on aviation, but taking every step we can to mitigate that impact has been, should be, and must now be a national priority. However, as a loyal supporter of the Government who is sympathetic to them about the challenge they are trying to deal with, I must say that it does not feel like that at the moment. Public Health England, for example, produced what can only be described as highly questionable figures to justify the current restrictions. Only a couple of weeks ago, a Government Minister told the House of Lords that it is the view of the chief medical officer that travel is not a priority.<\/p><p pid=\"a164.2\/7\">Although I really do understand the huge challenges that our medical community is facing, and they are doing a fantastic job in dealing with this pandemic, I fundamentally disagree with their view on this point about the sector. I urge the Government to change tack, to make at least the start of the reopening of our aviation sector an absolute priority and to use all the  tools at their disposal to do so. That does not mean a mass opening of borders overnight, nor an instant return to mass holidays, but it does mean making a rapid move to restart key economic routes and to allow the return of travel without unnecessary restrictions to low-risk destinations.<\/p><p pid=\"a164.2\/8\">The first key step that must be taken is to replicate what other countries are doing on testing. The current UK rules are simply too restrictive for low-risk destinations. I very much hope that the reports in the media about a reduction of the two-week quarantine rules are correct, but a decision to travel that still includes a period of several days when someone cannot leave their home, makes an important business trip, a short family holiday or a visit to an elderly relative in another country extremely difficult. Other countries are not asking for the same period of isolation.<\/p><p pid=\"a164.2\/9\">I applaud my right hon. Friend the Health Secretary for the work he has done in expanding our test capabilities to the extent he has; it has been a phenomenal achievement and he deserves huge personal credit for that expansion. We have now by far the largest testing capability and the broadest range of testing capacity in Europe&#8212;well done. But if we can test the whole population of Liverpool quickly and effectively, why can we not open a handful of key economic routes quickly using those same technologies?<\/p><p pid=\"a164.2\/10\">Why can we not reopen routes to New York and Washington, for example, setting aside the quarantine rules for those people who travel those routes and test negatively? Those are blue-chip routes for our industry; they deliver the highest level of profits and they are particularly vital for our economy. Are we really going to be putting the health of the country at risk by introducing the same kind of test rules that exist in other countries today and putting the same measures  in place for those key routes?<\/p><p pid=\"a164.2\/11\">Sir Edward, you or I could fly to Madeira tomorrow, taking with us a 72-hour-old test certificate. We would be allowed to enter the country freely, travel around and enjoy our visit. There is not a massive epidemic of the virus in Madeira. Why can we not apply the same rules for those key international destinations here?<\/p><p pid=\"a164.2\/12\">The industry is starting to take steps itself. Heathrow airport, for example, is now providing travel to destinations such as Hong Kong, Cairo, Bahrain, the Seychelles, Japan, Italy and South Africa and pre-departure testing at the airport. The average turnaround time for test results is 67 minutes, and travellers have a certificate they can take with them to prove they have tested negative that same day.<\/p><p pid=\"a164.2\/13\">British Airways is showing how it could be done on transatlantic routes by starting voluntary testing on key routes to the United States. Why not make those approaches official? Does anybody seriously think that that would be a less effective way of screening for risk than the current system, when it is patently clear, I am afraid, that many people are not following the self-isolation rules anyway? Allowing testing and restriction-free entry to the UK for those with negative results could unlock key routes and start the long rebuild of this vital industry.<\/p><p pid=\"a164.2\/14\">I am not going to speak for long because many people want to contribute, but my message to the Minister is very simple; I also have one for the industry itself.   Introducing airport testing and accepting a risk-based approach&#8212;which all the evidence suggests is low&#8212;is the easiest way to rebuild confidence in the airline industry and save jobs. That is the crucial piece: ultimately, the issue is about the welfare and employment of our fellow citizens. It is vital that we do this. Are we really going to continue to stand aside while entire airports risk closure and entire airlines risk disappearing? We have to act, and act now.<\/p><p pid=\"a164.2\/15\">There is another issue for us as a Government and a nation. The first of January marks our first day outside the ambit of the European Union. The transition period will have ended and the post-Brexit world will begin&#8212;whatever the result of the negotiations. On the first day of global Britain, will there really be only three planes in the sky over the south-east of England? Will our global hub airport, and airports such as Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Bristol, Belfast, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Cardiff, all be operating at a tiny fraction of their capacity? These are our global connections and have to be back in place for Britain in a global world post Brexit. For the sake of our economy, jobs and future role in that post-Brexit world, my message to Ministers is to make airport testing, and the flexibility that should come with it, the urgent priority that it should be.<\/p><p pid=\"a164.2\/16\">One final word for the industry is that recovery must come and we have to do everything we can to make sure that it does, but it has to come with an eye for the future. I want to see that Plane Finder app full again, but aviation must rebuild with a focus on the environment as well. There is no magic technology solution that will make it a net-zero sector by 2050, although I welcome today&#8217;s announcements about support for improved technology in the sector.<\/p><p pid=\"a164.2\/17\">I am hopeful that, before too long, hydrogen will power some short-haul planes, that all airports will have electric and hydrogen vehicles on their entire premises and that new technology for engines will continue to bring down emissions. I also believe that the industry needs to strengthen its offsetting strategy further to reduce its environmental impact. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, or CORSIA, was a start, but is a long way from what is needed and is too remote a concept for consumers starting to worry about whether they can, or should, fly in the future. That is a big item on the agenda for the industry.<\/p><p pid=\"a164.2\/18\">Immediately and over the next few weeks, the priority has to be getting planes flying again; the environmental strategy is a challenge we should be thinking about now, but the priority is that. That first task lies with the Government. My message to the Minister, to the great team at my old Department and particularly to the Department of Health is that we need airport testing and a regime that allows the industry to start to recover. Quarantine is killing it, and it will kill the first few months of global Britain. Things have to change, and they have to start changing right now.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a270.0\/1\">It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"David Johnston\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25924\">the Member for Wantage (David Johnston)<\/phrase> and also to recall the axis of evil. He mentions that things have moved on, but I challenge that and say that those countries that were part of that axis of evil are still threats today. Some of us were warning about the likes of China and Russia back in 2000, so I believe that the world is becoming a far more dangerous place. We have an increased number of threats rather than fewer, which is why this Bill is so fundamentally important. We need to have national security as our watchword. I know that this Government understand that perfectly well, so, as well as encouraging new investment into Britain, we need to increase the security and safety of British interests from hostile actors.<\/p><p pid=\"a270.0\/2\">The Bill will give the Government new powers to block mergers and acquisitions when they are national security risks. It will also introduce an extension of screening powers to include assets and intellectual property as well as companies.<\/p><p pid=\"a270.0\/3\">Why is this Bill so necessary? There is no doubt that foreign direct investment is vital to the UK economy. In the past 10 years, over 600,000 new jobs have been created from more than 16,000 FDI projects and $750 billion have flowed into the UK as a result of FDI. Foreign direct investment is overwhelmingly a good thing. As a Conservative, I am greatly anticipating throwing open our doors to global inward investment as we exit the Brexit transition period. I support unrestricted international trade and, for me, attracting investment into Britain is one of the most exciting things about leaving the European Union. Let me make this clear: leaving the European Union allows us to increase investment in this country, and it will be better economically for all of us.<\/p><p pid=\"a270.0\/4\">However, we cannot be naive about the threat that certain regimes pose for the United Kingdom. They exert their influence by taking over companies in strategic areas and increasing our dependency on their products and services, limiting our independence and stifling our dissent in the process. We cannot overthrow the shackles of the European Union only for hostile powers to come over and take over the jewels in the British crown. That is not acceptable.<\/p><p pid=\"a270.0\/5\">Members will know well that one of my political interests is the combating of the malign influence of the People&#8217;s Republic of China. The Government demonstrated strong leadership earlier this year by banning Huawei from Britain&#8217;s 5G infrastructure. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Anthony Mangnall\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25868\">the Member for Totnes (Anthony Mangnall)<\/phrase>, who is no longer in his place, who helped the Government to come to the realisation of these malign influences. However, despite Huawei&#8217;s weak protestations of independence from the Chinese Communist party, western politicians and companies know the price of conducting business in the PRC. A mainland Chinese telecom company, founded by a former People&#8217;s Liberation Army officer, has no chance of avoiding Beijing&#8217;s meddling, especially when the company in question is playing a central role in critical western infrastructure.<\/p><p pid=\"a270.0\/6\">The same can be said of TikTok, a Chinese-owed app, which has enjoyed explosive growth in the west among teenagers. It is not all fun and games though, with the company being accused of having close links with the Chinese regime and of gathering data on our young people. Indeed, we heard from representatives of TikTok on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee a couple of weeks ago, and we heard their protestations saying that they had no connection almost and that they were not passing over data. However, how can that be true when TikTok is owned by China&#8212;a state that is naturally hostile to human rights and many other aspects?<\/p><p pid=\"a270.0\/7\">There are very real fears that the Chinese state is using its economic influence to weaken our Government, sow discord in our societies and extend its surveillance network in our lives. Let us be honest, it is not just in Britain that we see China act in such a way. We have seen it act across the middle east and into Africa as well. We are not the only country over which China is trying to extend its influence and it is great that this Bill will go some way to stop that influence and protect our national infrastructure. I am pleased that the Bill takes such a strong stance.<\/p><p pid=\"a270.0\/8\">Huawei and TikTok should act as a cautionary tale to us for the future. The PRC&#8217;s unforgivable actions in Hong Kong, an autonomous territory, against the Uyghurs, a distinct and proud people, and against the Christians in China show us that Beijing cannot play by the rules and we cannot rely on them to look after our best interests.<\/p><p pid=\"a270.0\/9\">However, the PRC is not the only regime about which we must worry. I do not need to remind Members of the threat posed by Russia and Iran and other despotic dictatorships. My priority is the protection of the British national interest and the safety of UK citizens. As the UK&#8217;s current powers to oversee foreign investment date from legislation in 2002, new primary legislation is needed to bring the UK Government&#8217;s powers up to date. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wantage said, much  has changed over the past 20 years and therefore these new powers must take into account new threats and technological, economic and geopolitical changes. The Government must have powers to intervene effectively and efficiently to protect the UK.&#160;Furthermore, to be an effective and trustworthy ally to our friends and partners around the world, we must bring our powers into line with theirs. Australia, Japan and the United States have already taken action in this area, and we must not be left behind, because if we are, our businesses and our infrastructure will be ripe for the picking for these malign regimes.<\/p><p pid=\"a270.0\/10\">This Bill means that we can continue to work on bringing investment to our shores, boosting GDP and creating jobs as we recover from the coronavirus while defending ourselves against those who threaten the safety of the British people and the UK&#8217;s sensitive assets. I expect Members in all parts of the House to support this crucial piece of legislation, which will ensure that we are prepared for the challenges and the threats of the future, because the world is not a safe place and there are many countries and regimes that want to do us down. We will always stand with the British people and with British business to protect our interests.<\/p>",

I agree with the Chancellor that financial services are fundamental to Britain&#8217;s economic strength. However, I recommend that anyone looking to assess their future ignore the hype in the Chancellor&#8217;s statement&#8212;he seems to have drunk the moonshot Kool-Aid&#8212;and look at reality. Our failure to negotiate mutual recognition, or at least equivalence-plus, with the EU is a serious problem. If only the Government had taken as much interest in this area as they do in fishing or, as Catherine McGuinness of the City of London Corporation is quoted as saying in today&#8217;s Times, finance risks being<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1119.0\/2\">&#8220;the neglected child of an acrimonious divorce&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b1119.0\/3\">Over &#163;1 trillion in assets have already transferred from the UK to the EU. Last year, Ministers seemed to think that half the financial services business with EU clients, which is about 15% of total UK financial services, had left or was in the process of leaving, including swathes of insurance and asset management. Is 15% still the number, I ask the Minister? The size of these asset transfers suggests that the actuality is well above those expectations. Job transfers are unclear because of Covid, but we do know that, even in 2019, the recruitment of graduates who do not have EU passports had pretty much collapsed for anything except retail banking.<\/p><p pid=\"b1119.0\/4\">The EU, which I once thought had a 10-year strategy to remove, slice by slice, most EU and euro-related financial services back to the 27, seems to have accelerated that programme. For example, Mr Dombrovskis has cautioned EU businesses to shift a significant portion of their clearing activity out of the UK in the next 18 months. Without dominance in clearing euro-denominated derivatives, the UK&#8217;s global role is seriously at risk. Does the Minister agree?<\/p><p pid=\"b1119.0\/5\">On fintech, many firms have made it clear that they will have to move EU business if we cannot agree on the rules that govern data. Where are negotiations on this, because at the last look they were pretty dire, with the UK determined to please the United States by watering down data protection?<\/p><p pid=\"b1119.0\/6\">I am delighted that we are finally going to issue a green sovereign. We may be a leader in green finance now, but every single significant financial centre is committed to the green agenda. I note that the EU is expected to issue &#8364;200 billion in green bonds as part of its Covid recovery fund, none of which will be issued through London. But will the Government replace the Green Investment Bank? The noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, mentioned it; it was sold off in part because, along with the British Business Bank, it was associated with Vince Cable, but that was also a deliberate act of environmental vandalism. Will it be replaced?<\/p><p pid=\"b1119.0\/7\">We are entering a period of regional economic blocs. The United States has actively repatriated a great deal of dollar financial services. China and Asia generally, contrary to the expectations of George Osborne, are using Hong Kong and Singapore rather than London, even with all the disruption in Hong Kong. India is developing Mumbai, so I caution the Government not to misread the potential of dialogue with India. We are now outside all the regional blocs. We have capacity and skills in financial services, but everyone else has the clients and issues the major currencies. You can move capacity and skills, but you cannot move the clients. London will remain a global centre but, I fear, one of gradually less significance. Will the Government give us a reality check on the future of this crucial industry and a proper assessment of the damage that their hard-line Brexit is delivering?<\/p>",

Last year, we laid the Ship Recycling (Facilities and Requirements for Hazardous Materials on Ships) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 to ensure that legislation in this area would remain legally operable once the UK had withdrawn from the EU. The agreement on the UK&#8217;s withdrawal from the EU includes a protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland to address the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland. A provision in article 5(4) of the protocol and annex 2 specify that certain provisions of EU law will apply in respect of Northern Ireland. The EU ship recycling regulation is one such provision listed in the protocol and, as a consequence, will have some effect on ship recycling facilities in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p pid=\"d833.1\/4\">The EU ship recycling regulation transposed key parts of the Hong Kong convention on the recycling of ships into EU law. The provisions apply to ship recycling facilities in the EU and to EU flagged ships above 500 gross tonnes. The main provisions of the EU regulation have applied since <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-12-31\">31 December<\/phrase> 2018 and include rules about authorising and permitting ship recycling facilities, requirements needed for the EU to record a facility on its list of approved facilities&#8212;the European list&#8212;and a requirement that all EU flagged ships must be recycled at an approved ship recycling facility, according to a certified ship recycling plan.<\/p><p pid=\"d833.1\/5\">The EU regulation also requires that all new EU flagged ships must carry a valid inventory of hazardous materials and that existing EU flagged ships and ships registered to non-EU countries calling at European ports must carry an inventory of hazardous materials by the end of 2020. Under the 2019 regulations, EU flagged ships would need to use an approved ship recycling facility on a United Kingdom list of approved facilities instead of the EU&#8217;s list. The 2019 regulations also ensure that necessary functions of the EU Commission are transferred to the Secretary of State.<\/p><p pid=\"d833.1\/6\">The draft regulations will amend the 2019 regulations made under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, which in turn amended the retained EU ship recycling regulation and the Ship Recycling Facilities Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015, to make two substantive changes. First, the regulations amend provisions that affect ship recycling facilities in Northern Ireland to reflect our obligations under the Northern Ireland protocol. In particular, the regulations will<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"d833.1\/7\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;require the joint competent authority for ship recycling facilities in Northern Ireland to notify the Secretary of State of any change of circumstances&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"d833.1\/8\">concerning their facilities. The Secretary of State must<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"d833.1\/9\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;notify the European Commission of any change of status regarding ship recycling facilities in Northern Ireland&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"d833.1\/10\">and the regulations prevent ship recycling facilities in Northern Ireland that are not on the European Union list of approved facilities from recycling EU-flagged vessels.  The impact of the protocol means that existing arrangements for those facilities will remain the same after the implementation phase.<\/p>",

Should the UK Parliament have exclusive ability to legislate for a subsidy control regime once the United Kingdom  ceases to follow EU state aid rules, without including the possibilities of hidden subsidies, for example through research and development? In these circumstances, I am not arguing at this late hour about whether the Prime Minister will achieve a deal, as the case may be, or whether we will have to abide by WTO rules. Either way, I ask your Lordships that research and development subsidies, hidden or not, be included in the Bill to provide much needed safeguards.<\/p><p pid=\"b936.4\/3\">I made my maiden speech in the European Parliament on this subject in 1989, stressing the danger of allowing covert research and development subsidies to creep into state aid legislation before 1992, so that it did not come to stand for<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b936.4\/4\">&#8220;not the birth but the death of free competition.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b936.4\/5\">This was the possible abuse of state aid and member states feather-bedding their own industries.<\/p><p pid=\"b936.4\/6\">Leon Brittan was our United Kingdom commissioner in charge at the time. He did a magnificent job. We worked together for the United Kingdom on the distortion of French and Italian bids hiding behind state aid to our disadvantage. We abided by the rules but we lost. Cossor Electronics, a UK company in Harlow, was bidding for the air traffic control contract for the Hong Kong airport. We suspected that their bids went through research and development projects; make of it as you will, it was wrong. At this instance, we felt the hideous effects of distorted competition when the EU integration process had hardly begun. That is why I ask your Lordships to support these amendments: to have research and development incorporated into this Bill now, regardless of our EU position, to safeguard unfair state aid in any future international contracts. I beg to move.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b906.0\/1\">My Lords, I apologise that I was unable to participate in the Second Reading debate. Many noble Lords this evening have set out with great power and authority the legal, constitutional and moral objections to this Bill. My purpose in speaking is to take a slightly different tack&#8212;which may be a good thing at this point in the debate&#8212;and to look at the operational damage that Clauses 42 and 47 of this Bill, if enacted, would do to the effectiveness of our foreign policy.<\/p><p pid=\"b906.0\/2\">I do that on the basis of 40 years of experience representing this country as a British diplomat. I know at first hand that Britain has been widely respected around the world as the country that evolved the concept of parliamentary democracy and the rule of law and has played such a formative part in developing the body of international law as we now have it, from the Geneva conventions on the laws of war to the International Criminal Court.<\/p><p pid=\"b906.0\/3\">My point is that this is more than an issue of the country&#8217;s reputation. Our power of example has strengthened our powers of influence in the world. It has given our country the authority to demand that other countries uphold their international obligations. It is part of the reason, for example, that Britain has been able to play such a leading role in the UN Security Council in crafting countless resolutions, holding to account those who break their international commitments and often imposing sanctions on them.<\/p><p pid=\"b906.0\/4\">As other noble Lords have said, we are now standing on the cusp of a new American presidency, with a President-elect who is a passionate believer in the rule of law and in resolving disputes between countries  through agreement. There is a great deal of important work that we can do together. An early priority with the Biden Administration should be to bring Iran back into compliance with the agreement it signed with the US, the UK and others in 2015. But how can we preach to Iran what we do not practise at home? It would be the worst possible start to the British partnership with a Biden Administration intent on rebuilding institutions of the rule of law if the Government now plough ahead with Part 5 even after Mr Biden has explicitly warned of the dangers. In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Hoey, this is not about pleasing a new US President; it is about effective co-operation with a country that is now, once again, intent on helping to resolve the world&#8217;s problems through international agreement.<\/p><p pid=\"b906.0\/5\">I conclude with a specific illustration of the collateral damage I believe would result from keeping these clauses in the Bill&#8212;damage that goes far beyond the issue of Northern Ireland or even the UK and the EU. I invite noble Lords to come with me across the road to the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s grand office on King Charles Street and to imagine that he summoned the Chinese ambassador to upbraid him on his Government&#8217;s crackdown in Hong Kong on fundamental freedoms. The Foreign Secretary would tell the ambassador: &#8220;This is a flagrant breach of the international agreement China signed with Britain in 1984 to uphold Hong Kong&#8217;s way of life for 50 years.&#8221; The ambassador might well say: &#8220;I agree; this is a breach of international law in a limited and specific way, but be reassured, Foreign Secretary, it is perfectly legal in our domestic law. The National People&#8217;s Congress has legislated to repudiate parts of that 1984 agreement. That is our sovereign right.&#8221; How is the Foreign Secretary to respond if these clauses stand part of this Bill and become law? Every other Foreign Secretary would have said &#8220;pacta sunt servanda&#8221;, and he would have had centuries of British practice behind him to give that weight. What would the current Foreign Secretary be able to say if this became law? &#8220;Pacta sunt servanda when it suits us&#8221; does not have quite the same ring.<\/p><p pid=\"b906.0\/6\">For the sake of Britain&#8217;s effectiveness in repairing a rules-based international system grievously damaged over the last four years, in addition to all the other powerful arguments that have been advanced this evening, I shall be voting tonight with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Judge, so that Clauses 42 to 47 do not stand part of this Bill.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a754.1\/1\">My Lords, I shall speak to the amendment to the Motion in my name. As far as I know, I have not had coronavirus. What I do know is that whether I live or die is neither here nor there. In the grand scheme of things, though, whether parliamentary democracy survives and thrives is an entirely different question. That does matter, not just to all of us privileged to serve in the mother of Parliaments. It also matters to a totalitarian regime whose evident aspirations for domination depend on democracy&#8217;s demise. The totalitarian regime to which I refer is, of course, that of the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP. For that regime&#8217;s value system to succeed, ours must fail.<\/p><p pid=\"a754.1\/2\">As Lord Sumption and others have made clear, coronavirus has caused democracy to be placed under threat. The threat stems not just from the CCP&#8217;s military expansion and its aggression in, for example, Nepal and the South China Sea, nor in the corrosive cynicism of the retrospective application of new laws of repression in Hong Kong, but also from the growing popular disenchantment with the ability of democratic Governments to strike the right balance, to which my noble friend Lord Forsyth of Drumlean referred in his excellent speech, between saving lives and saving livelihoods during a pandemic which originated in Wuhan.<\/p><p pid=\"a754.1\/3\">I do not intend to rehearse the points made so eloquently by my noble friends Lord Robathan, Lady Noakes and Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, with which I agree. Naturally, most people are focused on  the impact on their families and friends, but we can be sure that Big Brother is watching us. I do not mean our own state, although it is increasingly intruding on and controlling every aspect of our lives. I refer of course to Xi Jinping, the head of the CCP and of the world&#8217;s most repressive, surveillance-obsessed and threatening totalitarian regime. He may not be watching today&#8217;s debate in your Lordships&#8217; House, but we can be sure that he will be watching and analysing the signals that we and the other place send. It is therefore worth reflecting on whether the messages that we are conveying highlight the strength of parliamentary democracy in the face of crisis or show panic, disarray and weakness.<\/p><p pid=\"a754.1\/4\">I wish this were simply about tackling a dreadful, devastating and deadly virus. Unfortunately, what is at stake is so much more significant than any of our lives: it is the future of western democracy itself. That is why we cannot afford to signal that we are panicking or weak. Consider this: if one wanted cynically to expose the fault lines of western democracy, there could scarcely be a better way to do so than to allow a vicious virus to engulf the globe and plunge it into poverty. That is what we are facing.<\/p><p pid=\"a754.1\/5\">We cannot afford to be in this situation again. We cannot afford, as Theresa May said in the other place only a few hours ago, for it to look as if the figures are chosen to support the policy rather than the policy being based on figures. That is the path to mistrust and cynicism. If we really want to save Christmas, we need to save people&#8217;s livelihoods. If we want to save the NHS, we need to ensure that we safeguard the tax revenues that are so crucial to funding it.<\/p><p pid=\"a754.1\/6\">I am not saying this is necessarily the case, but I am saying it is essential that we entertain the awful possibility that a totalitarian regime capable of incarcerating in concentration camps millions of its Muslim Uighur population and harvesting their organs, capable of turning disputed rocky outcrops in the South China Sea into fortified islands and capable of turning the bastion of freedom that was Hong Kong into a police state is surely capable of allowing perhaps the most potent threat that western democracies have faced in the last 30 years to spread until it was too late.<\/p><p pid=\"a754.1\/7\">The Government do not know best and noble Lords should resist any suggestion that they do, especially at a time of crisis.<\/p>",

Member for Southampton, Test tempted her to pursue. I am absolutely sure that she not only understands exactly where I am coming from but is entirely with me. The question is whether she can bring me with her in the direction that we want this Bill to go, rather than come from. Everything she said only emphasised the value of bringing something more concrete to the clause. We are in wide agreement on almost every single issue, except the important net increase of one letter that I am hoping for.<\/p><p>I hope the Minister will reflect on some of the thoughts that I offered, particularly on the vital notion that nature and humans do not need to be in conflict. I was brought up partly in east Africa, and I have seen over my lifetime how the occasional obsession with trying to separate the role and the perfection of the environment from the role and desires of the humans living in and beside it can cause conflict unless people work hard to realise that the two can go together very well. We have seen in the most successful environmental schemes around the world how effective that can be; whether in the marshlands to the north of Hong Kong, or in the wildlife protected in India and Africa. The same can be done here, in our own country. There are opportunities to pursue, and in that spirit I hope my hon.

            "body": "<p pid=\"a157.0\/1\">My Lords, it is a tremendous honour to be able to contribute to this important debate, and to follow the noble Baroness, Lady Young. I add my congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Sikka, on his excellent maiden speech.<\/p><p pid=\"a157.0\/2\">I will start by thanking all those&#8212;both Members and staff of this House&#8212;who have been so kind with their time and generous in welcoming me to this place. In particular, I thank my two introducers, my noble friend Lord Arbuthnot, who 15 years ago took me under his wing when he was chair of the Defence Select Committee and I a new member, and my noble friend Lord Randall. I must say that ours was a slightly less cordial first meeting when I was a very junior Member of Parliament and he a very senior Whip. After what, frankly, could only be described as a good dinner with fellow new MPs, I found myself coerced into being a rebel Teller on the Crossrail Bill, which was something of a surprise to the Whips. We all know that Whips do not like surprises but, to my noble friend&#8217;s credit, his only concern was not that I was rebelling but that I knew what I was doing and did not make a fool of myself in the Chamber of the House of Commons&#8212;and we have been firm friends ever since. It was fun, but government Whips can rest easy; I might wait a couple of weeks before trying the same thing here.<\/p><p pid=\"a157.0\/3\">I confess that I was rather hoping to be able to give my maiden speech on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-11-05\">5 November<\/phrase>. Fifteen years ago&#8212;exactly 400 years after the Gunpowder Plot&#8212;I became the first fireworks manufacturer to be elected to Parliament. My family firm, sadly now sold, was founded by my father, the Reverend Lancaster&#8212;to some an eccentric cleric, to me my dad, and to the industry affectionately known as the &#8220;Master Blaster Pastor&#8221;. Noble Lords will have seen his fireworks at the Hong Kong handover, the London Olympics and, for many years, on New Year&#8217;s Eve here on the river. Alas, my date of <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-11-05\">5 November<\/phrase> was not to be. It appears that my arrival in this place has caused such concern that we may not be sitting next Friday, for fear that I will attempt to repeat the events of 1605.<\/p><p pid=\"a157.0\/4\">However, I offer noble Lords some reassurance that I come to this place with some useful skills. I am a qualified bomb disposal officer. I started my career in Hong Kong with the Queen&#8217;s Gurkha Engineers. I continue to serve after 32 years in the Army Reserve and I am very proud to be chairing the Reserve Forces 2030 review. I continue my links with the Brigade of Gurkhas as the deputy colonel commandant. It was perhaps my operational service in Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan that led me into politics. War is a terrible thing and it has left a lasting impression on me. I found myself agreeing with Winston Churchill that<\/p><p pid=\"a157.0\/5\">&#8220;Meeting jaw to jaw is better than war.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a157.0\/6\">That inspired me to stand for Parliament.<\/p><p pid=\"a157.0\/7\">There seems to be a tradition, in the Commons at least, of Ministers being appointed to a department for which they have little or no relevant experience. Perhaps I and my noble friend the Minister are exceptions to this rule; I was deeply honoured to be a Minister at the Ministry of Defence for five years, ending my time there as Minister for the Armed Forces. I challenge anyone not to be uplifted by spending time with our service men and women. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to all those who have made such a contribution to our nation.<\/p><p pid=\"a157.0\/8\">My wife, Caroline Dinenage, is Minister for Digital and Culture and a veteran now of some six departments. She always says to me that I am so lucky only to have served in one, and I always tell her that she is and always will be a far better Minister than I ever was.<\/p><p pid=\"a157.0\/9\">I am equally proud to have represented Milton Keynes for nearly 15 years, a wonderful city of wonderful people, all with a positive can-do attitude. In Milton Keynes it is rare, if ever, for a political party to have a majority, and this means a level of party-political co-operation rarely seen elsewhere. That is just the sort of approach and attitude that I intend to bring during my time in this place. Situated at the centre of the Oxford-Cambridge arc, Milton Keynes is an area of high growth that is in desperate need of new housing if it is to continue to attract skilled workers and to be the economic powerhouse it is.<\/p><p pid=\"a157.0\/10\">The measures before us today are a positive move by the Government, giving homeowners the freedom to extend their own homes as their families grow and for us to regenerate the brownfield areas of our towns and cities. There is just one area where I seek reassurance from the Minister: that the conversion of family homes into houses in multiple occupation will still require planning permission. As my noble friend knows, an excess of HMOs in any community brings with it a whole host of challenges worthy of an entirely separate debate in this Chamber.<\/p>",

This set out how we would fulfil our commitment to the British public to take back control of our borders by ending free movement and introducing a single, global immigration system. The Points-Based System will cater for the most highly skilled workers, skilled workers, students and a range of other specialist work routes including routes for global leaders in their field and innovators.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The changes to the Immigration Rules are a crucial part of the Future Points-Based Immigration System. They also introduce the new Hong Kong British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) route for a BN(O) citizen who wants to live and work in the UK and will extend the Afghan Interpreter ex-gratia scheme.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The rules also represent a significant further step in our commitment to simplify the rules, implementing many of the recommendations of the Law Commission to ensure we provide greater clarity to migrants, employers and all other users of the rules.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>At the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, free movement will end and newly arriving European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss citizens will come within the scope of the new global immigration system. These rules will generally commence between 1 December and 1 January, but EEA nationals will not be granted permission until after 1 January as they are able to rely on free movement right until then.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>I have set out in a separate document, attached, the details of the changes we are making to the Immigration Rules, which should be read together with this statement.<\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/qna.files.parliament.uk\/ws-attachments\/1245816\/original\/Immigration Rules detailed changes.pdf\">details of changes<\/a> (pdf, 179.0KB)<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c922.1\/1\">I am delighted to be speaking in this debate during Black History Month, as the first black Conservative MP on these Benches in 2005. It is great to look around the Chamber today, on both sides, because the complexion is new. Certainly on the Government Benches, every one of us is here based on hard work, merit and, yes, of course, a little bit of luck from time to time.<\/p><p pid=\"c922.1\/2\">When I was growing up in a single-parent household in south-east London, racism was pretty crude. It was in your face. It was insults, casual violence, and it was very direct and very physical, including being spat at on buses and all sorts of things. I never dreamt, back in those days, that there would be any opportunity to get to the law-making apparatus of our entire nation. What an amazing thing to achieve&#8212;I am sure that everyone here of any background and persuasion feels exactly the same, especially if they came from a challenging background.<\/p><p pid=\"c922.1\/3\">The beauty of this Chamber and the strength of our United Kingdom is its rich diversity. Our country and our Parliament have demonstrated the ability to evolve, adapt and integrate good people who share our values and aspirations. It also demonstrates that we reject beliefs and practices that run counter to our values and those that seek to undermine democracy, freedom of speech and the rule of law. But British history is long and diverse, and it is undeniable&#8212;Magna Carta, democracy, the agrarian and industrial revolutions, the uniting of our kingdom, free trade, the abolition of slavery, emancipation, the defeat of Hitler and fascism, freedom of speech and plurality of media, and, in recent days, thank goodness, race relations and equal opportunities.<\/p><p pid=\"c922.1\/4\">The constitution of our country consists of waves of people coming and going over millennia&#8212;Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, Normans, Flemings, Huguenots, Indians, Kenyans, Russians, and, in more recent times, Americans, Australians and&#8212;soon&#8212;Hong Kong Chinese. Let us face it: at some point in the past 12,000 years, every one of our ancestors was an immigrant to these islands. If anyone is daring enough to take a DNA test, they might make some interesting discoveries. They might discover that, actually, we are all related. If we go back 70,000 years, we discover that modern human beings are all from the same stock. Black history is as rich and varied a part of our history as Asian, Jewish, Chinese and Mediterranean history, and the history of sex, gender, sexual preference, disability and class. I am delighted to see that the contribution of non-white Brits is increasingly recognised across society, and Black History Month is a good opportunity to make those recognitions.<\/p><p pid=\"c922.1\/5\">We cannot erase uncomfortable parts of our history, but we can learn from them. As a former governor of the Museum of London, I am deeply conscious of the many and varied histories that run through the streets of London and flow through the veins of our nation, and it is important that these contributions and historical interactions between people across the globe are acknowledged in the teaching of history and culture. As every teacher will know, timetables are tight, so this is a good time to reflect on whether we have the right balance of lessons in the context of our history and of the composition of present day Britain. History should not be whitewashed, but it should also not be blackwashed. Acknowledging black histories in schools should not crowd out other histories but highlight the rich diversity of all the histories that we share.<\/p><p pid=\"c922.1\/6\">So I add a little note of caution: it is all too easy to say that a single characteristic, such as skin colour, eclipses and overshadows everything else. It is all too easy to fall for the dangerous identity politics, where individuals are kettled into stereotypical communities, often for the benefit of self-appointed spokesmen and leaders. It is all too easy to focus on difference to generate a sense of grievance for political gain&#8212;I think we all recognise that&#8212;but I believe that what unites us as British citizens is far greater than what divides. So for me, Black History Month is a good time for reflection. I want us to live in a country where a person<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c922.1\/7\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"c922.1\/8\">and that goal is very much more within our reach than it was when I was a child in the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s. For me, black history is not about segregating communities or about the racist, dehumanising, infantilising politics of identity; it is about recognising different histories and  embracing our common humanity as equal citizens today. With a solid adherence to our values, our culture will continue its subtle evolution. Consensual integration will arise on the gentle currents of myriad individual free choices.<\/p><p pid=\"c922.1\/9\">So let us celebrate the rich and evolving nature of our great nation. Let us celebrate those people of various heritages who have made it in mainstream life in Britain&#8212;including many of us in this Chamber today. Let us not forget where we were before the &#8217;70s and Bernie Grant. Before we made our changes here, this Chamber had a very different complexion. We have made huge advances. We have non-white people at the top of science, at the top of the media and at the top of scientific academies; we have the editor of Vogue. There are so many good examples&#8212;[Hon. Members: &#8220;The Minister!&#8221;] And the Minister&#8212;forgive me! We have so many examples of how far we have come, but I acknowledge that there is still further to go. Let us celebrate the rich and evolving nature of our great nation: one nation awash with difference but united on the foundations of democracy, free speech and equality under the law.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1343.0\/1\">My Lords, I would not dream of questioning the judgment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Judge, in matters of the law&#8212;of course I would not&#8212;but I would say that the rule of law, as a matter of principle, is as important to me as it is to any noble Lord, however learned. However, like many legal matters, it is a question of fact and degree. I am not a lawyer but I have been involved in enough litigation to know that two Silks of equal distinction can produce very different and equally persuasive arguments for or against almost any legal question that any of us could pose.<\/p><p pid=\"b1343.0\/2\">These things are not, as some would like to have us believe, black and white. Like everything in life, they come in shades of grey. To my father, as a newly qualified barrister in 1938, the invasion of Poland in 1939 was not grey; it was completely black and white. However, having sat through the debates in your Lordships&#8217; House in 2003, to me it was clear that many of the lawyers in this House came to a very different conclusion  about the legality of the invasion of Iraq from that reached by the Labour Government. To them, it was not black and white; it was a matter of opinion.<\/p><p pid=\"b1343.0\/3\">In terms of degree, my belief in the rule of law, which I consider to be probably the most important principle that we espouse, has not stopped me from time to time&#8212;I hang my head in shame today&#8212;parking on a double yellow line. I do not suppose that I am the only noble Lord to have broken the law at some time or another. It would be hypocritical of us not to admit that we can all be flexible when it suits us.<\/p><p pid=\"b1343.0\/4\">I share with others regret that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State made the statement in the other place that set this hare running. I do not know whether it has been suggested that the Government felt that that declaration from the Dispatch Box would provide some form of legal cover in the event that some remainer obsessive decided to run another case to the Supreme Court in the hope that that court would be prepared to compromise its reputation by indulging in another political judgment.<\/p><p pid=\"b1343.0\/5\">It is primarily a political and not a legal matter when a foreign power seeks in negotiating an agreement, supposedly entered into in good faith, to use that negotiation deliberately to interfere with the delicate relationship between the component parts of an independent nation state, such as those of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It is perfectly obvious that the European Commission very early on worked out that this was our Achilles heel, and has done its level best to exploit this for its own ends. That is not the conduct of a good neighbour and trading partner acting in good faith; that is the behaviour of someone who does not wish us well. It is in effect a trap, deliberately placed where it would do the most harm. But what Government, having spotted this trap, would continue to blunder on, rather than take whatever measures they could to avoid it? It is the Government&#8217;s duty to avoid a trap, almost at any cost, which is precisely what the Bill seeks to do.<\/p><p pid=\"b1343.0\/6\">A final point on the issue of national reputation: who is it, I wonder, who will think so much less of us for having ducked this punch, aimed as it was below our belt? For example, I am not very interested in China&#8217;s view of our trade arrangements with Northern Ireland, particularly in comparison with their behaviour towards Hong Kong. Nor will I take any lectures from Mr Putin about the rule of law. President Trump thinks we are mad not to have walked away from the EU years ago, and Mr Biden has already made his views&#8212;firmly in line with those of his Irish republican voters&#8212;clear, and there is no changing that. The current members of the EU obviously think the worst of us, and they always have done. But who cares?<\/p><p pid=\"b1343.0\/7\">I do business in South America and Africa, and no one I have ever met in either of those continents has the remotest interest in this squabble, but they would all love to do business with us. Our Commonwealth friends are not fooled by this stuff. Saudi Arabia and our allies in the Gulf share the same view as their new Israeli friends&#8212;that business is business, a view shared by our Pacific trading partners. If our reputation is harmed, I am struggling to see with whom.<\/p>",

Amendment 3 commits to Parliament having the same opportunities to scrutinise this issue as it does now in the specification of territories under the Extradition Act 2003. The addition or removal of any territory is by the affirmative procedure and, as I have emphasised throughout the passage of the Bill, any statutory instruments laid before Parliament are accompanied by Explanatory Memorandums, which set out both the legislative context and policy rationale.<\/p><p pid=\"a1116.3\/2\">Throughout this process, relevant officials are engaged in regular discussions with their counterparts in the devolved Administrations and law enforcement agencies, which operate across the UK to ensure the effectiveness of our extradition system. This system, which gives Parliament the opportunity to scrutinise such proposals and accept or reject them, has been in place for over 15 years and has proved effective and fit for purpose. The amendment ensures legislative consistency between the Bill and its parent Act, the Extradition Act 2003. There is no need for alternative provisions, and I hope  noble Lords will support the amendment, which the other place considered in detail and decided, on balance, to comprehensively support.<\/p><p pid=\"a1116.3\/3\">I will now address Amendment 4, made in the other place, to remove the amendment made here. This provides that the removal or addition of a country will take place under the existing process in the Extradition Act 2003, where multiple countries may be added or removed at once. The Bill is consistent with that legislation and any Government seeking to add countries in the future can do so only with the consent of Parliament.<\/p><p pid=\"a1116.3\/4\">Unnecessarily burdensome legislation is an inappropriate use of parliamentary time and resources, and the Government are under a duty to use proportionate systems to legislate. Any additions are dictated by the will of Parliament and, if Parliament does not agree that a country should be specified, the relevant regulations will be voted down in the normal way.<\/p><p pid=\"a1116.3\/5\">The Government are well aware of the importance of parliamentary support to continue or commence any extradition arrangements with new countries. Our arrangements with Hong Kong are a good recent example, and amendments tabled to the Bill in the other place demonstrated the strength of parliamentary feeling on the matter. Our extradition arrangements with Hong Kong have been suspended indefinitely and these events exemplify that this kind of parliamentary scrutiny is already highly effective. As with the previous amendment, we do not think there is any need for this provision in the Bill. I therefore ask noble Lords to support these amendments and I beg to move.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c1025.4\/1\">My Lords, we come now to Amendments 68 and 76A, which are being taken together. Amendment 76A supersedes Amendment 68 and takes into account remarks made by the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Grimstone, when we debated Amendment 33 on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-09-29\">29 September<\/phrase>. I am grateful to the Minister for meeting the noble Lord, Lord Blencathra, and me yesterday at a meeting attended by another Minister, Greg Hands MP, and Sir Iain Duncan Smith MP, but I also thank my noble friend Lady Falkner of Margravine and the noble Lords, Lord Adonis and Lord Forsyth, for being co-sponsors, and all noble Lords who will either speak today or who have indicated their willingness to support the proposition at later stages.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/2\">Thanks, too, to the founders of the Coalition for Genocide Response, Luke de Pulford and Ewelina Ochab, for their valiant efforts in driving this on. Particular thanks, though, to Members of another place for their supportive, bipartisan references to the amendment in their recent Westminster Hall debate entitled &#8220;China: Labour Programme in Tibet&#8221; and yesterday&#8217;s debate on Uighurs. The former leader of the Conservative Party, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, told the House that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1025.4\/3\">&#8220;should such a new clause come to the Commons, I will absolutely support it&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class=\"offrep\" id=\", Commons, 7\/10\/20; col. 119WH.]\"><i>Official Report<\/i>, Commons, 7\/10\/20; col. 119WH.]<\/phrase><\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/4\">In yesterday&#8217;s debate, triggered by 100,000 signatures sent in a petition to Parliament, Shabana Mahmood MP said that she hoped that her colleagues on the opposition Front Bench would back the amendment. In parenthesis, I should mention that I am an officer of the All-Party Parliamentary Groups on Uighurs, Tibet and Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/5\">It was back in March 2016 that the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, my noble friend Lady Cox and other noble Lords strongly supported an amendment responding to the unfolding genocide against Yazidis and other minorities in northern Syria and Iraq. The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, made a characteristically powerful intervention. The Government resisted the amendment and repeatedly told the House that genocide was a matter for the courts.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/6\">We did not leave it there, and the admirable Member for Congleton, Fiona Bruce MP, a lawyer, tabled a Motion in the Commons declaring those events to be a genocide, in line with the legal definition of genocide set out in the convention on the crime of genocide of 1948. Although the House of Commons passed it with overwhelming all-party support, the Government again resisted it, saying that only international courts could determine a genocide. This is a circular argument&#8212;indeed, a vicious circular argument.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/7\">The Government say that the International Criminal Court is the appropriate court of law, neglecting to add that a referral to it from the Security Council will almost always be resisted by the use of a veto by a permanent member. Does anyone seriously believe that the Chinese Communist Party would refer itself to the International Criminal Court to establish whether it had committed genocide in Xinjiang against Uighurs. Waiting for international institutions to act soundly is very commendable, but is a convenient fiction, especially for those who think it should just be business as usual.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/8\">What happens in this cycle of buck passing? Following the debate in 2016, it is estimated that 10,000 Yazidis were kidnapped or killed by Daesh, and approximately 3,000 Yazidi women and girls were forced into sexual slavery and are still missing. Many other minorities suffered similarly, as I heard and saw for myself when collecting evidence in northern Iraq a few months ago. For the past four years, Mrs Bruce and I have tabled genocide determination Bills to break the circle&#8212;and here, in this Bill, we have the opportunity to do just that.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/9\">So how would the provision work? During the debate in Committee on Tuesday <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-09-29\">29 September<\/phrase>, the noble Lord raised his concern that the continuity agreements do not involve trading partners who are  most likely to be the most serious abusers of human rights, and that a country such as China would not have been within the scope of the amendment. However, with the help of the Public Bill Office, to which I am grateful, Amendment 76A takes those points into account and, in summary, nullifies trade arrangements made under the Bill if the High Court of England makes a preliminary determination that they should be revoked on the ground that the proposed trade partner has perpetrated genocide.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/10\">I particularly draw the attention of the Committee to the words that such deals would be revoked if<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1025.4\/11\">&#8220;another signatory to the relevant agreement or any future trading partner that has hitherto traded with the UK, regardless of whether they have a formal trade agreement, has committed genocide under Article II of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, following an application to revoke the regulations on this ground from a person or group of persons belonging to a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, or an organisation representing such a group, which has been the subject of that genocide.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/12\">As for scope, the noble Baroness, Lady Chakrabarti, rightly insisted during the Committee proceedings last week that it is for Parliament, not government departments, to determine what falls within the scope of the Title of a Bill. Therefore, this amendment is in scope. However, another argument is now also being deployed. The amendment may be in scope, it says, but this is not the Bill in which to do it; this is not the right time or place. However, as Sir Iain points out, that is a standard line that he himself was told to deploy and use during all his years as a Minister. It is never the right time and never the right Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/13\">This is a convenient moment to remind the House of the promise given by a government Minister at the Dispatch Box of your Lordships&#8217; House at the conclusion of Report on the Telecommunications Infrastructure (Leasehold Property) Bill. Following speech after speech from all sides pointing to human rights violations in Xinjiang and the direct links of Huawei and the companies in supply chains that use slave labour, the Government agreed to rewrite an amendment on human rights violations and to bring it back at Third Reading. That Bill of course continues to be deferred, and it is no secret that the Government have been unable to draft the promised amendment. Hence, an opportunity is presented here for the Government to honour their promise and to use this vehicle not for the Christmas-tree purposes of hanging on it every issue under the sun but to meet an obligation entered into in Parliament and to act on an issue that enjoys bipartisan and bicameral support.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/14\">So how would this provision work in practice, and who might it affect? The key is that the court would decide whether there is enough evidence to justify a predetermination. The threshold is incredibly high. Furthermore, as my noble and learned friend Lord Hope of Craighead pointed out, if they so wished, the Government would have the right to have a contradictor present in the court to argue against such a predetermination. I thank my noble and learned friend for his invaluable advice, not least in pointing me to the High Court of England and Wales rather than the Supreme Court as the relevant body to make the predetermination.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/15\">Currently, the most obvious global contenders for predetermination are China and Burma for their crimes against Uighur and Rohingya Muslims. However, if state collaboration in countries such as Syria and Iraq against ethnic or religious minorities, such as the Yazidis, were proven, they too could fall within the terms of the amendment. However, we should be clear: the threshold is exacting, and the amendment will not stop any trade with any country until the High Court has made a preliminary determination that there is a prima facie case of genocide, with the Government able to deploy a contradictor in the court.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/16\">The crime of genocide&#8212;often described as the crime above all crimes&#8212;is carefully defined in the 1948 convention on the crime of genocide, to which the United Kingdom is a signatory. Article II of the convention states that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1025.4\/17\">&#8220;genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1025.4\/18\">(a) Killing members of the group;<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1025.4\/19\">(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1025.4\/20\">(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1025.4\/21\">(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1025.4\/22\">(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/23\">As a signatory to the convention, we are required to prevent genocide, to protect those affected by genocide and to punish those responsible. However, if no judicial authority declares a genocide to be under way, we are not obliged to act&#8212;hence the vicious circle.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/24\">The practical effect of that is illustrated by the Armenian genocide of 1914 to 1923. It is still unrecognised by the United Kingdom as a genocide. It involved the systematic mass murder and expulsion of 1.5 million ethnic Armenians carried out in Turkey and adjoining regions, and was referred to here in your Lordships&#8217; House only yesterday in the context of the current unfolding events in Nagorno-Karabakh. In an intervention last week, I reminded the House of Hitler&#8217;s infamous remark as he prepared the Final Solution: &#8220;Who now remembers the Armenians?&#8221; In yesterday&#8217;s debate in another place, Siobhain McDonagh, the MP for Mitcham and Morden, movingly said of Xinjiang:<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/25\">&#8220;If we look on, history will condemn our unforgivable cowardice and ask why those in power did not act.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Commons, 12\/10\/20; col. 40WH.]<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/26\">Increasingly, we might ask, &#8220;Who now remembers the Tibetans?&#8221;, and in the future will other perpetrators of genocide ask, &#8220;Who now remembers the Uighurs?&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/27\">Perhaps I may give another example of the vicious circle. The United Nations report into mass atrocities in North Korea, chaired by the eminent jurist Michael Kirby, a judge in Australia, described North Korea&#8212;a country I have visited, and I should declare that I am a co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for North Korea, which I founded&#8212;as &#8220;a state without parallel&#8221;. The report called for North Korea to be referred to the International Criminal Court. It has never happened because this of course would require a referral by the United Nations Security Council, where China would use its veto.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/28\">What sort of evidence would be laid before the High Court to short-circuit the vicious circle and to upend the impotence to which the cynical misuse of the veto and the subversion of United Nations agencies has led? During the debate on Amendment 33, we heard allegations from the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, about forced organ harvesting in China, targeting Falun Gong practitioners. We have heard many accounts from Xinjiang of forced labour, the removal of people from their homes and villages, the creation of what the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, described as concentration camps, the prevention of births, and the destruction of cemeteries, identity and culture. There are almost 400 prison camps in Xinjiang and more are being built. The Muslim faith and culture, language and identity are being obliterated and a surveillance state enforces compliance.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/29\">In August, the President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews stated in a letter to the Chinese Ambassador:<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/30\">&#8220;The World will neither forgive nor forget a genocide against the Uighur people&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/31\">noting<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1025.4\/32\">&#8220;the similarities between what is alleged to be happening in the People&#8217;s Republic of China today and what happened in Nazi Germany 75 years ago&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/33\">Having seen a video of shackled and blindfolded Uighur Muslims being led from trains to camps, Dominic Raab said this is<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1025.4\/34\">&#8220;reminiscent of something not seen for a long time.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/35\">Professor Adrian Zenz, a German scholar, describes it as<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1025.4\/36\">&#8220;the largest detention of an ethno-religious minority since World War II&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/37\">while Joanne Smith Finley, a Newcastle University academic, has described what she calls<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1025.4\/38\">&#8220;a slow, painful, creeping genocide.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/39\">The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has described the region as<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1025.4\/40\">&#8220;a massive internment camp shrouded in secrecy, a &#8216;no rights zone&#8217;, while members of the Xinjiang Uyghur minority, along with others who were identified as Muslim, were being treated as enemies of the State based on nothing more than their ethno-religious identity.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/41\">I urge noble Lords to read the harrowing testimony of Mihrigul Tursun, a Uighur who managed to escape, who says:<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/42\">&#8220;Each time I was electrocuted, my whole body would shake violently, and I could feel the pain in my veins. I thought I would rather die than go through this torture and begged them to kill me.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/43\">There are increasing reports of Uighurs being subjected to DNA tests, and there is significant suspicion that they have been targeted for forced organ donation and biometric surveillance.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/44\">Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, in the final judgment of his independent tribunal into forced organ harvesting in China, concluded:<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/45\">&#8220;Forced organ harvesting has been committed for years throughout China on a significant scale &#8230; Falun Gong practitioners have been one&#8212;and probably the main&#8212;source of organ supply &#8230; crimes against humanity against the Falun Gong and &#8230; Uyghur &#8230; had &#8230; been proved beyond reasonable doubt&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/46\">On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-10-06\">6 October<\/phrase>, 39 countries issued a joint statement on the human rights situation in Xinjiang at the United Nations General Assembly Third Committee, stating<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/47\">&#8220;We are gravely concerned about the human rights situation in Xinjiang&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/48\">A report published last week by the US Department of Labor detailed the list of goods produced by forced labour and child labour. It described the appalling conditions and indoctrination endured by over 1 million Uighurs and said that the &#8220;vast scale of abuse&#8221; must<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1025.4\/49\">&#8220;serve as a notice for the world to ask questions, take action, and demand change.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/50\">Shockingly, western fashion brands and big-name companies simply turn a blind eye. In a call this morning with Sophie Richardson of Human Rights Watch, who is based in Washington, she told me that over 400 members of the House, from across the political divide&#8212;extraordinary given the toxicity often of US politics&#8212;had come together to insist on a rebuttable presumption on goods from China, requiring companies to demonstrate that they had not been manufactured by slave labour.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/51\">I was glad to hear the noble Lord, Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, insist last week that<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/52\">&#8220;The UK is committed to the principle that there must be no impunity for perpetrators of genocide&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/53\">He is right: there must be no impunity, but no lucrative trade deals either. Genocide should be bad for business, but it has not been in the past and it is not now. Think of Nazi slave labour and beneficiaries such as IBM and Volkswagen, which even built a labour camp next to one of its factories to ensure a supply of labour. Think of Hugo Boss, Kodak and Siemens; Siemens even ran factories inside concentration camps, including at Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Ravensbr&#252;ck and Sachsenhausen. Extermination through labour: what is happening to the Uighurs and others is comparable.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/54\">To summarise and conclude, Amendments 68 and 76A do not take a blunderbuss approach but are carefully designed to hit a target. They could not easily be used in trivial or vexatious cases. They are a proportionate response to a monstrous crime. They build on the almost unanimous support of Peers for such a threshold, expressed on Report on the telecommunications infrastructure Bill, and would therefore enable the Government to honour their promise, given during that debate, to find a suitable legislative vehicle to take the matter forward.<\/p><p pid=\"c1025.4\/55\">I have no doubt that the Minister shares my abhorrence and that of other noble Lords. I hope that even though he will feel duty-bound to resist many amendments to the Bill, he will recognise the unique nature of this amendment and will, between now and Report, work with the movers to incorporate it into the legislation. I beg to move.<\/p>",

It is important that we remain committed to, and steadfast in standing up for anyone who finds themselves a victim of hate crime or of any hate, because, sadly, our Chinese and East Asian communities are not alone in that experience. We know that bigots are only too happy to spread hatred against Jewish and Muslim communities and others if it suits them.<\/p><p pid=\"a125.3\/2\">This Government have a zero-tolerance approach to those who commit such acts. The perpetrators of hate crimes in relation to covid-19 are being punished. The Crown Prosecution Service has prosecuted a number of people for crimes involving racist abuse on the basis of perceived Chinese ethnicity. We will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with people of Chinese and East Asian heritage, and this Government have shown that time and again, supporting not only those who have made these islands their home, but people who visit for  tourism or access to our world-class education system, which we spoke about this afternoon. Also, our generous offer to those from Hong Kong eligible to come to make a new life here stands as testament to our solidarity. Although the level of hate crime towards people of Chinese and East Asian heritage appears to have reduced since earlier this year, the Government have no interest in showing complacency.<\/p><p pid=\"a125.3\/3\">We will continue to ensure that victims are supported wherever possible and to bring people who carry out hateful attacks to justice. We already have one of the strongest legislative frameworks in the world to protect communities from hostility, violence and bigotry and to deal with the perpetrators of hate crime. We will strengthen that framework through measures set out in our online harms White Paper and bring forward world-leading legislation to make the UK the safest place to be online.<\/p><p pid=\"a125.3\/4\">We intend to establish in law a new duty of care on companies towards their users, which will be overseen by the independent regulator, and we will not stop there. We have asked the Law Commission to undertake a full review of the coverage and approach of hate crime legislative provisions. It has opened a public consultation and will report to Ministers early next year.<\/p><p pid=\"a125.3\/5\">We will also consult on our hate crime action plan. It has guided our work over the past four years and has been well regarded, but now is the time to consider whether we can be even more ambitious. We will consult widely in the coming months to ensure that we build an effective new approach, which will benefit from the input of many of our diverse communities. I look forward to the Chinese and East Asian communities playing their part.<\/p><p pid=\"a125.3\/6\">I want to pick up on a point made by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Bambos Charalambous\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25676\">the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Bambos Charalambous)<\/phrase> about the police. He highlighted the annual statistics that were reported today. One of the elements that shows progress in this area is that we are seeing more of an understanding from the police of what hate crime is and the ability to categorise it, so that it is being better reported. I hope that we will continue to see that work in the statistics, but I totally agree with the comments that have been made: while we are seeing progress in this space, we need to continue with the work to make sure that the complexities are understood and articulated in the reporting, and that when individuals feel they want to report to the police, they are comfortable in doing that. I was pleased to hear that 87% of the Chinese community surveyed trusted their local police, in comparison with the national average of, I believe, just over 76%.<\/p><p pid=\"a125.3\/7\">On spending to work with our communities, we have committed to spend through the faith, race and hate crime grant scheme, which enables local groups to bid for grants for work, including with schools and young people. That is a &#163;1.5 million pot. We also have the integrated communities action plan, with more than  70 commitments within that plan, and we are working towards completing them.<\/p><p pid=\"a125.3\/8\">Comments have been made about members of my party. I am not here to speak for individuals, and I am unaware of some of the details. One thing I am very comfortable to say is that the party I represent stands against any form of racism. I am very proud to be part of a party that holds that position, whether people agree or not. In my role as a Minister in MHCLG, I will  do all I can to make sure that all communities in our country have equality and feel parity through the work we are doing. It is something that I have had experience of in other roles as a Minister in this Government over the past two years. I am looking forward to working with colleagues as we progress the action plans as we move through covid.<\/p><p pid=\"a125.3\/9\">This week being National Hate Crime Awareness Week, it is a moment to reflect on the challenges that confront us and reaffirm our commitment to tackling hatred. I believe that today&#8217;s debate has been an important part of that, and we should all stand together to condemn hatred and bigotry in all forms, and focus instead on what ties bind us together. I end by thanking everyone for their contributions to today&#8217;s debate, and look forward to further conversations with colleagues as we progress some of the work I have outlined this afternoon.<\/p>",

Member for Islwyn (Chris Evans)<\/phrase> for introducing it and to all colleagues for their contributions. There is, rightly, deep public concern about the issue, so I am also grateful to the 146,000 members of the public who signed the petition and enabled this debate to take place. We have heard the strength of feeling in the House about Xinjiang, and I will respond to as many as possible of the points that have been made.<\/p><p pid=\"a46.0\/2\">I assure the House that we closely and constantly monitor the situation in Xinjiang. As we have heard and read, and as we acknowledge, there have been harrowing reports and evidence of gross human rights violations. Analysis of satellite images suggests that the Chinese authorities continue to construct internment camps and demolish mosques and other religious sites. Those are systematic restrictions on Uyghur culture and religion. We heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Bob Seely\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25645\">the Member for Isle of Wight (Bob Seely)<\/phrase> about the extensive and invasive surveillance operation that targets minorities. We have also seen credible evidence of forced labour   &#8212;that was raised by most Members this afternoon&#8212;and the Chinese Government&#8217;s own figures show a dramatic decrease in population growth in Xinjiang over the past three years.<\/p><p pid=\"a46.0\/3\">I will now set out the Government&#8217;s position on global human rights sanctions. On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-07-06\">6 July<\/phrase>, as right hon. and hon. Members will be aware, we established the global human rights sanctions regime. In a statement to Parliament, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary set out the full scope of the UK&#8217;s new global human rights sanctions regime. He was clear, and I reiterate this today, that it is not appropriate to speculate on future designations under that regime. As I have said before and as the Foreign Secretary made clear, to do so could reduce the impact of such designations. However, I make it absolutely clear that that is under constant review.<\/p><p pid=\"a46.0\/4\">On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-09-09\">9 September<\/phrase>, during an Adjournment debate on Xinjiang, I stated that the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office is carefully considering further designations under the sanctions regime. We will keep all the evidence and the potential listings under close review. Our position on that remains unchanged.<\/p><p pid=\"a46.0\/5\">Let me be clear that we are committed to responding robustly to all human rights violations in Xinjiang. We have played a leading role within the international community to hold China to account. We have led two joint statements at the UN in the past year, including a statement at the UN Human Rights Council in June that was supported by 28 countries. Last week, on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-10-06\">6 October<\/phrase>, 39 countries joined our statement at the UN third committee in New York, expressing deep concern at the situation not just in Xinjiang, but in Tibet and Hong Kong. We believe this growing caucus reflects our diplomatic leadership, including the personal involvement of our Foreign Secretary.<\/p><p pid=\"a46.0\/6\">Outside the UN, we have lobbied around the world to raise awareness of the issue and underlined the critical need for an international response. We have supported that by funding third-party research to increase the evidence base and international awareness, and by sharing our analysis of the situation on the ground, although Members will appreciate that getting access to Xinjiang is incredibly difficult. On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-09-25\">25 September<\/phrase>, the UK dedicated its entire national statement at the UN Human Rights Council to human rights violations in China. That is only the second time the UK has dedicated its national statement to a single country, the first being about Russia in 2018 following the poisonings in Salisbury.<\/p><p pid=\"a46.0\/7\">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has raised our serious concerns about Xinjiang directly with his Chinese counterpart on a number of occasions, most recently on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-07-28\">28 July<\/phrase>, and I have raised them directly with the Chinese ambassador in recent months. We continue to raise awareness of the human rights violations in Xinjiang with UK businesses. We impress upon them the need to act in line with the expectations set out in the UK national action plan on business and human rights. That means conducting due diligence to make sure that they are not contributing to any human rights violations, including the use of forced labour in their supply chains.<\/p><p pid=\"a46.0\/8\">Several right hon. and hon. Members have raised the question of genocide. The term genocide has a specific definition in international law, and it is the long-standing  policy of the UK Government that any judgment as to whether war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide have occurred is a matter for judicial decision.<\/p><p pid=\"a46.0\/9\">In the time I have left, I will turn to remarks and comments made by right hon. and hon. Members. The hon. Member for Islwyn introduced the debate in his typically eloquent style, raising many of the concerns that we all share about the plight of the Uyghur people. I congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Iain Duncan Smith\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10180\">the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith)<\/phrase> on the work he does with IPAC and his persistent championing of this cause.<\/p><p pid=\"a46.0\/10\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Shabana Mahmood\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24788\">The hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood)<\/phrase> was absolutely right to raise the points that she did, but I politely suggest that it is not correct to say that we are no further on. Our actions at the UN last week, alongside 38 other countries, are an example of that. She raised the issue of forced labour, as did most Members. The reports are credible. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute report, which the FCO part-funded, estimated that 80,000 Uyghurs were transferred out of Xinjiang to work.<\/p><p pid=\"a46.0\/11\">We are committed to eradicating modern slavery and forced labour. The Modern Slavery Act 2015 made the UK the first country to require businesses to report how they identify and address modern slavery risks in their operations and supply chains, as hon. Members have mentioned. Businesses with an annual turnover of more than &#163;36 million are required to publish an annual modern slavery statement, and we are developing a registry of modern slavery statements.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c917.0\/1\">My Lords, I declare that I am on the BMA ethics committee. I want to consider what we know, what we are doing and where our duty in society lies.<\/p><p pid=\"c917.0\/2\">Masks are increasingly reported to be protective. I thank the Minister for his brief summary, but I add to it that no evidence has emerged that they are harmful in Covid transmission. The coronavirus is tiny, 0.1 micrometres across, less than one-800th of a human hair in diameter, but it does not leave the body on its own; it relies on aerosols and droplets to spread, and it goes however far that mist takes it. Think of tobacco smoke spreading; once you get beyond two metres and are not downwind, you are less likely to inhale much of it, even though the aerosol lingers in the air for a long time. Do not forget that in indoor spaces that can be for many hours, which is why the BMA wants masks worn in offices even when alone.<\/p><p pid=\"c917.0\/3\">This aerosol, often minute droplets of around double the width of the virus itself, is partly caught in the fibres of a mask. Masks made of double layers of tightly woven mixed fabrics, such as silk and fine cotton, seem to decrease aerosol transfer by up to about one-fifth. The standard mask for use in healthcare settings with aerosol-generating procedures is the N95 respirator mask, which is designed to protect the wearer by filtering out 95% of airborne particles that measure 0.3 micrometres or larger. A review of observational studies estimates that such surgical and comparable cloth masks are around 67% effective in protecting the wearer. That figure may be even higher for the G variant of the virus that seems to transmit faster, but we do not yet know that.<\/p><p pid=\"c917.0\/4\">The other protective effect of a mask is that it can cut the viral count inhaled by up to 60%. Where masking reduces the dose of virus that a wearer might receive, it seems that the resulting infection is milder or even asymptomatic, whereas a large viral load results in a more aggressive inflammatory response. So wearing the suitable mask protects the wearer as well as protecting others if the wearer is excreting virus. In Hong Kong a new type of reusable fabric mask, CuMask+, will be issued to all citizens. This patented six-layer mask is washable 60 times and incorporates copper as a key filtering component, although there is some dispute over the extent of claims of efficacy.<\/p><p pid=\"c917.0\/5\">What of mask deniers? I am afraid that they are still out there. The inconvenience of wearing a mask is tiny for most of us. Those who lipread for whatever reason need to see a person&#8217;s mouth and a very small number of people cannot tolerate a mask, so exceptions are appropriate. For the rest of us, it is only a slightly increased effort to breathe through the mask and cope with fogged-up glasses&#8212;although proper eye protection is associated with less infection. However, we all have a duty to others&#8212;the ethical principles of justice and  that we do not cause harm. We have no idea if the person that we passed in the shop, the street or elsewhere is in a high-risk group and should be shielding.<\/p><p pid=\"c917.0\/6\">Thin, disposable masks are not adequately protective, and there are now more masks than jellyfish in some seas. It is predicted that 75% of throwaway masks will end up in landfill or in oceans. The ecological effect will be long-lasting, as these masks last 450 years before degrading. What is the Government&#8217;s policy to radically decrease mask litter? Why are we not providing advice on how to recycle masks&#8212;for example, by hot-ironing cloth ones?<\/p><p pid=\"c917.0\/7\">I stress, as I have before and as Distance Aware aims to stress, that the most important measures are social distancing and hand washing. Is the word &#8220;space&#8221; used simply because it rhymes with &#8220;face&#8221;? Is there evidence that the public know that this means the two-metre rule? Will the Government make it crystal clear that the two-metre distancing rule is more important than anything else, and that masks can be an adjunct of that but no substitute for it? Other than fines, what is being done to empower those who deserve to be protected when confronted by someone who is simply too selfish to wear a mask properly and thinks it is funny to hang it around their chin or off one ear? I hope we are at the end of mixed messages and that social duty towards each other will define what we do.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a141.3\/1\">I beg to move,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a141.3\/2\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">That this House has considered the rule of law in the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/3\">Although I may not be a lawyer, as a professional I understand the need for the highest standards of professional conduct and, like every parent, I cherish my responsibility to instil in my children a deep understanding of right and wrong. How that develops is vital to their future and how they make their way in the world. When our children are little, we guide their understanding through the language of good choices and poor choices, working with their teachers and others to celebrate their successes and to use natural and restorative justice techniques to support their understanding of the impact and consequences of the choices they make.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/4\">As our children move into adolescence, we necessarily begin a process of refining that understanding, which manifests in a natural pushing against the boundaries of childhood and a process of reflection, leading to the development of their internal moral and ethical codes, which they then carry into adulthood.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/5\">Like any parent, I want the very best future for my children, so I take great care to act in a way that supports and guides the development of the values of honesty, integrity, respect and compassion, underpinned by a strong sense of self and a high degree of self-awareness. It is not always easy, but I always strive to demonstrate that I am a human, that I am fallible and that I am able to take ownership of any error in judgment, to apologise for any harm I may have caused, however inadvertently, and to embody the principles of restorative justice by making amends in a sincere and transparent way.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/6\">My hope is that, by my actions, my children will understand the value of truth, contrition and atonement. However, that is increasingly difficult when the actions of those in power suggest that such values and principles only exist for others&#8212;that their word is always negotiable and never their bond or guarantee. What does that say about the character of those who lead us?<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/7\">We have a Prime Minister whose past includes well-documented and repeated incidents of racist language. Despite having been given ample opportunities to apologise, he has steadfastly refused to do so. In the absence of any sense of responsibility or of the value of truth there can be no apology, no contrition and no atonement. While the Government may wish those matters away, they still stand as a measure of the man and of all those who stand in his defence.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/8\">However, the PM is not alone in that regard. At the height of the global pandemic, in which the UK has one of the highest mortality rates in the world, this Government&#8217;s Health Secretary regularly obfuscates when pressed on matters of importance. And what of the UK Government&#8217;s man in Scotland, the right hon. Member  for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr Jack)? He is stuck on his repeat with his claims of a &#8220;power surge&#8221;, so lacking in substance that he cannot produce any evidence to support its existence. I could question his motives, but I do not need to. Speaking at the Conservative party conference yesterday, he said about the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill that &#8220;they&#8221;&#8212;the SNP&#8212;<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a141.3\/9\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;don&#8217;t like the bill, which makes me like it even more.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/10\">If that is what passes in the Conservative party for an appropriate motivation to enact legislation&#8212;legislation that will have a demonstrably damaging effect on people&#8217;s livelihoods, jobs and businesses and Scotland&#8217;s democracy &#8212;that is shameful.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/11\">The right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s words reveal the dangerous and ideological grip that this Government are in, not just in observing the law but in writing it. If that type of casual comment is anything to go by, it is little wonder that the Prime Minister and his Back Benchers get such pleasure from their contentious behaviour towards Scotland, where the wildly exaggerated promises of Brexit are readily discarded but a casual comment made during Scotland&#8217;s 2014 referendum is held as inviolable. The Prime Minister should consider that the tissue of lies that was the vow used to secure that vote and its immediate betrayal will never be forgotten in Scotland. Those promises of devo-max ring hollow like never before as this Government impose their will on a Scotland that did not vote for them.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/12\">Prior to 2016, the Sewel convention performed a useful function, ensuring that the devolved legislatures engaged with the UK&#8217;s legislation to address problems early on. It engendered a culture of mutual respect and was based on trust, compromise, and transparent and open dialogue, but Brexit has exposed the vulnerability of devolved power in the face of a Conservative UK parliamentary majority.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/13\">Despite a clear majority remain vote in Scotland and Northern Ireland, the unilateral enactment of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 without the consent of the Welsh or Northern Irish Assemblies or the Scottish Parliament was described by Aileen McHarg, professor of public law at Durham University, as threatening the Sewel convention &#8220;almost to destruction&#8221;. She went  on to say that while it was possible to depart from the Sewel convention, UK ministers had failed to give constitutional grounds for doing so, and that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a141.3\/14\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;To make an exception to a rule, what is required is an explanation of why its underlying rationale either does not apply, or is overridden by some competing principle.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/15\">Perhaps that is a point that the Minister could clarify today. Professor McHarg further cautioned that such a<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a141.3\/16\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;radical re-reading of the Sewel Convention&#8230;would seriously undermine the protection it offers for devolved autonomy.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/17\">So much for a power surge.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/18\">Professor McHarg is not alone. In January, the Institute for Government stated that the Sewel convention had been broken by Brexit, and that reform is now urgent. Although both the Scottish and Welsh Governments put forward substantive proposals for such reform, such as making the convention legally enforceable or adding a stage to consider the views of the devolved Administrations, this Government were reluctant to engage. The United Kingdom Internal Market Bill makes it abundantly clear that their idea of reform has been to  do the complete opposite. As my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Joanna Cherry\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25404\">the Member for Edinburgh South West (Joanna Cherry)<\/phrase> recently opined,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a141.3\/19\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;The Sewel convention is about as much use for defending devolution as a chocolate teapot&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/20\">The Bill also shows a flagrant disregard for the Sewel convention, one of the key planks of the UK&#8217;s unwritten constitution. Clause 46 attempts to strip away powers from Scottish Ministers in clearly defined devolved areas of power. As Baroness Helena Kennedy QC said of the Bill last week,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a141.3\/21\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;It goes against the Sewel convention. It goes against our traditional constitutional workings and conventions. This is a really shocking business, and we shouldn&#8217;t take it lying down&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/22\">Indeed, the very mechanism that exists to protect devolution is toothless in the face of the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill and its facility to drive a coach and horses through the devolution settlement.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/23\">However, the further betrayal of the promises made to Scotland in 2014 is not the only impact of the Bill. It has also alerted the international community of something Scotland has known for a considerable time: that the word of the UK Government means nothing. Legislating to break international law in the midst of efforts to forge trade agreements with the EU and other nations across the globe&#8212;agreements that the UK Government presumably hope will be binding on both sides&#8212;is a very peculiar way to demonstrate the necessity of good faith.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/24\">On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-09-24\">24 September<\/phrase> this year, the Attorney General asserted in this House that, as a matter of domestic law, it was proper for Parliament to pass legislation that might breach<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a141.3\/25\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;international law or treaty obligations.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/26\">Fortunately, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh South West was on hand to raise the following question:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a141.3\/27\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;The Attorney General has justified her support for the Bill by reference to the domestic legal principle of parliamentary supremacy and the judgment of the UK Supreme Court in Miller. But in that case, the UK Supreme Court also said, at paragraph 55, that &#8216;treaties between sovereign states&#8217;, such as the withdrawal agreement, &#8216;have effect in international law and are not governed by the domestic law of any state.&#8217; The Supreme Court was quite clear that such treaties &#8216;are binding on the United Kingdom in international law&#8217;.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/28\">She then asked:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a141.3\/29\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Why did the Attorney General omit reference to that part of the Supreme Court&#8217;s judgment? Did she not learn the rule against selective citation when she was at law school?&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-09-24\">24 September<\/phrase> 2020; Vol. 680, c. 1125-1126.]<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/30\">However, it quickly became evident that not only had the Attorney General missed the point of law by confusing Miller 1 with the Miller 2 and Cherry cases&#8212;she must have been taking lessons from her boss by trading playground taunts as a substitute for substance and mounting an undignified attack on my hon. and learned Friend and the Scottish Government.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/31\">Following the point of order and an impromptu celebration from my hon. and learned Friend given her great victory for the rule of law made in Scotland, the misunderstanding was clarified, as one esteemed commentator opined that it was a case of<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a141.3\/32\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Mixed Millers from the attorney general.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/33\">However, there was no further response from the Attorney General. Perhaps we can hear one today.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/34\">It is worth noting that the Attorney General also raised the matter of the Scottish Government&#8217;s named person scheme when they were found to be in breach of international law, but there is little by way of equivalence. The Supreme Court ruled that although the named persons proposal was unquestionably legitimate and benign, some of the provisions breached the rights to privacy and family life under the European convention on human rights. Unlike the UK Government, the Scottish Government accepted the ruling without question and introduced a Bill to address the concerns of the court. That response to a court ruling stands in stark contrast to the UK Government, who have pressed on with their legislation regardless, despite a flood of criticism from some of the most senior legal voices in the country.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/35\">The SNP Scottish Government did not complain about &#8220;activist&#8221; or &#8220;leftie&#8221; lawyers or suggest that judges should have their wings clipped; they welcomed the role of the courts in holding the Executive to account, and see it as a crucial part of a healthy democracy. I gently suggest that the UK Government could learn a lot from Holyrood&#8217;s approach. In pursuing a clear breach of international law, UK Government Ministers are now also in breach of the ministerial code.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/36\">As confirmed in the Court of Appeal in 2018, the ministerial code still mandates compliance with international law. Furthermore, the Attorney General&#8217;s justification that treaty obligations become binding only to the extent that they are enshrined in domestic legislation is nonsense: they become enforceable before domestic courts only if incorporated by legislation. The Government&#8217;s reliance on internal law to justify their position does not in any way affect the fact that the Bill places the UK in breach of its international treaty obligations. It was therefore of little surprise to read the reaction of the Financial Times legal correspondent, who described the Attorney General&#8217;s legal opinion as<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a141.3\/37\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;first-term, first-year undergraduate tosh&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/38\">I should not need to say this, but fulfilling obligations under international treaties is one of the most fundamental responsibilities of any state that claims to be a responsible member of the international community. International law governs the making, interpretation and termination of international treaties. Most importantly, the Vienna convention on the law of treaties 1969, which the UK signed in 1970 and ratified in 1971, provides in article 26 that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a141.3\/39\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/40\">That article reflects a very long-standing principle of international law: &#8220;pacta sunt servanda&#8221;&#8212;agreements must be kept. That is a basic principle of customary international law, and as such, is also part of English common law. It is key to the very existence of a rules-based international order.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/41\">In recent years, we have seen the UK call on the Iranian, Chinese and Russian Governments to respect their commitments under international law. It is difficult to see how the UK will be able to conduct such conversations with any credibility in future. To that end, one can only conclude that the consequences for the UK&#8217;s international standing and reputation have been deeply damaging.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/42\">According to the Foreign Secretary, however, he has met no one who thinks that the UK is not a defender of the international rule of law in the wake of that controversial legislation. That statement lacks any credibility. I will give a flavour from some people the Foreign Secretary may meet. The former Prime Minister, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Theresa May\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10426\">the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)<\/phrase>, asked<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a141.3\/43\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;how can the Government reassure future international partners that the UK can be trusted to abide by the legal obligations in the agreements it signs?&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-09-08\">8 September<\/phrase> 2020; Vol. 679, c. 499.]<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/44\">Former Prime Minister Sir John Major has said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a141.3\/45\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Our signature on any treaty or agreement has been sacrosanct&#8230;If we lose our reputation for honouring the promises we make, we will have lost something beyond price that may never be regained.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/46\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Roger Gale\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10217\">The right hon. Member for North Thanet (Sir Roger Gale)<\/phrase> said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a141.3\/47\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Seeking to renegotiate the Northern Ireland protocol will be regarded worldwide as an act of bad faith.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/48\">Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a141.3\/49\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;The UK must respect the Northern Ireland protocol as signed with the EU to ensure the free flow of goods across the border. If the UK violates that international treaty and Brexit undermines the Good Friday accord, there will be absolutely no chance of a US-UK trade agreement passing the Congress.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/50\">Finally, Amal Clooney, the former UK special envoy on media freedom, said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a141.3\/51\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;very sadly, it has now become untenable for me, as special envoy, to urge other states to respect and enforce international obligations while the UK declares that it does not intend to do so itself.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/52\">I could seriously go on and on. In a recent Foreign Affairs Committee sitting, my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Stewart McDonald\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25322\">the Member for Glasgow South (Stewart Malcolm McDonald)<\/phrase> raised the Sino-British joint declaration, which the Foreign Secretary has accused China of breaking by forcing controversial national security legislation on Hong Kong. In response, the Foreign Secretary said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a141.3\/53\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;What I think you&#8217;re trying to neatly do is draw some moral equivalence or substantial equivalence between the two and I think it&#8217;s crazy, I think it&#8217;s absolute nonsense.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/54\">He also insisted that<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/55\">&#8220;we haven&#8217;t broken international law&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/56\">yet, instead saying that the legislation is necessary because of<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a141.3\/57\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;frankly some of the aggressive behaviour&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/58\">from Brussels.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/59\">That got me thinking. Should Scotland also take a similar tack, and introduce the legislation that we feel is necessary because, frankly, of some of the aggressive behaviour from this UK Government? Or is this more a case of &#8220;do as I say and not as I do&#8221;? Of course, it is not just the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill that undermines the devolution settlement and the Union; the planned independent review of administrative law, which is no small matter, is set to target the crucial judicial review process following the successful use of that mechanism to prevent the unlawful prorogation of Parliament, and that inquiry poses a danger to the Union.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/60\">It is important to reiterate widely held concerns about contracts recently awarded by this Government. Data analysed by The Guardian shows that in response to covid, state bodies have awarded at least 177 contracts worth &#163;1.1 billion to commercial firms. Of those contracts, 115&#8212;   with a total value of more than &#163;1 billion&#8212;were awarded under the fast-track rules, bypassing competitive tenders. Of course, that is nothing new from the UK Government. Last year, when <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Chris Grayling\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10920\">the right hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)<\/phrase> handed a &#163;13.8 million ferry contract to Seaborne Freight, with no tender process, despite the fact that the company owned no ships, that led to Eurotunnel suing the Government, who paid out &#163;33 million in settlement just before the case was to go to court. In the meantime, Seaborne Freight has gone into liquidation, owing &#163;2 million.<\/p><p pid=\"a141.3\/61\">Today, I am focusing on the party of government, because they are in Government, but I make no exception for others, regardless of their political stripes, who abuse the power that they are trusted to carry as a means to nefarious or personal ends. The party of law and order appear to have become the party of lawlessness and disorder. I ask the Minister to ask the Attorney General the question on the lips of parents up and down these islands: how can we teach our children right from wrong when those in power are seen to abuse it, when those who make the law break the law and when the protectors of the people throw their best interests to the wind in pursuit of self-interest? By their failure to observe the rule of law, the Government diminish us all.<\/p>",

It is clear from the debate that there is now a growing strength and unity of feeling across all parts of the House of Commons that the policy&#8212;as referenced by the Opposition spokesman, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Stephen Kinnock\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25297\">the hon. Member for Aberavon (Stephen Kinnock)<\/phrase>&#8212;initiated by the then Chancellor and Prime Minister of a Government in which I served, which was referred to in turn as &#8220;Project Kowtow&#8221;, can no longer exist. We now need to bear down on Chinese abuse.<\/p><p pid=\"a140.0\/2\">The point of the debate was to highlight the latest abuse in Tibet, but more than that, across the board, I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to take the following points forward. We must make sure that Magnitsky sanctions are applied to those mentioned in the reports, as well reports on Xinjiang and the Uyghurs and all those other areas as well, particularly Hong Kong. It is time now to call them out and put those sanctions in place; we have spent too long thinking about it.<\/p><p pid=\"a140.0\/3\">We need to condemn those companies involved with and linked to modern-day slavery and abuse in China. The Government should call out those companies. The way to act here is to agree to amendment 68 to the Trade Bill in the House of Lords, which would immediately stop that activity. I ask my hon. Friend to tell those in the Government that it is time to take a position on the Olympics, no matter what.<\/p><p pid=\"a140.0\/4\">I hope that the calling out of those abuses in Tibet for a long time by many of my right hon. and hon. Friends, including my hon. Friend the Minister, will let the Government know that we can no longer just say that we want a good and constructive relationship with China. We want an honest relationship with China&#8212;one in which, when something is wrong, we say it is wrong. In this case, if genocide and abuses of human rights are taking place, we now, as a Government and as a people, must call them out and take action.<\/p><p pid=\"a140.0\/5\">Question put and agreed to.<\/p><p pid=\"a140.0\/6\">Resolved,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a140.0\/7\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">That this House has considered reports of China&#8217;s rapid expansion of the labour programme in Tibet co-published by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China.<\/p>",

Lady began by mentioning the dual nationals and the need to keep their names at the forefront of the national debate, which she has been doing fantastically every week, so that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anousheh Ashouri and Luke Symons are remembered. The Government are made aware of this every week: the right hon. Lady mentions it to me, and I mention it to the Foreign Office. It is known. We are trying our best, but, as was found with hostages before, it is very difficult to get obdurate states and obdurate organisations to move.<\/p><p pid=\"c521.0\/4\">On parliamentary scrutiny of the coronavirus&#8212;the issue that the right hon. Lady focused on&#8212;I note that Labour Members did not actually take part in large numbers. I think a very small number of them voted yesterday. It is a bit worrying if, when we actually have a vote, the official Opposition sit on their hands, so they call for something and then they are absent without leave. They do not formally need leave, of course, under the procedures of the House; it a long time since attendance was demanded. The right hon. Lady asks but the Whips Office does not necessarily want.<\/p><p pid=\"c521.0\/5\">On the debates that we are bringing forward and have brought forward, we have had 40 oral statements in relation to covid in this House, in addition to the urgent questions that Mr Speaker has facilitated. This week, we had a full day&#8217;s debate. The whole of Monday after questions was devoted to a covid-19 debate, and of course we had the renewal of the orders yesterday. Next week, we will have a vote. We had a vote yesterday, but Labour Members did not take part. [Interruption.] The right hon. Lady is heckling&#8212;it is unlike her to heckle&#8212;saying, &#8220;Vote, vote.&#8221; Well, they did not vote. It is not my fault they did not vote. I cannot make Labour Members vote. I have no influence over the Labour Whips Office to get them to turn up and do their job. If they want to sit at home idling away the happy hours not voting&#8212;not going through the Division Lobbies&#8212;what can I do? I can appeal to your good offices, Mr Speaker. I can ask the Doorkeepers to encourage them. We have set things out in a covid-safe way. But Labour Members decide not to turn up when we give them a vote, which they keep on asking for.<\/p>",

Recently, the Scottish Parliament passed the standalone Scottish Biometrics Commissioner Bill, which deals with how biometrics data should be used. That shows how big an issue it is, and why it should be dealt with separately.<\/p><p pid=\"a1276.1\/3\">Most people are relatively comfortable with a passport gate scanning our face or a smartphone using our thumbprint. Yet there are many legitimate concerns about the use of biometrics by police forces and privacy concerns about sharing our data. We recently saw the brave protesters in Hong Kong tearing down alleged facial recognition cameras as the regime tried to incriminate those marching against the national security laws. That is just one example of how the technology can be misused. I know that the hon. Member for Bristol North West has a keen interest in that, as he held a Westminster Hall debate on the topic last year.<\/p><p pid=\"a1276.1\/4\">It is clear that the House will support the Bill and I welcome its progression to the next stage. The dependability of evidence heard in our courtrooms, be they in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, is one of the most important things that we can protect as legislators. Without a justice system that we can believe in and that we can trust, we cannot be a thriving democratic country.<\/p><p pid=\"a1276.1\/5\">I believe that giving statutory powers to the Forensic Science Regulator will help drive up standards throughout the country and I am happy to support that principle today.<\/p>",

As the outgoing chair of the British-Palestine all-party parliamentary group, I pay particular tribute to colleagues who have been such powerful advocates for peace, justice and security in this troubled land, not least my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Julie Elliott\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24710\">the Member for Sunderland Central (Julie Elliott)<\/phrase>, who will be taking over as chair of the APPG. I wish her well.<\/p><p pid=\"d1209.2\/4\">I start by setting out three core principles, which I hope and believe are shared by all who are taking part in this debate. First, this is not about religion or ethnicity. It is not a question of Arab, Muslim or Jewish identity. It is about upholding the universal norms and values that we hold dear, and it is about working to constrain and reverse the actions of those who seek to undermine those norms and values. Nor is this about being pro-Israel or pro-Palestine. This is about striving for peace, justice and security for all.<\/p><p pid=\"d1209.2\/5\">Secondly, we condemn violence in all its forms, whether it is Hamas launching rockets or the Israel Defence Forces bombarding Gaza or bulldozing Bedouin villages to make way for illegal settlements. We oppose any and all actions that lead to the death and destruction that have so tragically come to define this conflict.<\/p><p pid=\"d1209.2\/6\">Thirdly, we believe passionately in the rule of law. Indeed, our point of departure is that the rule of law is not up for negotiation. It is not some bargaining chip that can be tossed on to the table in exchange for concessions or compromises; it is the very cornerstone of the rules-based order and the bedrock of the norms, rights and values that we cherish and seek to defend.<\/p><p pid=\"d1209.2\/7\">I believe that our defence of the rule of law matters more now than it has done at any time since 1945, because we stand today at a moment in history when the rule of law is under threat across the world. The Chinese Communist party has breached the Sino-British declaration on Hong Kong, the Russian Government annexed Crimea in 2014 and, deeply regrettably, even our own Government are willing to renege on their commitment to a legally binding treaty.<\/p><p pid=\"d1209.2\/8\">Israel&#8217;s consistent flouting of UN resolutions and  the fourth Geneva convention has undermined the rules-based order for decades, and the international community can no longer just look the other way. Both sides in this conflict have witnessed horrific bloodshed and both sides deserve an end to the fear and suffering that  they have had to experience. That is why it is so vital and urgent that the rule of law be brought to bear as the foundation upon which a viable and sustainable Palestine can be negotiated and built&#8212;a Palestine that protects the rights of its citizens and lives in peace with  its neighbours.<\/p><p pid=\"d1209.2\/9\">The illegal Israeli settlements undermine all three of the principles that I have set out. They drive and amplify the vicious identity politics that poisons this conflict. They cause violence on a daily basis and they are a flagrant breach of international law, yet they continue and expand.<\/p><p pid=\"d1209.2\/10\">In 2018, we marked 25 years since the signing of the Oslo accords. That moment in 1993 was meant to herald a new and lasting era of peace and co-existence&#8212;the beginning of a genuine two-state solution&#8212;but since then, the number of illegal settlers has increased from 258,000 to more than 610,000. Fifty thousand homes and properties have been demolished, and an illegal separation barrier has been built that carves up the west bank and brutally disconnects towns, cities, families and communities from each other. What have the Israeli people experienced in that time? They have experienced insecurity, fear of attacks through suicide bombings, rockets and mortars, knife attacks and car rammings. None of this will end while there is no proper peace and no end to the occupation. It has been a disaster for all sides in this conflict.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"d743.3\/1\">I will not, because I am short on time. The clauses we are talking about today do exactly what we said in the manifesto. Clause 40 deals  with Northern Ireland&#8217;s place in the UK internal market. Clause 41 deals with unfettered access. Those should be uncontroversial clauses and they should be uncontroversial because they are explicitly referenced in the protocol itself, which states that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"d743.3\/2\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;nothing in this Protocol prevents the United Kingdom from ensuring unfettered market access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the United Kingdom&#8217;s internal market&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"d743.3\/3\">As we have heard today, the protocol goes on to set out in high-level terms how we avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, something that I am as committed to today as I was the day I voted for Brexit. We heard eloquently from my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Katherine Fletcher\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25830\">the Member for South Ribble (Katherine Fletcher)<\/phrase> why that is so important. The protocol also sets out that it is for the Joint Committee to reach agreement on some of the specifics. It delegates decision making to that committee to finesse the detail and act in a way that is consistent with the protocol. The protocol requires both sides to negotiate in good faith, protect the Good Friday agreement and reach a free trade deal, because ultimately that free trade deal is what will prevent a hard border. That is what we are striving for, and that is what the clauses help to do.<\/p><p pid=\"d743.3\/4\">However, given the short time before the end of the transition and that no free trade agreement has yet been agreed, we have to give thought to what happens if the EU takes an approach that is not in good faith. What if it takes a maximalist approach to what goods are considered high risk or a maximalist approach to what would constitute state aid that impacts the European Union? The outcome of that decision would not only be a major impediment to Great Britain and Northern Irish trade, but would threaten our own integrity and the Good Friday agreement. Are some seriously suggesting that in that scenario there should not be a means for the UK to respond? Are they suggesting we should look at such a situation, shrug our shoulders and say international law means we must surrender parts of our country?<\/p><p pid=\"d743.3\/5\">I heard the concerns from Members on both sides of the Committee about international law, but let us be clear on what we are not doing. I do not think that the language has been helpful. We have heard references to rogue states, to the Novichok poisoning on UK streets and to Hong Kong citizens, but we are not breaking international criminal law. We are not breaking an international treaty on global security. We are not breaking a free trade agreement. We are saying that, having signed up to an agreement to fulfil a democratic mandate to the people of this country, which one side appears to be using to undermine our constitutional integrity, we will stand resolutely as one country in pushing back.<\/p><p pid=\"d743.3\/6\">We have values as a country, and yes, those include standing up for an international rules-based system, the rule of law and democratic sovereignty, but when conflict arises, which it can do from time to time, Parliament remains sovereign, and this Parliament will act in the interests of our Union. That position was reaffirmed in our own EU withdrawal Act, which recognised the sovereignty of Parliament. If this Parliament is sovereign, we must act for the constitutional integrity of our country, and for that reason, I will be supporting this Bill.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1303.1\/1\">My Lords, I rise to support Amendment 62 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, which I was delighted to sign. I also wish to express my support for Amendment 64, which the noble Earl has so ably presented, and to speak to my own Amendment 79. The first two refer to people who need refuge; mine refers to a different group and I will get to that in a second.<\/p><p pid=\"a1303.1\/2\">As I was listening to the powerful presentations from the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Earl, I was thinking back to January 2016 when I was at a memorial service for a 15 year-old Afghan boy. His name was Masud, and he died in the back of lorry trying to get to the UK to rejoin his brother. This relates to the discussion we were having before about the situation on Lesbos. We have to provide safe, legal, orderly routes for people to reach the UK, and to achieve the refuge they should be entitled to.<\/p><p pid=\"a1303.1\/3\">I note my position as the co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hong Kong and identify what may well be a rising issue. The Government have stepped forward and said that they want to help people who need to leave Hong Kong because of what is happening there with regard to human rights. I very much hope that we will see action on providing orderly routes for people to be able to do that, and for people all around the world.<\/p><p pid=\"a1303.1\/4\">I mostly want to speak on Amendment 79. As I said, this does not relate to refugees. This relates to a situation involving those generally known as Skype children, the numbers of whom are, of course, likely to be significantly enhanced. At the moment, for non-EU and EAA citizens who are the spousal partner of a British citizen, the British citizen has to have an income of &#163;18,600 a year to bring them to the UK&#8212;more with children&#8212;and at the end of the transition period this Bill will extend that to many more people and many more children.<\/p><p pid=\"a1303.1\/5\">This is a more limited amendment than Amendment 23, which we debated last week, which addressed couples being able to stay together as well as children. While I prefer Amendment 23, I am hoping that the Conservative Government might be more prepared to consider amending the legislation specifically so that it is not tearing children out of their parents&#8217; arms. It is, at the moment, not using the wisdom of Solomon but actually delivering the verdict of Solomon and forcing parents to let their children go to be separated from them for years. As we all know from the situation with Covid-19, yes, you may be able to keep in contact through a screen, but it is certainly not the same thing.<\/p><p pid=\"a1303.1\/6\">I note that in 2018 the Children&#8217;s Commissioner for England commissioned a report showing that up to 15,000 British children were already growing up in this situation. This is without adding in people affected by Brexit. Many children were reportedly suffering from significant stress and anxiety from the separation.<\/p><p pid=\"a1303.1\/7\">So have the Government made an estimate of the number of children likely to be affected annually by the minimum income requirement once the immigration Act, as it will be, comes into effect? The research by the Children&#8217;s Commissioner found that Britain had the least family-friendly reunification policies of 38 developed countries, largely because of that minimum income requirement. That is of course &#163;18,600 a year, which was then 138% of the minimum wage. It will not be quite so bad now. The Children&#8217;s Commissioner, Anne Longfield, said at the time:<\/p><p pid=\"a1303.1\/8\">&#8220;There is a wealth of evidence which indicates that children are far more likely to thrive when they are raised by parents in a warm, stable and loving family environment.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1303.1\/9\">There is evidence, she said, that this affects<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1303.1\/10\">&#8220;their well-being and development. It is also likely to have an impact on their educational attainment and outcomes.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1303.1\/11\">As one of the authors of the report commissioned by the Children&#8217;s Commissioner pointed out, the great majority of children affected by this are British citizens. They are being forced to grow up effectively in single-parent families, when their parents want to be together. So I hope that the Government will reflect on the comparison with Solomon and think about accepting this amendment.<\/p>",

Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)<\/phrase>.<\/p><p pid=\"b93.0\/2\">This is of course an essential Bill for the good order of the internal market. It is essential for our economic success, wellbeing, jobs and employment, and I support it. I am very surprised at the EU&#8217;s negotiating strategy and purpose, particularly in offering my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Theresa May\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10426\">the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)<\/phrase>, in effect, the Canada deal, and then declining, to date, to offer the same terms to the Prime Minister. I therefore have no hesitation in supporting the Bill&#8217;s Second Reading, and I give the Government my strong support for reaching a deal.<\/p><p pid=\"b93.0\/3\">But I am not going to vote to breach international law, and I want to explain why. As International Development Secretary in the coalition Government, I consistently spoke up for the rule of law. Britain has been a beacon, in some very difficult places in the world, for support for the rule of law. Our support is relied on in that respect, and it matters, whether we are dealing with the rights of gay people in Uganda or ensuring the last vestiges of law in Zimbabwe, never quite snuffed out by dint of Britain&#8217;s strong support for the rule of law. Many in this House have rightly spoken up for the rights of Hong Kong citizens when China has sought to resile from international agreements it had signed. We are one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. We have a duty to uphold international law. The rule of law is incredibly important for our basic liberties and human rights, and failing to do so will do incalculable damage to our reputation all around the world.<\/p><p pid=\"b93.0\/4\">I have two further points to make. The first is that Members of the House should read with the greatest care what John Major and Tony Blair have said about the dangers of all this for the Good Friday agreement and peace across Northern Ireland. I have been here long enough to remember the awful statements about violence in Northern Ireland, with innocent civilians maimed and worse. Secondly, we have one of the largest national debts of any country in the world, and confidence in our debt depends on an absolute understanding that Britain will always stand by its word.<\/p><p pid=\"b93.0\/5\">In the past, I have voted in this House in ways that I have regretted. I voted for section 28, I voted for the poll tax and I voted with the then Prime Minister on Iraq. But I do not believe I have ever gone into a Lobby to vote in a way that I knew was wrong, and I will not be doing it on this occasion either.<\/p>",

Friend highlights go to the fact that many of us now think that the tests for what constitutes genocide are being met by the Chinese Government. It is truly depressing that because of the growing dominance of the Chinese Government and the way in which the United Nations institutions work, so much of the international community is just completely unable to effectively stand up and say, &#8220;This is not going to happen.&#8221; Too often the world just says, &#8220;Never again.&#8221; We were supposed to have &#8220;Never again&#8221; on genocides decades ago, yet they have continued to take place and one is taking place even now. What will it take for the world to act? That is why I want to push the Minister very strongly on that point.<\/p><p pid=\"f741.2\/2\">The Government can do more to consider more innovative legal approaches. I will refrain from making comments on the rule of law, which everybody has been discussing in the past 24 hours with regard to our treaty obligations, but the Minister will know, because he has to have the conversations with his Chinese counterparts and others, that Britain must be believed to be a country that stands by its international obligations and the rule of law. That is one of the great gifts that we have and it is one of our key strengths as a country when we play our role on the international stage. The Government should right what they have done wrong in the past 24 hours so that we can make representations with the full force of moral and legal authority that we have enjoyed for a long time.<\/p><p pid=\"f741.2\/3\">One thing is indisputable: nothing will change unless co-ordinated, robust political force and pressure is applied while commercial, financial and legal routes to take action against the Chinese Government are navigated and explored. The UK now has a choice as to whether to lead the charge or turn our backs and allow these atrocities to continue once the outrage has inevitably subsided.<\/p><p pid=\"f741.2\/4\">I support the actions that the Government have taken and intend to take in relation to Hong Kong citizens and I have supported the Government&#8217;s decision in  relation to Huawei. In fact, I think it is high time that we as a country take a more realistic and clear-eyed approach towards our relationship with China. As the shadow Minister, my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Stephen Kinnock\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25297\">the Member for Aberavon (Stephen Kinnock)<\/phrase>, has said, we have frequently rolled out a red carpet for the Chinese Government but got nothing in return. Surely, the perpetration of a genocide necessitates a full review and reset of our relationship.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"d565.1\/1\">My hon. Friend makes an important point about safeguards. He will see that the arrested individual will need to be before a judge as soon as practicable after arrest. That is one of the safeguards that I wanted to highlight, as it underpins this Bill. The new arrest power, in the prescribed circumstances, is the only change&#8212;this is another important point to stress&#8212;to current extradition law and practice that is introduced. It is designed to bring a wanted person into extradition proceedings under part 2 of the Extradition Act in an expedited way, without changing the likelihood of successful extradition. It does not change the current legislative framework, nor any of the process for the extradition proceedings themselves. The Bill is purely about shifting the point at which the police can intervene and arrest a wanted person. It in no way reduces the safeguards that must apply to any subsequent extradition proceedings considered by the court or the Home Secretary. Judicial oversight will continue as it does now after any arrest. The courts will continue to assess extradition requests as they do now, to determine, for example, whether extradition would be compatible with the individual&#8217;s human rights or whether the person would receive a fair trial. If they would not, extradition would be barred.<\/p><p pid=\"d565.1\/2\">The Bill includes five main safeguards. It applies only to certain specified countries. Countries with a poor human rights record or those that have abused Interpol systems could not be considered suitable for this provision. The addition of any countries would require the consent of both Houses, and it only applies to sufficiently serious offences; the power will only be available in relation to offences that would be criminal in the UK for which an offender would receive a prison sentence of at least three years and which is a sufficiently serious form of that offence to justify arrest.<\/p><p pid=\"d565.1\/3\">The designated authority must be satisfied that arrangements are in place to ensure that requests made by the country concerned are made on the basis of an underlying warrant or a conviction. Also, as I have indicated, the arrested individual will need to be brought before a judge as soon as practicable after arrest, and the power does not alter extradition proceedings in any other way and does not interfere with the court or the Secretary of State&#8217;s role in extradition proceedings.<\/p><p pid=\"d565.1\/4\">I hope that that sets out quite clearly the importance of the safeguards. I know that some Members raised the issue of Interpol. I stress that the UK continues to  work with Interpol to ensure that its rules are robust, effective and complied with. It is notable that the former chief constable of Essex was recently made the executive director of policing services for Interpol&#8212;the most senior operational role in that organisation&#8212;and a UK Government lawyer has also been seconded to Interpol&#8217;s notices and diffusion taskforce to work to ensure Interpol rules are properly and robustly adhered to by Interpol member states.<\/p><p pid=\"d565.1\/5\">I turn to Government amendments 11 and 15, which provide a contingency to keep an important current law enforcement protection for the UK public in place after the end of the transition period, whatever the outcome of the current negotiations. As the House knows, the negotiated outcome we are seeking with the EU would create a warrant-based system based on the EU&#8217;s surrender agreement with Norway and Iceland. The purpose of amending the Bill in this way at this time is to ensure the continuation of relevant arrest powers, should that prove necessary. Amendment 11 is a consequential amendment that will ensure that amendment 15 will be commenced only if we do not have in place new extradition arrangements with the EU at the end of the transition period. If an agreement is reached, these provisions will not need to come into effect. This is simply a contingency, and the provisions also provide a contingency in the event that we do not agree new extradition arrangements with Norway and Iceland to maintain the arrest power currently available by virtue of the EU-Norway-Iceland surrender agreement.<\/p><p pid=\"d565.1\/6\">Opposition amendment 17 covers similar ground, although framing it in EEA terms. I hope the hon. Member for St Helens North will appreciate that we should approve participants on a state-by-state basis, which he would probably acknowledge, and that is therefore why we think the better approach is to name countries individually.<\/p><p pid=\"d565.1\/7\">On the progress of the negotiations on law enforcement and criminal justice, I think there is a good degree of convergence in what the UK and the EU are seeking to negotiate in terms of operational capabilities. We will keep working to bridge the gap where differences remain. There is still an agreement to be had and we will continue to work hard to achieve it.<\/p><p pid=\"d565.1\/8\">Government amendment 12 specifies the National Crime Agency is to be the designated authority for this legislation. The designated authority is the agency that will have the task of certifying that the international arrest alerts conform to the right criteria for them to carry the new power of provisional arrest. The drafting is future-proofed, as it allows for the designated authority to be changed by regulation should the need arise. We have taken that approach as the direct alternative to using secondary legislation on this occasion, to ensure the best use of parliamentary time. The amendment therefore represents a change of process rather than policy and is reflected by Opposition amendment 16. I hope that the Opposition will recognise, because of the future-proofing arrangements, that this is an improvement to the technical approach they would take.<\/p><p pid=\"d565.1\/9\">Government amendment 13 will overturn one of the two changes made in the other place. Statutory requirements are added for the Government to consult on the merits of adding, removing or varying a territory from the Bill with the devolved Administrations and relevant interested stakeholders. Throughout the passage of the Bill, we  have been clear in our commitment to ensuring that Parliament can scrutinise any decision to bring a new country in scope of this power in exactly the same way as Parliament does in relation to the Extradition Act. To that end, the Bill mandates that the addition or removal of any territory is by the affirmative resolution procedure. This gives Parliament the right to scrutinise in detail such proposals and to accept them or, indeed, reject them.<\/p><p pid=\"d565.1\/10\">It is important to stress that while extradition is a reserved matter, relevant officials are engaged in regular discussions with their counterparts in the devolved Administrations and law enforcement agencies who operate right across the UK to collaborate on operational policy and ensure the effectiveness of our extradition system. Indeed, such discussion and consultation has already taken place in relation to the Bill and the amendments. Of course, given that any countries being added would be subject to the affirmative procedure, there will be opportunities for Parliament to probe the extent to which the views of the devolved Administrations and other organisations have been sought. Therefore, we believe that there is no need to add this provision to the Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"d565.1\/11\">Amendment 14 would overturn the second provision altered in the other place, which provides that the removal or addition of a country must use a single statutory instrument. Any additions will be dictated by the will of Parliament, not by an unusual process such that this would impose. If a country is proposed that Parliament does not agree should be specified, then the regulations will be voted down in the normal way. We judge that that remains the rightful process.<\/p><p pid=\"d565.1\/12\">Turning to amendments 1 and 2 in the name of my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green, I am grateful to him for the way in which he has approached this and for the important points that he and other Members have made. It might be useful to set out the measures the Government have taken in dealing with the situation in Hong Kong since the amendments were tabled. As the Committee will be aware, because of the new national security legislation in Hong Kong, the Government have indefinitely suspended the 1998 UK-Hong Kong agreement on the surrender of fugitive offenders&#8212;our extradition treaty. As a result, the Government will not deal with extradition requests sent by Hong Kong to the UK under that treaty. We are also creating a new bespoke immigration route for citizens from Hong Kong to come to the UK, reflecting the unique and unprecedented circumstances in Hong Kong and the UK&#8217;s historical and moral commitment to British nationals overseas citizens.<\/p><p pid=\"d565.1\/13\">I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend and Members across the House who have brought this issue to the House in ensuring that we stand with the people of Hong Kong. This Government have demonstrated our absolute commitment to the people of Hong Kong. Any changes to the Bill in the form of these amendments would not change our extradition relationship with Hong Kong, as I think my right hon. Friend has recognised. However, the points that he has made are very powerful, and I know that colleagues in the Foreign Office will equally have recognised them. We will certainly keep this issue under careful review.<\/p><p pid=\"d565.1\/14\">In relation to the amendments tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden, I would reiterate that the purpose of this Bill is to rectify a policing capability gap, to better protect the public. I recognise that he perhaps makes his points within a broader purview and that his amendments were probing and there are other issues that he might like to return to on another day. The US is just one of the UK&#8217;s extradition partners, and the legal processes in each of those jurisdictions will be different. He has been a champion of the important liberties that this Government seek to protect in relation to each and every extradition case that goes to the UK courts. I recognise and respect the approach that he takes. While we take a different view on these issues of imbalance, he will recognise some of the previous reviews that have looked at these issues in seeing whether that imbalance does exist. As I have indicated, we keep all our extradition arrangements under review, and I look forward to continuing this conversation with him in the weeks and months ahead.<\/p><p pid=\"d565.1\/15\">I am also grateful to my right hon. Friend for rightly drawing attention to the case of Anne Sacoolas. Harry Dunn&#8217;s death was a terrible tragedy. We have every sympathy with his family for their tragic loss and share their desire to ensure that justice is done&#8212;a point that the Prime Minister himself has reaffirmed in the last few days.<\/p><p pid=\"d565.1\/16\">Finally, I turn to new clauses 1 and 2. Throughout the passage of the Bill, there has been considerable cross-party consensus on its aims and measures, alongside the robust scrutiny that I have come to rightly expect from this House. New clause 1 would require the publication of an annual statement on arrests. The National Crime Agency already keeps data and publishes statistics on arrest volumes in relation to part 1 of the Extradition Act. It does that without having been required to do so by primary legislation. We have no doubt that it will similarly do so in respect of arrests under this new arrest power, as this is sensible operational practice. While I have some sympathy for the new clause, I am not persuaded of the necessity of a statutory obligation at this time. I hope that we will be able to review this as that information is published.<\/p><p pid=\"d565.1\/17\">I hear what the hon. Member for St Helens North said in relation to new clause 2, which I think has been tabled as a probing amendment, on the issue of a review. Again, we believe that there is sufficient transparency. This House will no doubt have the chance to assess the operation of the Bill, through the normal post-legislative scrutiny. For those reasons, we are not minded to accept the new clause, although we recognise the need for constant challenge through this House. I am grateful for the amendments that have been tabled and the informed debate that we have had.<\/p>",

It had never occurred to me that HMRC could not already do what is permitted under this Bill. Was this collection of data done anyway and then stopped? Surely the data collection was necessary to make the figures accurate. Clearly, HMRC has trouble with the regulations.<\/p><p pid=\"b708.0\/3\">I have heard it said by business leaders that the GDPR is one of the most burdensome regulations that Parliament has produced. Business leaders are  usually not very good at explaining which bits of regulations they would like to see changed, but almost all can say something bad about the details of the GDPR. I am glad that the Bill will remove some of that regulatory burden from HMRC and the Government. That is a good step in starting to remove the burden from business. Perhaps these clauses reveal excellent communication between HMRC and the department. HMRC has a problem; the Government step in and solve it. That is great. When will any department ask for the details of similar problems being dealt with by business and solve them? Regulations, like taxes, are costly and need to be reduced as soon as possible.<\/p><p pid=\"b708.0\/4\">A few years ago in a debate about salesmanship, my noble friend Lord Grade gave a spellbinding speech about how salesmanship is undervalued by British business, and I agree with him completely. Furthermore, I suggest that trading ability is in the same category. Some historians argue that it was the 18th-century world traders rather than the 19th-century manufacturers who were responsible for the pre-eminence of the British economy up to the First World War. Whatever the merits of their trade, one can certainly admire their bravery in travelling all over the world without a way to get home in a hurry. Even nowadays, there is a large element of bravery and imagination in setting up a sales business, selling British goods to places that have not bought them before. However, these people are usually not helped by more legislation, and on the whole the British Parliament should do its best to ensure that they are hindered to the minimum extent. I think that the Bill achieves that, but the amendments talked about this afternoon would carry the ability to get in their way substantially.<\/p><p pid=\"b708.0\/5\">The amendments debated and rejected in the other place will no doubt reappear here. No doubt they will be enthusiastically supported by a majority in our House, and no doubt they will be rejected all over again. The concept of trade democracy sounds seductive, but we would all agree that democracy produces uncertainty. Many noble Lords started their career in this House following the result of an uncertain election, but certainty and stability are important to a trader. The world is getting smaller, but it is certainly getting more complex and unpredictable.<\/p><p pid=\"b708.0\/6\">For some years, I was lucky enough to be chief executive of a group of companies, one of which had the majority market share in the sale of bus doors to Hong Kong. Perhaps that dates me, as the idea of profitably sending a crate of glass and aluminium assemblies from Beverley in Yorkshire to Hong Kong is a bit unlikely, however skilled the workforce in my favourite factory was. But that trade was so extraordinary that it was difficult to explain, and certainly no Government were able or needed to help it. However, we had heroes ready to leap on to a plane to Hong Kong at no notice to solve a customer&#8217;s problem, and those sorts of diligent people are not those who have a great deal of time for politics. Traders trade despite regulations, not because of them, so I doubt very much that the sorts of amendments proposed for this Bill will be designed to increase trade between British companies and overseas customers.<\/p>",

Like him, my sympathy goes to the families and to the victims. We are grateful for the action by the police and agencies to address the situation and to reassure communities. Obviously due process will now apply. We also share concerns regarding violence perpetrated elsewhere, which shows why violence requires to be treated not just as a criminal justice issue, but as a public health matter.<\/p><p pid=\"c388.2\/2\">Where I disagree with the Minister and differ from him in particular is that I very much regret his conflating that dreadful incident with the actions of Extinction Rebellion. The latter group perpetrated no violence&#8212;random or otherwise&#8212;nor is it a criminal gang, terrorist  group or a deranged individual. Any attempt to portray those people as that is wrong and a dangerous precedent in a democracy. The actions carried out by Extinction Rebellion, both in Scotland and in England, were a peaceful protest. That should not be forgotten, and that remains legitimate. It is a group of young people, although not always entirely young, who care about the environment. That is a legitimate position to take. This action was not an attempt to close down free speech, and to suggest otherwise is disingenuous. All they were seeking to do was to disrupt the outgoing of print for a period of time. There was no cessation of the print being published. Indeed, it appeared online and at most delivery was delayed to some shops.<\/p><p pid=\"c388.2\/3\">To equate that almost with actions such as those in Belarus and Hong Kong is fundamentally wrong. We must be very wary of overreacting. The protest replicated actions taken down through the centuries, from the Chartists, through the Suffragettes, to trade unionists and civil rights protesters, including over the poll tax. We might not all agree with Extinction Rebellion&#8217;s tactics, but we do have to accept it has a legitimate view and must be allowed to carry out its peaceful protests. Otherwise it is this institution that is threatened, as opposed to the right of free speech mentioned by the Minister.<\/p><p pid=\"c388.2\/4\">On the acts of violence, will the Minister ensure that violence is treated as a public health and not simply a criminal justice issue, and that we must address its manifestations, on which progress has been made in Scotland? On the Extinction Rebellion protests, can we ensure that the right to protest that has been enshrined and protected in this institution and this Chamber throughout the centuries will remain? Opposing the views of particular titles is not interfering with free speech. Can I ask that the aim of this Government always be to protect peaceful protest?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b453.0\/1\">My Lords, I thank the Minister for the Statement and the Covid update that the House will discuss today. We are, of course, all on the same side in fighting this virus. I hope the Minister will understand that when we raise issues it is to urge the Government to improve their response to fighting the virus which, as he said earlier today, remains lethal and leaves many with serious, debilitating sickness. Everything must be done to drive down and eliminate infections and suppress the virus completely.<\/p><p pid=\"b453.0\/2\">Given the news today about testing availability and the aspirations of the Secretary of State in that regard, I start by asking the Minister about the current state of testing and tracing. From the news this morning, it would seem that coronavirus testing was being prioritised in high-risk areas, leading to shortages in others. This has led to some people with symptoms being asked to drive significant distances for a swab. The Government say that areas with fewer Covid-19 cases have had their testing capacity reduced to cope with outbreaks elsewhere. Is this within the 300,000 tests which the Secretary of State has mentioned as being his aspiration? As the Minister will be aware, public health experts warn that this could miss the start of new spikes, so I would be very grateful if he could clarify the exact position on the rollout of mass testing.<\/p><p pid=\"b453.0\/3\">Saliva testing is being used in Hong Kong, as we know. Would the Minister be able to ensure a quick turnaround of these tests? Has he seen the study from Yale which suggests that saliva testing could be as sensitive as nose and throat swabs? What is his attitude towards pool testing, which surely could increase capacity in areas of low prevalence? Does the Minister have a plan to introduce pool testing? Will we now allow GPs to carry out testing or, at the very least, arrange tests for their patients directly? They currently have to ask patients to log on to the national system, which may be causing huge delays.<\/p><p pid=\"b453.0\/4\">A testing problem came to my notice in an email I received from an English family on holiday in Northern Ireland. They went there to have a break and did everything they could to ensure their safe passage&#8212;they did not stop for toilet breaks, they packed lunches, they booked the shortest ferry crossing, and they were heading to a house that had not been occupied for a week. However, something went wrong, and the father became ill. He said: &#8220;Getting a test should be easy, right? Well, wrong. When we first tried to get a test, the booking system was completely down. It was not working online or by telephone. When it eventually resumed, I was offered a test appointment 460 miles, and a ferry journey, away in Scotland. I was worried about having potentially to drive 20 or 30 minutes with a raging fever, so we ordered the home tests. The kits took 48 hours to arrive. Remarkably, there seems to be no test-kit storage site in Northern Ireland itself, so they have to come from the mainland, even though one of the companies than manufactures tests&#8212;Randox&#8212;is based in Northern Ireland.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b453.0\/5\">This person had the usual problems that lots of people have when doing a self-administered test and returning the results. They were in an isolated place, so they chose to use the specially designated postal box,  which meant his wife driving 25 minutes. That box was inside a building. It did not seem to cross anybody&#8217;s mind that potentially infectious people should not be entering a building full of people. When the wife talked to someone about their concerns, they said that they were not allowed to handle parcels and she should put the results in another post box. It took six days from the husband developing the fever and seeking a test to getting the result. When it came, it was not absolutely conclusive. We know that these tests can sometimes be only 70% accurate. This person is still very ill and still in Northern Ireland. He is an academic who, as it happens, is also a scientist. He is very disappointed with the 111 service, which he called to ask for another test. He was told that he could not have one, that he probably did not have Covid, and that he should go back to work. It seems to me that this system is not working terribly well. What is the Minister&#8217;s view of this sorry tale, which raises all sorts of issues about testing and tracing, at least in Northern Ireland?<\/p><p pid=\"b453.0\/6\">I move on to the cancer plan and whether a task force will be in operation. The number of new cancer patients presenting is down by one-quarter this year, the number of appointments for specialist cancer treatment is now also falling, and the amount of money available for clinical trials has fallen through the floor. This means that people will die. What are the Government&#8217;s plans to move this forward?<\/p><p pid=\"b453.0\/7\">We know that a vaccine is our best hope to stop this pandemic. It will save hundreds of millions of lives. We on this side of the House have offered to work with the Minister on a cross-party basis to promote uptake and challenge the poison of anti-vax myths. That offer remains in place. We would work constructively with the Government on any proposals that they bring to the House to deal with those myths.<\/p><p pid=\"b453.0\/8\">On Public Health England, the Minister is aware that we on this side of the House think that embarking on a distracting restructuring of Public Health England in the middle of a pandemic is very risky. Conservative MPs seem to like to blame Public Health England and this will sap morale even further. The UK has suffered the highest per capita death rate of any major world economy. To get through this winter safely, our NHS and public health services need resources, staff, protective equipment, fair-pay security and the support of this Government. I hope they will be able to deliver that.<\/p><p pid=\"b453.0\/9\">Finally, the Minister said a few minutes ago that the folic acid issue would not be dealt with until after the pandemic. He needs to write to the House about exactly what that means and what the timeline is.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b23.1\/1\">With your permission, and indeed your encouragement, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on coronavirus. The latest figures demonstrate how much progress we are making in our fight against this invisible killer. There are currently 60 patients in mechanical ventilator beds with coronavirus&#8212;that is down from 3,300 at the peak&#8212;and the latest daily number for recorded deaths is two. However, although those figures are lower than before, we must remain vigilant. I said in July that a second wave was rolling across Europe and, sadly, we are now seeing an exponential rise in the number of cases in France and Spain&#8212;hospitalisations are rising there too. We must do everything in our power to protect against a second wave here in the UK, so I would like to update the House on the work we are doing to that end.<\/p><p pid=\"b23.1\/2\">To support the return of education, and to get our economy moving again, it is critical that we all play our part. The first line of defence is, and has always been, social distancing and personal hygiene. We will soon be launching a new campaign reminding people of how they can help to stop the spread of coronavirus: &#8220;Hands, face, space and get a test if you have symptoms.&#8221; Everyone has a part to play in following the social distancing rules and doing the basics. After all, this is a virus that thrives on social contact. I would like to thank the British public for everything they have done so far, but we must continue and we must maintain our resolve.<\/p><p pid=\"b23.1\/3\">The second line of defence is testing and contact tracing. We have now processed over 16 million tests in this country, and we are investing in new testing technologies, including a rapid test for coronavirus and other winter viruses that will help to provide on-the-spot results in under 90 minutes, helping us to break chains of transmission quickly. These tests do not require a trained health professional to operate them, so they can be rolled out in more non-clinical settings. We now have one of the most comprehensive systems of testing in the world, and we want to go much, much further.<\/p><p pid=\"b23.1\/4\">Next, we come to contact tracing. NHS Test and Trace is consistently reaching tens of thousands of people who need to isolate each week. As I mentioned in answer to a question earlier, the latest week&#8217;s data shows that 84.3% of contacts were reached and asked to self-isolate, where contact details were provided. Since its launch, we have reached over 300,000 people, who may have been unwittingly carrying the virus. Today, we also launch our new system of pay to isolate. We want to support people on low incomes in areas with a high incidence of covid-19 who need to self-isolate and are unable to work from home. Under the scheme, people who test positive for the virus will receive &#163;130 for the 10-day period they have to stay at home. Other contacts, including, for instance, members of their household, who have to self-isolate for 14 days, will be entitled to a payment of &#163;182. We have rolled out the scheme in Blackburn with Darwen, Pendle and Oldham, and we will look to expand it as we see how it operates on the ground.<\/p><p pid=\"b23.1\/5\">The third line of defence is targeted local intervention. Over the summer, we have worked hard to integrate our national system with the local response, and the local action that we are taking is working. In Leicester, as <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jon Ashworth\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25120\">the hon. Member for Leicester South (Jonathan Ashworth)<\/phrase> knows well, as a local MP, in Luton and in parts of northern England, we have been able to release local interventions, because the case rate has come down. We also now publish significantly more local information, and I put in place a system for building local consensus with all elected officials, including colleagues across this House, wherever possible. Our goal is that local action should be as targeted as possible. This combination of social distancing, test and trace and local action is a system in which we all have a responsibility to act, and this gives us the tools to control the virus while protecting education, the economy and the things we hold dear.<\/p><p pid=\"b23.1\/6\">Meanwhile, work on a vaccine continues to progress. The best-case scenario remains a vaccine this year. While no vaccine technology is certain, since the House last met, vaccine trials have gone well. The Oxford vaccine continues to be the world leader, and we have now contracted with six different vaccine providers so that whichever comes off, we can get access in this country. While we give vaccine development all our support, we will insist on safety and efficacy.<\/p><p pid=\"b23.1\/7\">I can update the House on changes to legislation that I propose to bring forward in the coming weeks to ensure that a vaccine approved by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency can be deployed here, whether or not it has a European licence. The MHRA standards are equal to the highest in the world. Furthermore, on the development of the vaccine, which proceeds at pace, I will shortly ask the House to approve a broader range of qualified clinical personnel who can deploy the vaccine in order of clinical priority, as I mentioned in questions. As well as the potential vaccine, we also have a flu vaccination programme&#8212;the biggest flu vaccination programme in history&#8212;to roll out this year.<\/p><p pid=\"b23.1\/8\">Finally, Mr Speaker, in preparation for this winter, we are expanding A&amp;E capacity. We have allocated billions more funding to the NHS. We have retained the Nightingale hospitals to ensure that the NHS is fully prepared, and we published last month updated guidance on the protection of social care. As well as this, last month, figures showed a record number of nurses in the NHS&#8212;over 13,000 more than last year&#8212;and record numbers of both doctors and nurses going into training. We are doing all we can to prevent a second peak to prepare the NHS for winter and to restore as much of life and the things we love as possible. As schools go back, we must all remain vigilant and throughout the crisis we all have a role to play.<\/p><p pid=\"b23.1\/9\">This is a war against an invisible enemy in which we are all on the same side. As we learn more and more about this unprecedented virus, so we constantly seek to improve our response to protect the health of the nation and the things we hold dear. I commend this statement to the House.<\/p><p pid=\"b23.1\/10\">Jonathan Ashworth (Leicester South) (Lab\/Co-op): We are indeed all on the same side in fighting this virus. I hope that the Secretary of State understands that when we raise issues, we do so because we urge the Government  to improve their response to fighting this virus. This remains a lethal virus that leaves many with serious, debilitating sickness. Everything must be done to drive down and eliminate infections and suppress the virus completely.<\/p><p pid=\"b23.1\/11\">With that in mind, I hope that the Secretary of State can answer a few questions today. I am grateful for advance sight of his statement. First, to avoid a second national lockdown, which we all want to avoid, an effective test and tracing regime is vital. I listened carefully to the figures that he outlined, but he did not tell the House that the numbers going into the system have actually fallen in the past week, from 79% to 72%. This system is not yet world beating.<\/p><p pid=\"b23.1\/12\">Throughout questions the Secretary of State has rejected criticisms of the private sector contractors who are involved in delivering the system, so there is no point in me raising them again, but would it not be better if money was spent on investing in local public health teams, particularly in those areas where restrictions are in place, so that they can do more door-to-door testing, as we have seen, for example, in Leicester? Surely that would be a better use of public funding, for example, than paying for so-called influencers on Instagram to big up test and trace.<\/p><p pid=\"b23.1\/13\">On testing itself, the Secretary of State now supports mass testing as a policy aim. It is something I have been calling for, for some months. It is something the former Health Secretary, the Chair of the Health Select Committee, has been calling for. Indeed, we tried to persuade the Secretary of State of its merits before the summer when we asked him to introduce regular testing of NHS front-line staff. He whipped his MPs to vote against it, but will he now, given that he is in favour of mass testing, introduce regular weekly testing of all front-line NHS workers?<\/p><p pid=\"b23.1\/14\">To move to mass testing means evolving our testing regime from one that provides antibody tests and diagnostic PCR&#8212;polymerase chain reaction&#8212;tests effectively to a system of mass screening using more rapid, on-the-spot antigen tests. The Secretary of State referred to rapid tests in his statement. Can he tell us when rapid, on-the-spot antigen tests will be rolled out across society and which sectors of the workforce will be first in the queue to access those tests?<\/p><p pid=\"b23.1\/15\">Will the Secretary of State also look at introducing saliva testing, which is being used in Hong Kong, for example, and will he ensure the quick turnaround of tests? I wonder whether he has seen the study from Yale that suggests that saliva testing could be as sensitive as nose and throat swabs. What is his attitude towards pooled testing, which would surely increase the capacity in areas of low prevalence? Does he have a plan to introduce pooled testing? Will he allow GPs to carry out testing or, at the very least, to arrange a test for their patients directly? They currently have to ask their patients to log on to the national system, which is causing huge delays.<\/p><p pid=\"b23.1\/16\">On local lockdowns, the Secretary of State said that he wants to involve MPs and elected officials. What process will be used to properly consult local Members of Parliament? What can MPs expect? When a decision has been made to put a local area into restriction, will he publish the specific evidence behind that decision?   Why is it, for example, that our constituents in Leicester are not able to gather in private gardens? Can he publish the scientific evidence for that decision?<\/p><p pid=\"b23.1\/17\">In Trafford, we have seen infections increase. The local authority leader and the director of public health felt that restrictions should continue, but <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Graham Brady\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10062\">the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale West (Sir Graham Brady)<\/phrase> felt that they should be lifted. Why did the Secretary of State overrule the advice of the director of public health and instead endorse the representations of the chairman of the 1922 committee? There was a similar story in Bradford, and in Bolton, where restrictions are due to be lifted tonight, infections are increasing. Is it still his plan to lift restrictions tonight in Trafford and Bolton, even though infections are increasing compared with last week, when he made his initial decision?<\/p><p pid=\"b23.1\/18\">The Secretary of State is right: in the end, a vaccine is our best hope to stop this pandemic. Vaccines save hundreds of millions of lives every year, and I repeat my offer to work with him on a cross-party basis to promote uptake and challenge the poison of anti-vax myths, including those that we witnessed at the irresponsible and dangerous demonstration this weekend in Trafalgar Square. We will work constructively with him on the proposals he brings to the House. Does he share my concerns about those leaders, such as Putin and Trump, who are trying to short-cut testing to rush out a vaccine, undermining safety and efficacy, potentially damaging millions of lives and giving succour to the anti-vax movement?<\/p><p pid=\"b23.1\/19\">Finally, health protection is built upon good population health. Poverty makes people sick. Ending cuts and tackling deprivation as a determinant of ill health is vital to improving and protecting people&#8217;s health. But the Secretary of State is now embarking on a risky, distracting restructuring of Public Health England in the middle of a pandemic. Tory MPs like to blame Public Health England&#8212;it is such rotten luck that these decent, hard-working, competent Ministers are always let down by the people who work for them&#8212;but is not the reality that this restructuring will sap morale and focus and should wait until the end of the pandemic? The UK has suffered the highest per capita death rate of any major world economy. To get through this winter safely, our NHS and public health services need resources, and staff need personal protective equipment, fair pay, security and support. I hope he can deliver that.<\/p>",

The home testing provision is part of the UK Government administered system, but we will work with the UK Government if there are practical difficulties with it. That should not have happened. Obviously, I do not know why it happened, but I am keen to look into it.<\/p><p>In relation to capacity, yesterday, for example, around 22,000 tests were carried out across Scotland. The daily capacity is in the region of 40,000 tests a day, and we have plans to increase that to approximately 60,000 tests a day. We are confident in our plans to have that capacity right now and to build capacity as we go into winter.<\/p><p>One of the things that we have experienced this week, for which we have contingencies that have been activated, is that there will inevitably be points when demand peaks beyond the average level. There may be reasons for that that we can foresee and reasons for that that we do not foresee. For example, there may be a circulation of another virus in a particular area or a Covid outbreak in a particular area that increases demand. So, one of the key focuses for us this week has been on ensuring that those contingency arrangements for when we need short-term boosts in capacity are there and can be activated. Those are things that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport and I, among others, consider with officials on a regular basis.<\/p><p>Overall, our testing system is working well. Test and protect is working very well, but we may face a period, as we go into winter, when the pressures become much more significant again. We are therefore looking ahead to make sure that we can cope with that.<\/p><p>We do antibody testing in Scotland for surveillance purposes. The issue with antibody tests right now is twofold: there are still questions around it, although I think the quality of the test is getting better and effective tests are now available, but the biggest problem is that we do not really know what the results of an antibody test mean. If somebody has an antibody test and it tells them that they have antibodies, we do not know whether that gives them immunity to Covid for a day, a week, a month, a year or forever. So, there is still a real problem with asking anybody to make any decisions about how they live their lives on the basis of antibody testing. Hopefully, that science will develop over the weeks and months to come, but we do not yet know that.<\/p><p>One of the developments that we saw earlier this week, in Hong Kong, was researchers thinking that they may have discovered the first case of reinfection with Covid, which suggests&#8212;although I do not think anybody can be definitive about this at this stage&#8212;that the period of immunity may not be that long. That is the biggest doubt about antibody testing, which is why we have to be cautious about the reliance that we place on it.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b328.0\/1\">My Lords, I too thank the Minister for introducing these regulations. The very clear Explanatory Memorandum rightly records that,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b328.0\/2\">&#8220;human rights violations by State actors, and &#8230; non-State actors, leads to unstable and less prosperous societies. Such conduct perpetuates violent conflict, creates a world where terrorism flourishes and where democratic institutions are weakened. It has a devastating impact on individuals and &#8230; societies &#8230; deterring such conduct would help create fairer and more just societies, which support the long-term global conditions most conducive to security, economic growth and the safety of all.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b328.0\/3\">That is a very clear statement.<\/p><p pid=\"b328.0\/4\">As I did when we discussed sanctions recently, I once more pay tribute to all those who have played a part here, from Ministers, including the noble Lord, officials in his department, organisations such as Transparency International, and campaigners such as Amal Clooney, Bill Browder and the murdered Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, himself. I am glad that the Government have listed 25 Russian nationals linked to his case, as well as 20 of those who played their part in the death of Jamal Khashoggi.<\/p><p pid=\"b328.0\/5\">However, as others have said, there are omissions. Many noble Lords have mentioned China. I too ask: might those who are oppressing the Uighurs be included? Will proper consideration be given to the China Tribunal&#8217;s conclusion about organ harvesting, which was flagged up by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and might sanctions result? What about those taking action in Hong Kong? How do we make sure that in our newly exposed position outside the EU we are willing to place sanctions in relation to China, as my noble friend Lady Smith of Newnham and others asked?<\/p><p pid=\"b328.0\/6\">Several noble Lords mentioned corruption. In their equivalent legislation, the United States and Canada include corruption. The Government are already considering adding this, looking at the United Nations Convention against Corruption. Do they intend to base the definition of corruption on the UN convention? Will it include embezzlement of state funds, to cover kleptocrats, and bribery? Can the Minister also tell us how the new sanctions regime will be overseen so that it is not knocked off course by short-term concerns? Will its oversight be separate from ministries which might have other interests here? What parliamentary oversight will there be? It has been suggested that there should be routes other than via Ministers for proposing or considering whether individuals should be sanctioned. Might there be a judicial route here? I note the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws.<\/p><p pid=\"b328.0\/7\">Within the EU, particularly with Sweden and the Netherlands, we were working to develop similar human rights sanctions arrangements for all EU countries, which would have had a major effect. Like my noble friend Lord Bruce, I believe that it is clear that we would have been much more effective if were working  within the EU. Sanctions across the EU would have been much more powerful than we can be by ourselves, and the pressure on future Ministers not to take action would have been less acute. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Rochester is right about the risks of our isolation and that the rest of our foreign policy must be consistent with what we are saying here.<\/p><p pid=\"b328.0\/8\">Nevertheless, we welcome these regulations and look forward to the further development of our sanctions policy. I too wish the Minister a very enjoyable holiday and thank him and his officials for their readiness to engage across all areas of foreign affairs. I look forward to hearing his response.<\/p>",

They will be in place until January 2021, although today&#8217;s news from Hong Kong is a very timely reminder of the gravity of our situation. The Secretary of State must review them every fortnight. Given that <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-07-16\">16 July<\/phrase> has passed, can the Minister please let us know the outcomes of that first review? Has there been any significant change in the situation? How will this be conveyed to Parliament during the Recess?<\/p><p pid=\"b293.0\/2\">We know that there has been a considerable amount of testing in Leicester and the surrounding area, and that there is still a push for more testing. How is this progressing? What proportion of the population has now been tested, and is the sample size large enough to make meaningful decisions on a way forward?<\/p><p pid=\"b293.0\/3\">Why is sport singled out for preferential treatment in SIs? We are a nation that loves our sport, but why is a sportsperson deemed more worthy than, for example, a world-class organist? They cannot take their instrument home, but their form goes unless they continue to practise. What is the harm in them trying to maintain their standard, too, if they can practise in a distanced fashion?<\/p><p pid=\"b293.0\/4\">Finally, one area of concern that came from press coverage of the Leicester outbreak was employee safety. Employers have a legal responsibility to protect their employees and other people on site, and most are diligent. On the news that evening, we saw garment trade workers in Dickensian conditions, neither wearing masks nor distancing from their colleagues. What penalties does an employer pay for this dereliction of duty? What confidence have the Government that this was the exception and not the rule?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b2273.0\/1\">My Lords, I declare my interests as in the register. I join others in welcoming the Bill; it has been a long time coming. Though I have seen and acknowledge the benefits of freedom of movement, clearly the world is different today from what it was 10 or 20 years ago, for better or worse. It is a more volatile and unstable place and there is a lot more economic migration. Therefore, it is only right that we design and shift to a system which is sovereign and based on skills&#8212;that is what this country needs.<\/p><p pid=\"b2273.0\/2\">I hope that, as we make this transition over the coming 12 months or so, we send a message to the world that we are still open to migrants and that we are not closing the shop or raising the drawbridge. In fact, I hope we can see migrants&#8212;such as me and my own family, who came here from Hong Kong in my father&#8217;s generation&#8212;as people who want to come and contribute to Britain, be a bridge to the rest of the world once they are here and be part of helping to level up the country, which I know is a government priority.<\/p><p pid=\"b2273.0\/3\">I will not dwell on the Henry VIII clauses, because it is important that the Government have the flexibility they need over the coming months. However, it is important that Parliament is involved in this process and in the evolution of our immigration system, and  that the Government do not create policy on the fly, which there is a risk of given the scope of the powers the Bill might give.<\/p><p pid=\"b2273.0\/4\">I have a couple of questions for the Minister. First, while this is clearly not a regional matter, certain regions could benefit as well as suffer if this policy is implemented poorly. For example, areas that are already wealthy may get some of the more skilled, talented and wealthier migrants, whereas there are parts of the country which really need an influx of talent from overseas. Do the Government have plans, particularly around free ports, that are envisaged to encourage that kind of shift?<\/p><p pid=\"b2273.0\/5\">Secondly, I am worried about capacity: what preparations have been made in the Home Office and the Border Force to cope with the change and the demand that may come? If we can get our act together, I am excited about the potential to harness technologies such as blockchain. Estonia, for example, even has e-citizens who cannot come to the country on a long-term basis but can make use of its law, business and the ability to set up shop in Estonia. Is reform coming to the Home Office to enable it to handle this demand, given that is has such a backlog of regular passports to process currently?<\/p><p pid=\"b2273.0\/6\">Could we one day shift to a system where we can match the demand from different industries in closer to real time? There is such a delay between knowing where the skills are needed and whether you can match them through local skills coming through the pipeline, or if you need to import labour from overseas. Technology such as blockchain and internet technologies may be able to facilitate better matching than we currently have.<\/p>",

This legislation and its strict implementation constitutes a clear breach of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, undermining the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; framework. It cannot be ignored.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>I set out here the Government&#8217;s plans for a new Hong Kong British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) Visa and for the suspension of our Extradition Treaty with Hong Kong.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Hong Kong BN(O) Visa<\/strong><\/p><p> <\/p><p>Before the handover of the UK&#8217;s responsibilities for Hong Kong, we created the British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) nationality status which was opened to people in Hong Kong, through a registration process, to those who had British Dependent Territories citizenship. This status recognised the special and enduring ties the UK has with those people as a result of our role in Hong Kong before 1997. Now that China through its actions has changed the circumstances that BN(O) citizens find themselves in, it is right that we should change the entitlements which are attached to BN(O) status. I have decided to significantly improve those entitlements, to reassure BN(O) citizens that they have options to live in the UK if they decide that is an appropriate choice for them.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Today I am laying before the House a command paper (CP 280) providing further detail on a new bespoke Hong Kong BN(O) Visa, covering eligibility, conditions and entitlements, the application process, timing, the position for BN(O) citizens in the UK, and arrangements for BN(O) citizens arriving at the border.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>BN(O) citizens in Hong Kong are in a unique position, which is why I have designed a policy which is specific to them in the wider immigration system. It will not set a precedent. It is a proportionate response to the situation which has arisen. The UK is entitled to decide on the rights attaching to BN(O) status which it has previously conferred and that is what I am doing with these changes.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>My offer to BN(O) citizens is therefore a very generous one. There will be no skills tests or minimum income requirements, economic needs tests or caps on numbers. I am giving BN(O) citizens the opportunity to acquire full British citizenship. They do not need to have a job before coming to the UK - they can look for work once here. They may bring their immediate dependants, including non-BN(O) citizens.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>At the same time, it is not an unconditional offer. BN(O) citizens will need to support themselves independently while living in the UK; they must meet strict criminality checks and stay of good character; they will need to pay visa fees, the Immigration Health Surcharge and, if they subsequently apply for citizenship after they become settled, the fee and meet the criteria. These are reasonable things to ask of BN(O) citizens, and BN(O) citizens will need to ask themselves whether coming to the UK to put down roots here is the right choice for them. It is a choice I am making available and I welcome warmly all those who decide to take it.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We are planning to open the Hong Kong BN(O) Visa for applications from January 2021. BN(O) citizens do not need to hold a BN(O) passport in order to apply for the visa &#8211; so there is no need to apply for or renew a BN(O) passport specifically for this purpose. All BN(O) citizens will need a visa to be able to settle in the UK.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We understand there will be cases where the children of BN(O) citizens will not normally be eligible because they were born after 1997 (so are not BN(O) citizens) and are over 18 so they would not normally be considered as a dependant in the UK&#8217;s immigration system. Therefore, in compelling and compassionate circumstances, and where applications are made as a family unit, we will use discretion to grant a visa to the children of BN(O) citizens who fall into this category and who are still dependent on the BN(O) citizen.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>If the above doesn&#8217;t apply then the existing youth mobility scheme is open to people in Hong Kong aged between 18-30, with 1000 places currently available each year. Individuals from Hong Kong will also be able to apply to come to the UK under the terms of the UK&#8217;s new Points Based System, which will enable individuals to come to the UK in a wider range of professions and at a lower general salary threshold than in the past.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Home Office looks forward to receiving applications for this visa.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Extradition<\/strong><\/p><p> <\/p><p>The imposition of new National Security Legislation has significantly changed the assumptions underpinning the 1998 Agreement for the Surrender of Fugitive Offenders, our extradition treaty with Hong Kong. The Government remains especially concerned about Articles 55 to 59 of the law, which could give mainland authorities the ability to assume jurisdiction over certain cases and try those cases in Chinese courts.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The National Security Law provides no legal or judicial safeguards in such cases. The decision can be made by the mainland authorities with no reference to the Hong Kong Government. Other than access to a lawyer there are no legal or judicial safeguards in such cases and mainland systems of investigation, trial and punishment, about which the international community has long standing concerns, would apply. If China applies that legislation extraterritorially, it will pose a risk not only to Hong Kong residents who travel abroad, but potentially to British and other Nationals travelling into Hong Kong.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Hong Kong Department of Justice has therefore been notified of our intention to suspend the extradition treaty, immediately and indefinitely, until the UK is sufficiently assured that the new National Security Agency established by China in Hong Kong will not be able to initiate extradition requests to the UK, that extradition requests will not be sent in relation to newly created offences under the National Security Law; and that people extradited from the UK could never be transferred from Hong Kong to mainland China without the UK's explicit consent.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The suspension will protect those resident in the UK, including those who may soon be here by virtue of the new immigration route, from unwarranted pursuit through the provisions of the Extradition Treaty.<\/p><div class=\"qna-result-writtenstatement-joint-statement\"><div class=\"qna-result-writtenstatement-joint-statement-row\">\n                                This statement has also been made in the House of Lords: \n                                <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parliament.uk\/business\/publications\/written-questions-answers-statements\/written-statement\/Lords\/2020-07-22\/HLWS415\/\" id=\"ctl00_ctl00_FormContent_SiteSpecificPlaceholder_PageContent_ctrlQnAWSList_rptWrittenStatements_ctl09_ctrlWrittenStatementItem_rptJointStatement_ctl00_hypJointStatementID\">HLWS415<\/a><\/div><\/div>",

Of course, under normal circumstances, none of us would have supported such restrictions, but, given the circumstances, they were absolutely necessary.<\/p><p>The amendments give effect to the previously announced indicative timings for the opening of, among other things, museums, galleries, bookies, spas, tattoo and piercing businesses, restaurants, bars and clubs. Funerals are no longer restricted to close family and friends, beer gardens can reopen, and so on. I welcome the easing of the restrictions, as it indicates that, to an extent, we are getting on top of the virus. However, the situation remains extremely dangerous, and we need to listen to the experts, particularly in the field of public health.<\/p><p>I heard Pam Cameron mention the R number. That was the third time that I heard it mentioned today. The leader of the Ulster Unionist Party mentioned it on the radio this morning. I also heard Gabriel Scally, who is pre-eminent in the field of public health &#8212; one of the most renowned experts in these islands on public health &#8212; saying that when the transmission rate is as low as it is, particularly here, the R rate is not in itself a useful measurement. What is more important is the number of people being infected.<\/p><p>We need to listen to the experts. We also need to look at the countries that have done best in suppressing the virus. Many of them have done particularly well: New Zealand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Germany, and so on. We should listen to the advice that we are getting from people such as Gabriel Scally and Devi Sridhar, who advises the Scottish Parliament, and that advice is that, for the purpose of public health, we should treat the island of Ireland as one unit. We should coordinate, North and South, all the moves that we take in relation to the virus.<\/p><p>It is welcome that there was a memorandum of understanding (MOU) a few months back, but that in itself is not enough. There needs to be constant contact between the Executive, the Dublin Government and both Chief Medical Officers and Chief Scientific Advisers.<\/p><p>That is what we need to do. We need to continue to find, test, trace, isolate and support. That is what will keep the virus suppressed. That is the message that needs to go out.<\/p>",

Member for South Ribble (Katherine Fletcher)<\/phrase>, as I recall I did when she made her maiden speech. I rise to speak in support of new clause 4 tabled by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jonathan Djanogly\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10854\">the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr Djanogly)<\/phrase>, who I know is scheduled to speak immediately after me and will doubtless give a detailed account of the reasons for it. In anticipation of that, I wish to set out why the Liberal Democrats support it.<\/p><p pid=\"c1915.0\/2\">From <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-01-01\">1 January<\/phrase> 2021, the UK will be setting out on its own for the first time in nearly 40 years in developing its own independent trade policy and negotiating its own trade agreements. The implications of this step on everyday life in the UK are huge, and possibly not yet fully appreciated. Trade negotiations are complex and delicate. Securing access to international markets for one sector may mean conceding international access to our domestic markets for another. Securing preferential treatment on tariffs for some of our goods may mean relaxing import controls on something else.<\/p><p pid=\"c1915.0\/3\">We have a complex economy currently disrupted by the need to beat the coronavirus, and on the verge of major change as we transition away from carbon-emitting activity. Technological change offers both threat and opportunity. We must also consider that our economy is imperfect in its distribution of wealth and opportunity, and look for ways to address this challenge. Increasingly, the UK is being called on to stand up for the defence of fundamental human rights and liberal democracy and  use the powers at its disposal to effect change internationally. Our trade policy and agreements touch on all those urgent challenges. How can we best leverage our economic advantages to deliver current and future prosperity for UK citizens and influence peaceful progress abroad?<\/p><p pid=\"c1915.0\/4\">To determine that those decisions are best made behind closed doors without consultation or discussion is an assault on our very idea of what Parliament is for. We need to balance all the competing pressures from different economic sectors and geographical regions, fully considering the impact on different groups of workers, and determine whether we prioritise climate commitments over economic growth. How can that be done effectively without recourse to Parliament? The British people deserve to have their interests properly represented when these questions are being asked and for the answers given by Ministers to be put on the public record and judged accordingly.<\/p><p pid=\"c1915.0\/5\">I also speak in support of new clause 9 tabled by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Caroline Lucas\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24910\">the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas)<\/phrase> and supported by the Liberal Democrats because we recognise the urgency of taking action against the very real threat of climate change. It is essential that we enshrine that urgency in our trade legislation, so that negotiating partners know, before the first papers are exchanged, that they must comply with our environmental goals. Our economy is transitioning away from carbon emissions, in accordance with the democratic mandate to achieve net zero carbon by 2050, and that progress must be underpinned in every trade agreement we negotiate. Our commitment to net zero cannot be traded away in pursuit of other goals.<\/p><p pid=\"c1915.0\/6\">The Liberal Democrats have also tabled amendments that relate to dispute resolution and human rights. Dispute resolution is fundamental to ensuring that democratic decision-making that relates to the expenditure of taxpayers&#8217; money, or regulation of food standards, cannot be undermined by law suits from foreign corporations. At this stage, the UK Government should rule out any use of investor-state dispute settlement procedures from UK trade deals, to safeguard our ability to determine our own regulatory environment, without the threat of sanction from foreign investors. That is fundamental to ensuring that our NHS remains free at the point of use for all UK citizens, and that we set our own standards on animal welfare and food quality.<\/p><p pid=\"c1915.0\/7\">Earlier I referred to the UK&#8217;s powers to effect change internationally, and to how we can use our trade agreements as leverage. We have been forcefully reminded of our need to use those powers to influence foreign partners to respect human rights, thanks to recent events in Hong Kong and China. It would send a powerful message to the Chinese regime, and to others around the world who hope to trade with us, if we enshrined in law our commitment to upholding human rights as a non-negotiable element of our trade deals. That message will be compelling only if we lead by example, and that example starts with parliamentary oversight of negotiating mandates and trade deals. I implore colleagues to support new clause 4 this evening.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c1833.0\/1\">I thank the Foreign Secretary for his statement and for advance sight of it. May I be clear that the Opposition strongly welcome both of the measures he has announced today? He is right to ensure that Britain does not allow our exports to be used against the people of Hong Kong, and I thank him warmly for taking this step forwards.<\/p><p pid=\"c1833.0\/2\">I am particularly glad that the Government have listened to my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Emily Thornberry\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11656\">the Member for Islington South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry)<\/phrase>, the shadow Secretary of State for International Trade, and suspended the export of surveillance equipment alongside the suspension of the export of crowd control equipment, which was demanded of the Government by the Labour Opposition last year. Will the Foreign Secretary go further and also review the training of the Hong Kong police by the College of Policing and other UK police forces to ensure that we are playing a part in helping to uphold, and not suppress, the rights of the people of Hong Kong?<\/p><p pid=\"c1833.0\/3\">May I also welcome the indefinite suspension of the extradition treaty and the safeguards that the Foreign Secretary announced today? It affords protection to the Hong Kong diaspora community here in the UK, and particularly to the brave young pro-democracy activists, whom I recently had the pleasure to meet.<\/p><p pid=\"c1833.0\/4\">We believe it is vital that the world shows a co-ordinated front on this issue. I was heartened to hear that the Foreign Secretary had discussions with our Five Eyes partners. Canada, Australia and the USA have already taken this step. Will he speak to other key allies, including Germany, to ensure that there is a co-ordinated international response? He also made no mention of our Commonwealth partners. Has he reached out to those Commonwealth countries that have extradition treaties with Hong Kong, to ensure that BNO passport holders and pro-democracy activists can travel freely without fear of arrest and extradition?<\/p><p pid=\"c1833.0\/5\">The Foreign Secretary could take a number of other steps. He made a commitment today that the UK will not accept investment that compromises our national security. Will he confirm that that will extend to the proposed nuclear power project at Bradwell, and will he tell us what assessment the Government have made of the security implications of Sizewell C?<\/p><p pid=\"c1833.0\/6\">Elections are due to take place in Hong Kong in the autumn, and we are concerned that, just as in the case of Joshua Wong, the Chinese Government may seek to bar candidates from standing. A clear statement from the Foreign Secretary today that candidates selected through the primary process are legitimate and must be allowed to stand in those elections would send the message that, as he says, the world is watching. I also ask him to work internationally to ensure that independent election observers are allowed into Hong Kong to oversee those elections.<\/p><p pid=\"c1833.0\/7\">The Foreign Secretary was a little irritated by my suggestion yesterday that the UK ought to impose Magnitsky sanctions on Chinese officials involved in  persecuting the Uyghur people and undermining basic freedoms in Hong Kong, but I gently say to him that we have known that Uyghurs have been detained in camps since at least 2017. Has any work at all been done on that by the Foreign Office? Given that the USA has already imposed similar sanctions, is he working with our US counterparts to build the case for UK sanctions, and will he discuss this with the US Secretary of State tomorrow when he meets him?<\/p><p pid=\"c1833.0\/8\">The Foreign Secretary may not have done the groundwork to enable him to impose Magnitsky sanctions now, but his Government have the power right now to take action. He could, as the US has done, bar Communist party of China officials from the UK. Why has he not done that? The Chinese ambassador said yesterday that he reserves the right to take action against British companies. What discussions has the Foreign Secretary had with British companies operating in China to offer advice and assistance? I have asked him a number of times whether he has had discussions with HSBC and Standard Chartered about their stated support for the national security law. He must condemn that support. We should be showing the best of British business to the world, not the worst.<\/p><p pid=\"c1833.0\/9\">I was pleased to hear that the Foreign Secretary had discussions with Australia and New Zealand about their making a similar offer to BNO passport holders, but we are concerned, after asking a range of parliamentary questions, that there are serious holes in this offer. We have been told by the Government that BNO passport holders and their families will not receive home status for tuition fees, will not have access to most benefits and will have to pay the NHS surcharge. That seems wrong.<\/p><p pid=\"c1833.0\/10\">We are welcoming BNO passport holders to the UK for similar reasons to refugees, but these measures are completely out of step with that. Without serious action before these proposals are published, we will essentially be offering safe harbour only to the rich and highly skilled. That may benefit the UK, but it lacks the generosity and moral clarity that this situation demands. The Foreign Secretary will also know that many young pro-democracy activists are too young to be eligible for BNO passports. The Home Secretary said last week that she was considering a specific scheme for 18 to 23-year-olds. Will those details be published before the summer, and can he provide more detail today?<\/p><p pid=\"c1833.0\/11\">Finally, this must mark the start of a more strategic approach to China based on an ethical approach to foreign policy and an end to the naivety of the golden era years. If it does, the Foreign Secretary can be assured that he will have the Opposition&#8217;s full support. Like him, our quarrel is not with the people of China, but the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong, the actions of the Chinese Government in the South China sea and the appalling treatment of the Uyghur people are reasons to act now. We will not be able to say in future years that we did not know. I urge him to work with colleagues across government to ensure that this marks the start of a strategic approach to China and the start of a new era.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1623.1\/1\">No, we have heard enough from the hon. Gentleman over the course of the afternoon. I am going to reply to some of the points that have been made in the debate.<\/p><p pid=\"b1623.1\/2\">We have heard the great passion about both referendums in 2014 and 2016. Brexit and Scottish separation aroused great passions, but we have to respect the results of both referendums, and it is deeply patronising to say that people did not know what they were voting for in either case. The SNP says that the people of Scotland did not know about Brexit. I invite it to look at page 217 of its prospectus for independence, where the prospect of Brexit was raised. Is the SNP saying that the Scottish people were too stupid to read it and understand it? We should respect the result of the 2014 referendum, and we should respect the result of the 2016 referendum.<\/p><p pid=\"b1623.1\/3\">Many of my hon. Friends made this point, but I particularly highlight the contributions from my hon. Friends the Members for Hyndburn (Sara Britcliffe) and for West Bromwich West (Shaun Bailey), who are absolutely right that they are now representing what their constituents voted for, unlike their predecessors. It is disappointing that there are so few Members from the official Opposition here. What is their Brexit policy now? Are they going to respect the result? Are they going to join us in the Lobby to make sure that we do not extend the transition period at the end of tonight, or is their absence today indicative of the fact that they still secretly want to stop Brexit, but dare not admit it?<\/p><p pid=\"b1623.1\/4\">Let me turn to the issue of extending the transition. As many hon. Members have said&#8212;especially <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Christine Jardine\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25675\">the hon. Member for Edinburgh West (Christine Jardine)<\/phrase>&#8212;the Brexit debate is over. If the SNP truly believed that, we would not be having this debate today. We do not need, as my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Chris Clarkson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25825\">the Member for Heywood and Middleton (Chris Clarkson)<\/phrase> said, a &#8220;neverendum&#8221;. Business does not need the psychodrama of the last couple of years to endure. Those who say that we will not get a trade deal with the EU are probably the very same people who said that we would not get a Brexit deal concluded at all. We did, and we will.<\/p><p pid=\"b1623.1\/5\">Let us imagine if this motion today achieved its aims. What would be the consequences? Cost&#8212;what would we have to pay to the EU to support its covid recovery programmes as well as all its other expenditure, and as well as our own? Has the SNP quantified that, and if not, what financial support for business and public services would it be willing to see forgone in order that that bill would be footed? What new laws and regulations over which neither this House nor Holyrood had any say would businesses and organisations have to abide by? What would be the cost for the fishing communities of Scotland of being forced to remain part of the wasteful and disastrous common fisheries policy? As my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Andrew Bowie\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25703\">the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Andrew Bowie)<\/phrase> rightly said, the European Union will not be thinking of the United Kingdom&#8217;s interests when shaping its future policies.<\/p><p pid=\"b1623.1\/6\">Would extending the deadline make it any more likely that we will reach a conclusion of these matters? I very much doubt it. Having a deadline concentrates minds.  If we extend the transition period by a year, I would put serious money on our being back in this Chamber for another debate about extending it for another period. Negotiations are ongoing with renewed vigour, and I do not agree with the prophets of doom who say that we cannot reach a satisfactory conclusion. After all, we are not asking for something new. There is already a trade agreement between the EU and Canada, which we simply want to replicate.<\/p><p pid=\"b1623.1\/7\">I reject the characterisation of the UK outside the EU as some insular, narrow-minded, protectionist little island&#8212;far from it. We want to be an open, welcoming, tolerant, ambitious and free-trading country with global horizons. My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Claire Coutinho\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25890\">the Member for East Surrey (Claire Coutinho)<\/phrase> was on the money when she referred to our generous offer to the people of Hong Kong to find a home here in the face of Chinese oppression. That is what this country is about.<\/p><p pid=\"b1623.1\/8\">There will be huge trading opportunities for businesses in Scotland and across the UK as a result of the trade deals we strike. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Deidre Brock\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25336\">The hon. Member for Edinburgh North and Leith (Deidre Brock)<\/phrase>, who characterised me as &#8220;cannon fodder&#8221;, mentioned the wine trade in her constituency. I used to live in her constituency, and I was very pleased that the headquarters of the Scotch Malt Whisky Society was based there&#8212;it was my local. I want to see Scotch whisky exports go much further than they currently are, and the trade deals that we strike will enable that. That is the sort of ambition we should have.<\/p><p pid=\"b1623.1\/9\">While there are huge opportunities, threats remain. The right hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber spent much of his speech detailing what he saw as the potential disruptions to trade between Scotland and the EU, but what about the disruptions to trade between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom if he and his colleagues had their way? They have set their face against the internal market proposals without even seeing them. They walked away from the engagement discussions that this Government were having with the Scottish Government. As I have said, these proposals will guarantee the rights of Scottish firms to trade and source their products across the UK. The last thing Scottish business needs as we rebuild post covid are the barriers, costs, division and confusion that another independence referendum and separation would entail.<\/p><p pid=\"b1623.1\/10\">Of course, covid has posed huge challenges for us all. I just find it astonishing that some Opposition Members seek to trivialise and moan about the support that the United Kingdom Government have given. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Patricia Gibson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25300\">The hon. Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Patricia Gibson)<\/phrase> said that Scotland got less than 1% of the package announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor last week. Did she not see that Scottish businesses and people will benefit from the job retention bonus, the kick-start programme and many other schemes? Did she not factor that in? I am afraid that I do not accept this whining, moaning trivialisation of the support that this United Kingdom gives. If ever we needed an example to show that this United Kingdom is greater than the sum of its parts, this response to covid proves it. Of course there are challenges, to all parts of the Scottish economy. My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"John Lamont\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/14026\">the Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (John Lamont)<\/phrase> told me some concerning things about the impact on Scottish tourism as a result of the measures and announcements of the Scottish First Minister.If we ever needed an example to  show that this United Kingdom is greater than the sum of its parts, this response to covid proves it.

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1700.1\/1\">My Lords, I give a &#8220;better late than never&#8221; welcome to these statutory instruments, because protection of national interests, such as security of critical supply, critical infrastructure and defence of our science, technology and intellectual property base, has for too long been neglected and sacrificed on the altar of &#8220;We can buy it in&#8221; or, worse, takeovers have been celebrated as &#8220;evidence that Britain&#8217;s low-tax economy could attract major foreign investment&#8221;, which I believe is what some said of Pfizer&#8217;s proposed takeover of AstraZeneca in 2014.<\/p><p pid=\"a1700.1\/2\">It is a good thing that Vince Cable did not see it that way, and I recall that the present Prime Minister did not see it that way either. It is a pity that the Government&#8217;s public interest powers to cover the pharmaceutical and science sectors were not extended then, as was mooted. After the financial crisis, the financial sector was added for public interest protection. After a health crisis,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1700.1\/3\">&#8220;public health and crisis mitigation capabilities&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1700.1\/4\">have been added, and the farrago of Huawei and Hong Kong alerts us to reasons to have threshold-lowering measures for sensitive technology.<\/p><p pid=\"a1700.1\/5\">I see the creep towards a more comprehensive policy, but we are too slow. Other countries took faster measures to stop the buy-up of companies while they were cheap, a measure more needed in the UK as takeover is easier. I understand the concern not to overstep, but I share the broad sentiments expressed in the Motion in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, that having good time and opportunity to scrutinise the national security and investment Bill would assist in  finding the right balance for strategic economic security, preserving international reputation and even reducing risk of retaliation.<\/p><p pid=\"a1700.1\/6\">We have had a White Paper consultation already, and reports abound that further changes may be in train. However, there are opponents, especially in those business quarters that make significant money out of the UK&#8217;s easy takeover regimes. Do not listen to them: being a global investment and business centre does not have to be on a &#8220;UK for sale&#8221; basis. Many countries are sprucing up their FDI requirements in the light of experience, and they do not all have minimum turnover requirements, which I also challenge, as did the noble Lord, Lord McCrea. Having a broader set of FDI requirements does not undermine the key words from the Enterprise Act that there should be transparent and predictable decision-making. It is important to retain that, and the comments of the noble Lords, Lord Moynihan, Lord Adonis and Lord Liddle, are relevant to that.<\/p><p pid=\"a1700.1\/7\">I like the headlines from the new Dutch FDI proposals: ensuring continuity of vital processes; integrity and exclusivity of data and know-how; and avoiding the creation of strategic dependency. We have already ended up with strategic dependency in our energy sector&#8212; a matter that has exercised minds in several Lords committees, including the Economic Affairs Committee, of which I am a member, in its 2017 report on electricity. I welcome the inclusion of intellectual property in the additional share of supply order. However, like the Dutch, I would have included know-how, which has all too easily been lost in the past. I agree with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Lansley, about IP held in separate small entities. It is of course a subject dear to my heart, as a patent attorney, and I have also had the dubious pleasure of coping with the vagaries of MoD secrecy orders on intellectual property, making me well aware of the difficulty that there can be in assessing relevance&#8212;which will be reflected in any government team trying to assess strategic issues.<\/p><p pid=\"a1700.1\/8\">Although couched in terms of security and investment, these are matters of competition policy, which is a sensitive issue on the international stage. Even for a body as strong, well-established and independent as the EU Commission competition body, it works best when there is political consensus. While I was ECON chair in the European Parliament, I was deeply involved in competition policy, bringing about procedural changes and new legislation. That happened largely because the Commissioner recognised the advantages of parliamentary support, not least in its external representation. Now, as the UK forges an independent competition policy&#8212;notwithstanding what may or may not be in a Brexit agreement&#8212;and hones foreign direct investment policy, I hope that the Government will draw on support from consensus. Competition disputes can last longer than Governments, and the undermining of strategic interests certainly does.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c1378.0\/1\">I thank the Secretary of State for giving me advance sight of his statement. All sides of the House agree that the first duty of any Government is to protect their citizens, and we have confidence in our national security services, which go to such lengths to keep us safe. It has been clear for some time that there are serious questions over whether Huawei should be allowed to control large sections of our country&#8217;s telecoms networks, yet the Government refused to face reality. Their approach to our 5G capability, Huawei and our national security has been incomprehensibly negligent. The current Education Secretary was sacked as Defence Secretary for leaking parts of the security services&#8217; advice on Huawei, yet the Government went on to ignore large parts of it. In January, the Foreign Secretary said in a statement to the House that the Government would legislate at &#8220;the earliest opportunity&#8221; on high-risk vendors. They then refused to work with us and their own Back Benchers to enable that to happen. Will the Secretary of State tell us when he will bring forward the legislation on high-risk vendors, including the robust regulatory and enforcement powers required to limit or eliminate their part in our network? &#8220;As soon as possible&#8221; and &#8220;shortly&#8221; will not wash any more.<\/p><p pid=\"c1378.0\/2\">Will the Government publish the security advice on which today&#8217;s decision has been taken? What new information have they been given that was not available to them when the initial decisions were made? I would also like to ask the Secretary of State what discussions he has had with the Foreign Secretary and the Trade Secretary on likely retaliation. Where else are we dependent on Chinese suppliers&#8212;for example, in our nuclear sector&#8212;and how are we working with our democratic allies, including but not limited to the United States, to develop alternatives in these areas? The Secretary of State says that this change is being made in response to US sanctions, but in the past he has emphasised how closely  he was working with the United States, so were the sanctions a surprise? Is our security policy being led by the US? Did the very visible human rights violations by the Chinese in Hong Kong and against the Uyghurs play no part in the decision?<\/p><p pid=\"c1378.0\/3\">The reality is that the original decision on Huawei was made because, over the past decade, this Government have failed to deliver a sustainable plan for our digital economy. Almost exactly a year ago, the &#8220;UK Telecoms Supply Chain Review Report&#8221; was published. It stated:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1378.0\/4\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;We will develop and pursue a diversification strategy&#8212;including by working with our international partners&#8212;to ensure a competitive, sustainable and diverse supply chain.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1378.0\/5\">Now the Secretary of State claims to have set out a &#8220;clear and ambitious diversification strategy&#8221;. This will come as a surprise to anyone who has looked at the Government&#8217;s statements. I would like to ask the Secretary of State: what are the actions to implement the strategy&#8212;which has effectively been set out somewhere and which I have not seen&#8212;and can he tell me where it is set out?<\/p><p pid=\"c1378.0\/6\">This is a car crash for our digital economy, but one that could have been visible from outer space. BT and other vendors have put the cost of this decision in the billions. The Secretary of State says &#163;2 billion. What is the basis for that estimate, and how will he ensure that the cost is not passed on to consumers? Today&#8217;s announcement refers to 5G, but what are the implications for our emergency services network&#8212;a saga even longer than this one, in which BT was planning to use Huawei?<\/p><p pid=\"c1378.0\/7\">Open standards such as open RAN limit dependence on any one supplier; what is the Secretary of State doing to mandate such standards and open our networks to UK companies such as Cambridge company ip.access and the north-east company Filtronic? Crucially, what proportion of the additional money that is spent will go to UK companies and how many jobs will be created here? The Government recently announced a &#163;500 million investment in bankrupt American satellite broadband provider OneWeb; are similar investments planned for 5G or 6G companies?<\/p><p pid=\"c1378.0\/8\">Labour has repeatedly offered constructive ideas to get the UK out of the Huawei hole; we have consistently argued to end our national dependence on all high-risk vendors and improve corporate responsibility for global supply chains. This entire saga has shown that the Government cannot sort this mess out on their own. We need a taskforce of industry representatives, academics, start-ups, regional governments and regulators to develop a plan that delivers a UK network capability and secure mobile network in the shortest possible timeframe. Will the Secretary of State commit to that and return to the House regularly to update on progress?<\/p><p pid=\"c1378.0\/9\">Will the Secretary of State get a grip, get a plan and secure our critical communications infrastructure, our digital economy and our national security?<\/p>",

There used to be many a wrangle about the validity of the written confession of an accused. I recall a case in Hong Kong, where my client contested a signed written confession on the basis that the detective chief inspector had stamped on his hand until he signed whatever had been written out for him. When I expressed some doubt, he drew my attention to a photocopy of the confession. His signature after the caution at the beginning was in firm characters, but the characters with which he signed at the end were so shaky as to be almost illegible. The court threw the alleged confession out.<\/p><p pid=\"a1353.0\/3\">Video recordings that were subsequently introduced of the &#8220;harshing&#8221; of prisoners in Iraq during interviews have led to the Ministry of Defence paying out millions to claimants, and the MoD has given undertakings that none of these video recordings will ever be destroyed, so that the significance can be appreciated. Video recordings protect not only the accused from brutality  and fakery, they also protect the police interviewer from trumped-up allegations. I am sure that that has led to a great diminution in these practices.<\/p><p pid=\"a1353.0\/4\">These regulations cover two important aspects: tampering and security. The first issue is dealt with by ensuring immediate access by the accused to a copy of the digital recording. This is well covered in the code of practice.<\/p><p pid=\"a1353.0\/5\">The second issue arises in the event that no charges are brought. Is the recording of an interview to remain for ever, if not in the cloud then on the secure system described by the Minister? Is there a time limit? When will it be destroyed or deleted? Paragraph 7.15 of the draft code of practice requires digital files to be stored in read-only format on non-removable storage devices to ensure their integrity; for example, on hard disk drives. Access is restricted under paragraph 7.16 to those who have been given specific permission to access them, or for<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1353.0\/6\">&#8220;specified purposes when this is necessary.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1353.0\/7\">That is completely vague. Access for the purposes of a prosecution is given only as an example, not as an exhaustive definition. Who specifies the purposes and what is the ambit or the limitation of those purposes?<\/p>",

We have been waiting for a while for excellent foreign policy suggestions, but we have had three in the past three weeks&#8212;one on British national overseas passports last week, and now this on the Magnitsky sanctions. This is another fantastic policy change by Her Majesty&#8217;s Government, and something that <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Chris Bryant\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10761\">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)<\/phrase> and the Foreign Affairs Committee have been clear on for a number of years. Indeed, I know that the hon. Gentleman will have read our &#8220;Moscow&#8217;s Gold&#8221; report of May 2018, in which this was one of the many recommendations. This builds on his earlier work as a human rights lawyer at the Foreign Office, and I pay tribute to him twice over.<\/p><p pid=\"e667.1\/2\">There has been a remarkable silence on human rights violations in China. As yet, there is no announcement on any sanctions against those who are either exploiting  or abusing the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang, or repressing democracy activists in Hong Kong. I wonder whether that is merely because this is the first stage of sanctions and the Foreign Office has not quite yet caught up with it, or whether it is a policy change. I also pay tribute to the few words the Foreign Secretary said about co-operation with others. As he knows, sanctions work best when they work with others. Working with our European and CANZUK friends is an important aspect of that.<\/p><p pid=\"e667.1\/3\">I also pay tribute to two other people who have done incredibly well: Oliver Bullough and Luke Harding are two writers who have brought huge amounts of attention to the problems in the UK system, and I thank them for their work.<\/p>",

Health protection Regulations concerning international travel came into force in all parts of the UK on 8 June. These require people who arrive in the UK from outside the Common Travel Area to self-isolate for 14 days and to complete a passenger locator form. The Regulations have helped to reduce the risk of importing cases into the UK.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>For arrivals from some countries and territories into England, where the risk of importing COVID-19 is sufficiently low, the Government considers that it can now end the self-isolation requirement. Therefore, passengers will not be required to self-isolate when they are returning from travel abroad or arriving as visitors to England from a number of exempt countries and territories. Contact information will still need to be provided on arrival except by people on a small list of exemptions.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>The process to date<\/strong><\/p><p><strong> <\/strong><\/p><p>We have been guided by the science and worked closely with health and policy experts from across government to ensure the steps we are taking will minimise the risk of importing COVID-19 cases, while helping to open our travel and tourism sector.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Joint Biosecurity Centre, in close consultation with Public Health England and the Chief Medical Officer, has developed an approach to assessing the public health risk associated with inbound travel from specific countries and territories. The categorisation has been informed by an estimate of the proportion of the population that is currently infectious in each country, virus incidence rates, trends in incidence and deaths, transmission status and international epidemic intelligence as well as information on a country&#8217;s testing capacity and an assessment of the quality of the data available. Data has been used from official sources in each country and modelling by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, as well as from Public Health England and the National Travel Health Network and Centre. Other data sources may be used in the future.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>This categorisation has informed the Government&#8217;s decisions about relaxation of border measures and has allowed us to establish travel corridors through which passengers arriving in England from certain countries and territories will be exempted from the requirement to self-isolate. Those who have visited or transited through any non-exempt country or territory within the 14 days preceding their arrival will be required to self-isolate for the remainder of the 14-day period since they last left such a country or territory. The decision on these exemptions forms part of the first review of the health protection Regulations concerning international travel which apply in England. FCO travel advice should always be consulted before booking any travel.<\/p><p>The Government is continuing to discuss this approach with the Devolved Administrations who will set out their own approach in time. Passengers travelling from overseas to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland from outside the Common Travel Area should ensure they follow the laws and guidance which apply there.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Countries and territories exemption list <\/strong><\/p><p>From 10 July, unless they have visited or transited through any non-exempt country or territory in the preceding 14 days, passengers arriving from the following countries and territories will not be required to self-isolate on arrival in England:<\/p><p>Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Australia, Austria, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Bonaire St Eustatius and Saba, Croatia, Cura&#231;ao, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominica, Faroe Islands, Fiji, Finland, France, French Polynesia, Germany, Greece, Greenland, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, R&#233;union, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Malta, Mauritius, Monaco, New Caledonia, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Seychelles, St Barth&#233;lemy, St Kitts &amp; Nevis, St Lucia, St Pierre and Miquelon, San Marino, Serbia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Turkey, Vatican City State, Vietnam.<\/p><p>Ireland is already exempt as part of the Common Travel Area, as are the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. In addition, we will be exempting the 14 British Overseas Territories. We will keep the conditions in these countries and territories under review. If they worsen we will not hesitate to reintroduce self-isolation requirements.<\/p><p>In addition, the UK Government will be making a small number of sector-specific exemptions to the border health measures as a result of the first review. From 7 July, certain transport workers who do not come into contact with passengers in the course of their journey to England will no longer be required to complete the passenger locator form. This will help pilots, seafarers, and Eurostar and Eurotunnel drivers who make regular crossings without coming into contact with passengers. There will also be additional exemptions for certain groups, including elite sportspersons and essential support staff returning to England or participating in certain elite sports events, and individuals coming to England to work on British film and television productions.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Next steps<\/strong><\/p><p> <\/p><p>My Rt Hon Friend, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and First Secretary of State has announced exemptions to the global advisory against all but essential travel. Travellers should review this advice before making travel plans, and purchase travel insurance.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Government will keep the requirements and exemptions set out in the Regulations under review. The next review of the Regulations will be by 27 July 2020. For further information, please visit https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/uk-border-control.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>I hope this announcement provides good news to the many of us who want to enjoy a holiday abroad this year, visit family and friends overseas or travel to do business and will help protect jobs in the international transport and tourism sectors. The Government continues to work closely with international partners around the world to discuss arrangements for travellers arriving from the UK and will continue this engagement ahead of the changes coming into force.<\/p><div class=\"qna-result-writtenstatement-joint-statement\"><\/div>",

For Lancaster, the last decade has been a very good one. We have seen a 25% growth in student numbers, and we have expanded in areas that are the national priorities: engineering, the medical school, science&#8212;all have grown. This has, in part, been financed by our success in recruiting Chinese students. Clearly, there is a short-term issue with Covid-19, and longer-term issues with our relations with China, particularly now over Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"b866.0\/3\">We are devising our strategy for recovery from Covid-19. What are the planning assumptions we should make? Will the Minister give us an assurance that this is temporary, that we will be able to continue to recruit students in the years ahead? When will the Government clarify what the domestic fee level will be in those years ahead?<\/p><p pid=\"b866.0\/4\">One of the reasons I like Lancaster a lot is that it combines excellence with equity, and I have great sympathy with what noble Lords, starting with the noble Lord, Lord Blunkett, have said, about the impact of this measure of control at a time that is going to see a crisis in unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. I know the Government want to increase apprenticeships, but there is a huge challenge there; the numbers are actually down. It is a tremendous shame that we are imposing an artificial limit on the recruitment of students from deprived backgrounds in this measure, and it must not continue.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"d457.3\/1\">We have learned to expect that sort of behaviour. As Ronald Reagan said&#8212;we have heard about Roosevelt, so why can we not hear from Ronald Reagan, who was a better sort of Conservative as far as I am concerned?&#8212;when we tax something, we get less of it, and when we subsidise something, we get more of it. Research from the European Central Bank shows that when the tax burden is raised by 1%, economic growth is reduced by 0.13%. We have heard a lot about job creation, but that change means many fewer jobs. Every time we create taxes, we destroy jobs.<\/p><p pid=\"d457.3\/2\">The Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that the UK tax burden will grow to 34.6% of GDP by 2024, which is the highest tax burden for this country in more than half a century. We think of ourselves as a seafaring, deal-doing, trading nation, but how can we compete when the trend of tax burden is going the wrong way? That is how we will stifle job creation. We must look at a comprehensive reform of our economy, not the usual tinkering under the hood, and we can do some of that through regulatory reform. That is not aiming for deregulation&#8212;instead, the Government should ensure that the UK&#8217;s regulatory structure is simple, clear, and appropriate. That is the genesis of this entire debate: our tax system is not simple, not clear, and not straightforward.<\/p><p pid=\"d457.3\/3\">If we radically simplify the tax system we will spur more activity, so it is a virtuous circle of benefit to the whole of our society. Imagine if all the money spent on corporate or personal tax avoidance&#8212;tax avoidance is perfectly legal, I say to the Minister&#8212;could be invested in productive activity instead. Imagine all those thousands of accountants going off and taking up machine tools&#8212;I know it is unlikely, but at least it is a thought. That would also be fairer, as it would no longer mean that the richer someone is, or the bigger their company, the more they are capable of exploiting complicated tax loopholes.<\/p><p pid=\"d457.3\/4\">We know it is simplistic to base our economy on Singapore or Hong Kong&#8212;we are a larger country with more complex needs&#8212;but on tax policy, the example they have set is applicable. Let us consider per capita GDP of the UK, Singapore and Hong Kong. They were all more or less at a parity in 1989, about five years after I came to this House, with each at around $25,000 a year. All three countries have improved their GDP per capita, but the scale of the difference is notable. By 2016, six years into a Conservative Government, the UK, with its complex tax code, had a per capita GDP of $37,000. Low tax, simple tax Hong Kong was at more than $48,000, and Singapore at $65,000 to our $37,000. We neglect at our peril that opportunity for a huge growth in numbers of jobs, for our per capita GDP and for income for the Treasury. My simple point to the Minister is this: when he sums up, will he say something about tax simplification and tax reduction?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"d331.0\/1\">The new security law is deeply shocking, and the arrests overnight have stunned the world. This will have a chilling effect on democracy. It fundamentally undermines the commitments made by the Chinese Government to the United Kingdom and those we made in turn to the people of Hong Kong when we signed the joint declaration. I pressed the Foreign Secretary yesterday not to waver in his commitment to the people of Hong Kong, and I am grateful to him for coming to the House today to make this statement, for advance sight of it, and most of all for honouring the promise he made on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-06-02\">2 June<\/phrase>. He is right to do so and has our support.<\/p><p pid=\"d331.0\/2\">When will the Home Secretary provide details of the scheme for BNO passport holders and dependents, and has the Foreign Secretary made an assessment of likely take-up? Will salary thresholds apply? We are concerned that this does not become a scheme simply for wealthy Hongkongers to abandon the city and leave others behind. Under the national security law, the Government can extract money from those they believe to be involved in criminality or guilty of offences. In some cases, the people of Hong Kong will not be able to take sums of money out of the city and could have their bank accounts frozen, so what recourse to public funds will apply and will he ensure that dependents will be treated as home students for the purpose of tuition fees?<\/p><p pid=\"d331.0\/3\">The Foreign Secretary&#8217;s commitment to BNO passport holders is welcome, but it does not resolve the problem. I was deeply moved to see the young activists who bravely took to the streets to protest against this law, at considerable personal risk. The majority will not be covered by this scheme and must not abandoned. The loss of many highly skilled workers will be a blow to Hong Kong and to China. That is why we need additional measures. We in this House have been waiting for Magnitsky legislation for two years now. He must give us a date for when that will be introduced before the summer recess, so that targeted sanctions can be applied to those who breach human rights in Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"d331.0\/4\">Overnight, pepper spray and water cannon were used against the pro-democracy protesters. It is now time for Britain to lead on an inquiry into police brutality. I welcome the cross-regional statement that our ambassador co-ordinated and place on record my thanks to him for  his efforts, but will the Foreign Secretary now lead the charge for the appointment of a UN special rapporteur on Hong Kong? The provisions in the national security law that encourage people to confess and disclose others&#8217; so-called &#8220;criminal behaviour&#8221; have raised serious concerns about the prospect of torture. We must not turn away.<\/p><p pid=\"d331.0\/5\">What conversations has the Foreign Secretary had with Carrie Lam about the provision for the Chief Executive to hand-pick judges? Given the comments by the former Hong Kong Chief Justice Andrew Li that this would fundamentally undermine the independence of the judiciary, what assessment has he made of the continuing role of British judges in the court system? I wrote to the Foreign Secretary some time ago to ask him to address the direct challenge made by British companies such as HSBC and Standard Chartered to the UK&#8217;s stance by supporting this law. We cannot allow British businesses to become complicit in undermining the international rules-based order that they themselves rely on. Yesterday the Foreign Secretary spoke up in this place in defence of press freedom. What discussions is he having with UK news agencies to defend their ability to continue to report freely on the situation on the ground, and with non-governmental organisations, which will be deeply concerned that the law applies anywhere in the world?<\/p><p pid=\"d331.0\/6\">The Government have taken a step forward today with the announcement of new rights for BNO passport holders and a statement at the United Nations, but this is no substitute for ongoing and sustained international leadership. I urge the Foreign Secretary to bring forward a comprehensive, detailed and serious package of measures with international partners, as I have outlined.<\/p><p pid=\"d331.0\/7\">Finally, the Government must now develop a much more strategic approach to their engagement with the Chinese Government. We support the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s view that a constructive relationship remains essential, but it is also clear that the UK needs far greater strategic independence in order to speak from, and act from, a position of values. Will he provide an updated assessment of the implications for national security of the involvement of Huawei in the 5G network? Will he make a similar assessment in relation to the planned nuclear projects involving CGN, in particular at Bradwell? Although this announcement is to be welcomed, I remain deeply concerned that his counterparts at the Treasury see Chinese investment as a central plank of the UK&#8217;s recovery and that the Government&#8217;s approach remains deeply confused. For too long in relation to China, we have had no strategy at home and no strategy abroad. I hope he can give us a commitment today that this marks the start of a very different era.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b533.1\/1\">My Lords, there is never a best time to do these sorts of things, is there? However, I want to start by agreeing strongly with my noble friend Lord Cormack that this has been a most unsatisfactory way of conducting a debate. We have lost all the spontaneity that we get in the House and it is a very false atmosphere.<\/p><p pid=\"b533.1\/2\">Let me move on. Huawei is a commercial company. I have done a lot of reading during this lockdown. One of my recent books has been the last volume of Volker Ullrich&#8217;s German account of the life of Hitler&#8212;Hitler Downfall 1939-45. It showed that not only Siemens but a vast quantity&#8212;virtually all&#8212;of German industry was behind the Government, using slave labour and knowing exactly what it was doing. I do not believe that Huawei does not know exactly what it is doing, and if we deal with them, we are complicit.<\/p><p pid=\"b533.1\/3\">I noted with pleasure the dissertation on Monnet by the noble Baroness, Lady O&#8217;Loan. I had 10 years in the European Parliament and was its representative on the board of governors of the Jean Monnet Foundation. I remind the House that the other great notable invention of the late 1940s was Eleanor Roosevelt and the ILO, setting down standards of labour which are blatantly abused by the Chinese Government. The ILO and China do not appear to be on the same paragraph or even on the same page.<\/p><p pid=\"b533.1\/4\">This morning, as a member of the legal affairs committee of the Council of Europe, I attended a virtual meeting where one of the matters of report was the charging of Hashim Thaci from Kosovo. He has been indicted by the International Court of Justice in The Hague on charges of organ harvesting, so there is no doubt that not only is that practice disallowed in Europe, it is seen as a war crime. We need to bear in mind all those points.<\/p><p pid=\"b533.1\/5\">As they say in the police service, China has form. Years ago, I was the joint chair of the Hong Kong friendship group of the European Parliament. We had constant pressure from China. It did not like us going to Hong Kong or our support for the democratic  structures, and it certainly did not like Governor Chris Patten when he was there trying to push a democratic agenda. I also went to Taiwan. An official protest was lodged by the Chinese Government with the European Parliament at the mere fact that I had gone there. So there is a lot of form; many of us will remember that anyone who meets the Dalai Lama very quickly gets the black spot put on them, including our former Prime Minister David Cameron; when he met the Dalai Lama, he was subject to two years of freeze from the Chinese Government.<\/p><p pid=\"b533.1\/6\">I think we have to draw the line. At some point, we have to recognise that China is not on our side and we have to re-evaluate. It is not just the case of Huawei, but of getting together our colleagues in the Five Eyes, where we are already on the wrong side, in the European Union and elsewhere in what we always used to call the free world to join together and recognise that the performance, values and behaviour of the people of the Republic of China are anti everything we stand for.<\/p><p pid=\"b533.1\/7\">We are supporting this amendment. Perhaps the Minister is right that it is not the most appropriate Bill to tack in on to, but my good colleague, my noble friend Lord Forsyth, is also right that Ministers have to use the best argument they can find. This is the only Bill we have. I must say I am suspicious about what we will get at Third Reading and about whether we will get a proper opportunity. I would rather send this back to the Commons, let the Commons debate it and let the Commons&#8212;the elected House&#8212;come up with a solution. I hope very much that the noble Lord, Lord Alton, will divide the House because I think the Government would benefit from having the opinion of the Commons much more than a Third Reading debate in this House where it all might still go wrong.<\/p>",

The report shows that birth rates in the two mostly Uyghur regions plummeted by more than 60% from 2015 to 2018. Across the Xinjiang region, birth rates fell nearly 24% in a single year, compared with just 4.2% nationwide. Worse, it is now clear that this is a direct result of Government actions. Unearthed Government documents mandate that birth control violations that come about<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c37.3\/2\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;due to the influence of extreme religious thinking&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c37.3\/3\">should be &#8220;dealt with severely&#8221;, and that those unable to pay fines should be<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c37.3\/4\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;dealt with through coercive measures&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"c37.3\/5\">including internment. Mr Zenz&#8217;s paper concludes that these measures are part of a state-wide crackdown that includes the mass sterilisation of women. This report corroborates the many horrific personal testimonies that many of us have heard. The genocide convention maintains that birth prevention targeted at minority groups is indicative of genocide, and the convention binds individual states to act, not just to rely on the international judicial system. Does my hon. Friend therefore agree that the Uyghur people have been, and are, the victims of mass atrocity crimes?<\/p><p pid=\"c37.3\/6\">I ask the Foreign Secretary to go to the UN and call for an independent inquiry, but, sadly, I also recognise that the ways to deal with this through the UN will almost certainly be blocked by China. Given that likelihood, will my hon. Friend at least get the UK to make its own legal determination after weighing up this new evidence? Of course the world wants to deal with China, but we cannot continue with business as usual while this sort of blatant activity continues. Furthermore, given the Chinese Government&#8217;s appalling record on human rights, their attack on freedoms in Hong Kong, their bullying behaviour in border disputes from the South China seas to India, their blatant breaching of the rules-based order governing the free market and their delayed declaration on covid-19, will the Government now initiate an internal review of the UK&#8217;s dependence on China, with a view to significantly reducing that dependence, and call on the free world to come together to ensure that this growing threat from China is dealt with together before, as history teaches us, it is too late?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I strongly support this motion, because what is most glaring about our experience of coronavirus is the lack of evidence that the lockdown, the draconian lockdown, has had any useful purpose at all. It was based originally on predictions by Professor Neil Ferguson of Imperial College in London that proved to be utterly absurd in the event, and the Swedish Government received studies based upon Professor Ferguson's model if they didn't introduce a lockdown, and that model projected that their critical-care demand in Sweden would peak at above 16,000 or even 20,000 a day, whereas in fact the reality, in the outcome, was 500 a day. A difference of that kind is not science. That is statistical manipulation; it's junk science.<\/p><p>What we do know about coronavirus is that 98 per cent of the people who contract it either have no symptoms at all, or they certainly don't have anything like serious or critical symptoms. It affects in a severe way 2 per cent of those who contract it, and what we know also about the deaths from coronavirus is that 80 per cent of them have been people aged over 80. This virus does not attack people who are part of the working population on the whole. Nobody who's economically active in Wales, beyond a very small number, is likely to be at risk from a relaxation of the lockdown. There's a much greater risk from continuing it than there is from relaxing it.<\/p><p>Nobody, of course, can prove these predictions; you can't prove the future. But what we can do is look at the past, see what has happened, and see how it measures up with what was then predicted before these measures were introduced, and the reality is that the measures simply don't add up as having been worthwhile; in fact, they've been wholly counter-productive. When you look at the experience of countries that have relaxed their lockdowns or didn't have them at all, like Sweden, we find that the infection rate in the United Kingdom was far higher in the first place, and also the death rate of the United Kingdom was far higher. Per 1 million people, 4,500 people in the UK have contracted coronavirus, and the death rate has been 632 per million. In Sweden, there's a higher infection rate at 6,000 per million, but a lower death rate at only 500 per million. In Austria, a much, much lower infection rate of below 2,000, and almost no deaths at all&#8212;only 77 in the whole country, according to the Worldometer website today. Germany, similarly: half the infection rate that we've had in this country with only&#160;100 deaths, instead of the 632 deaths per million that we've got.<\/p><p>So, of the people who die from the virus, we know also that 90 per cent of them have had at least one pre-existing condition&#8212;90 per cent of the cases. Twenty per cent of the people who have died from coronavirus had dementia or Alzheimer's disease; these are not people who are part of the working population and need to be protected from their own personal irresponsibilities. The great tragedy of the coronavirus is that the Government has applied entirely the wrong remedy to the crisis right from the start. It's concentrated on locking down the whole economy, whilst not protecting the people who were most at risk in nursing homes and care homes. It's like going to hospital for heart surgery to find that your surgeon, instead of having a collection of scalpels, has come into the operating theatre with a chainsaw.<\/p><p>Now, the virus&#8212;. Sorry. The R rate, the rate of transmission of the virus, which the Government bases its policy on, is itself only an average of what they think it might be, and actually disguises the reality of coronavirus, which is that what we know is that a great proportion of the serious cases that have developed, and this is not just in Britain, this is throughout the world, have come from a very small number of super-spreaders. Eighty per cent of the cases in Hong Kong have come from 20 per cent of the initial cases. So, the R rate is a mythical figure that can't be calculated anyway because we don't know what proportion of the population has got any kind of natural immunity. We've all acquired some sort of immunity from coronavirus because we've all had the common cold. Nobody actually knows how protective these immunities are, but we do know from other circumstances that there must be such cross immunities.<\/p><p>Can you remember the Diamond Princess cruise ship right at the start of the crisis? A small, confined environment, where the disease was allowed to run rampant for weeks before it was recognised as a major problem. Only 19 per cent of the passengers on that vessel actually contracted the coronavirus. Professor Sunetra Gupta, a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Oxford University, says that the coronavirus has followed the same pattern worldwide, irrespective of the lockdown policies of different Governments. Professor Yonathan Freund, a professor of emergency medicine at the Sorbonne university, says that a second wave can be absolutely ruled out from what we know of the epidemiology of the disease. So, when Rhup ap Iorwerth says that we need to prove our case, then I'm basing what I say on the science and on the scientists, not on statistical modellers, because statistical modelling is not science.<\/p><p>Another factor that's involved in coronavirus as well, and all viruses actually, is we don't know enough about them to know about the progress of diseases and why they behave in the way that they do. Many viruses disappear like SARS did, for no reason that is apparent at all. Six months after SARS appeared on the planet, it disappeared. Professor David Heymann, a professor in infectious disease epidemiology at the London school of tropical health and tropical medicine, who headed the global response to SARS at the World Health Organization, has pointed out that SARS spread easily and killed a tenth of those who were infected, but actually disappeared within six months.<\/p>",

She says that they are minor, but the real importance of these regulations is that they illustrate what is at risk if we fail to reach an adequate trade deal, as seems very possible. Surely the regulations cannot in themselves begin to replace the unfettered access to the single market for our financial services sector which EU membership provided.<\/p><p pid=\"a2306.0\/2\">As the Minister will know, this sector employs 2.2 million of our workforce and is estimated to account for 6.5% of the UK&#8217;s economic output, generating more than &#163;70 billion in tax revenues in 2017, making up 11% of the national total. Until the financial crisis of 2008, the City of London was seen as the country&#8217;s greatest economic asset, as well as being by far the most important financial centre in the European Union. Financial firms in London have benefited hugely from EU membership, most obviously through passporting  rights which enable firms to trade in any other member state, under the supervision of British regulators, without having to seek further authorisation from each country. Around 5,500 firms based in the UK currently benefit from passporting, with financial exports worth &#163;26 billion, while 8,000 companies in the European Economic Area use this mechanism to offer services in Britain. After the post-Brexit transition period, UK financial services will lose their EU passport rights and be forced to rely on equivalence for their market access to Europe. Under that scheme, the European Commission decides whether a country&#8217;s regulations are deemed robust enough for it to operate within the single market, and can later withdraw the decision with as little as 30 days&#8217; notice&#8212;so much for taking back control.<\/p><p pid=\"a2306.0\/3\">In the run-up to the last election, many financiers seemed to assume that a Conservative victory would ensure business as usual for the City. However, as these regulations show, Britain&#8217;s status as Europe&#8217;s leading hub for financial and legal services is at real risk after Brexit. Already, more than 300 firms in Britain have opened EU hubs in order to ensure single market access, while &#163;1 trillion of City assets and 7,000 banking jobs have been transferred to the eurozone. London has been supplanted by New York as the world&#8217;s leading financial centre in the Global Financial Centres Index and is close to being overtaken by Hong Kong. Again, so much for the Brexit promise of taking back control, even with these regulations.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a2300.1\/1\">My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for her introduction of this measure, which is the latest in a long line of statutory instruments to amend EU-derived legislation so that it continues to function correctly following the conclusion of the transition period at the end of December. With the events of the past few months, I had forgotten just how many Treasury SIs we dealt with as part of the Brexit process. Indeed, paragraph 6.2 of the Explanatory Memorandum lists a dozen relating to this area alone.<\/p><p pid=\"a2300.1\/2\">As the Minister outlined, this SI expands the UK&#8217;s existing supervisory framework for central counterparties to cover third-country CCPs, to ensure that the Bank  of England is able to undertake the necessary supervisory responsibilities required under the EMIR 2.2 framework. It transfers a number of functions currently carried out by the European Commission to domestic bodies, including the Treasury and the Bank, and makes minor amendments to deficiencies in other Brexit financial services SIs.<\/p><p pid=\"a2300.1\/3\">My right honourable friend Pat McFadden MP asked the Commons Minister a number of questions during the debate there on this measure, including whether the Government think that they can achieve an equivalence decision in the timeframe envisaged in the political declaration. Mr Glen simply said that the Government were &#8220;working through&#8221; the process. I hope that the noble Baroness the Minister can go into slightly more detail today.<\/p><p pid=\"a2300.1\/4\">We remain deeply concerned about the future impact of our changing relationship with the EU on the success of this country&#8217;s financial services sector. Financial services contribute significantly to Britain&#8217;s exports. In 2016, they were worth about &#163;61 billion, with a surplus of &#163;51 billion over imports. More than 300 firms in Britain have opened EU hubs to ensure single-market access, while &#163;1 trillion of City assets and 7,000 banking jobs have been transferred to the eurozone. London has been supplanted by New York as the world&#8217;s leading financial centre in the Global Financial Centres Index and is close to being overtaken by Hong Kong. EU officials have insisted that at the end of the transition period the UK, as a third country, must abide by equivalence&#8212;a guarantee that its financial regulations meet European standards&#8212;and there are additional risks to access, as equivalence status can be revoked at any time.<\/p><p pid=\"a2300.1\/5\">While we cannot and must not rely on financial services to bring home the bacon, they will have an important role to play in returning the economy to growth once the coronavirus pandemic has been brought under control. We on this side accept that negotiations with the EU are ongoing. I hope that the Minister will note that our concerns have been heard and are shared.<\/p><p pid=\"a2300.1\/6\">Finally, can the Minister indicate how many further SIs are expected before the end of the transition period? This may be dependent on the number of open legislative files in Brussels but, as I have said on previous occasions, financial services regulation is complicated enough without multiple measures being brought forward to correct deficiencies in instruments that themselves amend other regulations. I trust officials at the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority to ensure that we have a functioning statute book on exit day. However, given the challenging times we find ourselves operating in, I hope that Ministers will do their best to make officials&#8217; lives and the work of your Lordships&#8217; Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee as straightforward as possible.<\/p>",

It must be very difficult when the connection goes: I think we have all been there.<\/p><p pid=\"a2283.0\/2\">My basic question on the regulations is whether there is any intention ever to move away from the EU limits. That needs to be clarified by the Minister. I would also like to pick up the point made by my noble friend Lord Naseby about UK citizens overseas. If the Minister is unable to give specific details, I am sure that she could write to all those participating in the debate to let us know what the position is in respect of any UK citizens overseas who are currently unable to get back into the country.<\/p><p pid=\"a2283.0\/3\">I have given advance notice to my noble friend the Minister about my intention to raise something that is somewhat off-piste but very relevant to the continued viability of air carriers and airlines, which is, of course, in some doubt at the moment; that is, the issue of quarantine and the related issue of testing at airports. It seems to me that quarantine has difficulties, particularly with the dangers related to the unsupervised journey from the airport to home. There is testing, for example, at Iceland&#8217;s international airport for people flying in. They are tested there and contacted later if the test is positive, and that gives some assurance to people. There is also testing in Hong Kong on a slightly different basis, but it is obviously a much larger airport with much greater throughput. Is this something that the Minister could say something about? Are the Government giving consideration to this? The context of these regulations means that it is really only if we are able to instil some confidence in the airline sector and provide proper testing facilities for people coming into the country that we will be able to ensure that these regulations have any real lasting relevance. I would be grateful if my noble friend the Minister could deal with that in her reply.<\/p>",

To name a few examples, as mentioned by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours, there is the modelling survey published yesterday by the Universities of Greenwich and Cambridge; the compelling evidence from Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Germany; and evidence that shows that droplets can linger in the air for tens of minutes, which potentially rides roughshod over the effectiveness of measures for queueing in shops. With shops reopening on Monday, social distancing will become harder. The government advice is to wear a face covering where social distancing is not possible, especially indoors, but when we decide to go to a shop, we will have no idea how empty or busy the streets or shops will be. Rather than the government advice remaining vague and weak, should the advice not now be strong and clear: wear a mask to protect others and their mask will protect you?<\/p>",

As our health Minister, Vaughan Gething, stated:<\/p><p>'We must challenge racism, inequality and injustice wherever we find it, including right here at home'.<\/p><p>Now, we know without question that institutionalised racism is not a problem reserved to the USA. We've got a long way to go in our own country to address this issue, but we've made clear our solidarity with all those protesting. But solidarity is not enough. We must be prepared to challenge other countries, particularly when those actions create a response here in Wales. In that vein, I've written to the Foreign Secretary of the United States setting out the position of the Welsh Government and requesting that the President of the United States is reminded of his obligations to respect human rights and to ask if he'll acknowledge, without condition, that black lives matter.<\/p><p>I've also asked our international relations team to monitor the worrying situation in Hong Kong and to underline our commitment in the Welsh Government to the principles of democracy, the rule of law and human rights.&#160;<\/p><p>Now, we've used the invaluable information provided by our international offices on how other overseas Governments are easing the lockdown to help shape our planning and our response here in Wales.<\/p><p>The clock is ticking in relation to developing a new relationship with the EU, and, when the transition phase ends, our current trading relationship with many other countries in the world also comes to an end. We're aware of the recent media reports regarding US trade negotiations, and in particular the growing concern with regard to the lowering of UK food and animal welfare standards, and the potential import of chlorinated chicken is of great concern. The UK Government has provided assurances to us that they will not agree to lowering standards in any future trade deals, and that's something that they promised in their manifesto and that we will hold them to.<\/p><p>I'd like to turn now to tourism. There's been a great deal of interest in that this afternoon. From the First Minister down, we're all acutely aware of the scale of the challenge facing the tourism, hospitality and the events sector, and, since the crisis began, the Deputy Minister and I have been meeting regularly with industry leaders. We know that when the summer season is gone, it's gone. It's therefore critical that we continue to work with the industry and local communities to ensure a safe return to tourism as soon as the public health position allows. We know that the industry would like us to provide a date as to when the industry can resume, but we've said consistently that we'll be driven by the science, and not by dates, and will only ease restrictions when the medical advice&#160;says it's safe for us to do so.<\/p><p>We've promised that we'll give the industry three weeks' notice as a minimum in order to prepare for reopening and we're giving detailed consideration as to when we can signal it will be approaching the right time to reopen shared accommodation without facilities, which is set out in the amber zone of the First Minister's programme. We're conscious that the industry will be watching next week's 21-day statement very closely and will be looking for a signal from the First Minister in terms of the tourism sector.<\/p><p>We're acutely aware that as businesses approach August, they'll be required to contribute financially to the furlough scheme, and we understand the importance of these dates to businesses. So, we're preparing&#8212;and we're preparing in detail&#8212;and that's included developing detailed guidance and protocols to support the sector and protect the community and staff and visitors.<\/p><p>Our package of support to the industry is the most generous in the UK, particularly through our bespoke economic resilience fund, under which, as of 5 June, we've awarded over &#163;10 million to tourism businesses, safeguarding over 4,500 employees. And as you've heard, phase 2 of the fund will pave the way for further tourism businesses to access these funds. We'll continue to press the UK Government on extending the furlough scheme or creating a bespoke package for the sector.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the events industry is likely to be the last to recover, and we're looking to work even more closely with organisers across Wales to consider the way forward. The culture and arts sector is also under extreme pressure. These organisations are often the beating heart of our communities, and they'll be even more important in the future.<\/p><p>We've worked closely with all our key stakeholders to offer advice and guidance and we've prioritised our responses to those activities most critical in the short term, and on supporting organisations with cash-flow problems and general hardship. And we're also providing guidance on the safe return of sport and the reopening of facilities when the conditions are right.<\/p>",

As Secretary of State Alok Sharma said, the Government now believe that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1699.0\/2\">&#8220;the package of measures that the Bill introduces will give businesses the best opportunity to survive the effects of the covid-19 crisis and lay the foundations for a bounce-back in the UK economy.&#8221;&#8212;[<\/p><p pid=\"a1699.0\/3\">Paul Scully, the Small Business Minister, said:<\/p><p pid=\"a1699.0\/4\">&#8220;If a restructuring plan is not agreed, it is worth remembering that the company might enter an insolvency proceeding, which would almost certainly produce a worse outcome overall for all involved. The company might stop trading altogether, which would put all employees at risk of losing their jobs.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Commons, 3\/6\/20; col. 952.]<\/p><p pid=\"a1699.0\/5\">As the noble Lord the Minister said, businesses and practitioners of insolvency law have largely welcomed the Bill. For example, Kate Nicholls, CEO of UKHospitality, said:<\/p><p pid=\"a1699.0\/6\">&#8220;This is a very important piece of legislation from the Government &#8230; The Bill should provide businesses with some very welcome respite from aggressive landlords and valuable breathing space to restructure their businesses.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1699.0\/7\">Jennifer Marshall, a partner at Allen &amp; Overy, said that the Bill represents<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1699.0\/8\">&#8220;the most significant insolvency reforms in the UK for a generation&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a1699.0\/9\">The Institute of Chartered Accounts, where I am proud to be a fellow, said:<\/p><p pid=\"a1699.0\/10\">&#8220;This is a pragmatic move and a useful addition to the government&#8217;s strategy to protect employment and &#8230; will definitely help some businesses survive, but we would encourage any directors with concerns about their company to seek professional advice at the earliest opportunity.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1699.0\/11\">The provisions of the Bill on company moratoriums, termination clauses, restructuring plans, the suspension of wrongful trading regulations, dealing with statutory demands and winding-up petitions, and flexibility around AGMs and filing requirements are all very welcome. As vice-president of the CBI, I can say that it supports the measures in the Bill, with our members widely welcoming the breathing space it will provide. The retrospective application of some of the measures is particularly important as firms continue to struggle with cash flow. Matthew Fell, one of our directors, said:<\/p><p pid=\"a1699.0\/12\">&#8220;The CBI welcomes these interventions at a critical time for business. The temporary suspension of wrongful trading provisions, along with other measures, will give much needed headroom for company directors to enable otherwise viable businesses to use the government&#8217;s support package and weather this crisis.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1699.0\/13\">With the Government&#8217;s support packages tapering off in the coming months, the timely passage of this Bill will be crucial to provide headroom for management teams across the UK. For firms to understand the extent of their liability, and the options for and likelihood of avoiding insolvency and securing a rescue package, the Bill will be pivotal. At a time when firms are grappling with huge demand shocks, constrained cash flow, and an uncertain picture on domestic and international consumer demand, government support is widely welcomed.<\/p><p pid=\"a1699.0\/14\">Following the comprehensive financial support package provided by the Treasury, for which business is very grateful, this Bill will help to underpin the Government&#8217;s requirements for the next stage of our economic recovery  in the coming months. We encourage the Government to ensure that businesses, and especially SMEs, which have the least capacity&#8212;I hope that the Minister agrees&#8212;have as much support as possible to retain jobs and livelihoods in the coming months.<\/p><p pid=\"a1699.0\/15\">The Minister said that the Bill is about maximising the chances of survival. It certainly helps to do that, but does he agree that, before companies have to resort to its measures, we should support them as much as possible? For example, look at the government loan guarantee scheme. We have 100% bounce-back loan schemes. The original CBIL scheme, from <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-03-23\">23 March<\/phrase>&#8212;two and a half months ago&#8212;has seen a 50% approval rate, to 47,000 businesses, with almost &#163;10 billion lent. But under the bounce-back schemes, with a 100% guarantee from the Government, in just over a month &#163;24 billion has been lent, to almost 800,000 businesses. Should not the Government consider matching what Switzerland and Germany are doing, and increase the limit for the 100% loans up to &#163;500,000? That would help businesses, especially as measures are tapered off.<\/p><p pid=\"a1699.0\/16\">Finally, if we can reduce social distancing from two metres to one metre, that will mean four times as many people in pubs and restaurants: at two metres, there is 30% capacity; at one metre, there is 70% capacity. This could be the difference between opening or not, and between survival or not. Cinemas, theatres&#8212;everyone would be helped. France, Denmark, China, Singapore, Lithuania and Hong Kong are doing it&#8212;why are we not doing it, in line with what the WHO says? We need to get the economy back up and working as soon as possible, and safely.<\/p>",

I think that is the critical thing. As I said, I have huge respect for the Home Office under the leadership of Matthew Rycroft and his team, but they are dealing with things such as covid-19 issues on immigration, refugees arriving over the channel, the situation in Hong Kong, and the immigration surcharge. They have a huge job list to do&#8212;and this is the only one in which they have a choice about the timing. I hope that the Home Secretary will be looking internally at the Home Office and its capability to deliver things that will then enable business to respond in a timely manner. I am concerned about the pressure being put on them.<\/p>",

If China follows through with this legislation, Britain will not hesitate to act. We will put in place new arrangements to allow those in Hong Kong who hold British national overseas passports to come to the UK, enabling them to live and apply to study and work for extendable periods of 12 months, leading to a pathway to British citizenship. If it proves necessary, the British  Government will take this step, and take it willingly. We will never abandon our commitment to the freedom of Hong Kong and its people.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1516.4\/1\">My Lords, I first join all noble Lords in thanking my noble friend Lady Anelay for tabling this debate and thank them  for their very focused contributions from the outset. There were a lot of questions; if I am unable to cover them in the time I have, following the usual courtesies I shall write to noble Lords and lay responses to those questions in Library.<\/p><p pid=\"b1516.4\/2\">I am sure noble Lords will forgive me&#8212;and join me&#8212;if I start by paying tribute to the important contribution of my noble friend Lord Patten. He is for ever a reminder to us of the importance of standing up for the rule of law in the context of Hong Kong, and the role he played was instrumental. I listened carefully to all of his contribution, in particular his specific proposal to have the telegram of <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-06-05\">5 June<\/phrase> 1989 placed in the Library. I will certainly take that forward, and hope that we will be able to deliver on that in the very short term.<\/p><p pid=\"b1516.4\/3\">As we all know&#8212;noble Lords alluded to this&#8212;on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-05-28\">28 May<\/phrase> China&#8217;s National People&#8217;s Congress adopted a decision that would impose a national security law on Hong Kong. Let me assure all noble Lords who have contributed that we share their concerns about this unprecedented development; my closing remarks will echo the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s comment. I also thank those noble Lords, including my noble friends, who gave their support for the Government&#8217;s statement last week. I particularly note the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, and the noble Lord, Lord Collins. More details will of course follow on the specifics of the announcements around BNOs. I will come on to that.<\/p><p pid=\"b1516.4\/4\">As my noble friend Lord Patten and other noble Lords reminded us, Hong Kong&#8217;s success was built on its high degree of autonomy and freedoms. My noble friend Lord Howell made this point well. This is under the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; framework that China itself has long advocated and reaffirmed. This framework is enshrined in Hong Kong&#8217;s Basic Law and underpinned by the provisions of the Sino-British joint declaration of 1984. As my noble friend Lady Anelay reminded us, the joint declaration is a legally binding international treaty, a point also well made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope. The treaty is registered with the United Nations and remains as valid today as it was when it was signed, more than 35 years ago.<\/p><p pid=\"b1516.4\/5\">The imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong would lie in direct conflict with China&#8217;s international obligations. Yes, as my noble friend Lord Patten reminded us, there are provisions for a national security law. However, as several noble Lords including him pointed out, this imposition goes directly against those obligations under the Sino-British joint declaration. It would also lie in direct conflict with article 23 of Hong Kong&#8217;s Basic Law, which gives Hong Kong sole jurisdiction to enact these laws. Imposing the national security law would undermine Hong Kong&#8217;s high degree of autonomy and threaten the freedom of its people. The Basic Law is unequivocal: it allows for Hong Kong to make its own laws and there are a limited number of areas in which Beijing can directly impose legislation. These include foreign and defence policy, and emergency legislation in extreme circumstances such as a state of war. As my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary has made clear, we do not oppose Hong Kong having a national security law. What we strongly oppose is its imposition by Beijing.<\/p><p pid=\"b1516.4\/6\">The impact on human rights was touched on, rightly, by many noble Lords, including my noble friend Lord Bridgeman. The noble Lords, Lord Dubs and Lord Truscott, reminded us about the joint declaration as well. The proposed national security law further raises the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes. It threatens to undermine existing commitments to protect the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong, as set out in the joint declaration, which reflects the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. We are also acutely conscious that Hong Kong&#8217;s rule of law and world-class independent judiciary, as mentioned by several noble Lords including the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, are a cornerstone of its economic success and way of life. We will of course watch the impact of these proposed measures closely.<\/p><p pid=\"b1516.4\/7\">I turn to Her Majesty&#8217;s Government&#8217;s response. I have listened carefully to a number of helpful suggestions and detailed questions. If I may, I will respond in writing to several of them. However, we are very clear-eyed in our approach when it comes to China. That is rooted in our values and interests. The point was made about China and its partnerships. Several noble Lords, including my noble friend Lord Randall, reminded us of our international workings. When it comes to issues such as climate change&#8212;my noble friend reminded us of COP 26&#8212;we believe that China also has a vital role in the international community, including in its global response to the pandemic. It has worked with many countries and the World Health Organization in its response.<\/p><p pid=\"b1516.4\/8\">It has always been the case that when we have concerns, we will raise them. On human rights, let me assure noble Lords that we will continue to raise the issue of the Uighurs, which was mentioned by the right reverend Prelate, as we have previously done at the Human Rights Council in Geneva. We will speak out.<\/p><p pid=\"b1516.4\/9\">Several noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, who speaks with great experience, referred to the proposal of the seven Foreign Secretaries, including the noble Lord, Lord Owen, for a contact group. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, mentioned human rights and the importance of broad coalitions. My noble friends Lord Patten, Lord Balfe and Lady Helic talked about international action, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Northover. Last Thursday, alongside his counterparts in Australia, Canada and the US, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary released a joint statement expressing deep concern over the proposed new security legislation. We are working with New Zealand, Japan and, yes, our partners in the EU&#8212;which the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, and my noble friend Lady Helic mentioned&#8212;who also made statements expressing concern.<\/p><p pid=\"b1516.4\/10\">The noble Baroness, Lady Jay, talked about the international group. My noble friend Lord Cormack talked about broadening coalitions, including at the UN. I am sure that noble Lords will have seen that we raised the issue of Hong Kong at a recent Security Council meeting, despite the challenges that China posed. We have taken steps towards creating broader coalitions. My noble friend Lady Meyer talked of  the G7, my noble friend Lord Bowness talked of wider coalitions and the noble Lord, Lord Glasman, suggested how we might strengthen and broaden coalitions. I will of course reflect on all noble Lords&#8217; contributions regarding how we can further strengthen international opinion on this issue. I assure noble Lords that we will work with all international partners, including those in the EU, because we want to implore China to reconsider its current path.<\/p><p pid=\"b1516.4\/11\">My noble friend Lord Wei talked of great hope, and we hope that hope can be restored. We encourage China to work with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and the people of Hong Kong. Several noble Lords rightly pointed out that the needs of the people should be put first in order to find a solution that will encourage dialogue and respect for human rights; I am unequivocal about that. I am proud to have among my responsibilities the role of Minister for human rights for Her Majesty&#8217;s Government. It is important that we put human rights at the forefront of our agenda because by doing so, we will help to restore trust.<\/p><p pid=\"b1516.4\/12\">The proposed imposition of a national security law&#8212;an incredibly sensitive subject in Hong Kong&#8212;would exacerbate existing divisions. From the beginning of the unrest, this Government have been committed to our responsibilities to the people of Hong Kong, to supporting their right to peaceful protest and to encouraging dialogue on all sides within the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; framework, to which several noble Lords pointed. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, and my noble friend Lady Goudie mentioned the independence of the judiciary; I agree with them. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, also made a point about HBSC and companies that made statements about the national security law. I shall not comment specifically on that, but I underline our hope that China will think again in respect of enacting this law.<\/p><p pid=\"b1516.4\/13\">In the time I have left, I will turn to the important issue of British nationals overseas. My noble friend Lady Anelay and the noble Baronesses, Lady Jay and Lady Falkner, amongst others, talked passionately about this issue. The noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, asked about Taiwan. We have not changed our position on Taiwan. I reiterate that it is important that a lasting solution to any issues and disputes between both sides is brought to the fore by exchanges by both sides of the Taiwan Strait.<\/p><p pid=\"b1516.4\/14\">My noble friend Lady Hooper also mentioned the issue of students returning from Hong Kong. We are of course monitoring the situation. They have a right to return to the United Kingdom and we will do what we can to ensure that we facilitate their return.<\/p><p pid=\"b1516.4\/15\">I am sure that noble Lords noted that the Foreign Secretary said last week and again on Tuesday that if China continues down this path, we will look to amend the arrangements for BNOs. The noble Lord, Lord Collins, raised that issue, as did other noble Lords. Under the current status, BNO passport holders in Hong Kong are already entitled to UK consular assistance outside of China and protection and entry clearance for six months into the UK. However, in response to actions that the noble Lords, Lord Powell and Lord West, suggested, if China follows through with proposed legislation, the Government will put in place arrangements  to allow those with BNO status to live, work and study in the UK for an extendable period of 12 months. That will provide a path to citizenship, as my noble friend Lord Trimble reminded us. We will keep the door open. The noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, also mentioned that point.<\/p><p pid=\"b1516.4\/16\">We want to give the Chinese Government the chance to step back from their current course of action, and I note some of the questions that have been raised, including those from the noble Lord, Lord Purvis. I shall of course write to noble Lords regarding the questions I have not had time to answer.<\/p><p pid=\"b1516.4\/17\">The noble Lord, Lord Collins, and the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, mentioned the Magnitsky proposals and secondary legislation in that respect. We are working through this and I assure noble Lords that it is certainly our aim to bring this to Parliament at an early stage&#8212;I hope in advance of the Summer Recess, but a lot of work is being done. I am sure that noble Lords will accept that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on specific designations at this point. The noble Lords, Lord Wood and Lord Campbell, asked about Huawei. Our decision on that carries the strongest possible scrutiny.<\/p><p pid=\"b1516.4\/18\">I thank my noble friend Lady Anelay for tabling this debate. I am sure this is an issue that we will continue to return to in the coming days and weeks, but I want to put on record that the UK and its partners have been clear to China. Imposing this national security legislation would be a clear violation of China&#8217;s international obligations, including those made to the United Kingdom under the joint declaration. I put on record our call to China to reconsider this path, because I assure all noble Lords that the UK will not look the other way when it comes to the people of Hong Kong.<\/p><p class=\"italic\" pid=\"b1516.4\/19\">Virtual Proceedings suspended.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1466.0\/1\">My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, for securing this debate. A key lesson to be learned is that we cannot just focus on &#8220;the science&#8221;. Our gateway to economic recovery is immediately to reduce the 2-metre distancing rule to 1 metre. We have just given the WHO another &#163;75 million, while ignoring its 1-metre guideline. This is economic and cultural suicide. Nothing is viable unless we change this rule and take a proportionate, sensible and informed approach to risk.<\/p><p pid=\"b1466.0\/2\">The public sector has of course been largely untouched, with few job losses, pay cuts or furloughing. It is the private sector that has suffered, and it will take us to recovery through sheer hard work and taking risks. Luckily, many have found smart ways of continuing to function. Each day, people are turning to common sense. This is vital if we are to increase productivity and retain jobs. We must incentivise the private sector.<\/p><p pid=\"b1466.0\/3\">In that regard, I wholeheartedly support our Prime Minister&#8217;s pledge that, if China imposes its national security law upon Hong Kong, we shall change our immigration rules for the people of Hong Kong. We want the best and the brightest to come here, not least to help us to recover. However, this must be conditional. If we change our immigration rules, then as a matter of principle and respect for the private sector, which will probably bear the greatest fiscal burden going forward, we must also ensure that all those coming to reside in the UK pay the same levels of tax as the rest of us.<\/p><p pid=\"b1466.0\/4\">Will my noble friend the Minister therefore seek to clarify HMRC rules going forward to provide for equal treatment of UK taxpayers with all coming to reside here from Hong Kong and elsewhere in the world, so that they are treated as domiciled in the UK for inheritance tax, and as UK residents for income tax and capital gains tax? With respect, to fail in this now would be crass in the extreme.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1455.0\/1\">My Lords, as a representative of the usual channels, I also join in congratulating the staff on all the work they have done to get us to where we will be next week. It has been an amazing effort and has exceeded most of our expectations about what could be achievable in the time. I thank them.<\/p><p pid=\"b1455.0\/2\">It is very important not only that the House moves forward to normality as soon as it can, but that we have the possibility of retreat if the virus strikes again in London. The role of the Lords in the next few months will be very important: not only do we have scrutiny of all the legislation coming through as a result of the crisis, we then have an important period when all the legislation associated with the end of the transition period&#8212;when our final retreat from the EU will take place&#8212;comes to the House. It could not be a worse time for this country to be standing alone, without accountability of the Government on the arrangements for which they will be responsible.<\/p><p pid=\"b1455.0\/3\">The Lords has moved in the past month from sitting from three days to four days and we are now sitting from 11 am until 7 pm pretty much normally, so terrific progress has been made in returning this House to normality so that we are now almost fully engaged in the proper legislative process. The usual channels accept that the Government are under extreme pressure to get legislation through, not only in time for the end of the year, but on their whole general election programme. I therefore join in the remarks that my noble friend Lord Newby made on allowances, because the House is not yet operating fully effectively. One reason for that is the distortions of the interim allowance system. Too many people are speaking because that is the only way that they can earn their allowance. We have a ridiculous situation today when there is an important debate on the implications of the coronavirus and we are limited to two minutes. There is another debate that is almost as important on Hong Kong and noble Lords are limited to one minute. That is ridiculous and a denial of the scrutiny role that we should have in this House. This is not the first time; it has been going on for a number of weeks. As a result, with such extreme time limits, far too many good people are not bothering to speak, so we are not hearing their contributions. We must address this.<\/p><p pid=\"b1455.0\/4\">There is also a PR problem. Each time we make minor changes to the interim system, we get even more criticism, which undermines the House&#8217;s reputation.  It will get worse unless we resolve it. We have had nearly three months of an interim system and we need to address it. It is important to do that so that we value the work that we are doing in this House and it is recognised. We must deal with the financial problems that we are creating for a small number of people and with the implication that the House is brought into disrepute every time we make a minor adjustment.<\/p><p pid=\"b1455.0\/5\">Although we obviously support the hybrid Parliament and all the moves that have been taken today, we fear that unless the allowance system is dealt with, some of this good work will be undermined. We need to have that top of the agenda for the commission in the next couple of weeks so that we can reform the interim system before the end of this month.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"d683.1\/1\">I thank the Foreign Secretary for coming to the House to make this statement and for advance sight of it. In particular, I thank him for the sentiment of solidarity that he expressed at the end of his statement.<\/p><p pid=\"d683.1\/2\">We are deeply concerned about events in Hong Kong. We share the Government&#8217;s opposition to the national security law. We want to see real action to address police brutality and the steady erosion of the joint declaration. We want the people of Hong Kong to know that the world is watching. We also want them to know that the world is prepared to act. Can I press the Foreign Secretary for more clarity on BNO passport holders? We welcome the announcement that visa rights will be extended. He says that they will be able to come to the UK if China continues down this path and implements this legislation. Will he tell us at which stage he envisages our taking action? When will these measures be brought before the House? I also ask him for more details about how this will apply. Will it apply to the 350,000 people who hold valid passports, or to the 2.9 million who are eligible? For this to be meaningful, surely it has to apply to people&#8217;s families. Will he confirm whether this is the Government&#8217;s intention, and what assessment he has done of the numbers?<\/p><p pid=\"d683.1\/3\">The first rule of any sanction against China must surely be that it does not harm the people of Hong Kong. Will he tell us what assessment he has made of the potential loss of millions of highly skilled people from Hong Kong; and what assessment he has done of the USA&#8217;s recent announcement, which I understand he supports, that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous? Will he therefore support the withdrawal of trade preferences and economic sanctions? There are implications for China and, of course, implications for the UK, but there are also serious implications for the people of  Hong Kong, many of whom he does not appear to be offering safe haven to. What impact does he believe that that will have on them?<\/p><p pid=\"d683.1\/4\">We have been asking for concrete steps, and I welcome the fact that the Government are now signalling that they are prepared to take these, but the joint declaration has been repeatedly undermined since 2012. As the former Governor of Hong Kong put it, that has been met with only &#8220;tut-tutting&#8221; and &#8220;embarrassed clearing of the throat&#8221; from UK Ministers. Why has the Foreign Secretary not pressed for an independent inquiry into police brutality? Given the serious implications for human rights, does he welcome, as we do, the suggestion by former Foreign Secretaries that an international contact group should be established? He knows that the only long-term solution to this is universal suffrage. We must see pressure from Britain on the Hong Kong authorities to begin the process of democratic reform.<\/p><p pid=\"d683.1\/5\">I was astonished that, in his statement, the Foreign Secretary did not address how the UK intends to respond to the threat of countermeasures by China. It is increasingly clear that we need an alliance of democracies to ensure that we can maintain, as he says, a constructive dialogue with China on shared challenges, not least on climate change, while standing up to aggressive behaviour and clear breaches of international law. He referenced the statements by the UK, Australia, Canada and the US, which was welcome, and the additional statements from New Zealand, Japan and the European Union. It is time for an international democratic alliance to come together and speak with one voice. The G7 is now off. The G20 is not meeting. The discussion at the UN Security Council has been blocked by China. It is time for Britain to be far more proactive. In recent weeks, Australia has shown real leadership on the search for a vaccine for covid-19 and France has led the charge for a global ceasefire. On this of all issues, why is Britain not stepping up and showing the leadership the world needs?<\/p><p pid=\"d683.1\/6\">Finally, I am concerned that this exposes some serious, deep contradictions in the Government&#8217;s approach to China. For a decade, we have been told that we are in a &#8220;golden era&#8221; of Sino-British relations, whereas the right hon. Gentleman has said that we cannot go back to &#8220;business as usual&#8221; with China. What does any of this mean in practice? The Government have finally accepted that there are concerns about the threat the Huawei contract poses to national security and are reportedly working with other countries to explore an alternative, but will he rule out Chinese involvement in any new nuclear projects beyond Hinkley? With a long and deep recession likely, the need for a coherent approach is only becoming more urgent. We do not have a strategy abroad. We do not have a strategy at home. This needs a calm and sensible approach, to maintain a constructive dialogue and build far greater strategic independence; the two are not contradictory but go hand in hand. Now is the moment that Britain must step up, show global leadership and begin to take this seriously.<\/p>",

I understand that the UK Government will now support the Australian motion calling for an independent inquiry, but it does not mention China. That is like having an inquiry into the Second World War and not mentioning Nazi Germany, which had a little something to do with it, I suggest.<\/p><p pid=\"b943.1\/2\">I hope the Minister will confirm that we will demand why the WHO and Tedros Ghebreyesus acted like the propaganda mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, clearing China of all blame. We know that the outbreak originated in China, that it was covered up by China, that China destroyed the initial samples and that the regime has disappeared any doctors who spoke out. China has lied, lied and lied again about Covid-19 and, when this is over, there has to be a fundamental shift in working relationships with the country.<\/p><p pid=\"b943.1\/3\">The best description of China I have seen recently appeared in yesterday&#8217;s Sunday Times. Mr. Rod Liddle wrote that China&#8217;s<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b943.1\/4\">&#8220;tyrannical state capitalist government &#8230; with its lack of accountability and openness, with its brutality and complete absence of independent viewpoints, contributed to the virus&#8217;s spread. &#8230; But Covid-19 is only &#8230; a small indicator of China&#8217;s flaws. This is a country in which thousands &#8230; of Chinese Muslims are held in concentration camps &#8230; A country that continues to occupy Tibet, that menaces Taiwan, that loathes and harasses the dwindling democracy of Hong Kong, that affords no freedom of speech to its citizens and that bullies its neighbours in southeast Asia with its overweening territorial claims.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b943.1\/5\">He continued that China<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b943.1\/6\">&#8220;has managed to combine the most brutal aspects of communism with the most brutal aspects of capitalism. &#8230; We have become too reliant upon this country and are thus scared to raise our voices.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b943.1\/7\">He concluded:<\/p><p pid=\"b943.1\/8\">&#8220;China is not quite the nastiest country in the world, but it is undoubtedly one of them.

            "body": "<p pid=\"b302.0\/1\">It is a great pleasure to be called to speak in this debate. I draw attention to my entries in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests, as I come from a long family of farmers, have interests in farming and food production, and represent a very successful rural constituency producing some of the finest food in the world, with absolutely top-class farmers and food producers.<\/p><p pid=\"b302.0\/2\">I strongly welcome the Bill, and look forward to it going through today. It will free us from the constraints of the common agricultural policy, which held us back for many years&#8212;it will let us give freedom to farmers. When I was Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, time and again farmers said, &#8220;Get out of our hair!&#8221; The Bill will allow farmers to concentrate on what they are good at, which is producing food. I entirely echo the comments made by the Minister and others earlier in the debate about the tremendous efforts of farmers and food producers to cope with the extraordinary circumstances of corona.<\/p><p pid=\"b302.0\/3\">The first thing I want to say is that there is no conflict between wanting to have freedom for farmers and wanting free trade around the world. I see a great opportunity for farming to benefit from any free trade deals. That is absolutely clear. There is a narrative out there that the sad price of free trade arrangements will be some sort of cost to the farming industry. I just do not buy that.<\/p><p pid=\"b302.0\/4\">We have huge export opportunities&#8212;the Minister touched on exporting beef to the United States, which must be worth over &#163;60 million over three years. When I was at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs we began to get beef on the bone back into Hong Kong, and there are enormous opportunities. For example, in the lamb industry, China and America are neck and neck as world leaders in lamb consumption. They each consume twice as much as France or Germany, so there are great opportunities for our exporters. Given the constraints we experienced under the common agricultural policy, I really see opportunities with new technologies&#8212;CRISPR gene editing and so on&#8212;to enable us to catch up.<\/p><p pid=\"b302.0\/5\">There are some interesting figures from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. Against a metric of 1 in 1961, the EU is still producing a given amount of food at 0.55; we are at 0.43; the world is 0.29; and the world leader is 0.03. That is the lesson&#8212;if we free up agriculture, people can take advantage of the benefits of free trade and technology.<\/p><p pid=\"b302.0\/6\">Turning to the new clauses, I take exception to the proposals from my hon. Friends the Members for North Dorset (Simon Hoare) and for Tiverton and Honiton (Neil Parish). We agree on many issues regarding oversight, but I do not agree with this. We already have high standards, and the Minister has made it clear that we are not going to reduce those standards. The new clauses are unenforceable. Let us take the great vexed issue of chlorinated chicken. As my hon. Friend for Tiverton and Honiton said, people do not use very much chlorine&#8212;they use pathogen reduction treatments, which have been cleared by the US, the EU authorities and by Codex Alimentarius. When we look at the regulations, we see that stocking densities are similar to those that pertain in Europe. The outcomes on health grounds are better. Americans eat roughly twice as much chicken as Europeans, and their outcomes on campylobacter and salmonella are significantly better.<\/p><p pid=\"b302.0\/7\">What would we do if this condition went through? It would completely block any hope of a US free trade deal, with catastrophic consequences for large parts of our economy. Would we go after the individual chicken plant? Would we go after the state? Would we go after the whole US nation, which would come straight back and say, &#8220;Sorry guys, our product is healthier.&#8221; It would be much better if we resumed our full seat on the Codex Alimentarius Commission on food standards, on the OIE on animal welfare, which is important to many citizens, and on the international plant protection convention on plant health, working with allies and pushing to improve world standards.<\/p><p pid=\"b302.0\/8\">When I was at DEFRA I went to New Zealand and was struck by the fact that, freed up, it had reduced massively the number of sheep but increased the volume of meat exporting while conforming to religion protocols for minorities. Everything that it exported to the middle east was stunned before slaughter. We talk about standards a lot. What goes on in many of our slaughterhouses does not bear inspection. I challenge Members to look at videos&#8212;or, better, go along&#8212;and they will be horrified when they see what many of our livestock go through. Much of this volume of material is not required by minorities&#8212;it is absolutely fine to provide it for them&#8212;but we could copy New Zealand. We could work with it at a high level, pushing for higher standards. I am afraid I do not support the amendments, but I do support the Bill.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"d224.0\/1\">To pick up the point about our constituents&#8217; expectations, I suggest that the constituents we all represent will expect us to order our business in a way that allows us all to contribute on an equal footing. That is the essence of how Parliament is supposed to function, and it must surely have a bearing on how we order our business going ahead.<\/p><p pid=\"d224.0\/2\">I too add my thanks to those members of staff and others who have worked so hard to make these virtual proceedings technically possible, while I recognise their temporary nature and limitations. I hope, though, that we will see this as an opportunity to learn lessons and see what might be possible for the future, to show that as a Parliament we are able to accommodate those with caring responsibilities, who are on parental leave or who are suffering from illness, and to allow them to continue to represent their constituents as they would want to but for those limitations.<\/p><p pid=\"d224.0\/3\">None of us knows what the future will hold over the next few weeks. If there is to be any suggestion of a renewal of these provisions, I make this plea to the Leader of the House: there should be proper and better consultation with the small parties than there was ahead of the implementation of these procedures. The smaller parties have been able to have a voice through them, but principally as a result of your good offices, Mr Speaker, and for that I place on the record my appreciation and that of my colleagues.<\/p><p pid=\"d224.0\/4\">Let us not pretend that this has been an exercise in holding the Government to account in the way that we might normally have expected&#8212;and that is principally because of the attitude of the Government themselves. That is exemplified when we consider the Prime Minister&#8217;s statement to the nation on Sunday. That should have been made first here to this House; there would have been every opportunity to address the nation after that.<\/p><p pid=\"d224.0\/5\">But the biggest limitation and my real concern is the range of business that the House is able to deal with. There are no Westminster Hall debates and the Backbench Business Committee is not functioning, but still the world continues to evolve. Israel is considering the annexation of the Occupied Palestinian Territories; we have very little opportunity to have a say on that. In Hong Kong, China is walking ever further from the joint declaration. These are all matters of great importance; whatever we do after the recess, this House must be allowed to have our voice in respect of all of them.<\/p>",

I welcome the financial contributions to Gavi, the WHO and others, whose efforts are clearly vital in this crisis. As we know, their work saves lives. I also welcome the contribution to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, something which no Government after this must neglect. I pay tribute to the huge amount of work undertaken by the FCO, DfID and our embassies and high commissions during this crisis. However, we seem to be behind other countries in getting people home.<\/p><p pid=\"b347.0\/2\">On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-03-27\">27 March<\/phrase>, the EU had brought home half a million citizens. The United Kingdom chartered six flights for 1,000 British citizens through the EU crisis scheme; Germany chartered over 100 flights for over 20,000 German citizens. On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-04-01\">1 April<\/phrase>, the Independent reported that Air France had flown more than 200 rescue missions but that<\/p><p pid=\"b347.0\/3\">&#8220;the UK has yet to reach double figures in government-sponsored repatriation flights.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b347.0\/4\">By mid-April, only 5,000 out of 20,000 UK citizens in India had been brought back. Why did we lag so far behind our EU colleagues? The Government emphasised &#8212;and still do&#8212;that they were working with other countries, yet we seemed particularly unwilling to work with our EU colleagues. Why was that? Looking at where we are now, can the Minister answer the question from the noble Lord, Lord Collins: how many more people need to be brought home?<\/p><p pid=\"b347.0\/5\">The Minister mentioned Nigeria in the Statement. I am sure he will know that there has been a surge of deaths in Kano state, an indication that coronavirus may be more widespread there than the Nigerian authorities are admitting. Are we making quarantine plans for those who come back from Nigeria?<\/p><p pid=\"b347.0\/6\">The Minister mentioned that we have tripled our capacity in consular centres. That is obviously welcome, but we have brought home many diplomats and their families from countries with weak health systems. Are we working jointly with the EU to maximise our capacity? There have been many complaints about inadequate capacity and communication.<\/p><p pid=\"b347.0\/7\">The Minister mentioned PPE. Again, we all knew from reports on Twitter, if nowhere else, that the United Kingdom had been invited to join the original EU scheme. No one can say that we did not know about it. So why did we not? The Minister will know that the Government&#8217;s latest Statement on this is not persuasive.<\/p><p pid=\"b347.0\/8\">However, I am very glad to hear that we intend to act globally. Some countries appear to be using the cover of this crisis. Some are taking authoritarian measures. In Hong Kong, human rights campaigners such as the esteemed lawyer Martin Lee have been arrested. What will we do to challenge these actions? Israel has just formed a coalition Government who may now plan to annex the Occupied Territories. Can the Minister assure us that we will make it plain that this is contrary to international law and will be resisted? I look forward to the Minister&#8217;s response.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b163.0\/1\">I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement and for his work on testing. We may have some difficult questions for him, but I hope I have the support of the whole House in saying thank you to him and his team for the work they are doing on this difficult area.<\/p><p pid=\"b163.0\/2\">I too thank all the staff and volunteers in the NHS and the wider social care sector and other key areas who have been working during this crisis, whether directly on the front line or in supporting families and our children in schools. We send our condolences to the families of the bereaved, and are pleased that many people are recovering, even though we know that, if they have had it badly, it takes time. From these Benches, we echo the concerns about the high percentage of BME deaths, among workers and non-workers alike.<\/p><p pid=\"b163.0\/3\">The Statement says that there are 3,000 spare critical care beds, but ITV reports that care home residents now account for up to half of Covid deaths. However, last week the Daily Mail reported that care home residents were still being asked to sign letters to say that they would not go to hospital in the event that they had Covid-19. Will the Minister confirm that these critical care beds in hospital are not spare? There are plenty of people in care homes who could use those beds but they have been put under pressure, no matter how gently, to sign the letters.<\/p><p pid=\"b163.0\/4\">It is good to see the Nightingale hospitals coming on board&#8212;even if they are empty, for the right reasons. One of the concerns expressed has been about the staffing and the initial request that any patient had to have staff accompanying them from their previous hospital. Can the  Minister say that this has now definitely stopped and that staff with appropriate critical care experience are able to be recruited? I gather that this has also been a problem for increasing the number of beds.<\/p><p pid=\"b163.0\/5\">There was a good message in the Statement for people to go to their GPs and to use 999 for emergencies, but today there was a report of somebody who had a severe heart attack not being picked up urgently, as heart attacks are still second-level priorities to Covid. As a result of that 20-minute target rate, sadly the patient died. Is there any rebalancing of priorities for ambulances now that we seem to be over the peak of cases?<\/p><p pid=\"b163.0\/6\">On equipment and medicines, it is good to hear that there are now just over 10,000 ventilators. Are they full ventilators, or does that include CPAP and BiPAP machines? How many more are to come? There have been some worrying shortages of medicines for those who need to be sedated, and recently we have heard news that there is a problem with kidney dialysis and kidney medicine for people who have come out of intensive care and require long-term support. Is there a shortage of such medicines, what other medicines are at risk and what proposals are there to remedy that problem?<\/p><p pid=\"b163.0\/7\">We have spent many hours today talking about PPE. We are still waiting for supplies for everything outside hospitals. On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-04-06\">6 April<\/phrase>, Clipper was heralded as being about to solve this problem, but it is still woeful. Until the social care and community sectors get the support they need, they will continue to be worried about the spread of Covid.<\/p><p pid=\"b163.0\/8\">The Turkish ambassador has written to various people in the APPG on Turkey, setting out the actual arrangements&#8212;as opposed to those reported by the Government&#8212;concerning the delay in the package that appeared to get stuck. Turkey actually donated 250,000 pieces of medical protection equipment to us; the rest came through privately. Can the Minister say when the remainder of the consignment due from a Turkish supplier will arrive?<\/p><p pid=\"b163.0\/9\">It is good to hear that formal arrangements for testing, tracking and tracing are now under way, but the WHO always puts in a third word alongside &#8220;test&#8221; and &#8220;trace&#8221;: &#8220;isolate&#8221;. Any mention of isolation in the Statement is notable by its absence. Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong have all managed to suppress further bursts of Covid because of the arrangements for not just testing and tracing but isolating. It is good to hear that an app will be available, but the Minister will know that there are people with technical experience concerned about whether it is appropriate to use Bluetooth for it, because of security issues. Can the Minister assure the House that this is not the case and that people&#8217;s data will be used only for NHS purposes and will absolutely not be able to be used by any providers of the app or beyond? The 18,000 tracers announced by the Secretary of State just before this Statement are a good start, but we will need more for good national coverage. Worryingly, Mr Hancock said a few days ago that all this will be operated centrally. Is that still the case, or will he use the existing trained tracers that there are in local communities, whether environmental  health tracers in councils or in local health teams? It seems rather bizarre to try to cover the country on that level.<\/p><p pid=\"b163.0\/10\">On shielding, it is good that there is a request to create more volunteers and to celebrate the volunteers, but notable by their absence in the Statement are the many people who have not yet had their letters on shielding and whether any further groupings may have to consider shielding&#8212;which I understand is the case.<\/p><p pid=\"b163.0\/11\">I congratulate the Government on their progress on test and trace, but confirm that we are extremely concerned about supplies of equipment and medicine and hope that things will be remedied speedily.<\/p>",

The evidence is that we are in a much better situation now than we were a week ago. He will not mind if I follow up what the shadow Health Secretary said about testing. The concern is that we appear to be testing on a daily basis virtually no more people than we were over a week ago, when the commitment was to increase the daily number of tests from 5,000 to 25,000. Given that this is a vital part of the success of the suppression strategies in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong, can he give us an estimated date when we will get back to routine covid-19 testing in the community of all suspected cases? Even if that is three or four weeks away, a date means that there is a plan, and without  a date, people will not be confident that this really is  the plan.<\/p>",

Friend knows, as a clinician&#8212; and I am concerned&#8212;that in our desire to get PPE out we have not understood the vital role that local authorities play in this. Residents in care homes are extremely vulnerable, and their carers need that equipment, so I very much support his concern about that.<\/p><p pid=\"a62.1\/2\">The second area where the Bill needs to do more is testing. A week ago today our strategy changed from mitigation to suppression. I strongly support that change in strategy. Suppression strategies are being followed very successfully in South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and China, which appear to have turned back the virus. Here, all our public focus has been on social distancing, but testing and contact tracing to break the chain of transmission are every bit as important, if not more important. Those countries that have turned back the virus rigorously track and test every case and  every suspected case, then identify every single person with whom a covid-19 patient has been in contact to take them out of circulation. As a result, those countries have avoided the dramatic measures and some of the economic damage that we have seen in Europe.<\/p><p pid=\"a62.1\/3\">South Korea has avoided national lockdown, despite having a worse outbreak than us; Taiwan introduced temperature screening in malls and office buildings, but kept shops and restaurants open&#8212;it has had just two deaths. In Singapore, restaurants remain open and schools are reopening, although working from home is discouraged. Again, in Singapore, there have been just two deaths. Ten days ago in this country, we went in the opposite direction, and stopped testing in the community. How can we possibly suppress the virus if we do not know where it is? So far, we have had 281 deaths, tragically. According to the modellers, there is about one death per 1,000 cases, which means that we have just under 300,000 cases in this country. According to the same modellers, the number of cases is doubling every five days, which means that at the end of next week we will have about 1 million cases or more in this country. Unless we radically change direction, we will not know where those 1 million cases are.<\/p><p pid=\"a62.1\/4\">The Prime Minister talked about expanding testing from 5,000 to 10,000 to 25,000, which is welcome. He even talked about 250,000 tests a day, which would be more than anywhere in the world&#8212;I welcome that ambition, but ambition is not the same as a national plan, and we have not seen a national plan on testing.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1483.0\/1\">My Lords, while thanking the Minister for introducing this important debate, I share the concern of my noble friend Lord Oates that the noble Lord seems to have delivered a speech that he would have delivered last Wednesday, without realising that the economy has moved on since then. As he has raised the issue of the Budget, I will touch for a moment on the criticisms that we have from these Benches. Clearly, the Chancellor had an extremely difficult hand, as growth rates have been revised down very significantly; we would say quite often that that was as a result of Brexit. Although that might be disputed, that was so even before the effects of the virus. I will make three brief criticisms before moving on to the wider issues.<\/p><p pid=\"b1483.0\/2\">First, there was no real mention of adult social care, which is one of the real issues facing the country. I would be grateful if the Minister could indicate, when he replies, what the Government are going to do about that. Secondly, as my noble friend Lord Oates indicated and as was said on the Labour Benches, there were rather disappointing statements about climate change. Personally, I think it was a great mistake not to take advantage of the significant drop in oil prices to remove the cap on fuel duty, which would be much less noticed by the consumer. Thirdly, the issue of shifting resources to the north seems to have been rather understated. As David Aaronovitch said in the Times last week, the policy seems to be simply to build more roads to the north so that people can get there.<\/p><p pid=\"b1483.0\/3\">However, as a number of noble Lords have indicated, the Budget has really passed us by now. We are really dealing with the statement of the Chancellor on the impact of the virus on our budget and his guaranteeing of loans of up to &#163;300 billion, which is 15% of GDP. This is obviously unprecedented. As my noble friend Lord Oates indicated, from these Benches we welcome those proposals. But as the noble Lords, Lord O&#8217;Neill and Lord Lamont, asked, will this be enough? As we all know, following the Prime Minister&#8217;s statement on Monday, the leisure industry has seen a catastrophic fall in its revenues. Without immediate action, there  will be bankruptcies of businesses, which will never recover. My concern is that if &#163;300 billion is to be lent by the banks, the bureaucratic process for people to obtain those loans will be very slow. For many people, this will be too late. It will be too late for the self-employed and for workers on zero-hours contracts, who are laid off and today have no money.<\/p><p pid=\"b1483.0\/4\">I know that the Chancellor is considering further steps. The CBI is advocating a VAT freeze and the reversal of national insurance to provide immediate payment to business but I would go further, rather like the noble Lords, Lord O&#8217;Neill and Lord Lamont. I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, raised the phrase &#8220;helicopter money&#8221;. I like that phrase because it was coined by the guru of the right wing of the Tory party, Milton Friedman, who, when asked what he would do if there were another depression, said that the Federal Reserve should hire helicopters and drop dollar bills over every town in the United States, hence the phrase &#8220;helicopter money&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b1483.0\/5\">The paying of&#8212;whatever we like to call it&#8212;a citizens&#8217; dividend or business dividend has a reasonable pedigree. Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve governor in 2002, said that he would do that to combat deflation, defining deflation as a side-effect of a collapse in aggregate demand, which we are clearly heading for. Japan tried it in 1999, with some success. Australia in 2009 gave 950 Australian dollars to 8.7 million people earning less than 100,000 Australian dollars, and was one of the few countries to avoid recession; and Hong Kong has tried it in recent weeks, with a payment of 10,000 Hong Kong dollars to every Hong Kong citizen. I accept that probably just giving that sort of dividend to every individual might not be sufficient, and there would have to be a decision as to how you split that between business and individuals. However, I share the views of the noble Lords, Lord O&#8217;Neill and Lord Lamont, that this could be essential. The argument against it has always been that it is hugely inflationary. However, with the economy facing low growth or a recession, I submit that that is a risk worth taking.<\/p><p pid=\"b1483.0\/6\">At least coronavirus has enabled the Chancellor to avoid the trap set by his right-wing Brexiteers, who were advocating the creation of a Singapore-on-Thames following Brexit, with drastic cuts in public expenditure and significant deregulation. You obviously cannot deal with coronavirus and promote growth in towns that have voted Tory in the north and Midlands while cutting public expenditure and taxes. Therefore, at least the crisis has prevented the disaster for us of the creation of a Singapore-on-Thames. As a colleague said to me the other day, &#8220;With a crisis like this, everyone&#8217;s a Keynesian now&#8221;.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"d944.0\/1\">This has been an excellent debate and one that I hope has been enlightening to the Government Benches especially. I thank all hon. Members who have contributed; I counted 24 Back Benchers in total. In particular, I pay tribute to my hon. Friends the Members for City of Durham (Mary Kelly Foy) and for Coventry North West (Taiwo Owatemi), who made exceptional maiden speeches and will be powerful advocates for their constituents.<\/p><p pid=\"d944.0\/2\">I highlight the other excellent speeches by my hon. Friends the Members for Coventry North East (Colleen Fletcher), for Bristol South (Karin Smyth), for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh), for Hornsey and Wood Green (Catherine West), for Bradford South (Judith Cummins), for Ealing, Southall (Mr Sharma), for Lewisham East (Janet Daby), for Blaydon (Liz Twist), for Putney (Fleur Anderson) and for Enfield North (Feryal Clark), although time will not allow me to comment on them in detail.<\/p><p pid=\"d944.0\/3\">As we have heard, &#8220;The Marmot Review 10 Years On&#8221; report confirmed what many Labour Members have been warning&#8212;that life expectancy is declining and inequalities are widening. The stalling of life expectancy is not a trend that we see worldwide. It does not have to be this way. The Nordic countries, Japan and Hong Kong all have life expectancies that are greater than ours and which continue to increase. But here in the UK, for the first time in more than 100 years, life expectancy is stalling and even declining for the poorest 10% of women. As the Marmot report says,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"d944.0\/4\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;if health has stopped improving it is a sign that society has stopped improving.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"d944.0\/5\">There is no doubt that there is a link between austerity and stalling life expectancies. It is disgraceful that rates of premature deaths in poorer areas are twice as high as those in the more affluent areas. The Secretary of State has always said that prevention is one of his top three priorities, yet we have seen no evidence of that. The cuts to public health budgets have not been reversed. There has been no investment in children&#8217;s services, addiction services or social care, and no attempt has been made by successive Conservative Governments over the past 10 years to improve the standard of living for people living in cold and damp houses, working in unstable jobs or on zero-hours contracts, which have increased to more than 1 million people under their tenure.<\/p><p pid=\"d944.0\/6\">The vulnerability of those on zero-hours contracts&#8212;sometimes with no rights to statutory sick pay&#8212;has come home to roost now that we are looking at a pandemic requiring two weeks of self-isolation, and possibly long  periods off sick if the virus is contracted and takes hold. The same applies to the self-employed and those working in the gig economy. Although we welcome what the Prime Minister announced earlier today about scrapping the three-day wait for statutory sick pay, trying to live on &#163;94.25 a week, which is about a quarter of the national minimum wage, will only exacerbate the existing inequalities, and could vastly compromise the nation&#8217;s attempts to contain the coronavirus if people choose to work, instead of self-isolating, due to the need to pay their bills and eat. The Government&#8217;s inaction to improve these inequalities in our society will not only continue to hurt the poorest and most vulnerable; in turn, the rest of society will also suffer. It is for those very reasons that Opposition Members believe in caring proactively for the most vulnerable. It really does benefit us all to do so.<\/p><p pid=\"d944.0\/7\">Not doing something to make life fairer and more equal has real measurable affects. According to the Royal College of Physicians, children growing up in damp, mouldy homes are between one and a half and three times more likely to experience symptoms of asthma and other respiratory diseases than children living in dry homes. A study by the Nuffield Trust found that young people in the UK are more likely to die of asthma than in any one of the other 13 European countries studied. That is totally disgraceful, and the Government really must do something urgently to reverse this trend.<\/p><p pid=\"d944.0\/8\">Holly Worboys died tragically at the age of 19 from an asthma attack in January 2016. She was using her inhaler sparingly to save on prescription costs. A prescription currently costs &#163;9&#8212;a price that is just too high for many people who are living on squeezed or inadequate incomes. People should not be priced out of health. That is why we on the Labour Benches are committed to rolling out free prescriptions for everyone. Has the Minister considered this as a means to prevent illnesses worsening and early deaths?<\/p><p pid=\"d944.0\/9\">The Marmot review confirms what we already knew: the poorer the area, the worse the health. That means that health inequalities also exist within poorer parts of otherwise wealthy areas, which we see across London often, but it also means that health inequalities exist between the north on the whole and the south&#8212; because, on the whole, the north is less affluent than the south. Sadly, it was ever thus and it is what drove me into politics in the first place, growing up in the north-east under Thatcher. The north is often a forgotten land, not least the north-east, where the most deprived 10% of neighbourhoods have seen the largest decreases in life expectancy. This is in comparison with the largest increases in life expectancy in the least deprived 10% of neighbourhoods in London.<\/p><p pid=\"d944.0\/10\">When it comes to healthy life expectancy, as we heard earlier, boys born in Blackpool in 2016-18 can expect to live 53.3 years in good health, compared with 71.9 years for those born in Richmond upon Thames, where healthy life expectancy is the highest. That is a gap of 18.6 years and that gap has widened by 4.7 years since 2009-11, when it was 13.9 years.<\/p><p pid=\"d944.0\/11\">This is a deep injustice that the Government must address as a matter of urgency. So what are they going to do about it? The public health grant has been cut by &#163;700 million since 2015, with the most deprived areas faring worst. Will the Government reverse the cuts to public health budgets? Will they today&#8212;not &#8220;soon&#8221;,  not &#8220;in the near future&#8221;&#8212;publish the public health grant allocation for 2020-21, so that local authorities can begin budgeting for the financial year ahead, which starts next month?<\/p><p pid=\"d944.0\/12\">The Marmot review should act as a huge warning sign for the Government. Health inequalities are widening and life expectancy is stalling and declining. Given everything that we have heard this afternoon, what urgent steps will the Government take to address health inequalities before they increase further?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>Thank you, Deputy Presiding Officer, and may I also thank you for the statement and thank you for the briefing sessions that have been provided for us as opposition parties, both on Sunday and earlier today? I look forward to seeing that kind of dialogue continuing, because I do think that it's important that the public has confidence that the steps that the Government is taking are responsible steps to take, and how that's communicated to us and to the public more broadly is very important, of course. I could ask hundreds of questions. I won't do so. I know that we'll have plenty of opportunities to ask those questions. But, there are a few things that do strike me, and I will take this opportunity to ask questions on those.<\/p><p>First of all, a question that was asked earlier by Adam Price, and you've touched upon it again&#8212;namely, the information shared by Public Health Wales and how often that information is disseminated. Now, the First Minister suggested, at least, that data is shared on a daily basis. You have also suggested that information is shared at 3 p.m. every afternoon. According to my understanding, and according to Public Health Wales's website, although information is shared on a daily basis, the data on the number of tests carried out, be they positive or negative, aren't shared, but are shared only on a weekly basis. Perhaps you could confirm what the situation is and ask whether Public Health Wales will ensure that those data, as well as the daily narrative, are shared on a daily basis rather than on a weekly basis.<\/p><p>Now, in terms of 111, I'm also very pleased that that is now a number that can be reached wherever people are in Wales. Can you give us some idea of the additional resources that have been put in place in order to enable that to happen? As a slightly peripheral question, is this the start of the provision of 111 in all parts of Wales&#8212;something that I do hope would happen? On budget day, I would appreciate just a few broader comments on the additional resources that you have secured, or that you are seeking to secure, from the finance Minister in order to ensure that we are in the best possible position as a nation to respond to COVID-19.<\/p><p>May I also ask: there are initial plans being drawn up, as I understand it, to perhaps open the door to doctors who may have left the profession or who have retired to return, should there be pressures on the NHS workforce. So, what advice is available to those health workers who are already in this difficult situation in carrying out this additional work in supporting the public within the health service? So, what advice is available to them as to how they can register before the details are fully in place, so that we can strengthen the health workforce, should that be required?<\/p><p>Just a few points on an issue of principle. You quite rightly condemn the prejudice and the racist comments that have been made in relation to the spread of this particular virus. So, could I ask you to make a broader comment on the need to treat people who are in self-isolation with dignity and respect? Because it's very important that people should know what level of treatment they should expect from the state, from society, where they, of course, feel very vulnerable, having been placed in self-isolation.<\/p><p>It has become apparent too that Mako Vunipola is now not going to be available to play in the six nations match between Wales and England this weekend because he has self-isolated. First of all, what kind of discussions are taking place with organisations such as the Welsh Rugby Union, and football clubs and so on, around major events such as this that bring people together? But, more importantly, what does the fact that Mako Vunipola has placed himself in self-isolation, given that he isn't showing any symptoms of the virus, but has been in a situation where there may be a risk&#8212;I understand that he flew via Hong Kong&#8212;what does that tell us about the need for people to be aware of the possibility that they could have been infected and to take sensible precautions to safeguard themselves, and others around them, while balancing that, of course, with the need, as you say, for people not to be overly anxious in more general terms?<\/p><p>Finally, again with reference to comments made by Adam Price earlier today in terms of the responsibility on employers. I have raised this with you in the past, as a Government, asking you to give clear direction of your expectations of responsible employers here in Wales. Employment law is not devolved, but I do think that there is an expectation that could be put in place by the Welsh Government in terms of the conduct of employers. Irresponsible employers in workplaces where people are expected to turn up to work whatever the state of their health could be putting the health of others at risk. So, will you be making a statement, either now or over the next few days or weeks, on your expectations on the need for employers, like everyone else within society, to take those sensible steps that are required in order to ensure that public safety is secured?&#160;<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b373.0\/1\">My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for securing this debate, but I have to say that there is an elephant in the room. I am about to speak of things from my own direct personal experience over the years.<\/p><p pid=\"b373.0\/2\">By the early 1990s most of the Arab states were tiring of war. This did not necessarily include the PLO but, gradually, prospects for peace began to improve, until there were talks in Oslo directly between the Palestinians and the Israelis and President Clinton presided over the famous handshake on the White House lawn. By that time I had left government and was the executive chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless, a 100 year-old Arabist company with extensive links in the region. In the improving atmosphere&#8212;I had been invited to Saudi and had sat at the right hand of Crown Prince Abdullah discussing Jerusalem, something I would have thought inconceivable a few years before&#8212;I had a dream that the nexus between Tel Aviv and Beirut could be an off-Europe Hong Kong. They had all the skills and all  the enterprise existed there. So Cable &amp; Wireless bought 10% of Bezeq, the Israeli telephone company, we agreed to buy 49% of the Jordanian telephone company, and we were in a contract for about 1.4 million lines in Lebanon when the Lebanese Parliament brought a boycott resolution against Cable &amp; Wireless and sent it to Damascus. Some 36 hours later, a most unexpected reply came: they would refuse the boycott and shortly invite me to discuss the proposal in Damascus. My proposal did not include the Palestinians. These were the early years of mobile telephones, so I decided that we could create a Palestine mobile phone company to be owned and operated by the Palestinians. We had agreed roaming rights throughout the region.<\/p><p pid=\"b373.0\/3\">In December 1994, Yasser Arafat came to London and stayed at the Dorchester. I spent an hour with him. I offered Chairman Arafat a Palestinian mobile telephone company which could be set up within 90 days, with roaming rights all over the region. I told him I believed it would be popular with Israeli Arabs as well as Palestinians and would be the first fruits of the new state. He was interested and said he would invite me to Tripoli. The weeks passed, but no invitation came. Then I read that they had granted a licence to the son of the Lebanese Prime Minister. A few weeks later, I read that they had granted a licence to AT&amp;T. Finally, they phoned me and proposed a 60:40 company; we would have 40% and finance the operation. I agreed and negotiations started. Right at the end my people found out that of the Palestinians&#8217; 60% shareholding, 80% would be held by Mrs Arafat in her own name. That was unsustainable.<\/p><p pid=\"b373.0\/4\">At the same time, I was working with a group of Palestinians in London. During my time in London I was involved in employment and was trying to get things going there. They told me that they needed a technical school. I had recently retired as chairman of the World ORT union, a Jewish charity which is the largest of the vocational and training schools, with hundreds of thousands of students and good relationships with the World Bank. I came back within a week and said to them, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got &#163;20 million for you from the World Bank, just give me the site.&#8221; They hummed and hawed for months and eventually rang to say, &#8220;Can we increase the &#163;20 million to &#163;24 million, as we&#8217;ve got people to look after?&#8221; That was equally unsustainable. Then the wind changed, Arafat refused to sign and the al-Aqsa intifada started; we were back to where we were and the days of hope had gone.<\/p><p pid=\"b373.0\/5\">The biggest cause of poverty in the entire world is the corruption of rulers. If 87% of the Palestinian people believe that the Palestinian Authority is rife with corruption, who am I to doubt it? Until there is more open and transparent government for the Palestinians, I am fearful for their future. Look back over the long decades of war after war, peace offer after peace offer: every offer that they rejected was in time followed by a worse one, time after time. I am certainly not saying that this is a good offer, but I believe it will be better than the next.<\/p>",

I pay particular tribute to the work of Hong Kong Watch, of which I should declare I am a patron, and the many other civic organisations that continue to work tirelessly to advance the cause of democracy in Hong Kong. Most importantly, I should state my full admiration for the people of Hong Kong, who have demonstrated fortitude and resilience for their cause in the face of adversity and active suppression.<\/p><p pid=\"d182.2\/4\">The status of British nationals (overseas) in Hong Kong and their right to abode in the United Kingdom is an issue on which my party, with others, has campaigned for decades. It speaks to our values of internationalism, support for the rule of law and liberal democracy. During the handover process in the 1980s and 1990s, we demanded that the people of Hong Kong be given the right of abode in the UK if China were ever to renege on the promises made in the joint declaration. Our then leader, the late Paddy Ashdown, led that call, and he knew that the UK could not guarantee the promises we had made without such a supportive measure. Some decades later, it is clear that the value of the joint declaration is being challenged by China, which is why the issue of British national (overseas) passport holders is more important today than it has ever been.<\/p><p pid=\"d182.2\/5\">At the formation of the first ever all-party parliamentary group on Hong Kong last month, Members from all sides of the political discourse came together to create a new parliamentary focus on scrutiny of China&#8217;s actions and to hold our own Government to account. China has repeatedly undermined the principles of the joint declaration in recent years, weakening Hong Kong&#8217;s democratic systems. The one country, two systems arrangement is a shadow of what it was supposed to be. It has been mocked by Beijing officials as being a &#8220;historical document&#8221;. The former Governor of Hong Kong, Lord Patten, denounced that dismissive behaviour last month in the inaugural Paddy Ashdown memorial lecture. He said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"d182.2\/6\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;A treaty is what all the contracting signatories agree it is; it is not simply whatever one side says it is.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"d182.2\/7\">Far worse than Beijing&#8217;s rhetoric is what we have seen on the ground in Hong Kong. Reports of police brutality against protestors have arrived almost daily since the start of protests against proposed extradition laws last summer. That the Chinese state is reneging on the Sino-British joint declaration is no longer a matter of debate, and if ever there were a time to act in support of Hong Kong, this is it.<\/p><p pid=\"d182.2\/8\">The Bill that I seek the House&#8217;s leave to introduce is supported and promoted by Members on both sides of the House. It is not a particularly radical set of proposals, but sadly, it is a necessary one. It seeks to discourage further infringements on Hong Kong&#8217;s historic freedoms by reopening the BN(O) passport scheme and establishing the right to abode in the UK for BN(O) passport holders. For Hongkongers, this is one of the most important signals that we can send. It is a signal that we in the United Kingdom have not forgotten our obligations to them and that, as it begins to look as if some of their worst fears may be realised, we shall do more than stand on the sidelines wringing our hands. Since the joint declaration was signed and implemented, however, international law has moved on significantly and it is only right that account should be taken of changes such as the evolution of Magnitsky sanctions.<\/p><p pid=\"d182.2\/9\">The joint declaration already includes a mandate for the UK Government to strengthen the six-monthly reports so that they issue a judgment on whether the joint declaration has been breached. The problem with that, however, is that as things stand there is no meaningful sanction for those responsible for any breach. That is why I am calling today for the Government to commit to employing Magnitsky-style sanctions for those whom it is judged have been responsible for human rights violations whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere in China. This, again, would be a powerful signal that the United Kingdom is serious about our commitments to the people of Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"d182.2\/10\">These actions would not set us apart from the international consensus. Quite the opposite. At the end of last year, the United States Congress passed a Bill to take measures against those responsible for human rights abuses in Hong Kong, and to ensure an annual review of their trading relationship with China. The Bill was supported across Congress&#8212;a reminder for us that standing up for democracy should not be a single-party issue.<\/p><p pid=\"d182.2\/11\">I am realistic about the prospects of success for a Bill that starts its life as part of a ten-minute rule procedure. There are some who would say that even this is more than we should be doing and that it would be better to keep our heads down and avoid making waves when it comes to our dealings with an important trading partner. Members will have noticed this week already that the former Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, was moved  to rebuke the Government publicly for what he saw as misrepresentation of his legal advice on the issue of granting the right to abode. That was a quite extraordinary move and one that I hope will act as a shot across the bows of the Government. If there are good reasons not to act, then the Government should explain them. Good reasons, however, are one thing; excuses are quite another.<\/p><p pid=\"d182.2\/12\">Lord Goldsmith has been clear that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"d182.2\/13\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;the UK Government can extend full right of abode to BN(O) passport holders without breaching its side of the Sino-British Joint Declaration&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"d182.2\/14\">This is an issue that is not going to go away. We have seen the continued resistance shown by Hongkongers over these past few months. They are not keeping their heads down, they are making waves, and that is why there is growing support and enthusiasm in the House and across the country for meaningful action to be taken now to stand with them.<\/p><p pid=\"d182.2\/15\">Rather than sitting on our hands, the UK can stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Hong Kong. I am calling on the Government to take an active approach by adopting this Bill. It is time to do what we should have done during the handover; it is time to give the people of Hong Kong the guarantees they need, by providing their right to live in the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"d182.2\/16\">The idea of global Britain, so often trumpeted in recent weeks, is meaningless if we are timid in the advancement of international human rights. Human rights are nothing if they are not universal. What is good for us here must also be good for those in Hong Kong. This House must make its voice heard on essential values such as the rule of law and liberal democracy. I believe that there will be cross-party support and grassroots backing across the country and beyond to move this legislation forward. If the Government intend to give substance to their global rhetoric, they should put their weight behind the Bill as well.<\/p><p pid=\"d182.2\/17\">Question put and agreed to.<\/p><p pid=\"d182.2\/18\">Ordered,<\/p><p pid=\"d182.2\/19\">That Mr Alistair Carmichael, Wendy Chamberlain, Wera Hobhouse, Jim Shannon, Alyn Smith, Andrew Rosindell, Bob Seely, Caroline Lucas, Liz Saville-Roberts, Mr Virenda Sharma and Stephen Timms present the Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"d182.2\/20\">Mr Alistair Carmichael accordingly presented the Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"d182.2\/21\">Bill read the First time; to be read a Second time on Friday <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-06-12\">12 June<\/phrase>, and to be printed (Bill 92).<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c2225.1\/1\">My Lords, with permission, I will now repeat a Statement made by my right honourable friend the Health Secretary regarding the ongoing situation with the Wuhan coronavirus. The Statement is as follows:<\/p><p pid=\"c2225.1\/2\">&#8220;I have laid an instrument before the House to confirm the power that we have taken to isolate those at risk of spreading the virus, and if necessary to keep them isolated as part of our belt-and-braces approach to protecting the public. The powers are proportionate and will help us slow down transmission of the virus and make it easier for NHS and public health staff to do their jobs.<\/p><p pid=\"c2225.1\/3\">The clinical advice about risks to the public has not changed and remains moderate. As of today, eight people in England have tested positive for coronavirus. All are receiving expert care from the NHS, which is well prepared and equipped to deal with this situation. Contact tracing of the first four cases has been undertaken rapidly and is now complete, while tracing for the latest four cases is ongoing. This contact tracing itself identified five of the cases&#8212;a tribute to the skill and tenacity of Public Health England staff&#8212;as well as finding five further British nationals in France who also tested positive for the virus. They are now receiving treatment, and the Foreign Office is following up with consular support.<\/p><p pid=\"c2225.1\/4\">On Sunday, 105 more British nationals and dependants from Hubei province landed safely at Brize Norton. They are now in isolation facilities at Kents Hill Park in Milton Keynes and receiving all the necessary medical attention. I pay tribute to the Foreign Office and the MoD, as well as Milton Keynes Council, Milton Keynes hospital and my own team, for their hard work and efficiency in ensuring that this all went smoothly. This is, of course, in addition to those now reaching the end of their isolation on the Wirral.<\/p><p pid=\"c2225.1\/5\">I turn to the efforts to contain the outbreak in China. The Foreign Office is advising against all travel to Hubei province and all but essential travel to mainland China. Last week we issued new advice to all travellers returning to the UK from China, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. That advice is clear: if you develop symptoms of cough, fever or shortness of breath, you should call NHS 111 and immediately self-isolate for 14 days, even if the symptoms are minor. If you have returned from Hubei, you should self-isolate and contact NHS 111, even if you have no symptoms.<\/p><p pid=\"c2225.1\/6\">My officials discussed the incubation period with the World Health Organization this morning. The current evidence shows that a 14-day incubation period remains appropriate. We will continue to monitor emerging evidence closely with our international partners.<\/p><p pid=\"c2225.1\/7\">As I said last week, dealing with this disease is a marathon, not a sprint. The situation will get worse before it gets better. We will be guided by the science. Be in no doubt: we will do everything that is effective to tackle this virus and keep people safe. We are investing &#163;40 million in vaccine research and working with international efforts on therapeutics. Today I can announce to the House the immediate launch of a capital facility to support any urgent works the NHS needs for coronavirus response, such as the creation of further isolation areas and other necessary facilities.<\/p><p pid=\"c2225.1\/8\">Finally, there are actions that each and every one of us can take&#8212;simple but effective steps such as washing hands and using tissues. We will take all necessary precautions to keep the public safe. I commend this Statement to the House.&#8221;<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1740.1\/1\">My Lords, I am delighted to follow the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, because I agree with most of what he said&#8212;which, I think he will accept, has not always been the case. My noble friend the Minister has a galaxy of learned and expert people to speak on this Bill. It seems to me that the Government  should be grateful that they are getting legal advice from three very learned retired judges. It would cost the Government a great deal of money if they had to ask for the advice, so I think she should be grateful.<\/p><p pid=\"b1740.1\/2\">My contribution will be much more modest. I say to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Judge, who speaks with great authority and expertise on these things, that I do not see that we need to be particularly concerned that China, let us say, should be allowed to extradite people under this measure. Given the problems that China has had with Hong Kong, which started off with extradition from Hong Kong to China, we would be unlikely to take that sort of decision. It seems to me, and others have said, that the Bill rightly and sensibly caters for the changes to the European arrest warrant now that we have left. The 24 hours within which somebody arrested under this has to be seen by a judge is reasonable. I agree with the noble and learned Lord&#8212;I will come to this later&#8212;that not all countries share the same standards as us. That also applies to European Union countries.<\/p><p pid=\"b1740.1\/3\">I support the Bill because it is sensible and very modest. So far it is certainly countries that we trust to abide by the rule of law that are included. For instance, Australia, New Zealand and Canada all take a great deal of their legal systems from us anyway&#8212;so, given the situation, it is not controversial.<\/p><p pid=\"b1740.1\/4\">Part 1 of the Extradition Act 2003 was about the European arrest warrant. I will concentrate on that, because it is more controversial. Like the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, I think the European arrest warrant can be hugely valuable. For instance, it gets nasty criminals out of the UK to face justice&#8212;paedophiles, drug dealers, murderers, whoever. That is all to be welcomed. I think the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, said that in 2017 there were 15,000 or so requests to the UK; I thought it was more like 17,000, but I may be wrong. I think we issued fewer than 400, but with my limited knowledge of the internet I had some trouble getting the correct details.<\/p><p pid=\"b1740.1\/5\">I will concentrate on Romania, which I think is the country that issues the greatest or second-greatest number of European arrest warrants in the European Union. That may be a reflection of crime in Romania. I will concentrate first on the general situation and then on one case, which shows why we should be very wary of believing that, just because a country is in the European Union, it follows all the rules and values that we have in this country and follows the rule of law as we do. We assume that because a country is in the European Union, it abides by the rule of law.<\/p><p pid=\"b1740.1\/6\">I will not mention the case I know of for two reasons. First, it is sub judice and, although I believe that under parliamentary privilege I could mention it, it would be improper to do so. Secondly, I used to have&#8212;I stress that I used to have&#8212;a financial interest in the case, in that I was advising somebody on this. That ended several months ago, but again it would be straying into difficult territory if I were to mention the case in particular.<\/p><p pid=\"b1740.1\/7\">The issues I will raise now on Romania have all been covered in the press. I start with a newspaper article from <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-04-10\">10 April<\/phrase> last year. I mention only this one&#8212;there are many others&#8212;because its headline is:  &#8220;Romania&#8217;s child traffickers walk free to mock the British police&#8221;. It was an operation called Golf, and the person in charge of it said:<\/p><p pid=\"b1740.1\/8\">&#8220;Let me tell you, there was tonnes of evidence against that gang &#8230; Dozens of child witnesses were interviewed, and we found hundreds of forged birth certificates. It beggars belief that all 26 suspects have walked free. On our side, we secured convictions, but Romania has not &#8230; If we cannot get Romanian courts to convict the most serious crimes it has an impact across the whole of Europe.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b1740.1\/9\">The case that I know about concerns political interference and deaths in prison. The Prime Minister of Romania stated on television before an arrest that an arrest would happen. I think we would all agree that that would be completely improper in this country. The same person died in prison. That was surely political interference. I would say so, but so does the European Bar Association&#8212;the F&#233;d&#233;ration des Barreaux d&#8217;Europe&#8212;which mentioned in a resolution on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-04-19\">19 April<\/phrase> 2018<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1740.1\/10\">&#8220;the right of access of Romanian citizens to a free and independent court and about the situation of judges, prosecutors and lawyers from Romania, noting that there is an interference with the independence of judges, prosecutors, lawyers and the administration of justice due to the intervention of Romanian Intelligence Service&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b1740.1\/11\">and called on the justice organisations to &#8220;cease the secret protocols&#8221; with the intelligence services<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1740.1\/12\">&#8220;and to restore independence of the judicial system by destroying also secret Protocols and &#8230; respect the right of Romanian citizens to a fair trial.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b1740.1\/13\">If that was said about the United Kingdom, we would rightly be horrified.<\/p><p pid=\"b1740.1\/14\">The issue of prison conditions is more difficult. We would wish to send back a murderer from Romania, but I note that the European Court of Human Rights said some two and a half years ago that the detention conditions in Romanian prisons are in breach of the convention and<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1740.1\/15\">&#8220;a violation of Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment) of the European Convention on Human Rights.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b1740.1\/16\">As I said, the case with which I am dealing involved somebody dying in custody because he was not given proper treatment. In his judgment on that case, which, again, I will not name, a UK judge said not two years ago, after the events I have cited, that Romania was a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights and that he was<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1740.1\/17\">&#8220;entirely satisfied that it will abide by its Convention obligations&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"b1740.1\/18\">which the European Bar Association and the European Court of Human Rights did not agree with.<\/p><p pid=\"b1740.1\/19\">I ask my noble friend the Minister: should we see some changes to the European arrest warrant, as I believe is likely, could we look very closely at the conditions in each country in Europe and at how they follow the rule of law? It is not just Romania, but I will not spread my wings too far on this. We need to make sure that other European countries are abiding by the rule of law as we see it before we admit them into what is already working under the European arrest warrant.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1591.0\/1\">My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord McConnell, for securing this debate and for his long-term commitment to these issues. I also congratulate my noble friend Lady Penn on her maiden speech. I look forward to seeing the amazing things that she will do during her time in this House and the collegiate way in which she will undertake her work.<\/p><p pid=\"b1591.0\/2\">In this debate, I will restrict my remarks to the way in which nations develop and how we have observed that safer and fairer nations are actually built. I hope that this might provide some interesting thinking to feed into the Prime Minister&#8217;s welcome review.<\/p><p pid=\"b1591.0\/3\">How a person, community or nation develops along the pathway from poverty to prosperity has long been a concern of mine. From my time spent living in the  Walled City in Hong Kong to my current role at the Legatum Institute&#8212;I refer to the Members&#8217; register of interests&#8212;the question of how a nation builds a safer, fairer and more prosperous society has challenged me greatly. At the Legatum Institute, we have undertaken a piece of work entitled How Nations Succeed. We have analysed which nations, over a 60-year arc, have built fairer and safer societies from a starting point of fragility, such as Colombia, and which, with exactly the same starting point, have struggled to do the same, such as Nicaragua.<\/p><p pid=\"b1591.0\/4\">From this work, we have observed a number of lessons, but noble Lords should not worry&#8212;I will reference only three. As we have heard this afternoon, the number one need for any country is self-evidently to deliver security, peace and stability for its people&#8212;hence the safer world element of this debate. However, there is also a need to strengthen the social contract between a Government and their citizens. What can they really expect of one another? Then there is the need to create a positive environment for investment and to improve conditions for enterprise and flexible labour markets, all of which ultimately lead to a fairer society.<\/p><p pid=\"b1591.0\/5\">Noble Lords will be grateful to know that I will not unpack these one by one. However, what is interesting to note here is that there is not a clear connection between the development of a nation and the distribution and focus of aid to it. To put it simply, what we have observed is that nations that receive aid but do not take responsibility for their own development do not thrive on a national scale, even if some of their people benefit in the short term. However, nations that take responsibility for their own destiny drastically outperform the development of those reliant on foreign assistance, regardless of their starting point.<\/p><p pid=\"b1591.0\/6\">Against this background, let us first look at the issue of security and the creation of a secure foundation for a nation. No nation will be able to make the transition into a safer and fairer world without first delivering safety and security for its people. Stable governance, free from violent conflict and upheaval, is an essential requirement for development, as we have seen over the years in, say, Botswana. Countries need safety and security, effective governance and a stable political environment to thrive. It is therefore no coincidence that poverty is concentrated in high-risk settings. Some 87% of people who currently live in extreme poverty are in countries where security in all its forms&#8212;political, social or environmental&#8212;is fragile.<\/p><p pid=\"b1591.0\/7\">Globally, we are seeing the first welcome signs of increased safety and security following a trend of declining safety and security. This is crucial to establishing greater fairness. The relationship between wealth generation and security is essential, as we have heard. A nation with a basic level of safety and security is much more likely to create the conditions necessary for producing wealth, or fairness, for its citizens.<\/p><p pid=\"b1591.0\/8\">As nations transition from violence to stability, the next important step is to strengthen the social contract between a Government and their citizens. Our research shows that the strength and health of institutions has a stronger relationship with social well-being than aid in the long term; this points to where the greatest development leverage is likely to be in future. Improving the quality of institutions can stimulate increased  economic well-being and thereby increased fairness. In the long term, the quality of institutions therefore has a substantial impact on social well-being, while the integrity and accountability of government is strongly related to the sort of fairness outcomes we long to see in the developing nations, in people&#8217;s health, education and living conditions.<\/p><p pid=\"b1591.0\/9\">This is because with stable Governments and institutional trust comes the ability to foster a positive investment environment. In our research, we have observed that the opening up of the world&#8217;s economies has led to an extraordinary reduction in the number of people in poverty. Absolute poverty rates have fallen; the proportion of families living on less than $1.90 a day has more than halved since 2000, and it continues to fall. We must not forget that the greatest anti-poverty achievement in the history of mankind has actually happened in our lifetime. Mainstream economists on the left and right, and in the centre, agree on the central role that free trade, property rights, the rule of law and entrepreneurship have all played in creating a fairer world. In our focus on aid, we must not hinder or constrain this metanarrative that is changing the world faster than any aid programme could.<\/p><p pid=\"b1591.0\/10\">The final lesson we learned when analysing how nations succeed is that countries which have developed over the last 60 years, such as Indonesia, have done so across multiple fronts concurrently: strengthening their institutions, growing their economies and improving the well-being of their people. This has seen a decrease in mortality rates across all age groups and a growing life expectancy. Our research shows that in living conditions and education, 85% of countries across the world saw an improvement over the last 10 years. Education systems are affording more people the opportunity to learn, with higher enrolment rates at each learning stage. Women are spending more time in school on average, for example in a country such as Mauritius. These improvements to living conditions, health and education foster communities and nations that are resilient enough to weather the challenges that an unpredictable world can provide.<\/p><p pid=\"b1591.0\/11\">There is significant food for thought in this debate, as we consider the way forward and the role that Britain should play in international development. If we are really focused on supporting the development of nations, do we need a conversation around how nations really succeed and develop? To build a compassionate world, we should certainly focus on providing assistance at times of crisis, famine and flood. Stability is absolutely the basis on which all prosperity is predicated. But if we really want to learn from effective models and use our defence, diplomacy and development to support emerging nations, should we work with the instincts of a nation where it is committed to development? Across all fronts, the nations that have forged the pathway from poverty to prosperity have worked to attract the people, ideas and capital that they need to succeed.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c310.0\/1\">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Sir George, and I apologise for being 10 seconds late. I am grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Stephen Hammond\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11927\">the Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond)<\/phrase> for securing this important debate. I am also grateful for the contribution of my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Steve Double\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25410\">the Member for St Austell and Newquay (Steve Double)<\/phrase>. I will try to respond to all the points raised.<\/p><p pid=\"c310.0\/2\">Before I address the current situation in Hong Kong, and the implications for those with British national overseas status, it is important to set out the obligations of the UK Government towards Hong Kong citizens with British national overseas status, and where those obligations derive from. BNO status was created in 1985 for people in Hong Kong who would lose their British dependent territory citizenship in 1997, when sovereignty passed from Britain back to China. This  status had to be acquired before <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-06-30\">30 June<\/phrase> 1997, so it is not possible to gain BNO status now. The BNO passport replaced the British dependent territories citizens&#8217; passport. Provisions relating to the creation of BNO status were part of the package of agreements made at the same time as the joint declaration. The status entitled Hong Kong citizens to continue to use passports issued by the UK Government. BNO status does not pass to the holders&#8217; children.<\/p><p pid=\"c310.0\/3\">As of October 2019, there were just over 250,000 BNO passport holders, out of an estimated 2.9 million people with BNO status. Individuals with BNO status are entitled to British consular assistance in third countries, but not in Hong Kong, mainland China or Macau. BNO status holders are also entitled to visa-free access to the UK for up to six months as a visitor. However, they do not automatically have a right to remain in the UK beyond that period, and nor do they have access to public funds. Those with BNO status require entry clearance when coming to work, study or live in the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"c310.0\/4\">Regarding former members of the Hong Kong armed services who have not received an offer of a British passport, the Government are extremely grateful to those who served in the Hong Kong military service corps. They carried out their duties with the same sense of pride and professionalism as any other British Army regular unit. They are rightly invited to take part in the Cenotaph parade for Remembrance Sunday every year. Under the British nationalities selection scheme, which was introduced in 1990 and ran until <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-07-01\">1 July<\/phrase> 1997, a limited number of Hong Kong military service core personnel who were settled in Hong Kong could apply to register as British citizens. The Home Office is listening to representations made on behalf of former Hong Kong military service core personnel who were unable to obtain citizenship through the selection scheme.<\/p><p pid=\"c310.0\/5\">While BNO status is not contained within the joint declaration itself, it was established as part of the delicate balance in the negotiations that led to the Sino-British joint declaration. Full and continued respect for the provisions in the joint declaration are crucial to the future stability and prosperity of Hong Kong, and to the rights, freedoms and autonomy of its people. It is a legally binding treaty, registered at the UN. It remains in force. As a co-signatory, we have a legal interest in ensuring that China stands by its obligations. The UK Government will continue to monitor its implementation closely.<\/p><p pid=\"c310.0\/6\">We want to see the joint declaration upheld in its entirety. We are not therefore seeking to change any one part of the package. We expect China to live up to its obligations under the joint declaration and, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, to its wider international human rights law obligations.<\/p><p pid=\"c310.0\/7\">Hon. Members have discussed whether the rights of those with BNO status should be altered following the recent protests in Hong Kong. Our position is clear: we believe that the best outcome for people with BNO status is for them to be able to enjoy the high degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms enshrined for Hong Kong in the joint declaration. BNO status was part of the delicate balance and negotiations that were conducted, which were concluded at the time of the joint declaration. The delicate balance reflected in that package needs to  be respected. That is why we believe it would not be right to change the legal status of those with BNO status at this time, but they will have our full support in exercising the rights they have as part of their status.<\/p><p pid=\"c310.0\/8\">The UK Government continue to take their moral and political obligations towards Hong Kong very seriously. The political situation and protests in Hong Kong are a matter of serious concern to us all. We are absolutely clear that a political solution can only come from within Hong Kong. That requires two urgent steps to be taken: first, a full and credible independent inquiry into the events of the last several months; and secondly, a process of meaningful political dialogue in which all sides engage in good faith.<\/p><p pid=\"c310.0\/9\">We have worked intensively over recent months to support a positive resolution to the protests, and to uphold the joint declaration. We continue to engage with the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has raised these matters directly with the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, and with the Chinese Foreign Minister and State Councillor, Wang Yi. He also summoned the Chinese ambassador in November.<\/p><p pid=\"c310.0\/10\">Senior officials have reiterated our messages during regular engagement with their counterparts in Hong Kong, Beijing and London. Ministers and officials also continue to raise our concerns internationally, including at the UN General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.<\/p>",

Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (James Brokenshire)<\/phrase>, and I am pleased to see that the NHS has got him back on his feet.<\/p><p pid=\"f1206.2\/2\">I am grateful for this opportunity to speak on health and social care, as the issue is very close to my heart. I start by paying tribute to the wonderful, dedicated staff at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital in my constituency. We should all be grateful to every single person who works there, from porters to paramedics, from healthcare assistants to operating department practitioners, and from doctors to nurses. They are dedicated but often overstretched.<\/p><p pid=\"f1206.2\/3\">I declare my interest as a proud member, and former employee, of the GMB union. I support the ongoing campaign against the outsourcing of housekeeping and domestic services at the L&amp;D.<\/p><p pid=\"f1206.2\/4\">I know the devastating impact of outsourcing. As a carer working for an outsourced care company, I witnessed at first hand a business that put profit before patients. It was then, standing in front of a patient who desperately needed more than the 15 minutes I had allotted for her, that I knew our social care system was broken&#8212;and it is still broken today. All parties in this House must have the political will to mend it, because the frustration of health workers should not be underestimated.<\/p><p pid=\"f1206.2\/5\">My mother came to this country from Malaysia 46 years ago, and she is still an NHS nurse today. She is just like many people who come to this country from across the world to work in our fantastic NHS, and we should never forget the debt we owe them.<\/p><p pid=\"f1206.2\/6\">Mum came to see me swear in just before Christmas, and we took pictures by the Christmas tree in Westminster  Hall. Her face went from smiley to thunderous in a matter of seconds. Usually that look is reserved for when I have done something truly awful, but it turns out she was not scowling at me; she was looking at the person behind me, which happened to be none other than the Secretary of State for Health. Joking aside, when we see the latest proposal to scrap four-hour A&amp;E targets, who, frankly, could blame my mum?<\/p><p pid=\"f1206.2\/7\">The NHS goes to the very heart of my party&#8217;s principles. My predecessor, Kelvin Hopkins, embodies those socialist Labour principles. He represented Luton North for 22 years and is beloved by many in the town. But for all his and his wife Pat&#8217;s dedication to the area, what I am most grateful to them for is their daughter, my amazing hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Rachel Hopkins\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25809\">the Member for Luton South (Rachel Hopkins)<\/phrase>.<\/p><p pid=\"f1206.2\/8\">Together we will represent the people of Luton with equal energy, commitment and dedication to the town, because we will need to. Every cut to local government and every cut to every service has an impact on an individual we represent. Early-years providers like the fantastic Gill Blowers nursery, which I visited last week, are facing a cut of a quarter of their budget. Firefighter numbers in Bedfordshire have been cut by 9%. Each child in Luton North is &#163;576 a year worse off. There are fewer police on our streets. All that comes against the backdrop of a hostile environment.<\/p><p pid=\"f1206.2\/9\">Even in these challenging times, Luton has always punched above its weight. Together, the people of Luton make the town the fantastic place it is. The mosques, churches, businesses and wider community have come together to support Luton&#8217;s food bank, making sure the most vulnerable in our community are looked after.<\/p><p pid=\"f1206.2\/10\">The entire community came together to make the dream of the new Power Court stadium a reality and to deliver the regeneration Luton wants. The Labour council led by Hazel Simmons works with communities to continue building much-needed council housing while facing over &#163;100 million-worth of cuts. Time and time again, Luton comes together to say no to the hatred and division of the far right.<\/p><p pid=\"f1206.2\/11\">I learned through the trade union movement that we are stronger together and that we should not let people divide us. That is sound advice for any workplace, but it is a lesson for our communities and our country, too. The people of Luton North know this to be true. Luton&#8217;s diversity is its strength, and I am proud to be bringing up this little one in a multicultural town that comes together.<\/p><p pid=\"f1206.2\/12\">Yes, in case Members have not noticed, I am pregnant&#8212;it is not just a good Christmas. She is, in every way, a little mix. A mix of east Asian, Irish and British. She is essentially Luton in a baby. And, yes, she will be donning a Luton Town shirt and going to games in a brand-new stadium that will be fit for her generation and future Lutonians. Judging by how she is kicking me right now, she might even try out for the team.<\/p><p pid=\"f1206.2\/13\">In the face of the hatred we saw in the past, we on these Benches will have to be staunch defenders of the equality and diversity I know run to our country&#8217;s core. Just over the road, in the Cabinet war rooms, my grandma worked under Churchill during the second world war, while my grandad fought overseas with the Royal Engineers.  They fought against vile fascism then, just as we must all renew our fierce opposition to those who discriminate against or dehumanise others in every corner of the world, from Luton to Kashmir to Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"f1206.2\/14\">It was not racism or hatred but the need for change that drove people to Brexit, and we must all hear that call for change. Luton has a proud manufacturing history, from Vauxhall to Electrolux, and it needs a future to be proud of, too&#8212;one that provides the decent housing, good schools, affordable transport and well-paid jobs that every Lutonian not only wants but richly deserves. As their MP, that is exactly what I will fight for in Luton North.<\/p>",

Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HRVP), chaired the November FAC with her replacement Josep Borrell chairing the December FAC. The United Kingdom&#8217;s Ambassador to the Political and Security Committee, Paul Johnston, represented the United Kingdom at both the November and December FAC.<\/p><p><em>November FAC<\/em><\/p><p>At the November FAC, HRVP Mogherini briefed Ministers on Venezuela, Bolivia, and Lebanon and touched on Turkey&#8217;s actions in North-East Syria. Ministers also adopted a framework for sanctions in response to Turkey's hydrocarbons explorations activity in the Eastern Mediterranean.<\/p><p>On Hong Kong, the United Kingdom stressed the need for support for the right to peaceful protest; condemnation of the violence; the need for a proportionate response; the importance of China upholding the Joint Declaration; and the need for investigations into the treatment of protestors.<\/p><p>Ministers discussed the EU&#8217;s approach to Iran and Gulf Regional Security, following Tehran&#8217;s announcement of further non-compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA).<\/p><p>The United Kingdom highlighted our commitment to the JCPoA whilst noting that Iranian actions were putting the deal under pressure. We stressed the importance of all parties engaging in comprehensive negotiations and of the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchange (INSTEX) to avoid the collapse of the deal and to support regional security.<\/p><p>Ministers discussed the political situation in Afghanistan and reviewed the prospects for peace, following the Presidential election. HRVP Mogherini underlined the EU&#8217;s willingness to contribute both politically and financially to peace talks, and its readiness to support an inclusive Afghan political process. The United Kingdom stressed the importance of reductions in Taliban violence and renewed US-Taliban talks as an important step towards the relaunch of intra-Afghan negotiations.<\/p><p>Ministers had an exchange of views with the Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. They reaffirmed the EU's strong political commitment to support the civilian transitional government, as well as the EU's readiness to provide financial aid for the transition, including in support of economic and state structure reform. They highlighted the importance of ensuring that the civilian transition remains an inclusive process, including an appropriate role for youth and women.<\/p><p><em>December FAC<\/em><\/p><p>In December, Ministers expressed their concerns about the Turkey-Libya Memorandum of Understanding on delimitation of maritime jurisdiction and on security and military cooperation. They also reflected on the political situation in Libya and the Berlin process, which aims to find a sustainable solution to the situation in the country.<\/p><p>Ministers exchanged views on Ukraine, in the context of the Normandy Format leaders' summit, which took place in Paris the following week, and the situation in Iran, following the recent meeting of the Joint Commission of the JCPoA, as well as recent protests. HRVP Borrell briefed on the situation in Bolivia, Moldova and Hong Kong. On the latter, the United Kingdom underlined the importance of meaningful government efforts around dialogue to prevent a return to violence.<\/p><p>Ministers discussed EU-Africa relations in preparation for 2020&#8217;s Ministerial and summit-level meetings between the EU and the African Union (AU). They addressed the political, economic, security and demographic aspects of the relationship as well as important cross-cutting issues such as climate change and digitalisation. Ministers emphasised that the next summit would be an important milestone in modernising and scaling up the EU's partnership with Africa.<\/p><p>Ahead of Human Rights Day on 10 December, Ministers discussed the promotion and protection of human rights in the world. They assessed the EU's work on human rights, the instruments at its disposal and its priorities for the coming months, reaffirming the EU's leadership in the protection and promotion of human rights worldwide. HRVP Borrell announced the launch of preparatory work on a possible sanctions regime to address serious human rights violations.<\/p><p>During the working lunch, Ministers informally discussed the FAC&#8217;s working methods. The new HRVP set out his priorities, including the Western Balkans, Europe&#8217;s Neighbourhood and the Middle-East, as well as on how the EU could work together more effectively to deliver operational outcomes.<\/p><p><em>Conclusions<\/em><\/p><p>At the November FAC, the Council extended sanctions on Venezuela for a year due to persistent actions undermining democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights. It also adopted a framework for restrictive measures in response to Turkey's hydrocarbons explorations activity in the Eastern Mediterranean.<\/p><p>At the December FAC, the Council agreed a number of measures:<\/p><ul><li>The Council decided to maintain individual restrictive measures against several personalities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) regarding the obstruction of the electoral process and human rights violations, and to lift these measures for two other persons.<\/li><li>The Council also adopted conclusions on the DRC that support the most recent elections as the first peaceful transfer of power in the country's history and state the EU's readiness for a gradual engagement in support to the DRC government's reform agenda, based on reciprocal commitments.<\/li><li>The Council adopted conclusions on Sudan, recognising the opportunity for democracy, peace and prosperity following the political transition. They highlight Sudan&#8217;s importance in the region&#8217;s stability and reaffirm the EU's commitment to accompanying Sudan on its reform path towards democracy. While welcoming the transition government&#8217;s recent steps, they reiterate the EU&#8217;s concern for the deteriorating humanitarian situation and call upon the Sudanese authorities to remove remaining bureaucratic obstacles to humanitarian and development actors&#8217; work.<\/li><li>The Council adopted conclusions on the civilian Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) Compact, reaffirming its commitment to make civilian CSDP more capable, effective, flexible and responsive. They highlight CSDP missions&#8217; significant contribution to international peace and stability as an essential part of the EU&#8217;s integrated approach to external conflicts and crises. They also emphasise the need to strengthen the EU's role and capacity to act as a security provider through CSDP.<\/li><li>The Council adopted conclusions on the EU Arctic policy, and noted that the EU should continue to make a significant contribution in both regional and multilateral fora.<\/li><li>The Council adopted a decision in support of strengthening biological safety and security in Latin America in line with the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.<\/li><li>The Council extended the implementation period of the decision in support of the destruction of Syrian chemical weapons to a total of 48 months. This extension of the implementation period will allow the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which is responsible for the technical implementation of the project, to reach its planned objectives.<\/li><li>The Council adopted a decision in support of SEESAC disarmament and arms control activities in South East Europe reducing the threat of illicit small arms and light weapons (SALW) and their ammunition.<\/li><li>The Council adopted the EU position within the Ghana-EU Economic Partnership Agreement Committee regarding the definition of the concept of \"originating products\" and methods of administrative cooperation.<\/li><li>The Council adopted a decision setting out the EU&#8217;s position within the administrative committee for the international convention on the harmonisation of frontier controls of goods, which aims to reduce barriers to international trade and facilitate the movement of goods at the international level, to reduce administrative burdens on Member States.<\/li><\/ul><div class=\"qna-result-writtenstatement-joint-statement\"><div class=\"qna-result-writtenstatement-joint-statement-row\">\n                                This statement has also been made in the House of Lords: \n                                <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parliament.uk\/business\/publications\/written-questions-answers-statements\/written-statement\/Lords\/2020-01-15\/HLWS32\/\" id=\"ctl00_ctl00_FormContent_SiteSpecificPlaceholder_PageContent_ctrlQnAWSList_rptWrittenStatements_ctl07_ctrlWrittenStatementItem_rptJointStatement_ctl00_hypJointStatementID\">HLWS32<\/a><\/div><\/div>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b543.0\/1\">My Lords, it is a great pleasure to follow my noble friend Lord Inglewood, a fellow Cumbrian, although his connections to Cumbria go back an impressive 400 years longer than mine.<\/p><p pid=\"b543.0\/2\">Since January 2018 I have spoken just twice on Brexit-related legislation, and one of those occasions was to explain some technicalities in the report of the Delegated Powers Committee, which I chair. But tonight I am speaking in a personal capacity.<\/p><p pid=\"b543.0\/3\">I warmly welcome the Bill, which marks the first and most vital phase of &#8220;getting Brexit done&#8221;. I welcome it in its current form because it means that at long last we have a Commons that is in accord with the people of this country, who over the last three years have seen their vote in the referendum sabotaged every inch of the way by some Members of Parliament who put their own arrogant, selfish view before the decision of the electorate.<\/p><p pid=\"b543.0\/4\">Over Christmas I met quite a few of my former constituents&#8212;you know, the little people up north accused by remainders of not knowing what they voted for. We had no view on defeated MPs from other parties, but they shared my relief&#8212;and indeed pleasure&#8212;that the electorate had got rid of Tory MPs such as Grieve, Soubry, Gauke, Allen and others. They hoped that we would hear no more from them. To that, I would add former Prime Ministers and Deputy Prime Ministers, who will no longer need to travel to Brussels to assure Monsieur Barnier that Brexit will be stopped.<\/p><p pid=\"b543.0\/5\">Could we also hear less from those who voted remain telling us what the leavers did and did not vote for? I had the opportunity to study the polling data about leavers. The majority expected to take an economic hit and were willing to accept that, provided we got back control of our laws and Parliament. The last Chancellor of the Exchequer kept repeating the shibboleth  that people did not vote to be poorer&#8212;wrong again, Chancellor. They expected to be poorer because the Chancellor and all his dodgy Treasury documents told them that repeatedly.<\/p><p pid=\"b543.0\/6\">So now we have the Bill before us today. It is right that ongoing parliamentary scrutiny of trade negotiations has gone. We saw in the last Parliament how even those remainers who agreed on what they disliked could not agree on anything that they liked. The main point I want to make to my noble friend is that EU negotiators will play even harder and dirtier now in the negotiations. They take the view that the United Kingdom has to be punished for daring to break away from them and to stop other countries leaving. First, they will demand sequencing of talks&#8212;the trap Theresa May fell into. That is, they will not discuss trade in goods until we surrender our fishing grounds and sell out our fishermen. And if we do that, then they will not discuss financial services until we sell out on trade in goods. And even if we extend the period by another 20 years, I do not see that they will do a deal on financial services unless we surrender every national interest.<\/p><p pid=\"b543.0\/7\">So let us be ready for it. Of course, when we sell cars to the EU we must comply with their design regulations, just as we have to comply with different regulations when we sell to Hong Kong or California. However, there can be no question of complying with the EU demand that we can sell them goods only if, for example, our workers do not volunteer to do overtime above 60 hours a week, or we agree a corporation tax rate which the EU approves of or that we cannot give any state aid in any circumstances. We must not be tied to EU regulations when we leave but have maximum freedom for divergence if we wish to create our own laws and do things better.<\/p><p pid=\"b543.0\/8\">We need the freedom to do gene editing, set higher environmental standards and approve medicines a lot faster. Are we willing to accept the cruelty of live animals being transported on excessively long journeys without proper food and water? Are we willing to let any more diseased plants and trees into this country and not be able to step up phytosanitary controls? There are hundreds of areas where we can do better, provided we do not sign up to accepting EU diktats on keeping all aspects of the single market and customs union.<\/p><p pid=\"b543.0\/9\">And by the way, the people voted to leave the single market and customs union, too. We were repeatedly told by the Government and remainers that if we were foolish enough to vote leave, we would be thrown out of the single market and customs union. We the leavers knew that, and 17.4 million people voted to do just that. So, in conclusion, I say to my noble friend that the Government are delivering on leaving the political union on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-01-31\">31 January<\/phrase>. We must be out of the customs union on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-12-31\">31 December<\/phrase> of this year as well.<\/p>",

As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I have seen that, when one visits certain missions abroad, there is a good policy understanding among our diplomats. However, that is sometimes not necessarily reflected in this House, and we must work much harder to ensure that we have our Ministers talking about the subject and promoting it much more themselves.<\/p><p pid=\"b818.1\/2\">Secondly, good foreign policy relies on a vibrant domestic economy and a realistic trade policy, providing a positive financial context in which to play a leadership role abroad. Instead, Brexit provides years of uncertainty,  which will harm long-term economic growth and a sense of buoyancy in our economy while consigning our economic importance to that of a middling nation.<\/p><p pid=\"b818.1\/3\">The past decade has already seen anaemic growth in the domestic economy as a result of the disastrous policy of austerity and the self-inflicted wounds of Brexit. Just today, in the financial pages, there is much discussion about another rate cap by the Bank of England because of fears of another dip in our economy. Households are worse off now than they were in 2010&#8212;10 years ago. Simultaneously, there is a real risk that UK trade policy could erode standards on our trade in goods and lead to a diminishing of the ease of trading in services owing to the ridiculously short adjustment period that the Government have given themselves to achieve equivalence in financial services. The amount of political capital in energy required to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU and the unrealistic timeframe of 11 months will mean that the UK is likely to reduce its influence in other crucial international relations issues.<\/p><p pid=\"b818.1\/4\">Finally, membership of the European Union has, to date, provided a strong front to promote values and norms in international relations, including a robust approach to promoting human rights. The UK was instrumental in designing a strong framework of protecting human rights, as it was the first nation to ratify the Council of Europe&#8217;s convention on human rights in war-ravaged Europe in 1949. The convention commits each signatory&#8212;each nation that signs up to it&#8212;to abide by certain standards of behaviour and protect the basic rights and freedoms of ordinary people. The treaty aims to protect the rule of law and promote democracy. The EU institutions in practice have performed an important function to maintain human rights dialogue with large trade partners, such as China, Japan and Turkey. Let us take, for example, trade relationships with Turkey. How will the UK be able to hold Turkey to account on its treatment, for example, of the Kurdish and Alevi communities, when trying at the same time to forge a trade deal and possibly to selling them even more arms than we do now?<\/p><p pid=\"b818.1\/5\">On the case of China, how can we have those honest discussions with that giant nation around the issues of Xinjiang province, Hong Kong and Taiwan, when, at the same time, we desperately want to promote our trade arrangements with them.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b213.0\/1\">My Lords, two years ago I received an email from a complete stranger about veterans. I did some research and found, going back five years and more, that Members of both Houses had been approached on the topic. I and others raised it in Questions and debates, in approaches to four Home Secretaries, and by letters or meetings of delegations. One well-supported letter was sent in January 2019 by Andrew Rosindell MP and co-signed by Sir Lindsay Hoyle. It was supported by a further 18 MPs and a dozen Peers, including the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Trafford, and me. With many approaches to Home Office Ministers, what is it about? What responses were given and is it resolved?<\/p><p pid=\"b213.0\/2\">Some 300 individuals born in Hong Kong and locally enlisted to serve in Her Majesty&#8217;s Armed Forces prior to handover were seeking right of abode in the United Kingdom. Early reaction from the Home Office was dismissive. Locally employed and locally enlisted, they were said to have no rights other than to British national (overseas) status. However, these veterans had been employed and paid by the UK, not the Hong Kong Government, their pay was subject to a UK tax reduction, they had been issued with UK service identity papers, and some had undertaken detachments in this country and jungle warfare training in Brunei. Others had been deployed to meet UK commitments to UNFICYP in 1990-91 to allow UK servicemen there to redeploy in the first Gulf conflict. Their status as veterans seemed indisputable and should be honoured by the Government under the Armed Forces covenant, as mentioned in the gracious Speech.<\/p><p pid=\"b213.0\/3\">After that, Ministers&#8217; responses then sounded more helpful:<\/p><p pid=\"b213.0\/4\">&#8220;We have agreed to undertake a thorough assessment of the request that this group are offered right of abode in the United Kingdom&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b213.0\/5\">That was the response from the noble Lord, Lord Bates, in January 2016. No decision was reached. By 2018, responses to Questions resorted to stonewalling and indecision. For example, in March 2018, Caroline Nokes MP wrote:<\/p><p pid=\"b213.0\/6\">&#8220;We have received a number of representations on this matter, all of which are being carefully considered&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"b213.0\/7\">adding that a decision would be made as soon as practicable.<\/p><p pid=\"b213.0\/8\">A month later the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, wrote to me in answer to one of my Questions with an identical copy-and-paste Answer. So it went on and, in July 2019, Caroline Nokes said in an Answer:<\/p><p pid=\"b213.0\/9\">&#8220;This is a complex matter to which we are giving careful consideration&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b213.0\/10\">In short, these veterans have been left in limbo. Ministerial responses could be diagnosed as repetitive indecision syndrome.<\/p><p pid=\"b213.0\/11\">I have now had sight of a more recent letter, dated <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2020-09-13\">13 September<\/phrase> 2019, to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Pittenweem, signed by Seema Kennedy, then a  Home Office Minister. She confirmed that members of the Hong Kong Military Service Corps were<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b213.0\/12\">&#8220;part of the UK armed forces in Hong Kong &#8230; therefore MoD considers them veterans.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b213.0\/13\">Ms Kennedy went on to say that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b213.0\/14\">&#8220;from a moral perspective further consideration is required.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b213.0\/15\">She said that the Home Office is<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b213.0\/16\">&#8220;fully engaged with this issue.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b213.0\/17\">That was signed off four months ago. The original 300 who started this request five years ago have reduced, through emigration to Canada, Australia and elsewhere and through deaths, to fewer than 100 individuals, and by no means is it likely that all would decide to leave Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"b213.0\/18\">I should mention that I have recently accepted the kind offer to be a patron of the Hong Kong Military Service Corps and HKOR Benevolent Association, the members of which are affected. I recall that fine Gurkha servicemen, even though never British subjects, were granted the right of abode in the UK because they served in the British Army. While all will recognise the scale of Home Office involvement with pressing immigration issues, it is unacceptable to continue to prevaricate about this claim and so not to honour our obligation to these veterans, who swore allegiance to the Crown, served full time in Her Majesty&#8217;s Armed Forces and were born British subjects.<\/p><p pid=\"b213.0\/19\">It is four years since the Government first agreed to &#8220;undertake a thorough assessment&#8221;, as was promised by the noble Lord, Lord Bates. It is time for them to find a cure for their repetitive indecision syndrome.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"d149.1\/1\">I can tell the noble Lord and the Chamber only what I have been given by way of briefing, and that is what I have just repeated. I am not inside the Prime Minister&#8217;s mind. I do not know what  he is cogitating on the future. It is important that the FCO and DfID perform two distinguished and distinctive roles. As has already been illustrated by working arrangements, there may well be scope for better co-ordination and efficiencies. As far as I am aware, no decision has yet been made by the machinery of government&#8212;which sounds a rather Orwellian entity, but that seems to be what it is called.<\/p><p pid=\"d149.1\/2\">My noble friend Lady Manzoor asked about the timeline for the integrated security, defence and foreign policy review. That will be confirmed early this year. It will be the deepest review of our security, defence and foreign policy since the end of the Cold War. My noble friend also called for a meeting between the all-party group and a DfID Minister to discuss the summit. I cannot speak on another Minister&#8217;s behalf, but I am sure her thoughtful points regarding nutrition and food security are noted and will be given due consideration.<\/p><p pid=\"d149.1\/3\">The noble Lord, Lord Collins, raised an important issue on nutrition, particularly the summit in Japan in November. He wondered whether the PM would attend the springboard event in July&#8212;is that correct? I cannot commit to that&#8212;I do not know&#8212;but we are working closely with the Government of Japan to ensure a successful summit later this year. We are working on the springboard event in the summer. I cannot commit to timing or pledge names of those who will attend, but I can assure noble Lords that nutrition is a high priority for DfID. We will build on the successful London summit of 2013 and strive to continue our global leadership on nutrition.<\/p><p pid=\"d149.1\/4\">The noble Lord, Lord Collins, also raised the issue of Saudi arms sales. Additional measures have been put in place to prevent such a breach happening again. All recommendations to grant licences for the export of items to Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners will now be referred to Ministers to decide.<\/p><p pid=\"d149.1\/5\">The noble Lords, Lord Collins and Lord Stevenson, along with some other Members, asked about ensuring parliamentary scrutiny of free trade agreements. The Government are absolutely committed to transparency and appropriate scrutiny of trade policy. We will ensure that Parliament and the public are given the opportunity to provide input as we take forward our independent trade policy.<\/p><p pid=\"d149.1\/6\">The noble Lord, Lord Alton, raised issues about Hong Kong with me but then decided not to speak to these, so I am a little constrained in dealing with them at the Dispatch Box, but I will write because I have marvellous answers and I am sure he will enjoy reading them. He also raised the important issue of Yazidis. DfID has committed &#163;261 million in humanitarian support to Iraq since 2014. We support the United Nations Funding Facility for Stabilization, which has completed 235 of 388 projects in Christian areas and 55 of 98 projects in Yazidi areas. I will endeavour to follow up the reference he made to the breach of the Geneva convention and respond to him on that.<\/p><p pid=\"d149.1\/7\">The noble Lord, Lord Alton, also raised the protests against the Iraqi Government. The UK condemns the disproportionate use of force against demonstrators, including the use of live fire. The right to peaceful  protest and freedom of expression must be respected. Iraqi leaders must take responsibility to stop the violence and hold the perpetrators to account.<\/p><p pid=\"d149.1\/8\">The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, raised the issue of Turkish maritime claims in the eastern Mediterranean. It is the UK&#8217;s consistent position that all maritime boundary disputes should be resolved through dialogue and in accordance with international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We continue to call for de-escalation.<\/p><p pid=\"d149.1\/9\">I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Sharkey, up in the corner there, who mentioned Cyprus. The Government&#8217;s focus remains to support both sides to reach a just and lasting settlement that will benefit all Cypriots, and a settlement continues to represent the most sustainable means of addressing the situation.<\/p><p pid=\"d149.1\/10\">There seems to be some dialogue taking place over my shoulder. I had been going to ask for your Lordships&#8217; indulgence, because this has been a very extensive debate. I did not think I would be chivvied for going on for 25 minutes or so. Are any last trains or buses going to be missed? I am being told I can go on for two more minutes.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a209.0\/1\">It is clear that the Conservatives overwhelmingly won the election for a variety of reasons, but on the Brexit front it is also the case that 16.5 million people voted for remain parties, compared with 14.5 million people who voted for leave parties. In fact, including the parties that do not support a particular deal&#8212;namely, the Brexit party&#8212;there are 18.1 million people who do not support  this oven-ready deal that we are being served up and asked to consume very quickly today. On that basis, there still should be a public vote on the deal, because this is about the long-term future of Britain. [Interruption.] I know that people do not agree with me, but my judgment is that we are going to be poorer, weaker, more divided and isolated.<\/p><p pid=\"a209.0\/2\">People in my constituency who voted leave&#8212;many did, of course&#8212;voted for more money, more control and more jobs, and they will judge this deal on whether the Government deliver that. I say to Members who have taken Labour seats on the back of &#8220;Get Brexit done&#8221; that if we do not deliver those things that leave voters asked for, they will be very unhappy. In fact, they will not just be unhappy; they will have lost their jobs, and I assume that they will come back to the Labour party.<\/p><p pid=\"a209.0\/3\">We are leaving the single market, one of the primary architects of which was, of course, Margaret Thatcher, who saw it as probably the most perfect free and fair trade market in the world. Today we are saying not just that we will have no alignment&#8212;or that we will not have dynamic alignment&#8212;but that we will have dynamic misalignment. In other words, as the European Union changes its rules, we will change our rules in a different way. That means the prospects of agreeing a deal within 12 months will become vanishingly small, and the prospects of knowing that we will agree a deal in six months&#8212;by June&#8212;are even smaller.<\/p><p pid=\"a209.0\/4\">China, the United States and other countries will look at us and see that we are increasingly turning our back on our biggest markets, and that gives them more power in negotiations. We stand alone, turning our back on the EU, and when we talk to the United States they will say that they do not want any environmental or climate change considerations in the trade deals, as they already have. They do not really care that much about food standards; they want hormone-impregnated meat and chlorinated chicken. They want our NHS database and to enforce patents so that drugs will be more expensive. They also sell asbestos and all the rest of it. As we move away from the regulatory protection of the EU, we are in their hands.<\/p><p pid=\"a209.0\/5\">When we have trade talks with China, we will obviously have to be on bended knee. They will say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t mention human rights, Hong Kong and all that sort of stuff. Just stick to the point and do what we say.&#8221; They are already building HS2 and a lot of other infrastructure here. If this is about democracy, it is important that Parliament has greater scrutiny of these trade deals and that we go into these things with our eyes open.<\/p><p pid=\"a209.0\/6\">Finally, on human rights, I am very concerned about the issue of unaccompanied minors. Frankly, it has a strange echo of Donald Trump, who has separated children from their parents who are refugees and put them in detention camps&#8212;our great friend, Donald Trump. At the same time, we see in the Queen&#8217;s Speech the abolition of the BBC, and the civil service and the judiciary are also under threat. Our fundamental values shared across Europe of democracy, human rights and the rule of law are under threat. All new Members must think carefully about what is in the balance here. I know that they are driving through in great merriment on the back of &#8220;Get Brexit done&#8221;, in pre-Christmas pantomime mode, but we need to think about what is best for Britain and best for democracy, and that means proper scrutiny of this Bill.<\/p>",

We were unable to hold the debate on that date, unfortunately, but I am pleased to bring it to the chamber today.<\/p><p>World day against the death penalty was launched in 2003 by the World Coalition Against the Death Penalty, in which many international human rights groups are represented. It was founded to strengthen the international fight against the death penalty and has the goal of abolition. I am glad that members are here today to add their voices and thoughts to that ambition.<\/p><p>Although many strides have been taken since the United Nation&#8217;s adoption of the universal human rights charter, the fundamental right to life still has to be fought for around the world.<\/p><p>Out of the 193 member states of the United Nations and 198 countries in the world, 142 countries have abolished the death penalty in law or in practice, including 106 states that have abolished the death penalty for all crimes. Eight countries have now abolished the death penalty for ordinary crimes only, with exceptions for crimes that are committed in times of war. Twenty-eight countries could be considered abolitionist in practice, having not held an execution for the past 10 years&#8212;they are believed to have a policy or established practice of not carrying out executions.<\/p><p>The work of Amnesty International should be highlighted in today&#8217;s debate. Aside from its political advocacy, the organisation&#8217;s efforts in international record keeping ensures that states are kept accountable and that debates such as this are grounded in facts. Amnesty&#8217;s records show that 56 countries use the death penalty.<\/p><p>Organisations such as Amnesty are essential to the functioning of democracies around the world, as they are key in keeping institutions accountable, which is the height of importance for issues such as the death penalty and the operation of justice systems.<\/p><p>In the past year, 20 countries have carried out executions. In 2018, the top five countries for the number of executions were China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and Iraq. In that period, 690 verifiable executions were recorded. That figure excludes cases that Amnesty could not confirm, but the organisation estimates that the number of executions in China in 2018 was in the thousands. China does not release any figures on executions, as figures pertaining to the death penalty remain a state secret.<\/p><p>It is clear from the figures that the death penalty is still widely used as a punishment around the world. It is used not only for capital crimes, such as murder and terrorism, but for other purposes, such as discrimination and the suppression of political opinion and groups of people, as well as the suppression of individuals on the grounds of their sexuality, religious belief, race or ethnicity, or their advocacy of human rights or, specifically, women&#8217;s rights.<\/p><p>The death penalty also disproportionately affects members of vulnerable groups who cannot afford experienced defence attorneys to advocate on their behalf.<\/p><p>There are cases of children being given the death penalty, which is particularly abhorrent. To be clear, the use of the death penalty against juvenile offenders is against international law. The 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 1969 American convention on human rights and the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child all ossify that. However, Amnesty understands that, currently, there are juvenile offenders who are under sentence of death in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan and South Sudan. In addition, in 2018, Iran executed at least seven people, and South Sudan at least one person, for crimes that were committed while they were under the age of 18. This year, Iran executed two 17-year-old cousins, Mehdi and Amin. Both were arrested at the age of 15 and went through what might be considered an unfair trial.<\/p><p>Whether in the name of the people or in the name of the regime, the taking of life by the state is the ultimate abuse of human rights.<\/p><p>According to Amnesty International, China is the world&#8217;s most prolific executioner and, as I said, the real number of state executions in 2018 could be thousands higher than the confirmed number of 690. Although China is estimated to have executed thousands last year, there is no exact figure.<\/p><p>Right now, we are seeing a battle for democracy and the independence of judicial system in Hong Kong. We are also seeing many news reports of the mistreatment of different ethnicities in the west of China, notably the Uyghur people. Credible estimates suggest that 1 million Uyghur people are being held in camps. Human rights activists continually disappear and religious belief is suppressed. For example, in China, Christianity has grown from 3 million believers in the 1980s to an estimated 100 million in 2018. Despite that, Human Rights Watch reports that the Chinese Government crackdown on churches has intensified in Henan province from 2018 to 2019, with authorities demolishing dozens of church buildings and crosses, preventing gatherings in house churches and confiscating Bibles.<\/p><p>In all those cases of human rights abuses, there is great cause for concern and an international response to the political suppression, disappearances of individuals and executions that are taking place.<\/p><p>In times such as these, and as we recognise world death penalty day, it is clear that the role of human rights organisations such as Amnesty International UK is essential to the functioning of any democracy.<\/p><p>I ask my colleagues in the Scottish Parliament to join Amnesty International in calling on states to abolish the death penalty and to uphold human rights across the world.<\/p>",

He handles colleagues with the utmost courtesy, while at the same time making it clear that there is an underlying message of authority, along the lines of, &#8220;Don&#8217;t mess with me&#8221;&#8212;some might say, the original strong and stable. Over the years he has provided Members, long-standing and new, with his wise counsel, as my noble friend Lord Robathan attested in his maiden speech. During their time in the Army in Hong Kong and Northern Ireland, my noble friend found that Company Sergeant-Major Phipps was right about most matters and could be relied upon to steer his company commander in the right direction. Many noble Lords will recognise that description of Mr Phipps, who has been a source of wisdom on procedure and custom, helping to steer us all in the right direction; and of course, his commanding presence made him the ideal candidate to act as the master of ceremonies during the Queen&#8217;s Diamond Jubilee lunch, which hosted Her Majesty the Queen and 700 guests in Westminster Hall.<\/p><p pid=\"a1158.2\/3\">When I joined this House in 2014, Mr Phipps and his team made me feel very welcome. He has always been willing to help out and on several occasions has  taken pity on my poor guests, who invariably get the most uninformative tour of this place, taking over as tour guide with panache and more anecdotes than I could ever remember. His generosity and good humour are, I am sure, valued by all noble Lords.<\/p><p pid=\"a1158.2\/4\">Our remarks today come earlier than expected. Mr Phipps officially leaves on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2019-12-13\">13 December<\/phrase>, but today is our last day with him as our Principal Doorkeeper. As the season&#8217;s festivities get under way in the coming month, I am sure that the Cirencester Salvation Army will want to seize the opportunity to sign him up for a starring role as Joseph in the nativity play, a role that I understand he played successfully some years ago.<\/p><p pid=\"a1158.2\/5\">Mr Phipps, on behalf of the whole House, thank you for your incredible service to us. We wish you and Sue all the very best for the future; enjoy your well-deserved retirement.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a524.0\/1\">My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, who always speaks with great authority and wisdom on health, and on scientific research and innovation, which are key to our future and the whole health service. I normally burden your Lordships with my views on international and overseas affairs and the shifting world order, having had the privilege to be the first chair of your Lordships&#8217; Committee on International Relations. I chose to intervene instead on this present set of topics for three reasons.<\/p><p pid=\"a524.0\/2\">We are living on an angry planet, to pinch a heading from the Times leader this morning. From Chile to Hong Kong, Lebanon to Venezuela, every part of the Middle East, every European capital to our own streets, e-enabled protest, organised on an unprecedented scale and driven through communications technology that is constantly changing rapidly, has become the norm. This anger affects all the issues we are discussing.<\/p><p pid=\"a524.0\/3\">Oddly, there is little or nothing in the gracious Speech about turbulent outside world events, except of course the eternal Brexit, despite their major impact on our lives and issues here at home. In particular it is a great pity&#8212;indeed, I find it rather shocking&#8212;that there is no mention of the Commonwealth in the gracious Speech, considering its central importance to the UK&#8217;s future world role, our internal and domestic cohesion, our care systems and many of our public services, and the importance to Her Majesty personally of the modern Commonwealth network. To have included a reference would have been no more than good manners, but manners, courtesy and vision seem all to be victims of the present Brexit debate.<\/p><p pid=\"a524.0\/4\">My second reason for seeking to speak today is that the internal good health of our democracy and society, aspects of which we are discussing, is essential to our external impact and influence, and safeguarding of our world interests. The inner health of our society is currently, as several speeches have emphasised, not as good as it should be. We really cannot go around  pressing on other countries our Westminster model, our welfare state model, our elderly care model or our education model if they do not work well here. As my noble friend Lord Dobbs said in a brilliant speech at the beginning of our debate on the humble Address,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a524.0\/5\">&#8220;if we are to offer lessons to others, we must relearn those lessons ourselves&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class=\"offrep\" id=\", 14\/10\/19; col. 9.]\"><i>Official Report<\/i>, 14\/10\/19; col. 9.]<\/phrase><\/p><p pid=\"a524.0\/6\">A third reason for my intervening today is that it had passed through my mind that our situation, both nationally and internationally, would be rather different this week from last week and the gracious Speech, which now seems rather a long time ago. I thought that, by now, the deal would be settled. Foolish me. I should have realised that frustration is the name of the game, and I am afraid that it is going to go on. I read that Mr Jacob Rees-Mogg wants it settled in three days. It occurs to me that we should perhaps consult the Bible to learn about getting things done in three days.<\/p><p pid=\"a524.0\/7\">The issue that I want briefly to discuss out of today&#8217;s list is pensions, workers&#8217; benefits and employment. I extend that to savings, workers&#8217; benefits and rights and security generally. These have all come into the Brexit debate, especially workers&#8217; rights: there is a constant fear, vocalised much by the Opposition, that they will be watered down if we are outside the European Union. In an interview on the &#8220;Today&#8221; programme this morning, Nick Robinson reached a new low in ignorance combined with interruptive boorishness with Mr Jenrick, the Housing Secretary. The subject was rights and benefits. I also watched a much more polite and effective Andrew Marr on this issue. Neither Robinson nor Marr have grasped the difference between the big business, corporatist type of legislation for workers, mostly coming from the EU, and the small-business-friendly social and employment legislation that we need and which is far better suited to both workers and business in the digital age. In the digital age and a service-dominated economy, we can do far better for working people, employer-employee relations and secure retirement than the old corporatist model, which is shaped largely by big companies&#8217; lobbies, philosophies and pressures in Brussels. It is not a question of watering down but of a different and far better deal for millions of workers in the highly disruptive age we are living in, which will become more disruptive still. We must break away from the heavy, big-business, corporatist approach of the old EU.<\/p><p pid=\"a524.0\/8\">The pensions system is very much part of this story. I welcome the new safeguards, as have some of my colleagues, but I fear that pensions reform of this kind does not go half far enough for what is needed in a modern and unified society. We talk about an economy which works for everyone, but it is simply not happening and my own political party needs, as do all major parties, to redesign its stances from the bottom up to meet these fundamentally democratic needs: a genuine sharing of capital ownership and the security and dignity that go with it, on a scale not hitherto contemplated. We cannot build a party of the future on out-of-date and out-of-relevance ideologies from the past.<\/p><p pid=\"a524.0\/9\">We will thrive only as an open nation committed to and interwoven with an utterly interdependent world. We must have our own modernised and flexible welfare and support arrangements for a disruptive and dangerous  world which is being totally transformed. The gracious Speech had ambitions, but it seems drafted with too little of this in mind. We have to up our game if we are to meet the colossal challenges coming fast towards us.<\/p>",

When I next see the Prime Minister, I will pass on the noble Lord&#8217;s comments about the importance he attaches to this subject.<\/p><p pid=\"b153.1\/2\">As my noble friend Lord Ahmad said, we are also determined to increase our co-operation with our Commonwealth partners. Some noble Lords seemed doubtful about this, so let me reassure them that Commonwealth member states including India, which the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, in particular, mentioned, are increasingly engaged and cognisant of what we can all achieve together .<\/p><p pid=\"b153.1\/3\">As we leave the EU, we remain absolutely committed to playing a leading role in international security and to sustaining and strengthening vital alliances. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell, who just intervened, rightly said that NATO is the most successful alliance in history. It has kept us safe for 70 years and it remains at the heart of UK defence policy. The UK is NATO&#8217;s leading European ally, our defence budget is the largest in Europe and the second largest overall. We are one of only a handful of allies that spends more than 2% on defence, and 20% of that on major equipment; it is a shame that the noble Lord, Lord West, is not here to remind us of the ship programme.<\/p><p pid=\"b153.1\/4\">The noble Lord, Lord Ricketts, commented on the challenges facing NATO. The Government welcome the suggestion of a debate on the alliance and its future. Ahead of the leaders&#8217; meeting in December, we will give this due consideration together with the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Sterling, of a debate on defence matters. We will, of course, do that in consultation with the usual channels.<\/p><p pid=\"b153.1\/5\">We remain committed to the rule of law internationally, to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action as the best way to prevent a nuclear Iran, to a clear, defensive and proportionate response to Russia and&#8212;as the noble Lords, Lord Kerr and Lord Pendry, raised&#8212;to de-escalation in Hong Kong. A number of noble Lords raised this subject. The Foreign Secretary has made our concerns clear to both the Hong Kong Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, and the Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, and will continue to do so. He has also spoken to a wide range of counterparts on this issue. We raised the situation in Hong Kong at the G7 and the UN. The way forward must be through meaningful dialogue with all communities that addresses the concerns of the people of Hong Kong.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b88.1\/1\">My Lords, noble Lords might be familiar with the Haydn symphony in which, towards the end of the last movement, one by one the musicians walk out until nobody is left&#8212;so I am very grateful to all noble Lords who will soldier through to the end of this movement, which I hope will not be too long. However, we are discussing serious issues and I want to make a brief contribution.<\/p><p pid=\"b88.1\/2\">I shall start with a general proposition. Successful negotiations are usually those where there is a degree of confidence and mutual trust between the negotiating parties, and the gracious Speech does indeed declare at the outset the ambition for,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b88.1\/3\">&#8220;a new partnership with the European Union, based on &#8230; friendly co-operation&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b88.1\/4\">That is excellent&#8212;but I fail to understand how it is compatible with the behaviour of the Government in their first two months. All the rhetoric about surrender Bills, betrayal and do or die, culminating in the memo from the Prime Minister&#8217;s office to the Spectator, which is the most disgraceful document that I have seen emanating from No. 10 in my 45 years, sends a none-too-subtle message to our EU partners that they are enemies. They are not our enemies; they are our allies, our friends and our economic partners. They are countries for which generations of British soldiers have fought and died. We do not need to fabricate new enemies in the world; there are plenty of adversaries out there already.<\/p><p pid=\"b88.1\/5\">Now, those same Europeans who have been treated to that language are the ones with whom the Government are seeking urgently to finalise a deal. As with the  previous Government, the closer a potential cliff edge comes, the harder the Government work to avoid it. That is welcome, but the tactics of the first two months have not made our task any easier.<\/p><p pid=\"b88.1\/6\">A lot has been made in recent weeks in public about the preparations for a no-deal Brexit. The &#163;100 million spent on that has brought to people&#8217;s attention some of the myriad disadvantages of leaving the EU with no deal. I am sure that the National Audit Office will have some penetrating questions to ask the accounting officer who signed off on that spending, as indeed I think it will about the other &#163;8.2 billion&#8212;I think that that was the figure the Minister mentioned in opening&#8212;that has been allocated to preparations for no deal. Personally, I doubt very much that that spending will make much difference to what will happen if we crash out of the EU with no deal. I do not believe that it bluffed the EU countries for one moment; they had worked out long ago that a no-deal departure would be far more damaging to this country than it would to the EU, although all would suffer.<\/p><p pid=\"b88.1\/7\">So I agree with noble Lords who said that a deal is better than a no-deal crash-out&#8212;but, equally, we should be absolutely clear that what is on offer, as we understand it from what has come out of the negotiations, is a harder Brexit overall than was proposed by Theresa May&#8217;s Government. Given that the level playing field provisions&#8212;the regulatory and customs provisions&#8212;seem to be on their way out, the destination is then a Canada-minus agreement, largely focused on goods, leaving the services sector to look after itself. That is so far from what was ever proposed in the referendum campaign by the leave side that I am convinced it would be right to put back to the people the option of choosing either the deal that may emerge from these negotiations in the coming days and weeks or, finally, staying in the EU.<\/p><p pid=\"b88.1\/8\">I want to concentrate mainly on foreign policy. As so often in my career, I find that my thunder was stolen by the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, in his brilliant and wide-ranging speech. I will just add a couple of grace notes to what he said. Like him, I found that my eye was caught by the phrase in the gracious Speech that the Government,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b88.1\/9\">&#8220;will ensure that it continues to play a leading role in global affairs&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b88.1\/10\">I cannot think of any major international issue at the moment where Britain is playing a leading role or, indeed, having any discernible impact at all.<\/p><p pid=\"b88.1\/11\">The noble Lord, Lord Kerr, did not mention Iran; he left me that one issue to raise. On Iran, the united western approach that was developed rather successfully by the six powers came apart not because of anything that Britain did but because President Trump decided to pull the United States out of the nuclear deal. The only initiative that I am aware of since that time to try to bring the United States and Iran into some kind of dialogue was taken by President Macron at the G7 summit. He did get some momentum going&#8212;enough, it seems, to have worried the Revolutionary Guard sufficiently for it to have carried out its very dangerous and escalatory attack on Saudi oilfields. Remarkably, Iran seems largely to have got away with that. I fear  that the impunity that the hardliners in Iran will feel as a result of the&#8212;as they would see it&#8212;successful provocation of the international community must make the Gulf region more dangerous in the future.<\/p><p pid=\"b88.1\/12\">Britain&#8217;s contribution to the Iranian crisis, as far as one can see from the outside, has not been stellar. We detained an Iranian oil tanker in Gibraltar; then we let it go and watched powerlessly as it delivered its cargo of oil to Syria. The US &#8220;maximum pressure&#8221; strategy has failed, and I would be interested to know whether Britain has any ideas about what might replace it.<\/p><p pid=\"b88.1\/13\">A number of noble Lords have raised the appalling events that are happening in north-eastern Syria, triggered by another of President Trump&#8217;s initiatives: the withdrawal of US forces from that part of the world. I worry that the Turkish invasion is a prelude to a population movement of Syrian refugees now in Turkey into what were Kurdish areas of north-eastern Syria. If that is true, it is storing up more instability and chaos for the future. We know that the West pays the price, in relation both to refugees and terrorism, from instability in that part of the word.<\/p><p pid=\"b88.1\/14\">The Foreign Secretary&#8217;s Statement in the other place today suggests something I would welcome. I think it is playing catch-up with decisions already taken in Washington, Berlin and Paris to put sanctions on the Turkish Government. The western response so far has seemed disjointed and not very powerful. If we are a country that still has an ambition for a global role, it is perhaps time that we took the initiative to get some more coherence into western strategy. Perhaps the Foreign Secretary should invite the US, German and French Foreign Ministers for a four-power meeting in London to try to map out a rather more co-ordinated approach. Perhaps they should then involve the Russians. As other speakers have said, Russia has major interests and probably more influence in the area than any of us at the moment. This is not a straightforward crisis for Russia either. Russia is allied with President&#8217;s Assad&#8217;s regime but also building a relationship with Ankara, including selling it modern air defence missile systems. So, to see Turkish forces coming up against Syrian forces in north-eastern Syria is not comfortable for Russia either.<\/p><p pid=\"b88.1\/15\">I would like to see Britain take the initiative in this area and show that we are still capable of using London as a major convening centre in trying to sort out international crises. Britain will of course continue to have a strategic relationship with Washington in areas such as defence and intelligence, but on what the gracious Speech refers to as the &#8220;most pressing global challenges&#8221; we face&#8212;whether climate, preserving free trade or the Iranian nuclear deal&#8212;actually Britain&#8217;s interests have in recent months been much more in line with European interests. I find it uncomfortable that President Macron and Chancellor Merkel are now talking about European strategic autonomy. That is rather a dangerous concept if it means Europe can do without America&#8217;s 70-year role in deterring Russian adventurism in this part of the world.<\/p><p pid=\"b88.1\/16\">This idea of European strategic autonomy, taken with President Trump&#8217;s rather erratic approach to NATO obligations, puts an enormous weight on the next NATO summit, which I am glad to see is being  held in London at the end of this year. I really hope that the Government will propose measures of our own to breathe life back into what looks like a rather faltering western alliance at the moment. In responding, perhaps the Minister could assure us that there will be an opportunity for a debate in this House before that summit on what Britain will propose to get NATO back on the road.<\/p><p pid=\"b88.1\/17\">We can already see that the EU&#8217;s approach to foreign and defence policy will change as Britain leaves. It is clear in the line being taken on European defence and in the signs that EU sanctions on Russia may well be relaxed in the months ahead.<\/p><p pid=\"b88.1\/18\">The gracious Speech assured us that Britain will defend our interests and protect our values, which is something I am sure we can all agree to. However, the world will be full of difficult trade-offs for a Britain operating on its own account and constantly having to balance the need for trade agreements and investment with standing up for its interests and values. We see that at the moment with Hong Kong and balancing standing up for the rights we promised to the Hong Kong people against our commercial interests in China. That will become the norm if Britain leaves the EU and operates on its own account.<\/p><p pid=\"b88.1\/19\">Of course, we will still have many assets as a player in the world: our Armed Forces, our diplomacy, our development, our soft power, the BBC, our culture, our sport. However, these will translate into influence only if there is real political leadership in implementing a clear strategy. We need the means to achieve that strategy, namely a well-funded Foreign Office. I wonder  whether the Minister will be able to tell us when we will have an ambassador in Washington or when we will have a full-time national security adviser, who can spend their entire time advising the Government on plotting a national strategy in the choppy waters that lie in front of us.<\/p><p pid=\"b88.1\/20\">It is not for me to sum up, but since I am the last speaker today, I will say that it has been a privilege to sit and listen to this thoughtful and high-quality debate, ranging across the very wide canvas that the Motion invited us to address. I am very struck that, right across that landscape of defence, trade, development and foreign policy, whether and in what terms we leave the EU has a huge impact. It is therefore all the more extraordinary that this country, with our great and glorious history, is in a position in which we cannot tell foreign friends what the country&#8217;s relationship with the EU will be in three months or three years. Whatever the final outcome, my conclusion is that Britain&#8217;s reputation in the world has suffered real damage from the chaotic way in which the whole Brexit issue has been handled.<\/p>",

Guy Verhofstadt has made comments on China, Brazil, Turkey and almost anywhere else we could mention, but on Catalonia he is utterly silent. He plays Pontius Pilate, and he cannot get enough bowls of water with which to wash his hands. I am afraid to say that that position seems to be shared by the UK Government. The cry of action is the cry for more bowls of water with which to wash their hands&#8212;and this in a Chamber that has just spent an hour telling UEFA and FIFA what to do. No courage at all has been shown in relation to telling the Government in Madrid to behave with a modicum of decency.<\/p><p pid=\"c166.2\/3\">I want to ask the Minister: what sort of oppression by Spain in Barcelona or Catalonia will the UK Government tolerate? Forget independence and the fact that Catalonia was annexed in 1716. What level of oppression do they oppose? Is it a Hong Kong level of oppression, a Barcelona level of oppression or being in jail for 14 years? What will they eventually stand up and oppose? The cowardice that has been shown is not on, and the people should not be having to live with it.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a115.0\/1\">The problem with vaccinating against bacteria is that it is much harder for the creature&#8212;whether it be human or animal&#8212;to fight a disease unless it is under pressure. That means that, if the disease is prevalent, a vaccine is much more successful than if the disease is not. Although I would welcome an effective vaccination, BCG in human beings is only 60% effective. But because we all do the same things, and because we can use antibiotics, that is enough to create the herd immunity that, as a society, we need. Unfortunately, we are not winning this battle particularly successfully in the human population, and it is becoming increasingly prevalent. Although I want to welcome every step of science that protects my constituents and their animals, vaccines alone will unfortunately not do it. But if we do everything, we can triumph.<\/p><p pid=\"a115.0\/2\">One of the things that has been bothering me is the situation for our sheep farmers&#8212;our shepherds. What will they do if we leave the European Union, which takes such a large proportion of our lamb? We produce 3% of the world&#8217;s sheep, but 25% of the EU&#8217;s sheep. We produce a third of the EU&#8217;s sheepmeat and are the sixth largest producer in the world. The average person in the UK eats 1.9 kg of lamb a year&#8212;including you, Mr Speaker, as I am delighted to see from your signalling. That is about the size of a family joint per year. We can do better than that. If our sheepmeat market is threatened, we could double consumption. That would actually make us a net importer of lamb. Some 64% of our product is actually consumed domestically, so the idea that the New Zealanders&#8212;who have a 90,000-tonne opportunity to sell into the UK already, but who have never fulfilled that quota&#8212;will flood our market is for the birds. We can eat our way to success even if everything goes wrong, and I am a great advocate for that, as the House can see from my aerodynamic dimensions. We produce 298,000 tonnes of sheepmeat per annum, worth &#163;2.216 billion.<\/p><p pid=\"a115.0\/3\">The other thing that is really upsetting me at the moment is dog meat in China. I have seen the way that these poor people in Hong Kong are being treated, and I think our reaction has been rather quiet. One of the things we ought to be doing is using our status in the world to set an example. The example that my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Giles Watling\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25644\">the Member for Clacton (Giles Watling)<\/phrase> and I seek to set is to make it illegal to eat dogs&#8212;not least because nobody eats dogs in the UK, so resistance to this law should be pretty minimal. It would set an example to the world. The horrendous torture that goes on for more than 10 million dogs in China is so unbelievably revolting and cruel that, if we can do even the smallest thing here, we should do it.<\/p><p pid=\"a115.0\/4\">We care about animal welfare, and today the Prime Minister talked about banning live exports. This is a difficult subject for me. Exporting animals for slaughter abroad is obviously not ideal. It would be much better if they were slaughtered nearer to where they live. We are constantly told that the EU sets these high standards for animal welfare, yet they clearly are not high enough for live exports. That is why our Government want to stop such exports. That is perfectly understandable, but surely when we leave the EU we can have much higher standards for transporting animals. Actually, I think the UK does it very well already, and the NFU has some excellent suggestions as to how this could be done. This is one of the EU failures that people do not talk about but jolly well should.<\/p><p pid=\"a115.0\/5\">There are other things in the Queen&#8217;s Speech that matter to my constituents. I am particularly pleased that railways and buses have come up. Railways really do need to take the passenger to the end of the line, particularly if that is in Hereford. It is no good stopping off in Worcester, Malvern or anywhere else that is jolly nice but where the people do not live; trains really do need to reach the end of the line. There is a wonderful man called Dave Morris, who runs the bus companies in my constituency. I have been appalled by the way in which bus companies treat each other and seek to compete in order to put their competitors out of business. We need reliability in our buses, and preferably slightly thinner buses that can fit down country lanes.<\/p>",

Before I delve into the specifics of the instrument on mutual recognition, I ask the Minister to explain why the House is still debating regulations which will apply only in the event of no deal when the recent European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act will prevent such a scenario. This feels both disrespectful of Parliament and a little bizarre.<\/p><p pid=\"b1908.0\/3\">Much of the instrument is intended to ensure that previous regulations will be operable for the latest exit date. As he was asked last week, can the Minister confirm that Parliament will be asked again to revisit these issues if the exit date is again changed?<\/p><p pid=\"b1908.0\/4\">According to the department&#8217;s Explanatory Memorandum, the regulation strives to ensure that products placed on the UK market continue to meet,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1908.0\/5\">&#8220;substantially the same essential requirements&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b1908.0\/6\">Why is it only &#8220;substantially&#8221; the same requirements, not exactly the same ones? If there is no difference, will the Minister clarify this? If there is a difference between substantially copying over requirements and completely doing so, which ones are not required to be copied over?<\/p><p pid=\"b1908.0\/7\">These regulations cover a wide range of products, from civil explosives to children&#8217;s toys. It is imperative that Parliament can fully scrutinise all legislation. I fear that the Government have crammed in amendments to so many items of secondary legislation, some of which have little relation to each other, that it may be difficult for the House to examine each necessary reference. How many separate pieces of legislation are within this instrument? I ask because I had a shot at trying to decipher some of the language. I understand the complex nature of this and how difficult it is, but we are debating important statutory instruments week after week. In Part 3, Regulation 11 states:<\/p><p pid=\"b1908.0\/8\">&#8220;In Schedule 12&#8212; &#8230; (e) in paragraph 30 &#8230; (i) in paragraph (b)(iii) before &#8216;third&#8217; insert &#8216;second paragraph and the&#8217;&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b1908.0\/9\">That is not simple or straightforward.<\/p><p pid=\"b1908.0\/10\">I understand that the Minister has come to the House to explain that a number of difficulties and issues have arisen with this since my noble friend dealt with it the first time round. It is important that these are rectified, but its complex nature makes it neither easy nor simple. Did the department give any consideration to splitting the regulations into separate affirmative instruments, which may have made it a bit simpler?<\/p><p pid=\"b1908.0\/11\">Finally, the Government have claimed that no consultation was necessary on the drafting of this instrument. In his opening remarks, the Minister talked about &#8220;stakeholder feedback&#8221;, but paragraph 10 of the Explanatory Memorandum, headed &#8220;Consultation Outcome&#8221;&#8212;which the Minister touched on&#8212;states that there was no consultation. If there was a need for stakeholder feedback and if that fed into changes to the SI, why was there no wider consultation with the industry?<\/p><p pid=\"b1908.0\/12\">We have no intention of opposing this instrument, but I would welcome any attempt by the Minister to clarify the Government&#8217;s intentions on some of my previous questions. As the House again finds itself  debating legislation that will enable a no-deal exit, which Parliament will not sanction, will the Minister offer an estimate of how many further redundant instruments it will be asked to consider?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"d1871.0\/1\">My Lords, to hear the noble and right reverend Lord is really like having an hour&#8217;s version of &#8220;Thought for the Day&#8221;; we all feel better and wiser. His measured tone and words of wisdom and the balance with which he puts forward the debate are incontrovertible and critically important at this time. He does not say that human rights should dominate trade deals, but that they should be respected. It is in that balanced mode that I want to make a contribution. I also want very warmly  to welcome the Minister to her place. As a hugely impressive and highly ethical person, her involvement in this field is very welcome.<\/p><p pid=\"d1871.0\/2\">I have to make an abject apology to the House, because my own personal human rights and well-being will be severely curtailed if I do not leave by 6.30 pm. I had no idea that the debate would be going on so late this evening but I will have serious domestic difficulties, which I will not go into further detail about. I apologise to the noble and right reverend Lord, the Minister and the leaders of the Benches and I will most definitely read the material very carefully.<\/p><p pid=\"d1871.0\/3\">This debate focuses on two really important  priorities in our country. Over the centuries, we have been a trading nation: an international perspective has long been at the heart of our commercial, social and political traditions. Similarly, part of our identity is a fierce commitment to promoting economic and democratic rights here and around the world, combating sources of exploitation and oppression. The noble and right reverend Lord mentioned some countries and areas where there is profound concern and, indeed, deteriorating situations.<\/p><p pid=\"d1871.0\/4\">Last week marked the close of the 42nd session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, reminding us that support for human rights is a pillar of our responsibilities within the rules-based international system. I believe that we have a proud record of impactful action around the world, both independently and in bilateral and multilateral collaboration. I also want to praise the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and DfID for their tenacious and principled work promoting human rights, which has included work with civil society organisations in Zimbabwe and with the Nepalese Government on capacity-building programmes; the conference held by the former Foreign Secretary and my constituency successor, Jeremey Hunt, on media freedom because of the appalling concern over the safety of journalists; and the work with Access Now and its #KeepItOn campaign to fight undemocratic internet shutdowns during elections. That has all been in the last year alone. There is also our work through the Human Rights Council, which only recently passed resolutions on Syria, Myanmar, Burundi, Yemen and the DRC. The Westminster Foundation for Democracy works in Mozambique, Kenya and Sierra Leone on disabilities. There has also been work in Uganda and Nigeria on underrepresented young people.<\/p><p pid=\"d1871.0\/5\">There are a huge number of areas where we have been willing and wanting to take a lead and to demonstrate our commitment. Perhaps most striking is the work of our former Prime Minister, Theresa May, on the Modern Slavery Act, both as Home Secretary and as Prime Minister. It is quite extraordinary: every company listed on the FTSE 100 has to make a declaration in its annual report that it has not been involved in modern slavery. This is quite a remarkable, almost draconian step, which I am delighted to say other countries are now following.<\/p><p pid=\"d1871.0\/6\">The noble Lord, Lord Ahmad, has worked on religious rights, as the noble and right reverend Lord said, in Iraq, Sudan, Indonesia, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt and so on and so forth. The Commonwealth also  plays a great role. I would like to say more about the Commonwealth, like my noble friend Lord Howell; its commitment to human rights has also been extraordinarily important.<\/p><p pid=\"d1871.0\/7\">The link between human rights and trade deals  is relatively recent. Talking of trade in general, free trade&#8212;in a rules-based system&#8212;has benefited the world enormously. It has taken more than a billion people out of absolute poverty, improving the fulfilment of the right to life, the right to an adequate standard of living, and the right to health, adequate nourishment, safe drinking water and sanitation. In addition, global poverty rates have fallen from 35% in 1990 to 10%; the global hunger index has come down 30% since 2000; there has been a 5.5 year increase in global life expectancy; the gap between the most and least developed countries has shrunk; and global illiteracy has halved since 1990. This comes from prosperity, wealth creation and trade, so I am an unequivocal believer in the idea that business and trade are the solution, not the cause, of the world&#8217;s problems.<\/p><p pid=\"d1871.0\/8\">Deeply alarming instances of sinister protectionism are emerging on the world stage. We live in an incredibly interconnected world: the WTO says that the volume of international trade has multiplied 38 times since 1945, and the McKinsey Global Institute found that goods, services and financial flows increased by 400% between 1990 and 2012. However, while trade and connectivity have led to impressive strides towards many of the sustainable development goals, we are increasingly aware of ongoing and emerging global human rights challenges. This is extraordinarily worrying. This is the 13th consecutive year of global democratic decline, according to Freedom House. The noble and right reverend Lord has spoken about the situation in China and how sinister that is, and we all watch Hong Kong with great concern.<\/p><p pid=\"d1871.0\/9\">Trade and international agreements impact all areas of a country&#8217;s public policy, and we should take a holistic, inclusive approach involving comprehensive impact assessments. The Minister has already dismissed outright the idea that there will be a deterioration in the standard of human rights protection in the new world. It will be up to us in the United Kingdom to develop this instrument, to use it proportionately and in a balanced manner, and to energetically promote trade and human rights&#8212;which is always very much in our hearts. There should be no dogmatism. If, for example we did not want to trade with people who still had capital punishment, our relationship with Japan, America, Singapore and others would not exist: it has to be proportionate.<\/p><p pid=\"d1871.0\/10\">I will say a little more about what business does on its own, without trade policies and agreements. When I was young, Barclays was vilified for trading in South Africa. One of my jobs in government was to take President Nelson Mandela, on his first visit to the UK after leaving prison, across to South Africa House. What did he say? He said that anti-apartheid was simple; what was difficult was building a country, and how indebted they were to all those enlightened international businesses that had hung on in in  South Africa and taught their people enlightened employment practices. My father was a management and leadership guru. He used to go to Anglo-American,  go down the mines and train the supervisors on better employment practices. The commitment of many global businesses to female empowerment, anti-child labour practices, sustainability and anti-corruption measures is phenomenal. Whatever you think of Coca-Cola, it is a precious brand whose work in these areas is phenomenal.<\/p><p pid=\"d1871.0\/11\">Business organisations, therefore, and the new review of corporate governance in the United Kingdom&#8212;which is developing Section 172 of the Companies Act by talking about &#8220;purpose&#8221;, &#8220;mission&#8221; and &#8220;stakeholder commitment&#8221;&#8212;are showing a trend that says that business has to earn its right to trade. With support, encouragement and determination, trade agreements, the role of business and the development of human rights should be able to march hand in hand, as long as we remain vigilant, determined and committed to making the world a better place for us all.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a399.0\/1\">I am grateful for the Minister&#8217;s speech, which recognised not just many of the ideas that I raised but many of the ideas that the Foreign Affairs Committee has debated. That demonstrates that, despite having been Chair of another Committee, he was assiduous in following the work of ours, even before he became a Foreign Office Minister.<\/p><p pid=\"a399.0\/2\">I am also grateful to my friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Khalid Mahmood\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11087\">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr Mahmood)<\/phrase>, who has been of invaluable support in many projects that I have done outside this place. His kind words supporting the Committee&#8217;s work and recognising the challenge that we all face, on whichever side of the House we sit, are extremely well received; I thank him for them.<\/p><p pid=\"a399.0\/3\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Peter Grant\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25273\">The hon. Member for Glenrothes (Peter Grant)<\/phrase> spoke extremely well on behalf not just of his party but of the House. He recognised many areas in which we all face similar challenges; one area that he did not mention, but could have, was the UK Government&#8217;s responsibility with respect to Scottish limited partnerships, on which he and his party have assiduously led the campaign. His speech reminded me that one reason why we are in this position in the UK is that we have the legacy of a very unusual political and economic system of absentee landlords that lends itself to foreign oligarchs in a way that many other economic systems do not.<\/p><p pid=\"a399.0\/4\">I am particularly grateful to the Minister for speaking about the rule of law, because it is the economic underpinning of the United Kingdom. It is fundamental, and highlighting it is extremely important. That leads me on to an area that none of us mentioned, but that perhaps we should have&#8212;the challenges in places such as Hong Kong, where the human rights abuse of individual citizens could easily raise questions about Magnitsky implementations. It may also raise questions about the position of British judges on the Court of Final Appeal. After all, at what point is the defence of commercial justice reliant on civil justice? At what point does the undermining of civil rights in a territory undermine the ability of any judge affiliated to the UK&#8212;certainly a former UK High Court or Supreme Court judge&#8212;to deliver justice? At what point is that no longer possible? Maybe that is a question for another day.<\/p><p pid=\"a399.0\/5\">The fundamental point is that the UK&#8217;s reliance on its economic markets is essential, as we know. We therefore need to look at whether the markets are not just open and fair but properly regulated with rules that are properly enforced. In the same way that the Minister&#8217;s ancestors on Her Majesty&#8217;s men of war&#8212;like their counterparts on Her Majesty&#8217;s frigates and destroyers today&#8212;implemented the rules of the sea and fought  the evils of the slave trade and so many other forms of tyranny in the pirate wars from 1600 to about 1900, there is a place for a new red ensign to fly over our financial markets. Everyone should know that the people who put their money here and invest through London, Edinburgh or the UK&#8217;s markets, and the businesses that use those institutions, cannot be the human rights abusers, thieves and oligarchs who enrich themselves in places such as Moscow by raping and pillaging the people. They should know that because our markets have the best sanctions regimes to prevent any such crimes.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1737.0\/1\">My Lords, it is a pleasure to join in at this stage in the debate and recognise the contribution that the House of Lords is making to showing that you can debate the issues of Brexit without the sort of bad temper and extraordinarily bad conduct that has existed in the other place and led to a serious loss of public respect for Parliament.<\/p><p pid=\"b1737.0\/2\">In the various exchanges that have taken place, I particularly enjoyed the contribution of my noble friend Lord Heseltine, who is of course an authority on good jokes in conference speeches. I seem to remember him on one occasion describing Labour&#8217;s economic policy as &#8220;all Balls&#8221;, in reference to the shadow Chancellor of the time, which the Conservative conference much enjoyed. I also very much agree with him that the failure to consult the Cabinet on recent issues is extremely poor and certainly should not be repeated. It is also a severe reflection on the present membership of that Cabinet.<\/p><p pid=\"b1737.0\/3\">I also believe that it was a very serious mistake to seek to prorogue Parliament when we did. There was no need for it and I certainly was opposed to it at the time. But that is probably as far as I go in supporting my noble friend. His enthusiasm for all things European was perhaps helped by the fact that he used to delegate to me the responsibility of going to all the Environment Council meetings in Europe, avoiding the problem of getting involved himself in some of those discussions&#8212;but I will let that pass.<\/p><p pid=\"b1737.0\/4\">The reason I am concerned about the paralysis we have had over Brexit is that we now live in an extremely dangerous world. Look around at the situation in Syria, Yemen or Afghanistan. Look at Iran and its activities. Look at the growing strength of China, the risk of American isolationism and the push from China at this stage, just after its great 70th anniversary. Russia and China both have 2 million men under arms at this time, in a dangerous and unstable world. There is the difficulty and embarrassment of Hong Kong, coming at a time of semi-paralysis, when the people of Hong Kong are looking to see what the United Kingdom might or might not be prepared to do and getting a pretty big lack of clear signals.<\/p><p pid=\"b1737.0\/5\">There are other challenges that are quite new to the world. Undoubtedly, there are dire warnings about climate change. There are the far too inadequately considered problems of population growth, which will lead to continuing mass migration, particularly out of Africa, and the changes that that will produce. There are the new developments of cyber and social media. There was the issue of drones even before we had the attack in Saudi Arabia, and the new, cheap weapons  that are available around the world to terrorist groups and hostile Governments, for extremely dangerous activities. And at this time, here is the United Kingdom, paralysed pathetically and battling through this issue. Against that background, we have proudly used the phrase that the United Kingdom has &#8220;a contribution to make&#8221;. We talk about being a force for good in the world, but this force is paralysed and is not making the contribution that is seriously needed.<\/p><p pid=\"b1737.0\/6\">I come to this situation. I had the honour to move a Motion on the Address for the Queen&#8217;s Speech. That speech referred to the proposal for a referendum Bill. I said in that speech that I hoped we would remain, but also that there would be a substantial vote in favour of leaving. I represented the United Kingdom for six years in different Councils of Ministers, and I found that the strength of the United Kingdom&#8217;s position was that we did have reservations about Europe and that, if we did not bring some attention to the issues that we were raising, there was a risk that we might leave. We can talk about the budget rebate, about no thank you to the euro or no Schengen. But that card is now lost. I also see the developments happening in the European Union. I notice that it is seeking to appoint a new commissioner for the eastward progression of the European Union.<\/p><p pid=\"b1737.0\/7\">In making these very truncated remarks necessary to oblige all noble Lords today, I feel that we now have to accept that Europe is moving away. I used to represent the United Kingdom when there were nine around the table. With 28 and rising, and an increased pressure for a united states of Europe, now is the time to enter into a sensible agreement to remove from the European Union, but to set down straight away work to establish the friendliest relationships going forward with all those countries in Europe and the European Union itself.<\/p>",

That is not the way to deal with Brexit; the only way to deal with it is to confirm the decision of the 2016 referendum, or not, by the Government&#8217;s negotiating a withdrawal agreement with the EU.

They chose not to stick to the confidence vote, therefore, the political principle is, if you don&#8217;t vote on confidence in your Government or your leadership, you leave the party. We&#8217;re seeing that in the Labour Party in Westminster at the moment.<\/p><p>But the point, the point I am making, is that what has happened in Westminster over the last couple of days has shown that Westminster has worked. I disagree with that legislation that&#8217;s come forward, but that legislation has come forward and has checked what the Government wants to do. Now, you can agree or disagree with it, and, as I said, I disagree with that piece of legislation, but it shows that Parliament has worked.<\/p><p>Now, the response of Boris Johnson and his Government is to say, &#8216;Right, Parliament has checked me. Let us go to the country; let us have that conversation with the country and seek a mandate from the country to deliver either the deal and we leave, or we hand the keys of No. 10&#8212;[<em>Interruption<\/em>.]&#8212;we hand the keys of No. 10 to the other parties so they can do it&#8217;. That&#8217;s called democracy, and I bitterly regret&#8212;I bitterly regret&#8212;the leader of Plaid Cymru making the comparison between the Prime Minister of this country and the chief executive of the Hong Kong administration, where people are on the streets fighting for democracy and actually dying for democracy there. You should retract that comment, because, ultimately, the Prime Minister of this country has said that he will go before the country and he will put his argument to this country. And it is you and the Labour Party and the other parties in Westminster that are stopping that happening. You can&#8217;t argue against that. That is called democracy. From other quarters in this Chamber today we've heard the word 'dictatorship', well, there&#8217;s no dictatorship with the Prime Minister standing at the despatch box in the House of Commons saying, 'Let us go to the country and ask them how they want this country to deliver on Brexit'. That is the question that we will face in the next four to five weeks, and that is what we must answer.<\/p><p>But, above all, what we mustn't shy away from is the instruction that we were given in 2016. I'm a Brexiteer, as everyone in this Chamber knows, but I believe in immigration. I believe immigration is a good thing for the country. I believe in trade; I believe that trade is a good for this country. And I believe that we learn from other people. I don&#8217;t believe in turning our backs on the world, but what I have learnt when I&#8217;ve been in politics and what I&#8217;ve seen in Brussels is an entity that I have chosen do I want this country to be a part of. I engaged in the debate and the discussion in the referendum. I put my flag up the mast. The country endorsed what I and 17.4 million other people chose to do. It is for us to enact and support that mandate and deliver it, and, in five, 10, 15, 20 years&#8217; time, if politicians in manifestos want to overturn that, then so be it&#8212;that is called democracy. But to not enact the referendum result of 2016 will be a deeply destabilising time for this country, and we must engage with what is coming in the next four to five weeks with a general election that I urge the parties opposite to engage with so that the people can have a Government in Westminster&#160;that will deliver on their wishes.<\/p>",

Throughout my political life, I have believed in two things: the union of the UK and the membership of the UK in the EU. In the next two or three years, I could see both struck down. I imagine that I will not be the only person in that position. Since I unashamedly and profoundly believe that our interest is best preserved by remaining&#8212;to answer the question of the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, taken up quite legitimately by the noble Lord, Lord Howard&#8212;I shall use the time available to argue that case as fervently as I possibly can.<\/p><p pid=\"b1156.0\/2\">I turn to the question of Scotland. Would it not be a quite extraordinary outcome if a party describing itself as the &#8220;Conservative and Unionist Party&#8221; were  to preside over the break-up of the United Kingdom? I do not know how often noble Lords go north of the border but it is worth doing that, if only for a couple of days, to understand the sense of injustice that so many people in Scotland feel about the attitude and policies of the present Prime Minister. That can only put wind in the sails of the Scottish National Party&#8212;and, God knows, it is adept at ensuring that any puff of wind in its direction is put to the best possible use. In my view, that would be damaging not just to Scotland but to the UK. For my part, I will not allow that to pass unless I am satisfied that I have done everything in my power to prevent it.<\/p><p pid=\"b1156.0\/3\">My second point is political. People often say, &#8220;All we joined was a customs union&#8221;, but it always was a political union, just as NATO, a defence union, was always was a political union. Why was it political? Because it was to try to avoid the fact that within 21 years two wars had taken place on the continent of Europe. If you are old enough to remember the Path&#233; newsreels of the devastation that had been caused to Europe, you will hardly find it surprising that the people whose countries had been invaded and occupied were determined to find an alternative way of living, and that has been remarkably successful. When the EU, in the shape of Mr Barnier and others, is reluctant to do anything that would detract from the EU&#8217;s economic integrity, that is as much about security as anything else because in economic integrity lies security integrity as well.<\/p><p pid=\"b1156.0\/4\">I hope that from time to time we look outside our own borders. We have a meddling Russia. As Russia&#8217;s economy goes further down Mr Putin has to keep meddling, trying to put the so-called West off its stride. The EU is a challenge to him, just as NATO is. His policies are the undermining of one and, if he can, the destabilisation of the other. We have an expansionist China, whose expansion is not just military but economic. Look at the extent of Chinese investment in this country and ask yourself whether that has had any impact upon the attitude expressed publicly by our Government in relation to the events in Hong Kong, to which, even if we have a declining legal obligation, we most certainly have a continuing moral obligation. Also, look at the White House. Can anyone ever remember a White House so uncertain and unpredictable? In this extraordinarily changed world, does it make sense to leave a political and economic union that has been so successful since its first creation?<\/p><p pid=\"b1156.0\/5\">Those are the reasons why I am a remainer. If the Bill is passed, I shall use every minute available to ensure that that case continues to be put to the people of the United Kingdom.<\/p>",

It was also the day of the Battle of Dunbar, which Cromwell called his crowning mercy; and it was also the day on which I joined the Army.<\/p><p pid=\"b970.0\/2\">As my noble friend has made clear, many issues were discussed at the summit and it is a pity that it could not put together a communique showing some agreement on serious matters such as the polarisation of conflicts in Hong Kong, the Amazon burning and so on. So, we come down to the familiar issue of the unnecessary backstop. Here, I put to my noble friend a puzzle. Clearly, there has been some progress, but the puzzle is why there has not been more. Contrary to what the noble Lord, Lord Newby, said, an enormous amount of detailed work based on experience of borders all around the world has been done, is being developed and is being further pursued. Special zones work all around the world and can be used in Northern Ireland. I am familiar with that border because back in the 1970s I helped to try to police it for security reasons&#8212;with very little success, I may say, because it is totally permeable. We have the common travel area. The Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom are both outside the Schengen area. Common provisions can be developed for livestock and all the necessary related checks. There is a huge amount of common activity already. It surprises many of us that, with all the work that has been done, progress is still very sticky and slow. Will the Leader of the House reassure her colleagues that those who have been involved with this border over the years understand that alternative arrangements are available, can be developed and can be pushed forward? If we do that, I think it would be understood by Mr Macron and other key players that&#8212;in his own words&#8212;it is unnecessary, and if it is unnecessary, why keep it?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b28.1\/1\">I thank the Prime Minister for an advance copy of his statement. I join with him in recognising the great human suffering of world war two and the great human bravery that took place during that awful conflict that began 80 years ago, which was essential in defeating the disgusting ideology of the Nazis and of fascism at that time.<\/p><p pid=\"b28.1\/2\">The Prime Minister met EU leaders over the summer and EU Council President Tusk at the G7 summit. After those meetings, the Prime Minister struck an optimistic note, saying that the chances of a deal were, in his words, &#8220;improving&#8221;. His optimism was not shared by those who had been at the same meetings. The Prime Minister may claim that progress is being made, but EU leaders report that the Government have so far failed to present any new proposals. Can the Prime Minister clear this up? Can he tell us whether the UK has put forward any new proposal in relation to the backstop? If it has, will he publish them so that these proposals can be scrutinised by Parliament and by the public?<\/p><p pid=\"b28.1\/3\">It is becoming increasingly clear that this reckless Government have only one plan: to crash out of the EU without a deal. The reality is exposed today in the in-house journal of the Conservative party&#8212;otherwise known as The Daily Telegraph&#8212;which reports that the Prime Minister&#8217;s chief of staff has called the negotiations &#8220;a sham&#8221;, that the strategy is to &#8220;run down the clock&#8221;, and that the proposal to alter the backstop is &#8220;a complete fantasy&#8221;&#8212;and those are the words of the Attorney General.<\/p><p pid=\"b28.1\/4\">No deal will mean food shortages, reduced medical supplies and chaos at our ports. It is not me saying that; it is the Government&#8217;s own leaked analysis that says that, and it warns of chaos across the board. Today, we had expected the publication of the Government&#8217;s no deal preparations. The Government are hiding from scrutiny and hiding from the people and they are trying to hide us from their true intentions. This is not just a Government in chaos, but a Government of cowardice. Thankfully, some in Whitehall are putting those vital  documents into the public domain, but we should not have to rely on sporadic leaks. Will the Prime Minister set out today when these documents will be published so that the people and Parliament can scrutinise and debate them? Many on the Government Benches would relish a no deal. They see it as an opportunity to open up Britain to a one-sided trade deal that puts us at the mercy of Donald Trump and United States corporations and that will increase the wealth of a few at the expense of the many.<\/p><p pid=\"b28.1\/5\">When it comes to the crunch, too many on the Government Benches who once opposed a no-deal outcome are now putting their own careers before the good of the people of this country. Just look at all those Tory leadership candidates who said that it would be wrong to suspend Parliament in order to make no deal more likely, but who sit passively as their principles of just a few short weeks ago are cast aside&#8212;I do not know what they were doing over their summer holidays, but something has changed. And it gets worse, because not only have they all stood by while the Prime Minister launches his latest attack on democracy, but some have repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility of the Government ignoring any law passed by Parliament that attempts to stop a no-deal Brexit. Will the Prime Minister therefore take this opportunity, when he responds in a moment, to assure the country that his Government will abide by any legislation passed by Parliament this week?<\/p><p pid=\"b28.1\/6\">The attack on our democracy in order to force through a disastrous no-deal Brexit is unprecedented, anti-democratic and unconstitutional. Labour will do all we can to protect our industry, protect our democracy and protect our people against this dangerous and reckless Government.<\/p><p pid=\"b28.1\/7\">I condemn the rhetoric that the Prime Minister used when he talked about a &#8220;surrender Bill&#8221;. I really hope that he will reflect on his use of language. We are not surrendering because we are at war with Europe; they are surely our partners. If anything, it is a no-deal exit that would mean surrendering our industry, our jobs, and our standards and protections in a trade deal with Donald Trump and the United States.<\/p><p pid=\"b28.1\/8\">The UK should be using its position in the G7 to promote policies to tackle the climate emergency. The climate emergency is real, but instead of standing up to President Trump, it was in fact agreed this time, in order to save his blushes, that there would be no joint communiqu&#233; on this at the G7. That is not leadership; that is fiddling while the Amazon burns. The situation across the Amazon should be a wake-up call to the Prime Minister, who once described global warming as a &#8220;primitive fear&#8230;without foundation&#8221;. As we watch fires rage, and not only across the Amazon but in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, does he stand by those sentiments?<\/p><p pid=\"b28.1\/9\">While funds to protect and restore the Amazon rain forest are welcome, the Prime Minister knows that this is merely a drop in the ocean, so will more money be pledged for the Amazon, and are additional funds being made available to tackle fires in sub-Saharan Africa? Will he be introducing measures to stop UK companies aiding, abetting and profiting from the destruction of the Amazon rain forest, and indeed rain forests in west Africa? On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2019-05-01\">1 May<\/phrase> the UK Parliament became the first state Parliament anywhere in the world  to declare a climate emergency, and I was proud to move that motion. We must continue to show global leadership on the issue.<\/p><p pid=\"b28.1\/10\">On Iran, it is notable that the Prime Minister fails to condemn President Trump&#8217;s unilateral decision to tear up the internationally agreed Iran nuclear deal, creating a crisis that now risks a slide into even deeper conflict. Does the Prime Minister plan to work with European partners to restore the Iran nuclear deal and de-escalate tensions in the Gulf? We are clear that in government Labour would work tirelessly through the UN for a negotiated reinstatement of the nuclear deal, and to defuse the threat of war in the Gulf. Effective diplomacy, not threats and bluster, must prevail. Will he call on the Iranian authorities to end the unjust detention of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, and what actions has he taken so far to ensure her release from the terrible situation that she has been plunged into?<\/p><p pid=\"b28.1\/11\">We are all concerned about the situation in Hong Kong. No Government anywhere should get to shut down rights and freedoms, or to pick and choose which laws they adhere to.

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1534.0\/1\">I usually use this debate to talk about very local issues. Today I want to deviate a little, because many of my constituents have written to me about their concerns for people who live elsewhere in the world and their fear that our voice might be silenced or muted because of Brexit and our pursuit of trade deals.<\/p><p pid=\"a1534.0\/2\">My constituents have pointed out Trump&#8217;s obsession with walls and putting children in cages, and his insidious support for the damaging and highly dangerous great replacement conspiracy theory. They asked, &#8220;What did we do in response?&#8221; Well, we gave him a state visit.<\/p><p pid=\"a1534.0\/3\">There are concerns about other powerful countries too, like China. As we know, more than a million men, women and children are in detention camps, based on their ethnicity and their Muslim faith. Families have been torn apart by the state, children from their parents. Credible reports say that detainees are forced to swear oaths of allegiance, renounce their religion and learn Mandarin in place of their mother tongue. Some reports even talk of summary execution and the harvesting of organs.<\/p><p pid=\"a1534.0\/4\">Our Government have recognised that human rights abuses are happening today on a huge, almost unimaginable scale. Uyghur Muslims fear a genocide. Why have we not taken targeted steps? Frankly, we do not need more words. It is clearly a business. We could identify those who develop racist software to identify the targets. We could identify those who are building the camps. We could refuse them contracts with the UK, couldn&#8217;t we? We could speak up much more strongly about Hong Kong as well, couldn&#8217;t we? We could address the increasing fear of Hong Kongers that their free society is just slipping away. We could help&#8212;but we have not, and I fear that we will not because China might move away from freer trade, and we need that free trade now as a substitute for what we are losing.<\/p><p pid=\"a1534.0\/5\">I fear that it is the same with Modi&#8217;s Government. On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2019-06-17\">17 June<\/phrase>, when the new Indian Parliament was being sworn in, members of the ruling party chanted the Hindu nationalist slogan &#8220;Jai Sri Ram&#8221; whenever a Muslim representative stood up to take their oath. It was an attempt to intimidate and delegitimise those elected representatives based on their religion. Those words could simply be an expression of faith, but they have been twisted into something horrifying.<\/p><p pid=\"a1534.0\/6\">Since then, there have been repeated Islamophobic attacks, accompanied by that same chant. On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2019-06-22\">22 June<\/phrase>, Tabrez Ansari was tied to a pole, beaten and abused by a crowd in the open. He cried and begged for mercy. After the crowd were done with Tabrez&#8212;after they had forced him to repeat their slogan and taken yet another step to erase his difference&#8212;the police took him into custody. Reportedly, he was refused medical help. His family members were threatened with similar beatings and not permitted even to see him until, four days later, he died of his injuries. There have been many further attacks. A Hindu video is being shared, with the lyric:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1534.0\/7\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Whoever doesn&#8217;t say Jai Sri Ram, send him to the graveyard.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1534.0\/8\">Frankly, that is the language of genocide.<\/p><p pid=\"a1534.0\/9\">As hon. Members will know, I could go on. I wanted to talk about Bolsonaro&#8217;s Brazil, Saudi Arabia and our arms deals as well. To be entirely honest, it seems to me that FCO Ministers, many of whom I deeply respect, have raised human rights issues in terms just vague enough not to cause trouble. What is our role in this new world if we swallow our words and turn away when we see persecution escalating, risk to lives and liberty, and possible genocide on the horizon? How will this new Government show us that they are not cowards, they are not distracted and they are not restricted because of Brexit?<\/p>",

Member for Dundee West (Chris Law)<\/phrase>, who I am delighted is in the Chamber today. We joined parliamentarians from around the world, representatives of the Tibetan Parliament in exile based in Dharamshala, and His Excellency Lobsang Sangay, the Sikyong or President of the Central Tibetan Administration since 2012. We were pleased to receive the Sikyong in this place, and that he met you, Mr Speaker, just a few weeks ago.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/4\">At the convention, we discussed continued human rights abuses of Tibetans at the hands of Chinese security forces; the routine intimidation of Tibetans, their supporters and the Dalai Lama himself around the world; the assaults on the Tibetan language, and the culture, religious practices and way of life of Tibetans generally; and the continued population transfer of Chinese into Tibet to dilute and smother further the Tibetan identity. We also debated at length the environmental degradation being waged on the Tibetan plateau, which has led to an unprecedented number of natural disasters, caused by the impact of excessive and unsustainable mineral extraction and dam construction in an area whose rivers service some 40% of the world&#8217;s population; as well as the accumulation of waste and the dumping of toxic waste on the plateau and in Tibet&#8217;s waters. We discussed, too, the tragic self-immolation of more than 150 Tibetans in protest against Chinese persecution in Tibet, and the continued human rights abuses generally.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/5\">We all signed up to the Riga declaration, which requests China<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1229.2\/6\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;give unimpeded access to Tibet to foreign journalists, scholars and researchers, diplomats and other foreign citizens, including those of Tibetan origin.<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1229.2\/7\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">To cease its policies and practices that harm the natural environment of the Tibetan Plateau.<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1229.2\/8\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">And to resume the dialogue with envoys of His Holiness the Dalai Lama without preconditions&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/9\">because the Tibetan struggle has always been a peaceful one.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/10\">A few days before the convention, I received a phone call from a senior official at the Chinese embassy in London, strongly suggesting that I should not be going to Riga, that I should not be consorting with such people and that I should rethink my plans, because everything is fine in Tibet, and that is plain for all to see. Basically, I was told, &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to go Riga, Mr Loughton, do you?&#8221; I responded politely that his entreaties had made me even more determined to attend  the convention and I asked why, rather than intimidating parliamentarians, the Chinese Government do not sit down to talk to us.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/11\">I again invited the Chinese ambassador to attend a meeting of the all-party group for Tibet and indicated that a group of us would be delighted to be hosted in Tibet so that the Chinese Government can show us at first hand how everything in Tibet is just fine. Subsequently, I wrote twice to His Excellency Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador in London, but I await a reply, even though the ambassador has found time to attend numerous other all-party group meetings in this place and various other events in recent months.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/12\">We should not be surprised, however, by that behaviour by the Chinese. Their record on human rights, cultural tolerance and the environment is deplorable, which is why they do not want people from outside finding out what goes on in the inside. Foreigners including British and EU citizens, and Americans require a number of special authorisations and permits in addition to a Chinese visa to enter the Tibet autonomous region, which spans about half of Tibet. For those who do get in, a Government-appointed guide must accompany them, and during politically sensitive periods the region is completely closed to foreigners. Such closures have occurred regularly since a wave of mostly peaceful protest swept across the Tibetan plateau ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/13\">Foreign diplomats, parliamentarians, journalists and even UN officials are almost always denied visits to the region, other than on rare official tours carefully orchestrated by the Chinese authorities. At the same time, Tibetans are regularly prevented from travelling outside China, and those passing information abroad are punished severely. A prominent example is Tashi Wangchuk, a young language rights advocate who last year was sentenced to five years in prison, just for giving an interview to The New York Times about his efforts to protect Tibetans&#8217; mother tongue. The UK ambassador in Beijing has not been able to visit the Tibet autonomous region since 2017, and is still waiting for permission to travel. Trips by officials and tourists are always closely managed, and travel permits are often withdrawn at short notice.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/14\">Sadly, such restrictions are even harsher for European citizens of Tibetan heritage, many of whom are refugees who escaped from Tibet and are specifically targeted by and discriminated against by Chinese embassies and consulates when they apply for a travel permit. That cruelly prevents many of them being able to see their families, from whom in many cases they have been separated for a long time.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/15\">Recently we have seen the latest attempts at repression by the Chinese authorities in Hong Kong, and the brave resistance of millions of Hong Kong citizens. Less graphically we have been given limited access to the appalling abuses in the Xinjiang region of China, where more than 1 million Uighurs, Kazakhs and other primarily Muslim minorities are detained in concentration camps that are cynically dressed up as re-education schools. Families are being split up and thousands of children are being taken into state care. But we must not be distracted from the long-term protracted suffering of the Tibetan people; in the 60 years since the occupation and invasion, more than 1 million Tibetans have lost and continue to lose their lives.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/16\">We can no longer sit idly by. All attempts to shed light on human rights abuses through the universal periodic review of the UN Human Rights Council have been snubbed, and continue unabated and largely in secret. The Foreign Press Association has reported that it is easier for Beijing-based journalists to visit North Korea than to visit Tibet.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/17\">Chinese authorities take advantage of our freedoms in the west to travel freely and spread their propaganda, but routinely refuse to reciprocate. That must stop. Recognising this, in December 2018 the United States adopted the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act, which promotes access to Tibetan areas for American diplomats, journalists and ordinary citizens&#8212;just as their Chinese counterparts enjoy in the US. Despite Chinese denunciation of this law, the legislation already appears to have made an impact, as Chinese state media are now reporting that Beijing has decided to adopt a faster process for foreign tourists to receive permits to enter Tibet. This landmark Act had cross-party support and was unanimously approved by the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in December. It was sponsored by Republican Senator Rubio and Democrat Senator Bob Menendez, and even President Trump welcomed it.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/18\">My Bill mirrors the US Act. I will shortly be publishing the draft Bill, replacing references to &#8220;US&#8221; with &#8220;UK&#8221; and &#8220;State Department&#8221; with &#8220;Foreign Office&#8221;, and making other appropriate adjustments. It will also include a recommendation for the UK Government formally to request that the UN Special Committee on Decolonization considers Tibet. Given that China is part of that committee, it would therefore need to recuse itself. I hope that request will be taken seriously.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/19\">My Bill requires the Foreign Office to report to Parliament annually regarding the level of access that Chinese authorities grant to UK diplomats, journalists and tourists to Tibetan areas in China. Such assessment shall include: a comparison with the level of access granted to other areas of China; a comparison between the levels of access granted to Tibetan and non-Tibetan areas in relevant provinces; a comparison of the level of access in the reporting year and the previous year; and a description of the measures that impede the freedom to travel in Tibetan areas.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/20\">Under this legislation, no individual who is substantially involved in the formulation or execution of policies related to access for foreigners to Tibetan areas may enter the United Kingdom if: the requirement that foreigners must receive official permission to enter the Tibet autonomous region remains in effect or has been replaced by a similar regulation that also requires foreigners to gain a level of permission to enter the Tibet autonomous region that is not required for other provinces; and travel restrictions on United Kingdom diplomats, officials, journalists and citizens to Tibet autonomous areas in Sichuan, Qinghai, Yunnan and Gansu provinces&#8212;I apologise to Hansard&#8212;are greater than travel restrictions to other areas.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/21\">The Bill will also require the Foreign Office to report to Parliament annually, identifying individuals who were blocked from United Kingdom entry during the preceding year and a list of Chinese officials who are substantially involved in the formulation or execution of policies to restrict the access of UK diplomats, journalists and citizens to Tibetan areas.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/22\">The Bill mirrors the legislation that has already been passed unanimously by the US Congress. It is time for us, in Europe and the United Kingdom, to take a similar stand to show categorically to China that its continued abuses in Tibet do not go unnoticed or unappreciated, and that we will tolerate them no more.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/23\">I am pleased to report that the Bill is co-sponsored by Members representing all the main political parties who have more than one Member in this House&#8212;demonstrating the widespread sense of outrage at what China continues to get away with in its continued persecution of Tibet and Tibetans the world over. I commend this Bill to the House.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/24\">Question put and agreed to.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/25\">Ordered,<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/26\">That Tim Loughton, Chris Law, Sir Peter Bottomley, Jim Shannon, Kerry McCarthy, Christine Jardine, Jonathan Edwards, Mike Gapes, Maria Caulfield, Catherine West, Fiona Bruce and Marion Fellows present the Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/27\">Tim Loughton accordingly presented the Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"a1229.2\/28\">Bill read the First time; to be read a Second time tomorrow, and to be printed (Bill 429).<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b518.1\/1\">My hon. Friend is a particular champion of industries in his area, not least ceramics in Stoke. I thank him for speaking in my constituency last Friday and talking about the success that has come from the effort put into that local economy to help to turn it around and strengthen it.<\/p><p pid=\"b518.1\/2\">Since 2010, we have been working to turn around the toxic economy legacy bequeathed by the last Labour Government and to support the pioneering, innovative, entrepreneurial brilliance of British business once again. Success has come from policies designed to promote the dynamism, openness and flexibility of our economy. A further important step was taken by the Prime Minister when she established a dedicated trade Department for the first time in British political history. The Department for International Trade has just celebrated its third birthday and is crucial to the delivery of trade and investment success.<\/p><p pid=\"b518.1\/3\">Given that this could be a valedictory performance by me, as we get a new Prime Minister later, I pay tribute to the Secretary of State for International Trade and President of the Board of Trade, my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Liam Fox\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10213\">the Member for North Somerset (Dr Fox)<\/phrase>, for the brilliant work he has done leading and establishing this Department of State. Its work will become even more vital after we leave the European Union. We must build a global, outward-looking Britain that is a dynamic and independent champion of free, fair, rules-based international trade.<\/p><p pid=\"b518.1\/4\">Our trade and investment strategy seeks three basic things: higher exports, greater foreign and outward investment, and reduced trade barriers. Contrary to what we have heard, exports are booming. Total UK exports now stand at a record high of &#163;647 billion,  bearing out exactly what my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jack Brereton\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25698\">the Member for Stoke-on-Trent South (Jack Brereton)<\/phrase> just said. They are up in real terms&#8212;[Interruption.] Maybe the shadow Minister only looks at numbers that suit his narrative? They are up 25% in real terms.<\/p><p pid=\"b518.1\/5\">In 2017-18 alone, the Department for International Trade helped UK businesses to export goods and services worth around &#163;30.5 billion, which is a year-on-year increase of 4%. We are proud of our work in encouraging more companies to export, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch and Upminster said in her excellent opening speech. A lot of the difficulty is in overcoming the timidity and the concerns that companies have in exporting. Nearly 111,000 firms exported goods in the first quarter of 2019, which is 5,000 more than in the same period last year.<\/p><p pid=\"b518.1\/6\">I have talked about the foreign direct investment numbers, but the latest figures from UNCTAD show that UK hit a record high of almost &#163;1.5 trillion in FDI stock by the end of last year, which is more than Germany and France combined, creating 76,000 new jobs and safeguarding 15,000 more. That was in one year and in marked contrast to 2010, when France was close to overtaking us.<\/p><p pid=\"b518.1\/7\">To put the FDI numbers into further context, UNCTAD&#8217;s figures show that FDI flows&#8212;flows not stocks; I hope <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Bill Esterson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24905\">the hon. Member for Sefton Central (Bill Esterson)<\/phrase> knows the difference&#8212;fell by 19% globally in 2018. [Interruption.] I am now talking about flows as opposed to stocks, so it is repetition, but about a different aspect of something that I hope the hon. Gentleman would take an interest in. FDI flows fell by 19% globally and by 73% in continental Europe. What happened to FDI into the UK? The flows increased by 20%. So much for the negative effects of Brexit uncertainty.[Official Report, <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2019-09-03\">3 September<\/phrase> 2019, Vol. 664, c. 2MC.]<\/p><p pid=\"b518.1\/8\">The pace of change in the global economy is increasing but, for the agile, opportunities abound. The Department for International Trade provides the platform to give the UK a unique trade advantage, by locating export promotion, trade finance, trade remedies, export licensing and international negotiations all in a single Government Department.<\/p><p pid=\"b518.1\/9\">I want to respond to some points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch and Upminster. She asked about the 100 days. We will continue to prepare for no deal to be the outcome, which is not the avowed intent of either of the leadership contenders for the Conservative party. We prepared and were in a good position ahead of <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2019-03-29\">29 March<\/phrase>, and we are working with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to be able to meet questions coming in from businesses. We are ready to meet any surge in demand at that level.<\/p><p pid=\"b518.1\/10\">My hon. Friend asked about state-level engagement with the US. The Secretary of State and I met with Senators from Florida and Texas the other day. As we expand and strengthen the Department&#8217;s reach, we recognise that it is not all about working at the national and federal level, whether in the US or elsewhere, such as in Brazil. I was pleased to meet the Governor of  S&#227;o Paulo, which itself has more than 30% of the  GDP of Brazil. There is a lot more to be done at that more granular level in order to identify barriers and overcome them.<\/p><p pid=\"b518.1\/11\">My hon. Friend made an interesting point about language. Given our national weaknesses on foreign languages, I hope that officials may be able to follow up on that point. She also touched on the DIT working more closely with the FCO and DFID. We are absolutely trying to do that. I am delighted that we are becoming an official development assistance Department. We have to bring trade and development together. That is how people get out of poverty. This involves so many countries. There is now the Ghana Beyond Aid initiative; I visited Ghana&#8217;s investment conference in London last year. These countries do not want to be seen primarily as aid recipients. They want to be seen as countries with great entrepreneurs, great technology and great capability. That is why, after the Prime Minister&#8217;s speech last year in Cape Town, I am helping to organise the Africa investment summit on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2019-01-20\">20 January<\/phrase> 2020. It is precisely to ensure that, cross-Government, we are able to support increased investment in Africa and take advantage of the opportunities there.<\/p><p pid=\"b518.1\/12\">My hon. Friend touched on the subject of regulators. Whether further changes are required in their missions as defined by Government is something that I will leave for others to wrestle with, but I can say that our regulators really are stepping up to the mark. The Financial Conduct Authority, with whose representatives I have met, is making a major difference. People can look at our FinTech bridges. We lead the world on FinTech&#8212;financial technology. It is enormously valuable, and we are creating FinTech bridges with a number of other countries. For instance, we are deepening our engagement with Hong Kong and Australia. In both cases, the FCA has been a fundamental part of the team as we try to ensure that start-ups there can more easily come to the UK, and vice versa. It is precisely that kind of opening up of markets that is so important.<\/p><p pid=\"b518.1\/13\">I am not sure that I have ever given a speech from my iPad before.

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1688.0\/1\">My Lords, I declare my interests as listed in the register and in particular that I advise two major Japanese companies.<\/p><p pid=\"a1688.0\/2\">This debate arises from a short inquiry by your Lordships&#8217; International Relations Committee, of which I was then chairman, and a subsequent memorandum to the Prime Minister before she set off for the G20 meeting in Osaka, Japan, 10 days or so ago. The G20 meeting is supposed to co-ordinate responses to the tensions in world affairs and to take an overview of all the disruptive forces of change sweeping the globe&#8212;and, as I think is generally agreed nowadays, to do so with rather more relevance than the old G7 in modern conditions. Frankly, it does not look as though much co-ordination or overviewing went on this time in Osaka.<\/p><p pid=\"a1688.0\/3\">When she returned, the Prime Minister was subjected to two full hours of questioning on the G20 in the other place&#8212;incidentally, a longer time than was allocated for the whole of our debate this evening&#8212;and that of course came after her 11-hour flight back from Tokyo. I do not think that that kind of battering treatment of a nation&#8217;s chief executive would be allowed or considered even faintly sensible in any other legislature in the world. Anyway, let us hope that the next Prime Minister, not to mention the ranks of Theresa May&#8217;s persistent critics, have even half her remarkable stamina.<\/p><p pid=\"a1688.0\/4\">The questions to her in the other place covered a huge range of topics, from the Chagos Islands to Scotch whisky. Even so, some key issues were completely missed in the exchanges. Therefore, perhaps it would be useful for me to comment first on those key issues&#8212;in other words, what should have been there but was not.<\/p><p pid=\"a1688.0\/5\">I begin with Japan itself, where it all took place. In her Commons Statement, Mrs May mentioned the growing strength of the relationship between the UK and Japan, but in all her questioning no one repeated it or referred to it. That is rather odd because Japan is by far our best friend in north-east Asia, the world&#8217;s fastest-growing area. We may not like some aspects of Japan, such as its judiciary or the persistence in whale killing, but it remains the third biggest industrial power in the world, with immense creative momentum, especially as the &#8220;globotics&#8221; revolution takes hold. We will need it very much in the future.<\/p><p pid=\"a1688.0\/6\">I have argued for 30 years that our foreign policy experts should take the Japan connection much more seriously and creatively. Osaka should have been&#8212;and I hope that in the sidelines, it was&#8212;a golden opportunity to carry forward our defence and security links, as well  as our trading ties with Japan and all Asia, with the new networks of trade and investment that are rapidly developing there.<\/p><p pid=\"a1688.0\/7\">Then there is our China policy. The G20 coverage was dominated by the US-China trade wrangles, but it is our interests that badly need developing and clarifying. America is not going to do that for us. Unlike America, we do not see China as the enemy. Of course, we have to treat our China connections with great caution, but this nation will stand or fall by its agility in balancing its connections with both China and America and not by being trodden flat between the two in the totally new pattern of world power that has now emerged, nor simply by clinging to the coat-tails of Trump&#8217;s America all the time, as some of the shallower columnists in the media keep urging. I hope that is not what we were doing last week in taking over the Iranian oil tanker in Gibraltar that was bound for Syria, and that it is not what the new Prime Minister will do; that would not be the right pattern to follow.<\/p><p pid=\"a1688.0\/8\">There are aspects of China in the human rights area that we rightly dislike&#8212;some nasty stories circulate about its treatment of minorities, especially the Uighurs and their culture&#8212;but there should be no illusions: China is now a major global player as a supplier, a market, an influence and an investor across the world and right up to our own front door. It is the world&#8217;s largest trading nation. Its R&amp;D expenditure soared to $298 billion last year, the second highest in the world. I believe that we can box much cleverer with China than the hot and cold, unpredictable views that come from Washington, using track-two and three diplomacy to the full on issues such as Huawei, 5G and the East\/West technology split that some Americans apparently want to see and which at all costs we should avoid.<\/p><p pid=\"a1688.0\/9\">Hong Kong was not actually mentioned in the communiqu&#233; or the report back to the other place but it is certainly right for us to insist on Hong Kong freedoms under the law, including the freedom to protest, the principles of the 1984 Sino-British declaration and so on. However, the violent physical trashing of the Hong Kong legislature is something else. It is wrong, and in my view we should have been much more forthright in saying so than we have been.<\/p><p pid=\"a1688.0\/10\">As for the Russians at the G20, Vladimir Putin may not be the nicest of characters, as the Prime Minister&#8217;s handshake photo made crystal clear, but undoubtedly he has a super-sharp mind and a mastery of prodding us at our weakest points. Liberalism may not be dead or obsolete in the West, as he claimed, but it is undoubtedly under severe assault from narrower varieties of populist nationalism, coming from both left and right, vastly amplified and empowered by digital communications and pushing Governments all the time inward, towards more protection and reluctance to co-operate internationally in line with the rules-based order.<\/p><p pid=\"a1688.0\/11\">As for climate concerns, the Prime Minister spoke proudly at Osaka of our Government&#8217;s new commitment to zero emissions by 2050. By itself, as everyone knows, this would hardly move the needle in fighting climate change. Indeed, if we manufacture less and import more carbon from overseas, it might actually have the reverse effect. So the key aim has to be, and can  only be, through example impact, especially on the really big global emitters: China, India, Russia and the United States. China is going to be decisive in this situation, with 28% of global emissions and rising fast. We need to hear much more about how the example process is actually going to work. Assurances that the big emitters are listening is not enough, and neither is costly virtue-signalling.<\/p><p pid=\"a1688.0\/12\">The nature of international trade has changed dramatically in the last decade, especially now that trade relations between China and the rest of the world are entering a whole new phase. Much of our thinking about China is badly out of date, as my noble friend Lord O&#8217;Neill reminded us as a witness to our committee. I hope we shall hear from him a little later. It is cultural and professional exchange, the creative industries, the newest technologies and soft power networks that are reshaping world commerce, with Asia taking the lead.<\/p><p pid=\"a1688.0\/13\">In the forums of the world, we are going to have to defend our core ideas much more effectively. We will have to fight for liberal values with new techniques, methods and expressions. We will have to defend international rules and build as fast as we can new types of social and fair capitalism, as they do in Asia, to counter the inchoate pressures of populist extremism that are growing everywhere and are definitely here to stay.<\/p><p pid=\"a1688.0\/14\">The G20 was&#8212;or should have been&#8212;a forum in which to make these tasks a lot clearer and to focus on them more vividly, but this time I am not sure that that is what happened. That may be because technology is moving ahead too fast for Governments to keep up, but that is a debate for another day.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1457.0\/1\">My Lords, I am glad to follow the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, and particularly glad to give unequivocal support to the Motion tabled by the Leader of the Opposition; I am just sorry that it has taken so long.<\/p><p pid=\"a1457.0\/2\">Three years ago, in the wake of a referendum that had divided our country almost equally, I told your Lordships&#8217; House that we needed a Parliament that could come together and look at the facts. I was anxious to have an innovation: a Grand Committee of both Houses. It could have been done. I like to think that had it been done, we might not be in quite the mess that we are in today. Certainly, were it not for the ending of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive, we would not be in this mess. Many of the points made cogently by the noble Lord, Lord Hain, would  have been appreciated by many of the parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly. We have had this extraordinary dichotomy that, on the one hand, 56% of the people of Northern Ireland voted to remain and, on the other, their only parliamentary representatives who take their seats in Westminster are leavers. When the history of this period comes to be written, I think that this will be seen as one of the most significant facts.<\/p><p pid=\"a1457.0\/3\">Having been in Parliament for just over 49 years, I am very depressed for our country as we approach <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2019-10-31\">31 October<\/phrase>. Of course, I hope fervently that a deal can be done. Like many remainers on this side of the House and on the Cross Benches, I would have accepted the Prime Minister&#8217;s deal, as negotiated by Olly Robbins, to whom the Leader of the Opposition referred in her speech. I wish Her Majesty&#8217;s Opposition in the other place had realised that you cannot leave an institution and retain all the benefits of membership. This was a deal negotiated by a determined and expert team, agreed by both sides; Parliament should have  accepted it.<\/p><p pid=\"a1457.0\/4\">We are where we are, but where is that? I am ashamed for my party because of the way we are conducting the leadership election. It should have been decided in the other place. I do not know what the result would have been, but whoever had been elected Prime Minister&#8212;elected leader of the party and gone to the Queen to receive the seals of office&#8212;should have been working now. We are wasting time that we do not have to waste. I thought it grotesque&#8212;I use the word deliberately&#8212;that yesterday, when we had more news of the gravest crisis in Hong Kong since the handover, our Foreign Secretary, who I personally admire and like very much, was in Northern Ireland with Mr Boris Johnson, appealing for the party vote.<\/p><p pid=\"a1457.0\/5\">The noble Baroness, Lady Smith of Basildon, said quite rightly that we are dealing with 0.3% of the electorate, but in Northern Ireland we are dealing with 500 paid-up members of the Conservative Party. What a distortion of priorities, an appalling spectacle and  a national disgrace that we should be conducting  this election among 160,000 people in the whole of  the United Kingdom when we desperately need a Government. I honour Theresa May, but she is a lame duck Prime Minister and the Government are in a state of suspended animation while this goes on, with nobody knowing who will occupy which posts after the votes have been counted. I appeal to those who control the rule-making in my party&#8212;a party that I have hitherto always been proud to belong to and to which I have belonged for 63 years&#8212;to realise that this is not the way to choose a Prime Minister. It may be the way to choose a Leader of the Opposition but not a Prime Minister.<\/p><p pid=\"a1457.0\/6\">What can we now do? The answer is: not a great deal. I wish I could share the sanguine approach of  my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford. I admire him greatly; he has done great service in both Houses of Parliament. He is just stepping down, having had a very distinguished period as chairman of our International Relations Committee, and we are all in his debt. I hope he is right in all that he said, but I fear he is too optimistic.<\/p><p pid=\"a1457.0\/7\">What could a committee of both Houses do, composed of good men and true, as it would be, with a great deal of expertise from your Lordships&#8217; House? The noble Lord, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, would have to be a member of it so we would have to give him his summer holiday, but it is just possible that it could produce a persuasive report that would make whichever candidate emerges as the winner, and as the new Prime Minister, realise that above all his responsibility was to the nation.<\/p><p pid=\"a1457.0\/8\">To chase the votes of the sort of people who turned their backs in the European Parliament yesterday is totally shameful.<\/p>",

Member for Cambridge (Daniel Zeichner)<\/phrase> spoke about the mood of the public changing&#8212;he noted that&#8212;and this petition is a testament to that, as is the quality of the contributions to the debate today; that quality has really shown that change, as well. There has been a great deal of passion and commitment to real change shown by the speakers in this debate and I commend everyone who has taken part for that.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/3\">The hon. Gentleman also paid tribute to those programmes, such as &#8220;Blue Planet II&#8221;, that have brought these problems home to each one of us; indeed, they have brought them directly into our homes.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/4\">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the impressive work of the Petitions Committee staff, with some 20,000 people having been surveyed. That is a huge number of people whose views we have taken into account and the survey has given us some incredibly useful statistics. I thank him for listing some of those statistics and look forward to looking up the rest of them, because that was obviously a really valuable exercise. It was interesting to hear exactly what packaging&#8212;or rather, the lack of packaging&#8212;remarkable numbers of people seem prepared to accept.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/5\">The hon. Gentleman highlighted what is something of a Catch-22 situation, with companies increasing production of genuinely recyclable packaging while we still lack the necessary infrastructure to properly deal with it. I suggest to the Minister that extra investment is urgently needed in that respect.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/6\">The hon. Gentleman made a very useful point about the importance of remembering to consider the whole lifecycle&#8212;that analysis of what is being packaged. It is also important to remember that items need to be reused considerably more times than they are now before they are simply thrown away, or indeed recycled.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/7\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Neil Parish\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24779\">The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Neil Parish)<\/phrase> brought back happy memories for me of hunting for returnable bottles and exchanging the extra cash for sweeties, I am afraid to say. However, he also called for an end to Government box-ticking exercises, a proper appreciation of what is recyclable, and proper co-ordination between different local authorities. That issue exists in Scotland too, and I know that the Scottish Government are keen to try to iron out some of the differences in recycling approaches.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/8\">The hon. Gentleman also talked about the compostable cups that are now in use in Parliament. It is perhaps worth pointing out for the record that they are for commercial composting&#8212;they are not really for household composting&#8212;and the company that produces them also provides a collection service to enable that commercial composting to happen. I know that because the company&#8217;s HQ is located in my constituency; I will say more on the company later.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/9\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Bill Grant\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25643\">The hon. Member for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock (Bill Grant)<\/phrase> mentioned the excellent initiative of Scottish Water, which I would love to see being rolled out throughout the UK by different water companies. It involves installing free water fountains, like the Victorian fountains that were once so common everywhere. They are fountains for residents and visitors alike throughout Scotland, and it is a pleasure to see them after so many of the older, mainly Victorian water fountains fell out of favour.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/10\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Anne Main\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11798\">The hon. Member for St Albans (Mrs Main)<\/phrase> quoted David Attenborough speaking of &#8220;the age of plastic&#8221;. She rightly pointed out that plastic was once very enthusiastically welcomed, but also spoke of the flipside of the &#8220;plastic curse&#8221;; she mentioned nurdles and micro-fibres and many other things that I have certainly become aware of through some of my beach clean-up days with the Wardie Bay beachwatch in my constituency. She also spoke of other very serious legacy issues for plastic. She called for the Government to address those and to commit to actions to deal with that &#8220;plastic soup&#8221;, which is a phrase that I think will stick forever in my memory; it is very unfortunate that we even have to think of such a thing.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/11\">The hon. Lady also called on us all to show joined-up thinking, saying that we should aim for that truly circular economy. She also mentioned clingfilm, so I should mention the fact that my mother still washes clingfilm and drapes it on the kitchen taps. She has done so for many years and was a very early recycler.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/12\">The phrase &#8220;horrors from the deep&#8221; took on another significance recently, when a plastic bag was found in the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the world&#8217;s oceans, along with sweet wrappers of course. We also heard that &#8220;there ain&#8217;t no mountain high enough&#8221;, when 11,000 kg of rubbish, including plastic, was removed from Mount Everest. Still, plastic keeps fruit clean, right?<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/13\">The hon. Member for Cambridge spoke of TV programmes that helped to create the increasing pressure for action. The recent disclosure that nations in other parts of the world are refusing to continue to accept waste from the UK, and plastic waste in particular, also brought that issue into the public consciousness with a bang. I am sure that many of us here muttered a wee profanity in relief as we realised that this news was  being laid out clearly on the public agenda&#8212;hooray, indeed. But it must not just be a press story that is here today and gone tomorrow.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/14\">It was no surprise perhaps that we were foisting our problems on countries that we regard as &#8220;developing&#8221; while we think of ourselves as &#8220;developed&#8221;, which is to our shame; there is perhaps no surprise either that we are happy to leave it to someone else to clean up after us; and there is perhaps no surprise that we did not think about the consequences before we made the mess.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/15\">The sheer volume of waste that cannot be recycled and that represents a hazard to other life on this planet is as mind blowing as the scale of our idea that it can all simply be swept under the global carpet. The task of cleaning up this mess, and the job of getting some semblance of order back, is of similar measure to that of sending people to the moon after Kennedy made that declaration in Houston in 1962.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/16\">We need to have a similar belief in our ability to achieve. We need to think that it is not only necessary but within our reach to take action; that this action is not only possible but desirable. We have to set our collective human mind to the task of setting right what we have made wrong. I do not think that anyone has all the answers yet, but at least we have started asking the questions.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/17\">We need to clear the backlog of waste that we have created, but we also need to do more to stop creating the stuff in the first place. I find myself going backwards and forwards, between praising supermarkets&#8212;as some speakers have done, quite rightly, today for developing products and packaging that can be composted or recycled, or that are even biodegradable, which are moves in the right direction&#8212;to thinking that if those supermarkets spent a fraction of their advertising and promotion budgets on this issue, we might see some real differences.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/18\">Since each supermarket watches all the other supermarkets and twitches at the smallest possible movement, smart supermarkets that find a way to market some real moves to sustainability will not only gain a commercial advantage, which they will keep, but trigger a chain reaction in the other supermarkets. It is good to hear that the first, somewhat tentative steps are being taken in that respect and that that opportunity is finally being grasped.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/19\">However, it is not enough simply to find ways to use a bit less packaging. Where packaging is desirable or necessary, we should make sure that it does not cost the future. We must make the packaging sustainable, recyclable and biodegradable&#8212;making it properly biodegradable would be even better.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/20\">In my constituency, there is a company called Vegware, which produces foodstuffs packaging that, as can be seen by looking at this cup, people might take for plastic, but it is not. Instead, it is made from plants and can be recycled with food waste, where it composts&#8212;commercial composting, yes, but that becomes nutrients for plants. That is a virtuous circle that is simple and rather beautiful.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/21\">Vegware has been in business only since 2006, but it has operational bases in the UK, the US, Australia and Hong Kong, and it distributes throughout Europe, the middle east, South America and the Caribbean. It has  corporate clients the length of the UK and, indeed, in this very Parliament. It has demonstrated onsite compositing at Dundee and Angus College that produces horticultural compost from waste in just two weeks. It is showing the way forward, and that is not unusual in Scotland, either. The Scottish Government are showing leadership within their restricted scope for movement.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/22\">I am delighted to see that the deposit return scheme is coming in Scotland. I have often wondered why there has been so much attention on plastic straws, important though that matter is, and not enough on plastic bottles&#8212;as the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton, the Chair of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee mentioned&#8212;especially when we can get compostable straws from Vegware, a company in my constituency that I might have mentioned previously.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/23\">Scotland&#8217;s recycling rates are high. More trees are being planted each year and communities up and down the country are taking action. I mentioned Wardie Bay beachwatch and I will also mention the fantastic Leithers Don&#8217;t Litter, a completely voluntary organisation that has been making a huge difference for years now to the Leith community with its clean-up days. I particularly pay tribute to Gerry and Zsuzsa Farrell, who have been utter champions in that regard.<\/p><p pid=\"b223.0\/24\">Schoolchildren have become the environmental activists that our generation failed to be, and the future is brighter than it might have been as a result. But that is not enough; much more needs to be done. Governments need to go beyond strategies, plans and visions to some actual actions, and I will be delighted to see the Minister getting on with it.<\/p>",

Of course countries can sensibly look at how they can work together, either to reduce costs or to provide better opportunities. I remember a visit to Reykjav&#237;k, where the same building houses both the British and the German embassies. They have separate parts of the building; there is a clear divide, but that has brought opportunities for closer working&#8212;better opportunities&#8212;when we are arguing, probably, on the same types of issue. At the same time, we maintain a distinct and separate presence that is easily recognisable to those who visit. Certainly we would be only too  happy to talk with countries, if they wanted to look at this in Cardiff, about how it could be supported and what opportunities would be available to them. Let us not forget that it does not necessarily have to be Cardiff. There are other great towns and cities in Wales where they may look to have or may have economic interests, particularly in the north of Wales, that they need to service and where they need to provide support to their citizens.<\/p><p pid=\"b52.1\/2\">We want Wales, all parts of the UK, and the UK as a whole to be open and outward looking, building new relationships in Europe and beyond. As foreign affairs are a reserved matter, the Government represent the interests of the whole United Kingdom, and we will continue to deliver for Wales and all parts of the UK overseas.<\/p><p pid=\"b52.1\/3\">We believe that Wales approaches EU exit from a position of strength and continues to be an attractive location for business and investment. Last year, more than 3,000 jobs came to Wales through foreign direct investment, from 57 projects. The Office of the Secretary of State for Wales will continue to work closely with the Department for International Trade to support that work and attract new opportunities.<\/p><p pid=\"b52.1\/4\">Welsh businesses continue to export their products across the globe. I was pleased to note that the value of Welsh exports for the year ending March 2019 was up &#163;1.2 billion over the previous year, with growth in exports to EU and non-EU countries alike. Our exporting success is testament to our great exporting businesses. I am thinking of businesses such as Babi Pur, based in Gwynedd, which has grown to be one of the leading retailers in fair trade and organic children&#8217;s products, selling all over the world&#8212;it was ably promoted to me by the two local Members of Parliament, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Liz Saville-Roberts\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25302\">the right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd (Liz Saville Roberts)<\/phrase> and <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Hywel Williams\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11323\">the hon. Member for Arfon (Hywel Williams)<\/phrase>, when I met them to discuss the North Wales growth deal&#8212;and Llanllyr Source, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Ceredigion, selling spring water globally.<\/p><p pid=\"b52.1\/5\">Alongside the strong economic links with other countries, it is important that we recognise the cultural ones. I welcome plans by the Thai embassy to hold the first Thai festival in Wales next month to help to raise awareness of the links that exist between Thailand and Wales. We should be clear that organising events with another nation to promote the country does not automatically mean organising events in London; that can happen across the rest of our United Kingdom as well. I am particularly pleased that the Thai embassy has decided to hold this event in Cardiff.<\/p><p pid=\"b52.1\/6\">The Secretary of State for Wales has regular meetings with overseas diplomats, to discuss opportunities to strengthen the links between Wales and countries across the globe. He also promotes Wales abroad and has done so recently in Hong Kong, Japan, the US, Qatar and elsewhere. These trade missions are vital in ensuring that our long-term aspirations for the Welsh economy are secured. He has also worked extensively with the Department for International Trade to launch the Wales portfolio at MIPIM&#8212;le march&#233; international des professionnels de l&#8217;immobilier&#8212;the world&#8217;s largest property and investment event, in March. The six projects in the portfolio, from across Wales, showcase our potential.<\/p><p pid=\"b52.1\/7\">In response to the specific query that was made, we want to continue working closely with the Welsh Government in marketing Wales to the world. The Secretary of State has a positive relationship with both the Welsh Minister for Economy and Transport, and the deputy Minister with responsibility for international relations in the Welsh Government, and has invited them to join him on trade missions in order to demonstrate a joined-up approach to our prospective partners.<\/p><p pid=\"b52.1\/8\">Businesses in Wales rightly have access to support in 108 markets globally through the Department for International Trade. I would be happy to look at how we can expand that sort of work further, so that Welsh businesses are heard in our international trade work. We are also working with the Department of International Trade to consider how best they can boost their resource and presence in Wales. DIT is a Department for the entire UK, and basing key staff in Wales, to work with stakeholders and the Welsh Government, can help grow our exports.<\/p><p pid=\"b52.1\/9\">All of that is important, because, after we have left the EU, the UK will have an independent trade policy for the first time in more than four decades. I know that you will particularly welcome that, Mr Bone.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b853.0\/1\">I thank the Minister of State for advance sight of his statement, and for the customary tone of concern and deliberation that he brings to these issues. At the outset, I should like to ask him a couple of specific questions about the proposed extradition Bill, which I do not think were covered in his statement.<\/p><p pid=\"b853.0\/2\">First, have the Government sought or received any safeguards from the Hong Kong authorities that, once that proposed Bill is on the statute book, the powers it contains cannot and will not be extended to include the extradition of political activists and dissidents? Secondly, what safeguards have been sought or received with respect to British citizens living in Hong Kong and British national (overseas) passport holders, should the proposed extradition Bill be passed?<\/p><p pid=\"b853.0\/3\">However, as the Minister of State has rightly observed, our concerns go deeper than those specific issues&#8212;the implications of the extradition Bill and the violent protests we have seen on the streets of Hong Kong in recent days. Our concerns also must go to what has undoubtedly been the steady erosion over recent years of compliance with the joint UK-Sino declaration, signed in 1984&#8212;the agreement that was supposed to enshrine the one country, two systems approach, to ensure<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b853.0\/4\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;a high degree of autonomy&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b853.0\/5\">for Hong Kong and to protect its political, cultural and social rights and freedoms for at least 50 years after the 1997 handover. Just 22 years on, we see those freedoms and that autonomy being steadily taken away.<\/p><p pid=\"b853.0\/6\">Last September the Hong Kong National party was banned, on so-called grounds of &#8220;national security&#8221;&#8212;the first time since 1997 that any Hong Kong party had been outlawed by the authorities. In April, nine individuals&#8212;students, professors and human rights activists&#8212;were found guilty of &#8220;incitement to public nuisance&#8221;, just for the supposed crime of organising the 2014 umbrella protests, facing sentences of up to seven years in prison. Now we have the proposed extradition Bill, which many fear is the thin end of the wedge when it comes to Hong Kong&#8217;s judicial independence. No wonder opinion polling by the University of Hong Kong has found that public confidence in the one country, two systems commitment has fallen from 77% in 2008 to just 40% today. No wonder our Foreign Affairs Committee has said that China is moving closer to a &#8220;one country, one system&#8221; approach. It is, sadly, no wonder that we have, as a result, seen protests in Hong Kong in recent days, and the growth of the pro-independence movement in recent years.<\/p><p pid=\"b853.0\/7\">So the big question today is, what are the UK Government prepared to do to demand that the Chinese authorities go back to the commitments that they made in the 1984 statement? As the Minister of State has said, the Chinese ambassador said last night that that is an historic document. But, you know, the Chinese have been saying that for two years. Two years ago they said it was an historical document which had no &#8220;practical significance&#8221; and was &#8220;not binding&#8221;. I agree with the Minister of State when he condemns those comments, but we have to ask, is it any wonder that the Chinese are so dismissive of the joint agreement, and prepared to commit flagrant breaches of it, if we as a country are not prepared to protest when they do so? Let me make it clear: I mean that not as a personal criticism of the Minister of State, but as a general indictment of the Government&#8217;s approach over recent years, which has not been as clear and robust as just set out by the Minister of State.<\/p><p pid=\"b853.0\/8\">I am not the only one making that indictment. Last year it was Chris Patten, the former Member for Bath, the last British Governor of Hong Kong, who described the Government&#8217;s stance toward China as craven, in seeking a trade deal at the expense of advocacy for human rights in Hong Kong. He said that a series of<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b853.0\/9\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;outrageous breaches&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b853.0\/10\">of the 1984 declaration had prompted little more than<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b853.0\/11\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;a slightly embarrassed clearing of the throat&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b853.0\/12\">and some<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b853.0\/13\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;tut-tutting&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b853.0\/14\">from the Government. This is a theme going back to 2015, the year after those umbrella protests, when George Osborne visited China and was praised by the state-run media for being<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b853.0\/15\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;the first Western official in recent years who has stressed more the region&#8217;s business potential instead of finding fault over the human-rights issue&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b853.0\/16\">Last year, after her own visit. the Prime Minister was praised by the Chinese state media for &#8220;sidestepping&#8221; human rights in favour of &#8220;pragmatic collaboration&#8221;. They concluded:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b853.0\/17\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;For the Prime Minister, the losses outweigh the gains if she appeases the British media at the cost of the visit&#8217;s friendly atmosphere.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b853.0\/18\">But those losses do not outweigh the gains if they amount to the erosion of democracy and autonomy in Hong Kong, if they amount to the abandonment of the 1984 joint agreement, and if they amount to the endangerment of the rights and freedoms of Hong Kongers, including British nationals and passport holders.<\/p><p pid=\"b853.0\/19\">Let me end by asking the Minister what action he and the Government will be taking, not just to express concern about these recent events, but to end their &#8220;craven&#8221; approach to China and to demand that the Beijing Government return to honouring the terms of the 1984 agreement.<\/p>",

The situation is changing day by day, and the Legislative Council is considering the matter again tomorrow. I hope we will have an opportunity to return to the subject. Mark Field said yesterday that we remain seriously committed to our international agreement and take it seriously, and so do our international partners. The Minister referred to the discussions with the Canadian Government but clearly, we need to do more. What is the Government&#8217;s assessment of China&#8217;s assertion in 2017 that the Sino-British joint declaration is just a &#8220;historical document&#8221; with no &#8220;practical significance&#8221; and is &#8220;not &#8230; binding&#8221;? More importantly, what diplomatic steps are the Government taking to build international co-operation and solidarity to ensure that the Sino-British joint declaration remains vital to the future of Hong Kong?<\/p>",

Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)<\/phrase> for initiating this debate and for continually highlighting developments in Hong Kong. I also express my gratitude for the contributions and sincere interest&#8212;perhaps silent interest in some cases&#8212;expressed by a number of hon. Members here, particularly my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Richard Graham\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24921\">the Member for Gloucester (Richard Graham)<\/phrase>. Clarifying with the Hong Kong Government what these proposals will mean is clearly something that I intend to do in very quick order.<\/p><p pid=\"b519.2\/2\">This was billed as a slightly more general debate, and given that we had an urgent question earlier, I do not wish to spend this time entirely by simply covering the same old ground, important though that ground is, but let me start with a few words about the UK&#8217;s relationship with China. We believe that we have a constructive relationship based on a strong economic partnership but also our position as leading nations of the world. The UK and China are both, of course, P5 nations of the United Nations. Trade and investment links are at record levels, and people-to-people links, particularly among Chinese students&#8212;the largest single cohort in the UK&#8212;are thriving.<\/p><p pid=\"b519.2\/3\">The UK&#8217;s approach to China is pragmatic. It maximises the benefits of co-operation while doing its best to protect our national security. As G20 members with seats on the UN Security Council, the UK and China can do more than most to address a range of global challenges. From medical research to sustainable  development, we have co-operated, and will continue to do so, for our mutual benefit in ways that support global prosperity, security and stability.<\/p><p pid=\"b519.2\/4\">Of course, this partnership has its challenges. China&#8217;s growing influence is putting pressure on the global rules-based system, and we regularly express our very real concerns about issues, including its stance on human rights, its respect for certain international agreements and its failure fully to protect intellectual property. But we work with China where doing so is in line with our values and protects our national interests, including the security of our people and businesses. We are clear and direct where we believe that China&#8217;s actions are incompatible with those values.<\/p><p pid=\"b519.2\/5\">The UK Government are acutely and continually aware of our historical responsibility towards Hong Kong, specifically as one of the joint signatories of the 1984 joint declaration that established the principle of one country, two systems. That joint declaration is a legally binding treaty registered, as I said, with the UN. Its objectives clearly apply to both signatories&#8212;the Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China and the UK. It remains in force and remains relevant to the conduct of life in Hong Kong. We are absolutely committed to ensuring that it is remains faithfully implemented for the period up to 2047, as <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Sarah Champion\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25168\">the hon. Member for Rotherham (Sarah Champion)<\/phrase> rightly mentioned.<\/p><p pid=\"b519.2\/6\">The one country, two systems principle provides Hong Kong with the foundations for success as a truly global financial centre and prosperous world city, as touched on by my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Fiona Bruce\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24857\">the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce)<\/phrase>. It safeguards Hong Kong&#8217;s capitalist economic system, its high degree of autonomy, its system of common law, its independent judiciary, and the rights and freedoms of its people and those who are lawfully residing there. However, as the Government&#8217;s most recent six-monthly reports have made clear, we believe that important areas of the one country, two systems framework are coming under increasing pressure. I take this opportunity to reassure the House that we engage in an ongoing and frank dialogue&#8212;a sometimes private, but frank dialogue&#8212;with the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities about the implementation of the joint declaration.<\/p><p pid=\"b519.2\/7\">Turning to our relationship with the Hong Kong Government, I want to stress that we have warm, constructive and positive links across a wide range of other issues. As an example, just last month, I joined the start of the inaugural UK-Hong Kong Government-to-Government financial dialogue, led on our side by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury. This involved the two Governments discussing co-operation between our globally leading financial services centres, building on rich industry-to-industry links. I welcome the decision for the UK to be the partner country for Hong Kong&#8217;s Business of Design Week this year. It is the largest design festival in Asia and it is our pleasure to support Hong Kong in this area. It is also a great opportunity to showcase the global reputation of the UK&#8217;s creative sector.<\/p><p pid=\"b519.2\/8\">It is also right that we take the opportunity to turn our minds collectively to the ramifications of the Hong Kong Government&#8217;s contentious proposals to change their extradition laws, following a highly publicised homicide in Taiwan, allegedly carried out by a Hong Kong national. Civil society groups, including organisations  that represent legal professionals and businessfolk in Hong Kong, have aired deep concerns about both the content of the proposals and the short consultation period. They fear above all that Hong Kong nationals and residents risk being pulled into China&#8217;s legal system, which can, as the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland pointed out, involve lengthy pre-trial detentions, televised confessions and an absence of many of the judicial safeguards that we see in Hong Kong.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"d40.0\/1\">My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Janvrin. I will be quoting from a book, and there is a rather fuzzy photograph of him in that book. It is an honour to speak in this debate and to pay tribute to all the people, not only from  our country but from our allies and friends, who made such a mighty triumph of Operation Overlord.<\/p><p pid=\"d40.0\/2\">The mammoth task of preparing for D-day, including training troops for amphibious operations, started well over 18 months before the invasion itself. The principal allies&#8212;ourselves, the United States and the Canadians&#8212;used all the valuable intelligence resources available to us. It is true to say, as other noble Lords have, that the code-breaking capacity at Bletchley Park was vital in helping to secure victory in the war and certainly shortened it by a considerable period of time. Our ability to gauge the Axis powers&#8217; deployments, strategy and tactics was invaluable. Furthermore, the assistance we got from the French Resistance and its ability to disrupt Axis forces was also extremely helpful.<\/p><p pid=\"d40.0\/3\">There was so much planning and co-ordination for this huge amphibious operation. Months before the invasion we had reconnaissance troops deployed all over the north coast of France, from Calais to Brittany, engaged in beach reconnaissance in an endeavour to confuse the enemy as to the invasion destination. Nearer the time of the invasion, decoy models were parachuted into different areas. The organisation and co-ordination had to involve all the main allies, particularly, as I have said, the United States, ourselves and Canada. It also involved all branches of our Armed Forces: we had to retain air superiority to be able to bomb and strafe the enemy from the air and co-ordinate ships, naval gunfire support, landing craft commando, and glider pilot and parachute troops for the assault itself. In addition to transporting troops, tanks, armoured cars and other vehicles, fuel, ammunition, food, water and medical supplies had to be delivered. In sustaining the assault and getting reinforcements and the main body of the Army ashore, there had to be a system of landing, especially for heavy armour. The Mulberry harbours, an invention of genius, had to be towed to northern France and assembled after the invasion when the beachheads had been taken.<\/p><p pid=\"d40.0\/4\">The House will know that the First United States Army landed at Omaha and Utah beaches, whereas the British and Canadian forces, comprising the Second Army, landed on Gold, Juno and Sword beaches. To gauge the massive scale and power of the initial result, it is instructive to look at the order of battle on D-day itself. The United States Army landed a division at Utah and two divisions, plus rangers, at Omaha. In addition to those forces, the 82nd Airborne Division and the 101st Airborne Division were dropped inland. The 3rd Canadian Division was landed at Juno beach, and the United Kingdom&#8217;s 50th Division was landed at Gold, with the 47 Commando Royal Marines. The UK&#8217;s 3rd Division landed at Sword with two commando brigades; the United Kingdom&#8217;s 6th Airborne Division was dropped inland. Over 150,000 allied troops were landed or dropped on D-day itself. This initial assault was on a massive scale that had never before been seen. The crucial reinforcement of the bridgehead in subsequent days was also of a magnitude unsurpassed in history.<\/p><p pid=\"d40.0\/5\">It should not be forgotten that there were large Australian, New Zealand, French, Czech, Belgian, Dutch, Greek and Polish contingents, sometimes as many as a division in strength. The success of the operation and the work of the beach-masters and others involved in this operation was a triumphant achievement.<\/p><p pid=\"d40.0\/6\">The United Kingdom Second Army was responsible for our initial assault and subsequent land operations. The commander of the Second Army was General Sir Miles Dempsey, a quiet but highly respected and hugely admired officer. To give the House an example of the intensity of the combat and the terrifying casualties sustained by the assault troops, I have chosen General Dempsey&#8217;s selection of 47 Commando&#8217;s capture of Port-en-Bessin as one of two D-day actions he considered especially outstanding. He wrote:<\/p><p pid=\"d40.0\/7\">&#8220;The capture of Port-en-Bessin was vital for two reasons: firstly, it formed a junction point between the British right flank on Gold Beach and the American V Corps landing on Omaha; secondly, it was essential as the main terminal of our petrol, petrol being the life-blood of a modern, mechanised army&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"d40.0\/8\">I am indebted to the late Professor John Forfar MC for his book From Omaha to the Scheldt, in which the noble Lord, Lord Janvrin, appears. Professor Forfar was the medical officer of 47 Commando and went on to have an equally distinguished career as a consultant paediatrician in Edinburgh. In a table in the book under the heading &#8220;Counting the cost&#8221;&#8212;this would include casualties that the unit sustained in the Scheldt some months later&#8212;63% of the fighting troop officers were killed in action and 75% of them wounded, giving a total of 138%. As to enlisted men, the total was 116%. Noble Lords might wonder how to get a figure of more than 100%; it is because the replacements and reinforcements were often killed or severely wounded as well.<\/p><p pid=\"d40.0\/9\">One benefit of a debate of this nature is the chance to put on record our profound gratitude and indebtedness to the countless people from not only our own country but those of our allies and friends who were involved in this operation. We owe them all a debt of honour we can never repay.<\/p><p pid=\"d40.0\/10\">Another advantage of the debate is the chance to emphasise the importance to this country of retaining and building on our amphibious capacity. In what I would loosely call the western world, the only countries with such a capacity are the United States&#8212;its amphibious capability is huge&#8212;ourselves and the French. Since World War II, the Royal Navy and the Royal Marines, often with Army and Royal Air Force ranks attached, have been involved in numerous amphibious operations, including the Korean War, Suez, Tanganyika&#8212;as it was&#8212;Limbang in Borneo, the first Kuwait threat from Saddam Hussein, the threat to Hong Kong in 1967, the Falkands campaign, operations in Sierra Leone, the invasion of Iraq and, the year before last, humanitarian operations in the Caribbean, as well as earlier operations.<\/p><p pid=\"d40.0\/11\">In his speech at the Royal United Services Institute on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2019-02-11\">11 February<\/phrase> this year, the then Secretary of State for Defence talked about the importance to this country of,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"d40.0\/12\">&#8220;increasing our global presence and building on our alliances&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"d40.0\/13\">both east and west of Suez. Among other things, he stated:<\/p><p pid=\"d40.0\/14\">&#8220;The UK is a global power with truly global interests&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"d40.0\/15\">He talked at length about the &#8220;Littoral Strike Ship concept&#8221;, and praised the success of the Royal Navy and what he rightly described as our &#8220;world-renowned Royal Marines&#8221;. The point is that we need the capacity to retain these skills. Can the Minister confirm that  the Government still have these aims? What exactly will they do to ensure that we continue to be able to mount amphibious operations throughout the world, with the necessary escort vessels, aircraft carriers and other vital support?<\/p><p pid=\"d40.0\/16\">Finally, we should give thanks that we have had no western European war since 1945. I fervently believe that our membership of the European Union, with our European allies and friends, has made a great contribution to this ensuing peace.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a895.0\/1\">I am grateful to you for the opportunity to take part in this debate, Madam Deputy Speaker. It is a good number of years since I last spoke in one of these Adjournment debates. In one of the first ones I spoke in, we were squeezed out to such an extent that I got to speak for 30 seconds at the end of it. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Ben Bradshaw\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10061\">The right hon. Member for Exeter (Mr Bradshaw)<\/phrase> was the Deputy Leader of the House at the time, and I managed to give 30 seconds on the subject of powdered whisky, an abomination then and today, I am sure. Returning to this debate after some years, it was refreshing to see that <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Sir David Amess\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10009\">the hon. Member for Southend West (Sir David Amess)<\/phrase> still sees it as an opportunity to catch up on his casework. In an ever-changing world&#8212;others have spoken about the difficulties in the House at the moment&#8212;that one small piece of continuity provides a small measure of reassurance for us all.<\/p><p pid=\"a895.0\/2\">I had hoped not to be here today&#8212;I mean that in the nicest possible way&#8212;but unfortunately an air traffic controllers strike is taking place in the highlands and islands so I was moved to take part in this debate, as a consequence of a meeting I had this morning. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Nicholas Dakin\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24798\">The hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin)<\/phrase> spoke in detail and with great knowledge about the steel industry, which is undergoing a moment of crisis. I very much associated with the way in which he spoke about that industry, because my communities in Shetland and in Orkney feel much the same about the fishing industry as his communities obviously do about the steel industry. In many ways, fishing defines what we are, because we are, of course, island communities. It pains me that I have to return today to a subject I have spoken about in the House previously&#8212;at numerous Question Times and in the two Adjournment debates I have had on the subject, one in July and one in April. I refer to the issue of visas for non-European economic area nationals seeking employment in the fishing industry.<\/p><p pid=\"a895.0\/3\">We are reaching a point of crisis. The dependence on non-EEA nationals for crew of many of the small inshore boats is such that the boats are being tied up; they cannot get the crew and they are looking at being sold on. When that happens, no fish are being landed in the individual ports, which means that the fish processing factories will eventually find other things to do. In that way, an important part, economically and culturally, of  our coastal and island communities around the UK is under threat. I fear that this is the sort of thing that in normal politics would have been sorted out months ago, but unfortunately we are in this phase where things that ought to be routine and capable of being managed somehow just do not come out the other end of the sausage machine.<\/p><p pid=\"a895.0\/4\">At the moment, the only non-EEA nationals who have been able to get in to crew fishing boats are ones who come into the country on transit visas and who are then fishing outside the territorial waters. There is an irony here, in that these fishing boats are forced to fish outside the territorial waters but Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs is now saying that their crew will be treated as though they were fishing within the territorial waters, so they are being taxed even though they are not being allowed to work within this country. For the white fish boats and the pelagic boats, which are bigger, go away for longer and work outside the 12-mile limit, these things are manageable, because they are bigger boats. The small inshore boats simply cannot work in that way, so, again, they are the ones being pushed out. Even the white fish boats and the pelagic boats are now being pushed into fishing where immigration regulations will allow them to fish, not where they know the fish are there to be caught. If ever there were a case where regulation was the tail wagging the dog, it is this.<\/p><p pid=\"a895.0\/5\">Along with other Members&#8212;<phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"David Duguid\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25664\">the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (David Duguid)<\/phrase> has been with me on many occasions, as have the hon. Members for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Angus Brendan MacNeil) and for Strangford (Jim Shannon)&#8212;I have been on delegations that have gone through the revolving door that has been the Immigration Minister&#8217;s in recent years, but we have been pushed from pillar to post. Most recently, the current Minister for Immigration, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Caroline Nokes\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24809\">the right hon. Member for Romsey and Southampton North (Caroline Nokes)<\/phrase>, explained that the Government had decided not to change their position on these visas because of the advice given by the Migration Advisory Committee.<\/p><p pid=\"a895.0\/6\">The Migration Advisory Committee is an independent body, and I have recently taken some time to consider its composition and work. This morning, I was delighted to welcome to the House of Commons the chairman of the committee, Professor Alan Manning, and several of his advisers and staff from the committee&#8217;s secretariat. Initially, I was encouraged by their willingness to come to Parliament to meet me and others who represent coastal and island interests. I was grateful for the work of the Fishermen&#8217;s Welfare Alliance on bringing together the case to present to them. I suppose that, after all these years in the House, I should have known better than to have allowed myself to get my hopes up. The two-hour engagement&#8212;if that is what I can call it&#8212;this morning was unfortunately dispiriting and disillusioning. I had hoped that if we were able to explain our position to them, they might have been able to explain their working to us, and we might then have achieved a meeting of minds, or at least a better understanding of what both sides were seeking to get out of the exercise.<\/p><p pid=\"a895.0\/7\">On the basis not only of this morning&#8217;s interaction but the Migration Advisory Committee&#8217;s most recent work, I am exceptionally disappointed. The body is comprised almost entirely of academics&#8212;in fact, I think they are probably all academics&#8212;but their work demonstrates a remarkable lack of intellectual rigour,  and I have seen demonstrated a worrying lack of intellectual curiosity. It simply defeats me to consider why academics who pursue their expertise in this area of public policy are not more curious to know the impact of the recommendations they make on communities throughout the country.<\/p><p pid=\"a895.0\/8\">We were told this morning that the Migration Advisory Committee&#8217;s concern is people and communities, which should be a good starting point, but it is apparent to me that there is simply no understanding on the committee of the communities that I represent and that others in coastal and island communities represent, and as a consequence, the committee concludes its work by saying that its aspiration is to create a level playing field in this policy area. I just do not see how that is going to be possible in any meaningful way. How is it going to be possible to create a single level playing field&#8212;a single size that fits all&#8212;right throughout the country? My particular working example of the fishing industry is so distinctive and so different, economically, socially and culturally.<\/p><p pid=\"a895.0\/9\">With regard to the most recent piece of work on which the Government now rely for their policy, the &#8220;EEA migration in the UK: Final report&#8221; from September last year, it concerns me that the Migration Advisory Committee will not recommend the introduction of<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a895.0\/10\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;separate employer-led sector-based routes&#8230;with the possible exception of seasonal agriculture&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"a895.0\/11\">which is discussed later in the report. The report also says:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a895.0\/12\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;In low-skilled jobs little training is required and thus it should be possible for employers to hire workers from other sectors.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a895.0\/13\">It is the definition of low-skilled jobs that most people in and around the fishing industry find most offensive. The idea that just because a deckhand is not undergoing a university-validated qualification their work is low skilled is offensive and demonstrates to me a quite fundamental lack of understanding about the work these people do.<\/p><p pid=\"a895.0\/14\">That impression is further reinforced by the MAC&#8217;s conclusion that to fill these &#8220;low-skilled jobs&#8221;&#8212;its term, not mine&#8212;we can rely on tier 5 youth mobility visas. It says:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a895.0\/15\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Tier 5 (Youth Mobility) is a cultural exchange scheme for people aged 18 - 30 from the following participating countries: Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Monaco, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong. Individuals can stay in the UK for up to 2 years to experience life in the UK &#8211; they can work and study but are not allowed to bring in dependants. The scheme operates on a reciprocal basis with opportunities for young British people to live and work in participating countries&#8230; Tier 5 workers can work in all jobs and, although we have little information on where they currently work, it seems likely that many are in lower-skilled jobs.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a895.0\/16\">If anything illustrates the lack of understanding of these great and eminent minds of the industries for which they are supposed to be formulating public policy, that surely is it. The idea that Australian, New Zealand and Canadian backpackers are going to come here and take jobs as deckhands on whitefish boats and prawn trawlers is, I am afraid, simply laughable. It grieves me to say it but we have come to a place where either Ministers have to be honest about their reliance on the advice of this body or else the body itself has to be reformed fundamentally.<\/p><p pid=\"a895.0\/17\">According to its own annual report last year, the MAC cost 893,467 taxpayer pounds to run, which is not insubstantial. Its membership comprises three professors, two doctors and one lonely individual who does not seem to have any academic title to append to her name. Two are based in London, one in Southampton, one in Warwick, one in Oxford and one in York&#8212;the most northerly of its members. This body, which is supposed to advise the Government on how to regulate immigration policy in relation to my community, has no member who works north of a point that is some 500 miles south of the southern-most point of my constituency&#8212;and remember that the southern-most point of my constituency is some 200 miles south of the northern-most point of my constituency. Does that not hint at the problem? This is an advisory committee composed of academics, not one of whom is based anywhere north of York. That surely has to change.<\/p><p pid=\"a895.0\/18\">I hope that this message will be heard in the Home Office. One of the principles that apparently guides the work of the MAC is diversity. I am afraid that a committee of six academics, all of whom are based between Southampton and York, whatever the gender balance, is not one I could regard as being diverse. I hope that within the Home Office the message will be heard today that the problem of fishing visas, which I have spoken about many times, is not going away but is getting worse. Ministers have got to take responsibility because it is apparent to me that the advice they are getting from those whom they pay to give that advice is not of a quality that is fit for purpose.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1936.0\/1\">My Lords, I too greatly welcome this timely and well-judged report from the International Relations Select Committee, and particularly the recommendations to strengthen engagement with the Commonwealth, to invest more in our global diplomatic presence, to increase the deployment of our smart power assets such as the British Council and the BBC global news, and I wholeheartedly support the commitments to the multilateral rules-based system &#8212;to the UN, NATO, the WTO and other multilateral organisations, however imperfect they may be. I also welcome the recommendation to increase engagement with regional powers across Africa, Asia and Latin America. That is particularly relevant in post-election India and Indonesia. I have three points to make.<\/p><p pid=\"b1936.0\/2\">In a world where 84% of people hold religious beliefs, I would like to have seen a reference in the report to the rise in persecution, crimes against humanity and genocide. Upholding Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is directly linked to national security, displacement and migration, stability, prosperity and other strategic concerns. As the BBC&#8217;s courageous correspondent, Lyse Doucet, has said, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t understand religion, you cannot understand the world&#8221;. It is certainly an issue that is taken seriously in Washington, and that brings me to my second point.<\/p><p pid=\"b1936.0\/3\">The committee concluded that the UK&#8217;s &#8220;bedrock&#8221; relationship with the United States is under &#8220;disturbing pressure&#8221;. Past Administrations in both countries have always been able to differ, as on occasion did Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, but it is central to this country&#8217;s interests that, notwithstanding our other relationships, we should sustain this bedrock relationship and entrench our more natural alliances such as the Five Eyes. Fevered anti-Americanism is a huge error. With this in mind, in the light of plans to allow Huawei&#8217;s investment in 5G and other Chinese investment in our national infrastructure, we should pay special attention to the remarks of Robert Spalding, the former senior director for strategy at the US National Security Council, who writing in yesterday&#8217;s Daily Telegraph said that to &#8220;miss the significance&#8221; of the US position would be a &#8220;grave misjudgment&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b1936.0\/4\">That brings me to China. While we should seek ways to engage with China, I am concerned that the report&#8217;s summary paragraph underestimates the serious dangers posed by China&#8217;s increasingly aggressive behaviour on the world stage combined with its increasingly repressive behaviour towards its own people. Consider, for instance, China&#8217;s influence on the UN and specifically the bodies and mechanisms focusing on the promotion and protection of human rights. In its report The Costs of International Advocacy, Human Rights Watch says:<\/p><p pid=\"b1936.0\/5\">&#8220;China has worked consistently and often aggressively to silence criticism of its human rights record before UN bodies ... the stakes of such interventions go beyond how China&#8217;s own human rights record is addressed at the UN and pose a longer-term challenge to the integrity of the system as a whole&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b1936.0\/6\">Human Rights Watch cites: cases of harassment and intimidation of UN officers, NGOs, and activists; efforts to weaken key human rights resolutions; and   opposition to any discussion of China&#8217;s own human rights record. In the Brookings Institution&#8217;s China&#8217;s Long Game on Human Rights at the United Nations, Ted Piccone warns that we are at,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1936.0\/7\">&#8220;the start of a more wholesale campaign to reshape the rules and instruments of the international human rights system&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b1936.0\/8\">More effort should be made to protect civil society organisations and activists, and to allow their safe participation at the UN. More effort should be made to radically reform the Security Council veto&#8212;a point referred to earlier in the debate by the noble Lord, Lord Bates. China&#8217;s threat to use the veto or to consider its use when looking at referrals to the International Criminal Court of countries like North Korea and Burma&#8212;I declare my interests as the co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on North Korea and as vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Burma&#8212;graphically illustrates how the rules-based international order, or at least the rule of law, can be so badly compromised.<\/p><p pid=\"b1936.0\/9\">All of this is happening when China&#8217;s own human rights situation is at a critical moment. Under Xi Jinping, we have seen a rapid and significant deterioration in political rights, in freedom of religion or belief and in freedom of expression. Those who defend these rights or question in any way the dominance of the party are subject to harassment, intimidation, arbitrary detention, torture and imprisonment. Thousands of lawyers, religious adherents, journalists, academics, labour activists and students have been targeted in this way. In the context of evolving UK-China relations, evidence given to the Select Committee highlights the need for the UK to remain committed to its own values and ideals. Carrie Gracie, the former China editor at the BBC, told the committee that it was,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1936.0\/10\">&#8220;very important to speak up for one&#8217;s values, assert where one&#8217;s red lines are and be firm about adhering to them, because one&#8217;s Chinese counterpart expects that&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b1936.0\/11\">One glaring example is that of the mass detention of over 1 million people in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. Normal life for Muslims has become impossible. An excellent briefing by CSW describes what it calls the,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1936.0\/12\">&#8220;already critical level of fear ... Disappearances can happen at any time, to any person, without warning. In such a climate of fear, many Uyghur Muslims have stopped public and communal religious observance and have broken off contact with relatives overseas&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b1936.0\/13\">Over Easter, I met a group of Uighurs. British citizens are among the many families whose relatives have disappeared into these camps. If the UK is to remain committed to its values, we must continue to speak up about the appalling situation in Xinjiang. If China fails to respect the rights of Muslims to live peaceably within its own borders, it will place at risk its own internal harmony and, overseas, its belt and road programmes.<\/p><p pid=\"b1936.0\/14\">I turn finally to Hong Kong, and I declare an interest as a patron of Hong Kong Watch. We must not forget the ongoing importance of the UK&#8217;s commitment to Hong Kong under the Sino-British joint declaration. Last month, I met two young graduates   who were among the 100,000 people who in early May joined protests against proposals to amend the city&#8217;s extradition laws. Hong Kong&#8217;s International Chamber of Commerce says that these will have an,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1936.0\/15\">&#8220;adverse impact on Hong Kong as a place to live and work, and to continue growing as a major international business center&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b1936.0\/16\">If we fail to act, we will be passive witnesses to the most grievous breach of the joint declaration since the handover. I hope that the Minister will make a clear statement on that in his remarks.<\/p><p pid=\"b1936.0\/17\">Not for the first time, the noble Lord, Lord Howell, has done us all a great service by giving us this opportunity to debate an important report. I join with others in expressing great admiration for his unstinting and sustained service to the House.<\/p>",

Unfortunately, I do not have much time these days to make a proper curry, but I remember it well.<\/p><p pid=\"a335.1\/3\">The Minister for Immigration said last month:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a335.1\/4\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;it would be unfair if certain applicants or routes benefited from free applications or reduced fees&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a335.1\/5\">at the expense of others. Such inflexibility does not reflect well on the Government. Veterans from the Commonwealth should not be prevented from settling in the UK, or forced into debt by ridiculous fees, which the Government should commit to abolishing. It is not up to them to get veterans into debt and not up to veterans&#8217; charities to help veterans pay the fees, which simply should not exist.<\/p><p pid=\"a335.1\/6\">We know that the Home Office is in need of drastic reform. The Minister has mentioned that he does not like talk of the hostile environment, so I will not refer to it directly, but I will say that we have had immigration scandals that have highlighted the deficiencies in our system. Scrapping the income requirements for Commonwealth armed forces personnel is an essential place to start. As I said at the start, it is a no-brainer.<\/p><p pid=\"a335.1\/7\">We have a debt of gratitude to the people who have chosen to serve. That, coupled with the positive contribution that Commonwealth veterans will make in our society, means we should ensure that indefinite leave to remain is granted without charge, for both personnel and their families. All of us here this afternoon are keen to hear how the Minister is collaborating with the Home Office to ensure that that takes place. I look forward to hearing his contribution and what positive steps are being taken to sort out this&#8212;I will not call it an injustice&#8212;serious issue for our Commonwealth personnel.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a296.2\/1\">Yes, I am. We need to go further. If any employers are not giving mothers breaks at work to breastfeed, they should change their practice. The hon. Lady is right to raise that issue.<\/p><p pid=\"a296.2\/2\">As children&#8217;s lives go on, the problem gets worse. When children start primary school, 10% are obese, but when they leave at the age of 11, 20% are obese. A quarter of all children starting primary school are overweight or obese, yet one third are when they leave.   Cancer Research UK and others have said that, based on present trends, half all children in the UK are set to be overweight or obese by 2020.<\/p><p pid=\"a296.2\/3\">Sadly, obese children are five times more likely to remain obese as adults, and therefore more likely to have diabetes, cancer, heart or liver conditions, or perhaps mental health conditions associated with those issues. There are 3.1 million people with diabetes. That has gone up from 2.4 million in 2010. Every week in this country we amputate around 170 lower limbs due to diabetes. That is 9,000 a year. People are having their feet or lower legs cut off because their diabetes has got so bad. That should shame us; it is an appalling state of affairs, and the number has gone up from 7,200 amputations in 2010. The trajectory is getting worse.<\/p><p pid=\"a296.2\/4\">Our food sector is not working in the way it should. We know from the work of the Food Foundation and others that unhealthy food is on average three times cheaper than healthy food. Let me put that the other way around: healthy food is three times more expensive than unhealthy food. That is simply not good enough. People in poverty and those with low incomes will buy what they can afford. If they are forced to buy unhealthy food, children set off on the wrong trajectory, which is why being obese and overweight is a huge social justice issue. For the first time in our nation&#8217;s history, the poorest are the most overweight and obese. That should set red lights flashing across Whitehall that our food policy is not working.<\/p><p pid=\"a296.2\/5\">In most constituencies, fast food outlets, many of which unfortunately do not sell the healthy food they should, average about a quarter of all places to buy food. The figure varies from only 7% in the Isles of Scilly to 39% in Blackburn with Darwen, where nearly four in 10 food outlets are fast food outlets, selling primarily unhealthy food.<\/p><p pid=\"a296.2\/6\">The UK does badly internationally, too. I am grateful for the research from the Guy&#8217;s and St Thomas&#8217; Charity in its report &#8220;Bite Size&#8221;, which came out a couple of months ago. It compared London with capital cities around the world for childhood obesity rates. It is not  a happy story. In Paris, 5% of children are obese; in Hong Kong, it is 7%; in Sydney, it is 10%; in Tokyo, it is 12%; in New York, it is 21%; and in London, it is 22%. We are worse than New York for childhood obesity, and more than four times worse than Paris, which is just the other side of the channel.<\/p><p pid=\"a296.2\/7\">There is a particularly European dimension to the problem. I will not talk about Brexit, but about what is happening with food policy in Europe. I am grateful to the Food Foundation for its &#8220;Broken Plate&#8221; report, which came out a couple of months ago. In that, a lady called Kathleen Kerridge wrote:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a296.2\/8\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Across mainland Europe, cheap foods are healthy choices. It&#8217;s sensible that a kilo of tomatoes should be cheaper than a kilo of sausages. In the UK, however, the opposite is true&#8221;&#8212;<\/p><p pid=\"a296.2\/9\">or it is often true. Why is that the case? She goes on to state:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a296.2\/10\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;I would like to see the UK take note of the European model. I think with food education and more affordable fresh produce, we could turn the tide for the poorest households and see us all eating &#8216;well&#8217;.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a296.2\/11\">I have considerable issues with the food industry in this country. I commend the work of the Obesity Health Alliance in calling for the 9 pm watershed and for  restrictions on multi-buy promotions, both of which the Government are consulting on. That is excellent, but we need to get through the consultation and take action. As the Obesity Health Alliance says, these are serious and important issues.<\/p><p pid=\"a296.2\/12\">Let me give praise where praise is due. One supermarket in Europe is doing the right thing&#8212;the Dutch retail chain Marqt, which operates 16 stores in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Haarlem in the Netherlands. It has become the first chain in the Netherlands to ban the marketing of unhealthy foods to children. Its chief executive Joost Leeflang said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a296.2\/13\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Marqt helps consumers choose products that are produced with respect for people, animals and environment and this includes helping customers make healthier choices.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a296.2\/14\">He went on to say:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a296.2\/15\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Tempting children to choose unhealthy products doesn&#8217;t fit with how we want to help our customers.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a296.2\/16\">Mr Leeflang is a private sector entrepreneur running a business, and he is appealing to people&#8217;s better instincts&#8212;to parents to do the right thing for their children. Frankly, if he can do it, I want to lay down that challenge before the supermarkets and fast food outlets up and down this country. If it can happen in the Netherlands, it can happen here.<\/p><p pid=\"a296.2\/17\">As a member of the Health Committee, I went to Amsterdam, where the deputy mayor, Eric van der Burg, a centre-right politician, has brought in a major, city-wide programme to deal with obesity. That meant having free water available in schools&#8212;the hon. Member for Bristol East is absolutely right about that. In fact, only water is allowed to be drunk in schools there. That meant educating the parents, helping low-income and immigrant communities to learn to cook properly and banning the advertising of unhealthy foods on the metro. It is a city-wide approach that is producing results, as is happening in Leeds&#8212;encouragingly, we learnt last week that the poorest children are starting to lose weight the fastest. There is hope that lessons from Amsterdam are coming over to the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a296.2\/18\">I hear what the hon. Lady says about people living in food poverty. We have to make sure that people have enough income to eat properly. We need what I would call prosperity with a purpose and inclusive growth&#8212;there is no point running a free market system that does not benefit the people working in it. That has to be part of what we are about; it is what I am about, and I know it is what the Minister is about in his role in Government.<\/p><p pid=\"a296.2\/19\">There is more we can do. We could learn from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme in the United States, which gives vouchers for farmer&#8217;s markets in the USA. I have farmer&#8217;s markets in towns in my constituency, which often provide lower cost, healthy food. We need more of that. Let us look around the world and take best practice. Let us not just leave this issue to the free market alone. Let us encourage the people who are doing the right thing, such as Mr Leeflang in the Netherlands, and encourage UK retailers to follow his excellent example.<\/p>",

That is extremely concerning. Over the weekend, we learned that the Cabinet Secretary is leading his own mission to Beijing, with 15 permanent secretaries. That is a huge mission to take to Beijing. I hope the Minister will tell us whether he is in agreement with the Cabinet Secretary that we need long-term engagement, or whether he thinks, like the former Defence Secretary, that we need to be much more cautious. What precisely is the Government&#8217;s position?<\/p><p pid=\"b259.1\/3\">The right hon. Member for West Dorset took a surprisingly relativist view. I thought that we were all western liberal democrats and that, as a western liberal democrat, it was completely respectable to stand up for those values, promote them and try to get other people in other countries to share and adopt them. I would point out two things to him. First, the Chinese have signed up to quite a lot of the big United Nations international treaties that were written in that framework. They did not have to sign them; they chose to sign them. Therefore, when discussing human rights in China, Myanmar or anywhere else, it is reasonable to hold other members of the Security Council to those standards.<\/p><p pid=\"b259.1\/4\">Secondly, of course, it is true that we cannot force China to change and that we might be alarmed by what is going on in Washington. However, the best way to resolve such potential conflicts between large countries is to uphold the international rules-based order. That is the way to resolve such difficulties. Another question for the Minister, therefore, is about where the Government stand on the trade dispute between China and the USA, because that is a sort of proxy for future disputes and conflicts.<\/p><p pid=\"b259.1\/5\">I also ask the Minister, as the Foreign Affairs Committee did, exactly what the Government&#8217;s position is on the South China sea problem, and how they see us moving forward. It is right to uphold the international law of the sea, and we should be doing that, but I want to know what the Government see as their legal base and what their intention is.<\/p><p pid=\"b259.1\/6\">The belt and road initiative has an upside, as my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Faisal Rashid\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25700\">the Member for Warrington South (Faisal Rashid)<\/phrase> said, but it has problems as well. Where do the Government stand? Are they with Christine Lagarde? Does the Minister agree that China has problems with environmental standards and with how it puts a lot of debt on to other countries in pursuit of the initiative? If he is worried, what are the Government going to do about it?<\/p><p pid=\"b259.1\/7\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Fiona Bruce\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24857\">The hon.

Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Yasmin Qureshi\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24775\">the Member for Bolton South East (Yasmin Qureshi)<\/phrase> were absolutely right to raise human  rights issues. To put another question to the Government, what will they do about the undermining of the civil rights of people in Hong Kong, where the Government have a legal position?<\/p><p pid=\"b259.1\/8\">I am afraid that my conclusion is that we need a policy&#8212;China is a big, important country&#8212;so let us hear from the Minister what it is.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a468.3\/1\">It is a particular pleasure to serve under your chairmanship today, Mr Gapes. Your contribution to the Foreign Affairs Committee over the past 20 years has been truly exemplary, and indeed, your contribution to this report is one of the reasons why it was such a success. I am very glad that you are chairing this hearing.<\/p><p pid=\"a468.3\/2\">Today, the Foreign Affairs Committee published its report on China and the rules-based international system. We worked on this inquiry for more than a year, including a trip to China to understand how the UK was seen from a Chinese perspective. As ever, we are very grateful to many people who submitted evidence to us, and especially to those who gave oral evidence, including the former Prime Minister of Australia, Kevin Rudd.<\/p><p pid=\"a468.3\/3\">China is seeking a role in the world commensurate with its growing economic power, and the UK should welcome its desire to take part in global governance. We do not believe that China wants to jeopardise the benefits that it has reaped from a stable, rules-based international system. However, it has consolidated power in the hands of the Communist party under President Xi, and the UK&#8217;s China strategy needs to reflect that. On many issues, China is a viable partner for the United Kingdom. The threat that environmental degradation, for example, poses to the Communist party&#8217;s legitimacy has led China to join international efforts on climate change and sustainability.<\/p><p pid=\"a468.3\/4\">However, on other issues that China perceives as challenging its domestic control, such as global initiatives on human rights and free societies, it has opposed international approaches. It is appropriate that this statement follows one from the Select Committee on Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, given how many of the concerns we considered overlap with that Committee&#8217;s work.<\/p><p pid=\"a468.3\/5\">Indeed, in the area of human rights, the evidence suggests that China does not intend to reform the rules-based international system. Rather, it intends to subvert it by promoting an alternative version of human rights that stresses economic development at the cost of the universality of individual civil and political freedoms. In our report, we urge the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to increase its efforts to hold China to account for its human rights violations by using UN mechanisms, public statements and private diplomacy.<\/p><p pid=\"a468.3\/6\">During the inquiry, we also heard troubling allegations of Chinese attempts to interfere in the UK&#8217;s domestic affairs. The openness of the UK&#8217;s political system and society is a fundamental source of our strength. However, in the face of an autocratic state seeking to increase its influence abroad, that openness can also be a source of vulnerability. The UK needs to decide how to draw the line between legitimate attempts to exercise influence and illegitimate attempts at interference. It is a topic that we on the Foreign Affairs Committee will be looking at further in our new inquiry into autocracies and UK foreign policy.<\/p><p pid=\"a468.3\/7\">The Committee also noted its concern about the Chinese Government&#8217;s approach to Hong Kong. The Sino-British joint declaration on Hong Kong is a legally binding international treaty registered at the UN. It is of great importance to UK national interests and the health of the rules-based international system. China&#8217;s adherence to the letter and spirit of the declaration is a key test of the sincerity of its commitment to global governance. We were therefore deeply concerned by evidence that Hong Kong&#8217;s autonomy is at risk, especially in the area of the rule of law. We are concerned that the Chinese Government are moving away from an approach of &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; towards &#8220;one country, one system&#8221;. We therefore urge the UK Government to continue to raise concerns about Hong Kong publicly and privately with the Hong Kong authorities.<\/p><p pid=\"a468.3\/8\">We support the Government&#8217;s efforts to increase the UK&#8217;s presence in the Indo-Pacific&#8212;including its military presence&#8212;in line with its capacity and other defence commitments. The region is vital for global trade and home to a number of UK partners and allies. Communication about those efforts is crucial. Poorly communicated military deployments in the Indo-Pacific could be perceived or depicted by China as a crude attempt to contain the expansion of its influence.<\/p><p pid=\"a468.3\/9\">The UK should focus instead on core principles, including freedom of navigation, the rights of states&#8212;including China&#8217;s neighbours&#8212;to form and maintain alliances of their choosing, and the importance of a balanced and consensual regional security order. We urge the Government to ensure that initiatives to expand the UK&#8217;s military presence in the Indo-Pacific are explained with reference to those principles.<\/p><p pid=\"a468.3\/10\">China&#8217;s belt and road initiative&#8212;perhaps the most famous and well-known aspect of its foreign policy&#8212;is likely to have geopolitical effects that are as important as, and potentially more important than its economic impact. That Chinese-led investment in foreign countries, and in developing countries in particular, need not conflict with British interests. Asia&#8217;s infrastructure gap is real, and exporting the fruits of China&#8217;s spectacular growth could be a way to close that gap while addressing China&#8217;s own economic needs. The UK should help China with that. It can gain economic benefits from doing so, including by focusing on areas in which the UK has particular value to offer, such as legal and financial services.<\/p><p pid=\"a468.3\/11\">However, in its current form, the belt and road initiative raises concerns in relation to UK interests. There is a risk that Chinese investment could encourage countries to strike deals that undermine international standards or that leave countries with unsustainable debt that undermines their political stability. The Government  should take a strictly case-by-case approach to assessing belt and road projects and refrain from expressing a view on the initiative as a whole.<\/p><p pid=\"a468.3\/12\">For the UK to come up with a comprehensive strategy to guide its relationship with China, it will need to answer some key questions. What are the drivers of Chinese foreign policy? What are the major goals of UK policy towards China? What is the bottom line of UK interests, values and national security considerations on which we are not prepared to compromise?<\/p><p pid=\"a468.3\/13\">The UK&#8217;s approach to China reflects an unwillingness to face the reality of China&#8217;s strategic direction. Building a deeper partnership with China is still desirable, but we must recognise that there are hard limits to what co-operation can achieve and that the values and interests of the Chinese Communist party, and therefore the Chinese state, are often very different from those of the United Kingdom. In the report, we call for the Government to produce a single public document that defines its China strategy, crafted through a cross-Government process directed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. That chimes with findings emerging from all the substantial inquiries we have undertaken.<\/p><p pid=\"a468.3\/14\">The FCO has a diminished grip on our Government&#8217;s international strategy. It needs to reassert itself as the focal point for that strategy and regain some of its self-confidence and authority. Without a comprehensive approach, the UK risks prioritising economic considerations over its other interests, its values and national security. A constructive, positive UK relationship with China is possible and desirable, but it will require strategy, rigour and unity in place of hope and muddling through.<\/p>",

This SI represents a significant change, not just in our relationship with Europe, but as far as our industrial potential is concerned.<\/p><p pid=\"b1554.0\/2\">For too long, this country has given away to, or allowed takeovers of its major industrial production by, foreign Governments. At the time of nationalisation, back in 1948, there were more than 150 railway workshops in this country. Those of us of a certain age are familiar with seeing that &#8220;Made in Britain&#8221; sign in railway industries in other parts of the world&#8212;for example, on locomotives, rolling stock and signalling systems. I was in Hong Kong in the 1970s. The new rapid transit system there depended on the expertise of GEC Alsthom, which built the first trains for that system in Birmingham. Yet we have thrown away all that expertise and allowed foreign companies to take over our industrial production.<\/p><p pid=\"b1554.0\/3\">This SI will make matters worse. If we are to have different standards from EU&#8212;that will happen over the years&#8212;the ever-smaller market of the United Kingdom will continue to shrink. Even as we speak, the signalling systems in Europe are being unified. The French and German Governments have just refused&#8212;temporarily, I suspect&#8212;the amalgamation of two major signalling production companies to create, in effect, a European monopoly on signalling. Again, if this SI goes through, our prospects of competing in these areas will be diminished. That is what it means.<\/p><p pid=\"b1554.0\/4\">We are moving away from the European railway agency&#8212;the ERA&#8212;and placing these decisions in the hands of the Department for Transport and the Secretary of State. The Minister will be relieved to know that I will not indulge in any knockabout about the current Secretary of State; after all, even with his powers of survival, I cannot see him being in the department much longer. We are moving away from European standards and allowing him, or some other Secretary of State, to decide standards for rolling stock and railway materials more generally in this country. That is what we are doing. That is how significant this SI is.<\/p><p pid=\"b1554.0\/5\">I indicated earlier that there were more than  150 workshops in this country at the time of nationalisation. There were 52 at the time of privatisation. There is a small handful of them now, all of which are foreign-owned. People do not invest in this country because they love the British; they do so for various financial reasons. If we are to reduce our market in the way that this SI will, those companies could decide that it is not worth investing in the United Kingdom in the long term and move elsewhere. That is how significant this SI is. I do not know what the Minister can do other than adopt the associate membership my noble friend Lord Berkeley talked about, but I regret that this Motion is not fatal. Unless the Minister can satisfy us and assuage our very real fears, this barmy piece of legislation ought to be resisted.<\/p>",

We have to admire the tenacity of the Attorney-General in refusing to temper his original note of <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2019-12-03\">3 December<\/phrase>, despite the overwhelming political pressure on him to do so. He has said, in terms, that his professional reputation as a lawyer is far more important to him than his reputation as a politician. He advised in December that the Northern Ireland backstop is intended by all parties to be temporary, and the assumption is that it will be superseded by a relationship agreement between Brussels and London. In the absence of such an agreement, the backstop is intended to endure. He said that the solution in such a scenario would be political and not legal.<\/p><p pid=\"d852.0\/2\">This has not been sufficient for the Brexiteers. Their view, as expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, in his inimitable way, is that the European Union is a continuing conspiracy to hold the United Kingdom fast within its grasp. Their demands are for a time limit to the backstop or a unilateral exit route. The alternative arrangements they also propose would involve the development of a technology that does not exist, or at least does not operate satisfactorily, anywhere in the world. They demonstrate a complete lack of trust in the European Union. Similarly, the DUP. That party, which does not represent the majority view in Northern Ireland, seems totally incapable of perceiving the potential economic benefit to that Province if it were able to trade directly and freely in a customs union and single market with the EU and at the same time have direct and free access to the UK. Instead of promoting the positives, they mouth with suspicion the negatives.<\/p><p pid=\"d852.0\/3\">So Mr Cox was sent off to negotiate legally binding clauses to add to the Northern Ireland protocol. This shows a gratifying, if unexpected, trust in the legal  profession and the judiciary. Lawyers, under this plan, would determine when the backstop has served its purpose&#8212;a massive decision with implications for the people of this country. Yet, in the absence of political agreement, it is seriously proposed that lawyers should be instrumental in prising open the economic, social and legal ties which have bound us together with the EU for more than 40 years. The withdrawal agreement provides for an arbitration process, but that model was apparently not sufficient. If a decision cannot be agreed in the joint political committee, the issue, under the withdrawal agreement, goes to a panel of five arbitrators, but any issue as to the interpretation of EU law must be referred to the European Court of Justice. Of course, for reasons I have never been able fully to fathom, the European court is anathema to the Brexiteers as a matter of faith, although the United Kingdom has the best record of success in that court of any EU country.<\/p><p pid=\"d852.0\/4\">No matter&#8212;Mr Cox has done his ingenious best. It seems he has proposed a separate arbitration panel, with no access to the European court, to decide when the backstop has served its purpose. The membership we do not know, but let us assume it is similar to the panel agreed in the withdrawal Agreement. He has rightly conceded that it cannot be the purpose of lawyers, however eminent, to determine whether the sovereign United Kingdom or the EU and its sovereign states are acting in bad faith. Unless you are a truly head-banging conspiracy theorist, you cannot expect a panel of arbitrators to determine that a sovereign state, in legitimately pursuing its own interests as it sees them, is acting in bad faith.<\/p><p pid=\"d852.0\/5\">Mr Cox sought therefore to introduce the Brussels negotiators to the concept of &#8220;the reasonable man&#8221;&#8212;the man on the Clapham omnibus. That is a legal tag which has done the rounds in the field of the law of negligence in every common law country&#8212;it recently surfaced in Hong Kong as the &#8220;man on the Shau Kei Wan tram&#8221;. The issue he proposed for the arbitrators to decide was whether the UK would be acting &#8220;reasonably&#8221; if it sought to terminate the backstop.<\/p><p pid=\"d852.0\/6\">The arbitrators would not be concerned with construing a difficult line of legal text but with deciding a question of opinion: is the UK, or the EU, acting &#8220;reasonably&#8221; in accordance with the standards of the man on the Clapham omnibus? I do not knock the Clapham omnibus; the No. 87 bus which runs from Westminster to Clapham has many distinguished regular passengers, not just myself and my noble friend Lady Walmsley, but the noble Lords, Lord Faulkner of Worcester and Lord Cope, the noble Baronesses, Lady Gale and Lady Morris, and, above all, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach&#8212;although he generally does not go much beyond the Tate Gallery. It would be very hard for arbitrators and lawyers in Brussels or elsewhere to guess what we on the 87 bus collectively thought was reasonable. Hence, I regret to say that terms such as &#8220;crazy&#8221; and &#8220;bizarre&#8221; have been reported from the EU side on its introduction to this entertaining concept invented by a Victorian judge.<\/p><p pid=\"d852.0\/7\">The plane was standing by at Northolt, and may have taken off, but what possible gain can there be for the Prime Minister to plead with Mr Barnier to repeat  for the umpteenth time that the backstop is intended by the EU as well as the UK to be temporary? Why do not the ERG, the DUP and sundry other leavers take him at his word? Can diplomacy exist at all in the world without a measure of trust? Can there be compromise, as the noble Lord, Lord Howard, talked about, without trust? Mr Cox said in December that the solution as to when the backstop would end would be political and, of course, he was absolutely right. Let us leave it at that.<\/p>",

Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker)<\/phrase>. When he said, &#8220;Where there&#8217;s a will there&#8217;s a way,&#8221; I thought he was going to get into the Brexit debate, like my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Sammy Wilson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11374\">the Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)<\/phrase>, and say, &#8220;If there&#8217;s a will, there&#8217;s a way,&#8221; and we hope that in the next few weeks we find that will from our negotiating partners and then find a way out, truly, of the EU. But I digress by straying on to the Brexit debate.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/2\">The debate on the Bill has largely been masked by the debate around RHI, and it would be remiss not to pass some comment on clause 1 and what has been achieved. My right hon. Friends the Members for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) and for Belfast North (Nigel Dodds) and my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Gavin Robinson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25280\">the Member for Belfast East (Gavin Robinson)<\/phrase> have been heavily engaged for the last number of weeks on that point. As has already been alluded to, we would have been facing a massive rates hike if it had not been for that negotiation. If only it had been the same for the second part of the Bill: that we had had early sight of it and could discuss and challenge and probe and therefore see a much more beneficial change than the one that has come forward on RHI. We must, however, congratulate our colleagues on their hard work in trying to significantly improve the rates issue.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/3\">The shadow Secretary of State, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Tony Lloyd\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10367\">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Tony Lloyd)<\/phrase>, made some very kind remarks about the situation in Ballymena. I believe that there is an agreement today to see new opportunities created there by USEL, an employer that has set up a site on the Woodside Road industrial estate, and that is leading directly to the employment of 60 new workers in the constituency. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the opening of that site because of duties here in Parliament, but I know that the Gallaher charitable trust, which I chair, led with key financial support to that building and that employer and that that has directly resulted in the employment of those people. Where did that charitable trust money come from? It is a legacy fund left over from when JTI Gallaher had to close its doors, and I am delighted that the first thing we have been able to do, through paying out money and resources, is to help to create 60 new jobs in the constituency. I hope that in the next few years we will see not only the charity that I chair but other employers adding to the local economy and creating new jobs and skills, leading to a revival in local employment.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/4\">I hope that the measures on the city deals will shortly come before the House, as they could apply very beneficially to the Mid and East Antrim Borough Council area, as could the Heathrow hub scheme. All those projects could see a huge increase in the employment and opportunities coming to my constituency, and I am delighted with the work that will be done in that regard. I want to ask the Secretary of State and her Minister to challenge Translink to hurry up and create more orders for the local bus building company in my constituency. It is great to see it getting orders from places all over the world, including Latin America and Hong Kong, but I would love to see more orders coming through to it from Translink, and I encourage the Secretary of State to push for those orders to come forward.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/5\">We now have to turn to the perplexing issue of the renewable heat incentive. The shadow Secretary of State was absolutely right to say that we are being presented with an amalgamation of two Bills. That is wrong; there should be a stand-alone piece of legislation on the RHI, because it is so controversial and far-reaching, and because the consequences of the issue will be felt by a lot of people in Northern Ireland for a very long time&#8212;indeed, probably for the next 20 years. Instead, these measures have just been stapled on to the back of this Bill, and we are now being expected to nod it through without serious, appropriate scrutiny. I do not believe in nodding through legislation; nor do I believe in the emergency process by which we are taking through this legislation. Northern Ireland deserves better, and this House has to demonstrate to Northern Ireland that we are going to give it better.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/6\">Officials in Northern Ireland have handed us these proposals, and I believe that they think we should accept them without challenge or scrutiny. That would be wrong, because it would be unfair on the people we represent. I think that people will understand and accept our caution, given that these are the very same officials who brought forward the first flawed scheme. We are now expected to accept the evidence they are giving us today as being good, beneficial, tested and rigorous and to accept that it will be all right on the night. That is not the case, however, because there are flaws in what is being put to us, and even in the manner in which it is being put to us, and they should be properly challenged.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/7\">Those in the Department are privately telling us that they would welcome the opportunity for further scrutiny. They do not want the debacle of the past to happen again; they want to learn from the mistakes of the past, rather than to repeat them. I believe that any such extra scrutiny would be very beneficial. A new clause has been tabled to the Bill&#8212;it stands in the name of the Chairman of the Northern Ireland Committee, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Andrew Murrison\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11132\">the hon. Member for South West Wiltshire (Dr Murrison)<\/phrase>, and several other Members from across the House&#8212;and I hope that the Deputy Speaker will be kind enough to select it and allow us to debate that issue properly.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/8\">Two wrongs never make a right. The obvious historical problems with the RHI tariff are the subject of an ongoing inquiry, and it would not be right to press those matters here today. However, the future ought never to be held to ransom by the past. Unfortunately, the Bill that the Secretary of State has brought to us today will hold the future of the RHI to ransom because of what has happened in the past, and that is wrong. We need to treat people fairly and honestly going forward.  No matter what the RHI inquiry throws up, that will have to be dealt with on its own terms, we have a duty and a responsibility to treat the RHI owners in a way that is respectful, honest and fair, and equitable with the rest of the United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/9\">Everyone can look at the measures and the proposed cuts in support&#8212;from as much as &#163;13,000 to about &#163;2,000 per annum&#8212;and then at those same people who have bank loans signed up to on the basis of the original business plans and legal arguments. The banks, however, will not go back on the original plans. They will not say, &#8220;We&#8217;ll just forgive all that debt; it&#8217;s all over.&#8221; Banks do not operate like that, and why should they? They were given business plans guaranteed by the Government&#8212;legal guarantees&#8212;and they expect people to honour the payments agreed.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/10\">The Government have to accept that the way in which the issue has been brought forward tonight is not fair to 2,020 boiler owners in Northern Ireland. The vast majority of them, as the hon. Member for Gedling said, have done nothing wrong; they followed the rules, totally and absolutely, yet tonight they are being held to ransom by the system. Most of those RHI users are not abusers of the system, but they will all be punished by the system that is to be introduced now. Again, that is grossly unfair.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/11\">People can look across the channel to see the English system, or south to see the RHI system that has been proposed but not yet introduced in the Republic of Ireland, where support will be significantly higher than even here on the British mainland. The Bill will not only punish but in effect end for the next 20 years all renewable energy plans and damage forever anyone who claims a copper-bottomed guarantee from the Government, no matter the shade of that Government, because they will look back at this scheme and say, &#8220;Look how we were done over, treated shabbily and given no answers to our questions. This will lead us to a situation in which we are treated badly.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/12\">Today, I tabled questions about levels of support and Barnett consequentials for RHI payments in both Scotland and Wales. The proposals in the Republic of Ireland will be so much more generous even than what will be made available here in England, as well as in Scotland and Wales. The only part of the United Kingdom that will therefore be treated unfairly is Northern Ireland. The cuts are to the bone, and through it.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/13\">The argument presented by the Department yesterday in a 15-minute presentation was that this would stop a breach of state aid rules. That simply is not good enough. We have to be given more substance and the legal arguments to demonstrate the precise nature of those state aid requirements, which do not appear to apply to another European Union member state&#8212;namely, the Republic of Ireland&#8212;or to the rest of the United Kingdom or any of its regions, whether Scotland, Wales or England. State aid rules are supposed to apply in the same way, yet Northern Ireland has been singled out to be treated differently.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/14\">The Department has a duty to make the case in public. It and the Secretary of State cannot give a 15-minute briefing to the shadow Secretary of State or us as Members of Parliament in a conference, and then expect us to sell it to the public. Do they think we are mad? That is not acceptable. The Department has a duty to stand up in public and to defend itself. Will the  Secretary of State make herself and officials available to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee for us ask them the difficult questions? Let us at least have the opportunity to put those questions to the Secretary of State, because so far today we have had no answers to any questions.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/15\">For example, how did the Department come to the figure for the average cost of boilers in Northern Ireland? What was the basis on which that was done? The Department has given us a figure for the average cost, and are we just to accept it? We are not equipped to challenge that figure unless we see the evidence, but we are not allowed to see that evidence. We are just told that we have to accept it. We have the great sword of Damocles hanging over us, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t accept it by the end of the month, farmers will not be paid.&#8221; Blackmail is all that is, and it is wrong.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/16\">What is excluded from the cost assumptions in Northern Ireland? Are those same exclusions made to the cost assumptions here in England? We did not get any of that answer. We asked three or four times during the 15-minute presentation, and there were raised eyebrows, buts and tuts, and, &#8220;Ask someone down the video line. He might be able to tell you.&#8221; We were not able to confirm whether the &#163;2,500 plumbing costs or the &#163;1,000 electrical costs are included in the English scheme but excluded from the Northern Ireland scheme. If so, why? If they are, I am not the one to sell it to the general public in Northern Ireland on the basis of a 15-minute presentation; it is up to the Department to sell it.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/17\">When a person applies for one of these boilers, they have to seek planning permission, which is a costly exercise. They have to pay a lawyer and, usually, an architect. Is all that included in the English scheme but excluded from the Northern Ireland scheme? Apparently, it is included in the English scheme but excluded from the Northern Ireland scheme. If it is excluded from one on the basis that it is against state aid rules, I can tell the House there is an express train coming down the tracks towards those who try to include it in the English scheme. We have to address those issues.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/18\">Do the cost assumptions differ from what is permitted in England? If so, why do they differ? The Department and, indeed, the Secretary of State need to answer that question. If 12% is the rate of return, why can the rest of the UK work on a rate of return of between 8% and 23%, as my right hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim said? Why is there that differential? We were given an excuse yesterday. We were told 16 times that the European official had told the Department for the Economy that it could not move from 12%. Why can it not move from 12%? It is up to the Department to reveal the answer, if it has one. Why should I go out and sell it to my constituents when the Department told me that Europe has said it cannot do it? That might have been all right for the past 40 years, but from <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2019-03-29\">29 March<\/phrase> it will not be acceptable. Europe cannot tell us all those things, and it is therefore wrong, 23 days before we leave, that the EU is allowed to hold us to ransom on that point.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/19\">When we ask whether the state aid rules will still apply after <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2019-03-29\">29 March<\/phrase>, some lawyers say they will and others say they will not. Why should I make the case in public? It is up to departmental officials and the Secretary of State to make the case, and they have to answer those  questions. Officials say that the EU does not allow them to stray from 12%. Why is that the case? A judicial review was lodged this morning, and the appeal will be heard in April. Is it really appropriate for us to change the tariff about 30 days before that judicial review hearing? I do not believe it is. I think that in itself could constitute knowledge that we were doing something wrong, and I think the Department needs to move.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/20\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Alistair Carmichael\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10785\">The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)<\/phrase> made the point well that the buy-out scheme is an admission that this scheme is flawed. If that is the case, the Government will pay out even more compensation if it goes to judicial review. Will the state aid rules apply after <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2019-03-29\">29 March<\/phrase>?<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/21\">If we were successful in voting against the Bill tonight, would the payments stop on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2019-04-01\">1 April<\/phrase>? The Secretary of State made that case. When we asked yesterday for evidence to back it up, we were told that it is just a legal opinion, but that legal opinion is being tested in the courts today because there is another equally valid legal opinion saying that it is a wrongful interpretation. We will know the outcome in the first or second week of April.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/22\">All those questions need to be answered in advance of our taking a decision. We are not being given the proper time to scrutinise this properly. It is little wonder that we have been inundated by calls, emails and personal visits from hundreds of constituents, businesses and farm families who are affected because this touches more than 2,000 owners in Northern Ireland. If those businesses go out of existence, that would be the equivalent of 60,000 or more small businesses closing here on the British mainland. That perhaps gives a sense of the proportion of what has been affected; we are talking about tens of thousands of families who would be affected if this was transferred over here. We have to address that matter properly. The Department has a duty to make that case in public. It is not our duty to make the case for it, because it is sitting on the evidence. I would therefore welcome the opportunity to scrutinise it properly; the Secretary of State and officials should come before the Select Committee. They should make themselves available instead of expecting us to nod this matter through.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/23\">I agree that if Stormont was in place tonight, this debate would be better placed there&#8212;that is where it should be taking place&#8212;but we have to deal with the cards as they are currently, and Stormont is not in place. It would therefore be a dereliction of our duty to do this in what we would describe locally as a &#8220;half-baked way&#8221;. Frankly, what we are doing here tonight is half-baked; this is not proper scrutiny, with Parliament at its best, but Parliament doing something and taking shortcuts. That will result in problems down the line. I fear that in a matter of months something will come out and people will say, &#8220;You really should not have taken that decision on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2019-03-06\">6 March<\/phrase> 2019. It was a huge mistake.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/24\">We are therefore right to be cautious about supporting this part of the Government&#8217;s proposal tonight. This House has a duty to carry out scrutiny, in the absence of the Assembly, and to do it properly. The Department, whenever we met its representatives, outlined how it came to its calculations, but the only conclusions I can draw is that if the Department for the Economy is right in what it has told us, the scheme currently operating here in England is unlawful. If that is the case, an even bigger question is raised. I have asked that very question  of officials and looked at their answer. If officials know that that system was unlawful, they are on notice today that they had knowledge of it and, in effect, they let us know that they had knowledge of an unlawful system operating on the mainland. If that is the case, the scheme being proposed for the Republic of Ireland would, similarly, be unlawful under state aid rules. So the Government have a duty to allow us to scrutinise this properly. I welcome the fact that an amendment has been tabled, which we will get to debate later, and I hope the Government will be able to concede some of the points we have put to them and that we will be able to address those issues fairly.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/25\">I wish to end my remarks by referring to a couple of emails that I have received out of those from the hundreds of people who have been in touch with us. Whenever we boil things down the actual person and family involved, we actually see what is happening. Jacqui and Thomas are from a farm family in my constituency. They said that the Department for the Economy has been &#8220;ignoring&#8221; them for months. They said that they have been emailing the Department, trying to make contact with it and sending it their questions about these matters when the consultation originally came out, but it has been ignoring &#8220;genuine RHI users&#8221;. Jacqui says:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1034.0\/26\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;I totally object to be financially punished for adhering to the requirements of the Scheme and blame this department for putting my farming business at risk.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/27\">That will have been repeated up and down the country, not just in my constituency, but across County Tyrone and in all of County Antrim, where we a major food producer for these islands.<\/p><p pid=\"c1034.0\/28\">We must remember that this is largely about producing poultry that is sold in supermarkets up and down the UK. Most of the poultry eaten on this side of the channel is grown in County Antrim and County Tyrone. If this puts farm businesses at risk, it damages our food security, our biosecurity and everything is now at risk. That is the consequence of what we are doing; it damages businesses and it damages what we actually feed to our children. So let us address it and address it properly.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in the debate, although, like many in the chamber, I wish that we did not have to have it. I find it deeply regrettable that we are in this situation. That our situation is regrettable was underscored for me yesterday when I visited St Benedict&#8217;s high school in Linwood, in my constituency. The young people I saw there are of a generation that will be deprived of opportunities and chances that my generation and preceding ones might have taken for granted. Nevertheless, when I engage with young people, I always seek to be positive and to discuss the future, regardless of the situations that we find ourselves in. Nothing affords that more than an opportunity to talk to a modern studies class.<\/p><p>Yesterday, when I spoke to the modern studies class in St Benedict&#8217;s high school, I was asked a range of questions, some of the which were about my personal background and some of which were about matters as trivial as the names of my pugs. However, one question floored me. I am often asked what the responsibilities of an MSP are and I am able to list them, but this time I was asked, &#8220;What is your biggest responsibility as an MSP?&#8221; That gave me pause for thought. What is the biggest responsibility of an MSP&#8212;we who are privileged to sit and stand at these desks in our national Parliament, who might be here for only a fleeting period?<\/p><p>I do not want to sound too grandiose in saying this, but I believe that our biggest responsibility is the duty to preserve and strengthen democracy, particularly as we find ourselves, at the end of this decade, in a world in which populism and even extremism are rearing their ugly features, whether we are talking about Trump in the United States, the Front National in France, Alternative f&#252;r Deutschland or the regimes that are currently in power in Poland and Hungary and the groups that are menacing democracies elsewhere across the continent.<\/p><p>When members of all parties speak of the importance of respecting the result in 2016, I take that very seriously. It is a well-made point. However, it is also a point that requires further discussion and debate. First, we have to ask ourselves why people voted to leave. Why did more than 17 million people in the UK&#8212;a majority in England, a majority in Wales and more than a third of our fellow Scots&#8212;choose to vote leave? I think that people did that for a number of reasons, but I suspect that only a very small number did it for ideological reasons in that they imagined the UK taking the role of a Hong Kong on steroids in the mid-Atlantic, as a buccaneering free-trade state. I also think that only a very small minority voted leave because they thought that regulations that are made in Europe impinge on their lives in a negative way. Rather, I believe that the driver of much of the leave vote, particularly in many communities in England, was the gross and entrenched economic and geographical inequalities that exist throughout the UK, with jobs lost over decades to globalisation and automation. There was also the persistent scapegoating of immigration by the right-wing tabloid press.<\/p><p>Legitimate and genuine sentiments of anger and frustration were hijacked and manipulated by a class of&#8212;frankly&#8212;Tory ideologues at Westminster, who have never reconciled themselves to the loss of an empire that predates their own births. That idea has been brilliantly explored and written about by the Irish writer and commentator Fintan O&#8217;Toole. What were people voting for if not for ideological purity or for the return of empire? I believe that, for many, it was about frustration. They wanted to send a message that they were tired of the inequality that persists in many parts of the UK and wanted something different. For those people, it was a vote for hope, as was the case for people who voted for Trump. I disagree with those people and I do not think that their vote will deliver what they wanted, but I accept that it was a vote for something. If we fail to understand that, we are in danger of not being able to address the fundamental issues and drivers that led people to vote leave.<\/p>",

Gentleman&#8217;s recognition.<\/p><p pid=\"a659.2\/2\">As we heard, the World Dog Alliance has called for an explicit ban on the consumption of dog meat in the UK and has stated exactly why that is necessary. It is acknowledged that the issue is not one that is predominant in the UK, and there is no tangible evidence of such consumption. However, in a recent campaign, the Humane Society International rescued more than 170 dogs from a dog meat farm in South Korea. It is estimated that South Korea has about 17,000 dog farms, breeding more than 2.5 million dogs a year for human consumption. Around the world, it is believed that approximately 30 million dogs are eaten annually.<\/p><p pid=\"a659.2\/3\">We heard from the hon. Member for Clacton that the Yulin festival takes place from 21 to <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2019-06-30\">30 June<\/phrase>. The lychee and dog meat festival is an annual 10-day event at which more than 10,000 dogs are eaten. Dog eating is traditional  in China where, according to folklore, eating the meat during the summer months brings luck and good health. We have heard about some of the abhorrent practices that exist.<\/p><p pid=\"a659.2\/4\">The hon. Member for Strangford is a vociferous campaigner on a great many issues. In fact, I cannot think of an issue about which he does not have something to say, which is quite impressive. His contribution was heartfelt, and so is his devotion to his own dogs&#8212;whether the collies, the Pomeranians or the Jack Russells. He said that dogs are often loved companions. They are not just family pets but part of our families. He highlighted the terrible conditions and practices, the abhorrent torture and animal cruelty, and the beliefs that fuel the trade in Asia. He called on the Government to set an international example.<\/p><p pid=\"a659.2\/5\">The hon. Member for Clacton made an impassioned contribution on this rather unlikely subject. He called for a comprehensive ban, and asked for DEFRA to review the matter. It is entirely reasonable that we call on the Government to do everything they can in this regard.<\/p><p pid=\"a659.2\/6\">It is accepted that this is not an issue in the UK, and that there is no evidence that dogs are being consumed here. However, we have heard that the US and other countries such as Germany, Austria, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Australia are leading by example, even though this is not necessarily an issue in many of them. Although the commercial trade in dog meat is illegal in the UK, it is clear that maintaining the highest standards of animal welfare ought to be our paramount consideration. The UK&#8217;s Farm Animal Welfare Committee currently advises DEFRA Ministers on this matter. I hope the Minister will consult it on this issue.<\/p><p pid=\"a659.2\/7\">Although many aspects of this issue still remain reserved to the UK, many are not. The Scottish Government have established a Scottish animal welfare commission. Like the UK&#8217;s Farm Animal Welfare Committee, it will form an animal expert advisory group that will advise on animal welfare, introducing new legislation, issuing Scottish Government guidance and public awareness campaigns. The Scottish Government have also committed to consult on amending the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006. That consultation ended in January 2019. The proposed changes to the 2006 Act include increasing the penalties for the most serious abuses of animals, including attacking emergency service animals. It will also include fixed penalty notices for lesser offences, and will create enforcement bodies to rehome and sell on animals seized when welfare is compromised. The Scottish Government are using the powers that they have to do as much as they can, including on animal welfare, improving conditions, providing CCTV in slaughterhouses, ensuring that domestic animal welfare is improved through licensing, and introducing licensing for animal sanctuaries, rehoming agencies and commercial breeders.<\/p><p pid=\"a659.2\/8\">It is essential that all Governments, including the Scottish Government and the UK Government, lead by example and do all they can for animal welfare. The international pressure that the Government can bring to bear on countries where this practice is prevalent is absolutely necessary. It could end the abhorrent practice of the consumption of dog meat. I hope the Minister will listen to the calls from across this House and see what more the UK Government can do in that regard.<\/p>",

In the Republic of Korea, dog meat is the fourth most consumed meat after pork, beef and chicken. More than 450 tonnes of dog meat were imported to Japan between 1997 and 2017. The dog slaughter industry is worth between $220 million and $273 million.<\/p><p pid=\"a1374.1\/4\">Eating dog meat has long-standing cultural significance in many east Asian countries, where many consumers believe it to have medicinal value and to bring good fortune, yet none of the alleged health benefits has any scientific basis. Instead, eating dog meat fuels an unspeakably cruel trade involving animal torture.<\/p><p pid=\"a1374.1\/5\">It may seem extraordinary, but consuming dog meat is currently not illegal in the UK. Luckily, there is no evidence that dogs are eaten in the UK yet, but due to the vile way in which dogs are treated in China, I would like our country to join in setting an example to the world. China argues that, until we make it illegal, why should they?<\/p><p pid=\"a1374.1\/6\">Two months ago, a ban on the human consumption of dog meat was passed in the United States, following Germany, Austria, South Australia, Taiwan and Hong Kong. This Bill is an opportunity for the UK Government to join those countries in introducing a ban, which  is particularly important as the conditions under which dogs are farmed, transported and slaughtered are deliberately cruel. It is believed that inflicting suffering raises an animal&#8217;s adrenaline levels, tenderising its meat and adding medicinal properties.<\/p><p pid=\"a1374.1\/7\">This Bill, therefore, is not just about consuming dogs but about the extra suffering and cruelty involved. Humane Society International, the animal protection organisation, has reported the appalling conditions to which dogs are subjected. Usually forced into tiny cages, many dogs suffer broken limbs as they are transported vast distances, often without food or water. Poor sanitation, parasite infestations and disease outbreaks spread quickly in crowded conditions.<\/p><p pid=\"a1374.1\/8\">A 2007 study by Vietnam&#8217;s National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology found that two in 10 sick dogs in Hanoi slaughterhouses were rabid. Some dogs are force-fed with a tube down their throat to boost their weight before slaughter. Nearly half the dogs die before reaching their final destination. Injured, dehydrated and exhausted, the dogs that are still alive face unspeakably cruel deaths. Routine methods of slaughter include bludgeoning, hanging, boiling, skinning and blow-torching alive. The dogs are then consumed.<\/p><p pid=\"a1374.1\/9\">The city of Yulin in China hosts an annual dog meat festival that is infamous for its inhumane slaughtering methods, which are practised at over 100 slaughter sites around the city, including crowded markets, in the streets and outside schools. The dogs, some of which  are puppies, are tortured and killed in front of each other. During the 10-day festival, 2,000 to 5,000 dogs are killed each day. Over 230 tonnes of dog meat are consumed each year at that festival alone. I hope the House would agree that the sheer scale, as well as the unnecessary cruelty, is truly shocking.<\/p><p pid=\"a1374.1\/10\">In the UK, we spend &#163;10 billion a year on our 8.9 million pet dogs. They provide companionship and love and, for many people, they are part of the family. Dogs are used by the police, our armed forces, in therapy and, of course, as guide dogs. Our laws usually reflect the respect that dogs deserve, and this Bill fits with our long and proud tradition of support for and insistence on the highest standards of animal welfare. As a nation of dog lovers and champions of animal protection, the UK must enact a ban on trading and consuming dog meat.<\/p><p pid=\"a1374.1\/11\">If the animal cruelty were not bad enough, the human suffering cannot go unnoticed. In China, an estimated 70% of dogs slaughtered for consumption are stolen pets. Anybody whose pet has gone missing knows the worry and fear for the future of their loved pet, the anguish and concern over what has happened, or simply having to wonder, &#8220;Where is my dog?&#8221; At least in the UK we know our missing dogs will not be eaten.<\/p><p pid=\"a1374.1\/12\">In China, dog-snatching gangs are hired by butchers to supply cheap animals. Increasingly bold, these gangs are often armed with machetes and Tasers. The dog meat trade normalises violence and fuels both animal and human abuse. For the sake of the tortured animals, the victims of crime and the exploited workers, it is vital that the UK takes steps to end this cruel industry.<\/p><p pid=\"a1374.1\/13\">In 2015, the World Dog Alliance organised a petition to urge the South Korean Government to act, and it received more than 100,000 signatures from UK citizens. In response, the South Korean Government closed the nation&#8217;s biggest dog meat market ahead of the 2018 winter Olympics. Fortunately, many countries recognise the value of contributing to this global effort, with the United States being the latest to introduce a ban. That  ban was passed two months ago, even though, like here, dog meat consumption is not a problem in America. Last week, a group of US Congressmen and former Representative Jeff Denham wrote directly to our Prime Minister urging the Government to introduce a ban, emphasising the need for an international condemnation of dog meat consumption.<\/p><p pid=\"a1374.1\/14\">I am proud to have campaigned for tougher sentences for animal cruelty, and I am proud that the mistreatment of animals in the UK, and across the globe, has always been an important concern of our Government. My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Giles Watling\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25644\">the Member for Clacton (Giles Watling)<\/phrase> has tabled an amendment to the Agriculture Bill that would enable the House to support the ban on consuming pets. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jim Shannon\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/13864\">The hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)<\/phrase> will introduce a Westminster Hall debate on this topic on Thursday.<\/p><p pid=\"a1374.1\/15\">It is helpful that this issue has support from MPs on both sides of the House, and it is certainly an issue that my constituents, and the wider population, care deeply about. I am sure that anyone who takes animal welfare seriously would join my colleagues and me in condemning the vile torture and slaughter of dogs. Making it an offence to consume dog meat, or to transport, possess or donate dog meat for the purpose of consumption, would highlight our country&#8217;s commitment to outlawing the practice globally and would cement the UK as a champion of animal welfare.<\/p><p pid=\"a1374.1\/16\">Question put and agreed to.<\/p><p pid=\"a1374.1\/17\">Ordered,<\/p><p pid=\"a1374.1\/18\">That Giles Watling, Andrew Rosindell, Dame Cheryl Gillan, Sir David Amess, Scott Mann, Mr Ian Liddell-Grainger, Daniel Kawczynski, Sir Henry Bellingham, Damien Moore, Royston Smith, Tracey Crouch and Bill Wiggin present the Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"a1374.1\/19\">Bill Wiggin accordingly presented the Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"a1374.1\/20\">Bill read the First time; to be read a Second time on Friday <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2019-03-22\">22 March<\/phrase>, and to be printed (Bill 337).<\/p>",

If he thinks that they are on that scale, I invite him to name one that might be worth &#163;1 billion, for example. I suspect that he will not be able to do so.<\/p><p pid=\"b2098.1\/2\">My noble friend went on to talk about equivalence, which is important and can be valuable; that is the substance of this SI. It is worth the House remembering that equivalent regulation is not as important as superior regulation. It is far more important for this country to have good regulation&#8212;that is, the best in the world, which is not to say the most detailed or intrusive regulation but effective, appropriate, not-too-onerous regulation that ensures good quality of business. That has been the City&#8217;s great strength over the years. Better regulation than other countries has often been more important than identical regulation. The Eurodollar market is in London, not New York, because of bad regulation in America: Regulation Q, or whatever it was, drove all the business out of America. Our success in the trade in German state bonds was because the majority of it took place in London, due to our regulatory system being superior to the Germans&#8217; before we introduced the single market and they had to improve theirs somewhat. Likewise, we carried out a high proportion of the trade in French equities because our regulatory system was superior, rather than identical, to that of France.<\/p><p pid=\"b2098.1\/3\">We should remember that the four great financial centres in the world&#8212;New York, Singapore, Hong Kong and London&#8212;all have something equivalent to each other and are great financial centres because they have in common common law and all the infrastructure built on that, such as legal and accounting processes, which make them flexible and desirable places to do business. In effect, they outpaced countries with different legal systems. We should welcome equivalence where appropriate but be very glad that we will not have to have regulation identical to that of our friends and partners on the continent. It is almost certainly beneficial to London to be a rule-maker, not a rule-taker.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a135.1\/1\">I thank all hon. Friends who have spoken in the debate and my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Bim Afolami\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25661\">the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Bim Afolami)<\/phrase> for raising this important issue. We both enjoyed careers in the City before coming to this place, and it sounds as though those late nights were worth it after all&#8212;he has been able to use his experience in this place. I have always thought that there are some similarities between working as a City lawyer and coming here: late nights, with difficult people, spent negotiating the finer details of agreements. We did usually get them over the line, so I hope that that turns out to be true here.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/2\">As my hon. Friend said&#8212;there has been wide agreement on this across the Chamber today&#8212;the UK&#8217;s financial services sector is an engine for the economy: it brings  prosperity and creates jobs and growth for citizens across the country. My hon. Friend said that it is a national asset. Actually, the argument that we have been making in our negotiations with our EU partners is that it is a European and international asset, which we all want to succeed. In the European context, a loss for London and the UK&#8212;with jobs and investment going to the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong or some of the emerging markets that hon. Members have mentioned&#8212;is as likely to be a loss for Europe as it is to be a loss merely for the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/3\">We do not believe that our strength is ours by right, as my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Bob Neill\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/13736\">the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)<\/phrase> made clear. We are operating in an unprecedentedly competitive global market and we have to ensure the future of the financial services sector. That will require a successful outcome in the EU negotiations. It will also require us to look to the future by embracing new technology and the opportunities that brings, and by embracing new markets.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/4\">The incredible contribution of the financial services sector to the economy has been mentioned. It contributed &#163;131 billion in 2017, including &#163;77 billion in exports, and there is room for more on that front. A number of colleagues have made the point well that the tax take was &#163;75 billion last year, which helped fund public services. The sector employs more than 1 million people in all parts of the United Kingdom, two-thirds of whom are outside London&#8212;a point made strongly by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Anneliese Dodds\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25618\">the hon. Member for Oxford East (Anneliese Dodds)<\/phrase> and others.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/5\">London has long been the global capital of finance. We want that to continue. Its strengths are multifaceted. They come from the depth and breadth of experience and talent in the ecosystem here. That stretches, as we have heard, beyond pure financial services to the law, where a number of us worked, and to accountancy, shipping and insurance, which my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Craig Tracey\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25290\">the Member for North Warwickshire (Craig Tracey)<\/phrase> mentioned. We have to view that ecosystem as something special that needs to be preserved.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/6\">London is also an attractive destination culturally, socially and in terms of diversity, all of which need to be preserved. I am married to a New Yorker who moved to London and would never leave the UK now, because she thinks that it is such a special country and that London is the world&#8217;s greatest capital city. None of those factors should be underplayed and we should not be complacent about how we can keep them going in the future.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/7\">We have had a good debate about the importance of financial services in other parts of the country. My own city of Nottingham has a significant financial services presence. For example, it is home to Experian, the credit rating company, which employs thousands of people. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Kirsty Blackman\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25314\">The hon. Member for Aberdeen North (Kirsty Blackman)<\/phrase> mentioned the importance of Edinburgh, for example for asset management firms.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/8\">We also heard about banking in Birmingham, back office processes in Bournemouth, the insurance industry in cities such as Cardiff and Norwich, and many other examples that we must preserve and give due consideration to in the debates we are having in Parliament at the moment. I agree with hon. Members that this House and the Government need to give more consideration to the fact that our economy is 80% services-based, and  that there need to be more debates about professional services and the contribution they make to the whole economy.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/9\">It is important that the UK remains a tax-competitive jurisdiction in many respects, but particularly for financial services. We are committed to the reliefs that my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden spoke about, such as the seed investment enterprise scheme, the enterprise investment scheme and entrepreneurs&#8217; relief, as well as the continued reduction in corporation tax, which we have just legislated for in the Finance Bill, to 17%. Together, those measures are critical to the future success of the UK in paying our way in the world and attracting investors here as an important place to live, work and form businesses.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/10\">The hon. Member for Oxford East also alluded to the importance of the financial services sector to the wider economy. Having strong capital markets in the UK is important for our venture capital industry, which is the European leader and is maturing, but there is more that it needs to do to create thriving sectors such as FinTech, the technology sector more generally and life sciences, for example in Oxford. There is also more to do in infrastructure investment, which the hon. Lady also referred to. We will shortly publish a review of how we can continue to be a strong player in financing major infrastructure projects. That will include the proposition of a national infrastructure investment bank, which has been suggested by a number of individuals, as well as by the Labour party.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/11\">It is important that the UK&#8217;s financial services sector is inclusive. The hon. Lady made an important point about diversity. Most recently, we commissioned Alison Rose to report on how we can improve the level of finance that is available to female entrepreneurs across the country, building on the charter alluded to by the hon. Lady. The Government are also committed to credit unions. The number of individuals who are members of credit unions is rising&#8212;it is now over 2 million. There has been some consolidation in the number of credit unions, but the number of members benefiting from them is increasing. I think that they now have assets of &#163;3.3 billion. We are making a number of interventions in that respect, including a FinTech challenge fund to see how FinTech can help with some of the social problems that we have discussed in terms of access to capital.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/12\">Given that there is little time available, I am happy to write to my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden and any other hon. Members who are interested about the measures that we have taken and are interested in taking to ensure that credit unions become more widely available, including, of course, by increasing their scope from 2 million to 3 million members and their geographical reach, which helps them to have a larger presence in big cities and different regions of the country.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/13\">Brexit has clearly been a major factor in this debate. Like my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Lee Rowley\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25685\">the Member for North East Derbyshire (Lee Rowley)<\/phrase>, I do not believe it would be responsible to rule out a no-deal scenario, as it is important to maintain that leverage in the negotiations, but we have to accept that this is a sector of the economy that would be  significantly harmed by a no-deal exit. It would be problematic for a range of reasons, which we have discussed.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/14\">First, if we can secure a deal, it will provide an implementation period, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst said, would smooth out those cliff edges and enable firms to prepare as we transition to the future relationship. There is no escaping the fact that while we can take a generous approach to the European Union, there is no obligation on it to reciprocate, and we cannot prepare for that in advance.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/15\">Secondly, if we leave with a deal, it will ensure that we have the political declaration and, within it, the enhanced equivalence regime that we want, to ensure that we have a continued close relationship with the European financial system. It is critical for all of us to work together in the weeks ahead to secure a deal that we can support. Of course, it must not be just any deal, but a good deal that we can support for this sector. Ultimately, that is the only way we can give the sector the assurances it needs to continue to invest and protect jobs.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/16\">My hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden spoke about FinTech, to which I have alluded. There are now 80,000 people working in the FinTech sector in the United Kingdom. None of those jobs existed 10 years ago. We are a world leader. We have published a FinTech strategy. Of course, there is more that we might be able to do in the future. The next great opportunity is in SureTech. We are working with Lloyds of London and other parts of that industry to ensure that the same principles of open data that were taken forward by the Financial Conduct Authority can help to drive a revolution in products in the insurance industry. That is of interest both globally and to consumers in the UK, to ensure that they are protected.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/17\">We have heard about the importance of access to capital, on which the industry is reliant. We have taken a number of steps, from the patient capital review to increasing the amount of money available to the venture capital sector in the UK. There is more that we can and will do, such as working with pension funds in the UK so that they back these sorts of investments.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/18\">As we have heard, this is an industry that relies on attracting the best and brightest talent to the United Kingdom. We need to ensure that that continues. In March, we will be launching the start-up visa, which was announced last June by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. That will answer the question my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden asked about how talented entrepreneurs in a sector such as FinTech can come to the UK. There will be no limit on the number of individuals who can benefit from that and it should be a major step forward.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/19\">We have also accepted the Migration Advisory Committee&#8217;s recommendations with respect to students. Those changes will be made in due course, which will make it easier for individuals to stay on in the UK after studying, to make a life here and to join businesses in financial services and elsewhere.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/20\">With respect to data sharing, which my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst raised, we are pursuing a comprehensive relationship with the European Union, but we will be able to deliver that only if we  can secure a deal and get on to those negotiations in due course.<\/p><p pid=\"a135.1\/21\">I hope that I have answered many of the questions that have been raised today. There were many others, and I will write to the hon. Members who raised them. We are committed to financial services sector, which is a foundation stone of the United Kingdom&#8217;s economy and is of benefit to people across the country. The critical step in the days ahead is to secure a deal that gives the sector the assurance that it needs to move forward.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1010.1\/1\">My Lords, I thank the Minister for a good set of amendments that respond across the piece to concerns that were raised in Committee. I shall probe a little further on what can and cannot be done for the purpose of clarification.<\/p><p pid=\"a1010.1\/2\">Clause 1(1) states that this is about converting,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1010.1\/3\">&#8220;the provisions, or any of the provisions, of any specified EU financial services legislation&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a1010.1\/4\">So the option is still there not to convert it or to convert only parts of it. At an earlier stage, I suggested that that could be adapted. I noticed that when the Minister spoke, he used the word &#8220;files&#8221; as if the files were all transposed at once, but we must recognise that some things may not be transposed. I believe that is the intention. Here, I should give my usual reminder to the House of my interests as set out in the register, in particular as a director of the London Stock Exchange. In the first set of EU legislation, that which is completed but not yet active, you could still omit some or all of it and do an EU-type adaptation, but you cannot adapt it if you chose to convert it. It has got to be relatively straightforward.<\/p><p pid=\"a1010.1\/5\">For the not yet completed, there is greater flexibility. I have a few little tests of my own to see whether this would be allowed. First, what if you wanted to keep a current provision instead of having a new one? That is quite simple: you probably just leave it out and do not convert it, which falls within what is allowed. If you want to reflect more closely an international standard&#8212;let us say that the EU has embellished it in some way&#8212;could you do that? I think you probably could because you are still going back to the originating international standard, but it would be interesting to hear what the Minister has to say about that. What if you want to reflect more closely UK market data because it has been calibrated on EU data, by then absent us? I expect most of that happens in technical standards, but it would be interesting to have the Minister&#8217;s view on whether the Government could make such a change. I think it would be allowable.<\/p><p pid=\"a1010.1\/6\">What about aligning with alternative provisions made in other major international markets? That would be departing from alignment with the EU into alignment  with somewhere else. Let us say that you wanted to align tick sizes with Hong Kong or the US, rather than staying with the EU regime. Would that be allowed? I think that is quite a marginal issue. The Minister does not have to use that particular example, but it would be interesting to know where that would lie in the tests. If you want to avoid disrupting the functioning of UK markets&#8212;the sort of comment you often hear&#8212;you are probably left with the option of not converting that element.<\/p><p pid=\"a1010.1\/7\">My final test is, what happens about proportionality for SMEs and SME markets? I am not sure how that would work out: if the legislation has not included proportionality, is it reasonable and within scope to put some proportionality in? That measure is probably relatively popular from a UK perspective, so it would be nice to know whether that could be covered.<\/p>",

The EU has very high standards of recycling and we will continue to match them after we leave.<\/p><p pid=\"a1004.2\/2\">The Secretary of State reserves the right to change the list. The power to add new facilities to it is included so that it does not become static. If we did not include this power, it would not be possible without primary legislation to add ship-recycling facilities to the UK list and to mirror what the EU does on its list. Over time, that could reduce the choices that UK ships have, compared with their EU counterparts. Because we will be retaining the standards and criteria for approving ship-recycling facilities used under the current EU regulation, the UK and EU lists will continue to be compiled to the same high standards. The powers in this instrument cannot be used to lower the standards of ship recycling.<\/p><p pid=\"a1004.2\/3\">If the EU changes its criteria, we will of course consider revising ours along similar lines. We do not think that this will happen for a few years, until the ship recycling regulation&#8212;which is fairly new&#8212;beds down. The Commission is committed to reviewing the EU regulation 18 months before the Hong Kong convention comes into force.

            "body": "<p pid=\"a882.0\/1\">My Lords, this is an important debate, which was well introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson. It is, first, an opportunity  to review progress in understanding scientific progress and technological developments, especially those associated with extreme and unusual processes and phenomena. Secondly, we should review and identify new and appropriate technologies and strategies for urban areas and communities around the world. I declare my interest as an emeritus science professor at UCL and co-chair of the Asian Network on Climate Science and Technology.<\/p><p pid=\"a882.0\/2\">Parliamentarians have supported how essential it is to have a broad and integrated approach to dealing with these issues and to support the Government in that respect. It is only when we work on international programmes that we can make contributions, as the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, commented. Nearly 10 years ago, I was proud to join other UK parliamentarians in helping the growth of the Global Legislators Organisation for a Balanced Environment, which helped ensure that a large number of the countries in the world&#8212;150 or so&#8212;came together to develop policies that eventually led to the Paris Agreement in 2015.<\/p><p pid=\"a882.0\/3\">I will use this opportunity to point out where the UK and other government agencies, as well as research and industry, could progress more rapidly using effective climate policies. I hope to explain the worrying rise in overall temperatures and how in many areas there are extremes in precipitation and other meteorological effects. To give your Lordships an example, when I was chief executive of the Met Office, I learned from our forecasters how west-to-east coherent jet streams in the northern hemisphere tended to become chaotic&#8212;I was going to say &#8220;fizzle out&#8221;&#8212;as they came over western Europe, therefore weather forecasters did not talk about the jet stream over Europe. But research that has taken place in the past five to six years in Europe and the United States now shows weather forecasters how the jet stream persists over northern Europe. This partly explains why, associated with the warming of the Arctic and the decrease in polar ice, the jet stream is now much stronger over Europe, which leads to considerable changes in the weather, as we have seen in the past few years. A number of severe winds and temperature changes have been observed.<\/p><p pid=\"a882.0\/4\">In tropical areas, extreme precipitation has occurred more frequently over mountainous urban areas such as those in south-west China, including Hong Kong, and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. Rapid reconstruction methods in communities damaged by floods have been invented by engineers in some developing countries, such as Malaysia, and a number of other developing countries make use of them&#8212;whereas there is a tendency, when you have damaging floods, simply to cast away all the woodwork and buildings.<\/p><p pid=\"a882.0\/5\">Extreme winds and rainfall associated with tropical cyclones are becoming more dangerous. Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines had unique features: the wind was so strong that it pushed back the sea and lifted stones from the bottom that then crashed into buildings and vegetation even a few kilometres inland. In fact, the wind was so intense that the bark was stripped from the trees, which many people studying it said had never been seen before.<\/p><p pid=\"a882.0\/6\">In my first debate in the House of Lords in 2000, noble Lords discussed their concern about the rise in coastal sea levels. Since then, there have been serious  floods along the rivers associated with significant and persistent precipitation and high winds. Coastal communities in the UK and around Europe, agriculture and Governments are now having to contribute financially to raising the dykes and pumping schemes. That is a serious matter.<\/p><p pid=\"a882.0\/7\">Other equally important and long-term risks in coastal areas have been associated with non-carbon nuclear power stations and nuclear waste-processing facilities. These are also being installed in Asia. Other risks in those areas are associated with volcanoes, earthquakes and tsunamis along coastlines, such as the Fukushima nuclear power plant breach, which UK insurance companies have been involved with. Artificially generated carbon emissions and earthquakes caused by fracking are also a factor.<\/p><p pid=\"a882.0\/8\">People will continue to live in these dangerous areas. They will have to make use of these new methods to reduce risk. One of the most important developments in which I am involved is that of fusion energy in small, modular systems, which are now being supported by the Government and the private sector. We now expect those systems to be producing electrical energy, perhaps in the next five to 10 years&#8212;a considerably shorter time than the very large international ITER fusion project in France, which is not, I notice, being supported by the UK&#8217;s EU parliamentarians.<\/p><p pid=\"a882.0\/9\">As recent articles in Nature and the newspapers have commented, urban areas are producing some new technologies. One of the most remarkable ones is Wuhan, where very high-level solar panels cover large areas of the city, so that the city becomes rather like a forest canopy, with a great reduction in radiation&#8212;heat&#8212;hitting the ground; it is reflected.<\/p><p pid=\"a882.0\/10\">Finally, Members of the House of Lords who enjoy drinking wine might like to know that one problem of climate change is too much heat, which makes the wine too alcoholic. What are they now doing in France? They are putting solar collectors along the lines of the vineyards. That is very interesting.<\/p>",

No one in this House needs persuading of his long-standing and tenacious commitment to human rights. It is characteristic of him not to have lost sight of the plight of suffering Filipinos. I hope the Minister will respond to the recommendations that he has made, and particularly to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, that the Philippines should be officially designated as a country of concern. That would be a positive outcome of today&#8217;s debate.<\/p><p pid=\"a869.0\/2\">I have a non-pecuniary interest as a trustee of the Arise Foundation, an anti-slavery charity with a brilliant team that does superb work in various countries of origin for trafficked people, including the Philippines.<\/p><p pid=\"a869.0\/3\">In addition to the human rights abuses in the Philippines itself, we would do well to remember the many thousands of Filipinos working abroad who suffer exploitation. I was shocked when I first learned that over 10% of the entire GDP of the Filipino economy is remitted back to the Philippines from abroad from an estimated 2.3 million overseas Filipino workers. The principal countries of destination are: Saudi Arabia, which takes 25.4% of these workers; the UAE, 15.3%, Hong Kong, 6.5%; and Qatar, 5.5%.<\/p><p pid=\"a869.0\/4\">I know from work by the Arise Foundation that many of these Filipinos are exploited and enslaved in unimaginably cruel and inhumane conditions. I go so far as to say that the stories of Filipina women enslaved in the Middle East are the most extreme and unrepeatable I have ever heard. The situation is Qatar is so bad that the Philippine embassy has a rescue shelter attached to it which is reportedly always full. Can the Minister tell us whether the dire and well-documented human rights conditions of Filipino overseas workers in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar feature in our discussions with the respective Governments?<\/p><p pid=\"a869.0\/5\">While considering the difficulties faced by Filipinos abroad, we also need to look closer to home. Even if they find work, there is no guarantee that they can remit their earnings back to their families. What measures are in place to ensure that companies do not charge unfair and exorbitant fees to transfer money home? During the passage of the modern slavery legislation, my noble friend Lord Hylton and I divided your Lordships&#8217; House on the issue of domestic migrant labour. Many Filipinos are tricked by unscrupulous employment agencies who prey on their hopes for a better life. Some take on huge debts to pay unaffordable agency fees which have to be paid back once work has begun&#8212;a well-worn pattern leading to debt bondage in the destination country.<\/p><p pid=\"a869.0\/6\">The UK is a significant destination for Filipinos seeking employment as domestic workers; sadly, the Philippines is never far down the list of source nations for modern slavery victims of our own national referral mechanism. What are we doing to disrupt the unethical recruitment corridor that clearly exists between the Philippines and the UK? The United Kingdom has a memorandum of understanding with the Government of the Philippines to enable the recruitment of nurses and other health professionals. In 2018 the number of Philippines-born workers in the National Health Service  was 15,400. What guarantees can the Minister give that our recruitment methods are ethical and respect the communities from which these workers are sourced?<\/p><p pid=\"a869.0\/7\">Arise works with front-line charities in the Philippines which continue to do superb work in difficult circumstances. Many of them have stood bravely against Duterte&#8217;s Administration, as described so powerfully and so well by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, a few moments ago. Unfortunately, bilateral funding for work such as theirs has decreased due to lack of confidence in that Government. Many of the charities working in the Philippines are struggling for support. I hope the Minister will assure us that, in allocating UK aid, we will not make the mistake of conflating worthy front-line work with a wayward Government, and will not falter in our commitment to the wonderful Filipino people.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b165.1\/1\">I was talking about how legislative solutions are applied, what is already in place and the charter for budget responsibility. My point was that in non-financial areas of Government activity, we are happy to bind ourselves to long-term targets, because there is the political will. The most obvious instance in recent years was the Climate Change Act 2008, which created an explicit legal requirement for future Governments to reduce greenhouse gases by 80%. If a political consensus can be built for protecting the country against such a danger to our children, why cannot the same be done to prevent economic problems for future decades?<\/p><p pid=\"b165.1\/2\">That is where a balanced budget rule could really make a difference, with a legislative requirement to balance our budget over a period, minimising the growth of the debt to be left for following generations to deal with. It is not all that innovative. The OECD estimates that about 100 countries have some kind of fiscal limiting framework. Those can be voluntary or compulsory, and they vary in strictness and the degree to which they are adhered to. None is perfect, but it is at least arguable that over time the focus on fiscal rectitude focuses minds and attention on delivering better outcomes.<\/p><p pid=\"b165.1\/3\">Perhaps the most obvious example of a budget rule, and the best known, is Chile&#8217;s. In the 2000s, Chile adopted a rule requiring structural surpluses to be run, so that the national debt could be reduced significantly. Broadly, under the structure it created, an estimate was made of the country&#8217;s economic potential over future years, and spending was allowed only to match the anticipated growth and revenue.<\/p><p pid=\"b165.1\/4\">What was the result? There was a sharp reduction in net debt, surpluses as high as 8% in the years leading up to the economic crisis, and the upgrading of the country&#8217;s credit rating. Admittedly, some of that was possibly because of the commodity boom. None the less, the rule permitting appropriate balance to be given to both revenue and spending was important. Even today, after the rule has been challenged and battered a bit more through experience and difficulty, Chile&#8217;s debt remains significantly below that of many other countries. It is about 20% of GDP, rather than the 80% that we are grappling with.<\/p><p pid=\"b165.1\/5\">Switzerland is another example where a legislative solution has focused minds and improved overall fiscal discipline. The Swiss &#8220;debt brake&#8221; was introduced in 2001, having been approved in a referendum&#8212;something that that country is wont to use for important national policy questions. Integration into the national constitution followed. There is a requirement for structural balanced budgets, through the capping of annual spending with tax revenues, plus or minus some flexibility. Again, the change had a significant impact. A nation whose debt-to-GDP ratio had significantly increased&#8212;from around 15% of GDP in the early 1990s to 45% at the time of the referendum&#8212;saw a rapid reduction over the succeeding years. Debt to GDP is now about 25%, and is projected to fall.<\/p><p pid=\"b165.1\/6\">Switzerland and Chile are not alone. Sweden is another country that learned from overspending, this time in the 1990s, and it has been relatively successful at maintaining surpluses. The Germans have introduced in their constitution a cap of 0.35% on structural deficits. It is not exactly a surplus, but it is a way to prevent large consistent deficits. Other examples that the OECD has highlighted include Argentina, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Hong Kong and the Netherlands, although their arrangements vary with respect to their legislative teeth and their success. Even the French, who have not been able to balance a budget for decades, have made tentative steps in that direction, with the transposition of their fiscal compact in 2012. The fact that that has not gone anywhere is a topic for another conversation, but at least they were moving in that direction for a time.<\/p><p pid=\"b165.1\/7\">Of course, legislation is not the only solution, and it does not necessarily guarantee a positive outcome against politicians determined to get around it. The United States&#8217; periodic fights over the debt ceiling&#8212;a mechanism that was designed to stop overspending&#8212;always have one outcome. In the 1980s, the attempts in the States to balance the federal budget under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, through mandatory sequesters&#8212;automatic cuts in spending in the event that politicians could not agree a budget that would fit&#8212;were unsuccessful, as resets and changes occurred when the going got tough. Nothing is infallible if we do not want it to be. Creative accounting, redefinition of spending as investment or capital, direct appeals and canny political manoeuvring can all undermine fiscal responsibility if politicians want that to happen.<\/p><p pid=\"b165.1\/8\">I do not argue that a balanced budget rule would be a panacea. In Chile in recent years, there have been issues when estimates have not been realised and projections have been undershot. Switzerland also exempts elements of spending, such as social services, from the rules. If people want to get around this stuff they will, and no Parliament can truly bind the hands of a future one. Yet the idea of fiscal responsibility being formally codified beyond aspirations that can be amended by mere ministerial statements creates an impetus and a legal framework that focuses the political mind and public discourse on ensuring that we do something as basic as spending only as much as we raise.<\/p><p pid=\"b165.1\/9\">What kinds of solutions should we consider? That depends on the political will and the desire to focus on the issue at hand. First, it is right to fix our immediate problem and finish the job of eliminating the deficit. I support what the Government are doing about that and want to give them gentle encouragement to accelerate it  where possible. That is the first step. There is the potential to legislate in the future once we have reached a surplus, or perhaps even when the point is reached at which the deficit is relatively small, which we are starting to get to.<\/p><p pid=\"b165.1\/10\">There are various options. We could try to act voluntarily. That, to some extent, is what we have done already, and it is absolutely better than nothing, but we can in truth see that that approach has shortcomings&#8212;for some of which there are good reasons. I shall not provide a running commentary on Government policy, which, as I have said, has been positive overall. Plans are moved, for good and bad reasons. The conveyor belt of politicians calling for more spending and pushing their own hobbyhorses&#8212;holding Westminster Hall debates&#8212;continues. Many such ideas have merit and value, but we have effectively created a pressure cooker in Parliaments such as ours, with a desire just to ask for more and do more, and seek out new ways to spend money on fixes. When one parliamentarian does it, others follow suit. We remain addicted to spending and voluntarism goes only so far.<\/p><p pid=\"b165.1\/11\">How, then, can we formalise the approach I am outlining? We could, as happens in the United States, make it a formal requirement to vote on increasing debt when it approaches established ceilings, or when there is a question of its exceeding them. The Government debt is fixed and capped and politicians have to make a clear decision in front of their electorate to change it. That is useful but probably, as in the US, it would not focus the minds of politicians too much. Often people&#8217;s eyes glaze over when they see big numbers. That is one of the reasons why my party should stop trying to win the public services spending arms race with the spendthrifts on the Opposition Benches and focus instead on what the money is actually doing to improve outcomes. A debt ceiling has limitations, but it would send a clear signal.<\/p><p pid=\"b165.1\/12\">Taking things further, we could establish a simple balanced budget rule that we would not spend more than we took in over a defined year or over the course of a few years. That could be done through adept forward estimating or by linking spending to the trajectory of past revenue growth. The Government would have a formal responsibility not to overspend, and to set out their plans clearly, on a short-term basis, showing how they intended to avoid overspending. In some ways, that would be the simplest solution&#8212;a clear understandable position and a clear understandable requirement to ensure that the budget is balanced. It might also improve public understanding of and support for the proposal.<\/p><p pid=\"b165.1\/13\">Such rules, however, are often clunky and inflexible. Absolute requirements to budget on an annual or near-annual basis will significantly reduce headroom and the flexibility to deal with short-term shocks and recessions when there is at least an arguable case for fiscal stimulus in certain circumstances. That is probably one reason why such strict rules do not apply in many places around the world.<\/p><p pid=\"b165.1\/14\">Alternatively, we could think about a more flexible approach that achieves the overall objectives, but that relies more heavily on estimating being correct, and on the Government not delaying hard decisions through a lack of political will. The requirement to balance a budget over an economic cycle would seem a strong starting point, although identifying the start and end  point of that cycle will be difficult and reliant on guesswork that would no doubt not be correct in a number of cases.<\/p><p pid=\"b165.1\/15\">Flexibility could be introduced through various mechanisms. For example, the Swiss debt brake accepts that at times the Government will need to amend their approach due to external factors. To accommodate that, it applies a model of debits and credits, so if a Government fail to achieve a balanced budget in one year, they carry over that failure to another year through a fiscal debit that needs to be made up. Similarly, fiscal credits can be built up in a bank in readiness for future problems. To avoid future debts being run up too heavily, once debits exceed 6% of total Government spending, an automatic requirement kicks in to eliminate them within three years. An exceptional rule also applies so that in times of genuine emergency or need, both Houses of the Swiss Parliament can approve spending on an exceptional basis that breaks the rules. Even then, however, the Swiss have found a way to accommodate that, and automatic amortisation of that exceptional spending must be dealt with within six years.<\/p><p pid=\"b165.1\/16\">The challenge of the Swiss model is its relative complexity&#8212;try explaining that down the pub after a few pints or during hustings at the next election&#8212;but its beauty is that bygones cannot be bygones, which is often the flaw in attempts to regulate deficit spending and debt growth. If Chile gets its estimates wrong, it tries harder next time. If the Swiss get them wrong, they have to find a way to compensate, and all the while the cost of servicing debt remains low and does not threaten the financial health of the next generation.<\/p><p pid=\"b165.1\/17\">Despite Brexit sucking the oxygen out of the room, and despite the challenges that the UK faces in the coming years&#8212;including from that B-word&#8212;we have to make a choice. The Government have been consistent and clear that they believe in fiscal responsibility and discipline. We have had success in restoring the UK&#8217;s financial health after such difficult times 10 years ago, and the trajectory continues&#8212;albeit a little slowly for my liking&#8212;to get us back to balance. Nevertheless, we need to talk about what we do when we get there. As some politicians occasionally point out, dealing with the deficit does not mean that we have dealt with the debt, and the conversation needs to move on to that.<\/p><p pid=\"b165.1\/18\">Balanced budgets, fiscal rules and the promotion of fiscal discipline will be the weapons and constraints&#8212;perhaps we could call them the backstops&#8212;for when the next generation of politicians, whoever they are, are tempted to spend, spend and spend again. Indeed, some of the current generation are quite tempted to do that at the moment. Having balanced budget rules and the codification of fiscal discipline is one way to do that. It is not a perfect solution, but the status quo is far from perfect in this regard. Perhaps as a nation we should start to think more about how we create frameworks for future success, and how we address the fundamental challenge in western democracies of celebrating the money we want to spend&#8212;whether necessary and virtuous, or inefficient and virtue signalling&#8212;while not paying sufficient attention to the cost of it all. We cannot and must not keep spending today on the backs of our kids and grandkids tomorrow. If politicians are not willing voluntarily to adopt restraint, perhaps it is time to harden our resolve.<\/p>",

In fact, last week, the Chancellor and the Home Secretary launched a new taskforce on economic crimes, which will include cyber-security and digital payments. Of course, we work across the full range of financial institutions and authorities to ensure that they take this issue seriously. The Government&#8217;s cyber-security strategy, in which we have invested almost &#163;2 billion, is designed to increase capability and awareness among financial institutions and police forces across the country. Police forces need to take this issue very seriously as crime changes.<\/p><p pid=\"a82.1\/2\">It is also worth mentioning the societal benefits of developments in other parts of the world, particularly in Africa and the developing world, where organisations and companies that have taken the lead on mobile payment services, such as M-Pesa, have been truly transformational in opening up new opportunities for entrepreneurship and person-to-person payments. We have seen that happen in those parts of the world, and we want it to happen in this country, too.<\/p><p pid=\"a82.1\/3\">We heard about some of the challenges associated with the increase in digital payments and the falling use of cash. It is worth noting that cash payments fell from 61% of all payments in 2007 to 34% in 2017. However, 34% is still a significant proportion, and about 2.7 million people in the UK remain entirely reliant on cash. We must ensure that those who rely on cash are not excluded as digital payments become more prevalent. We can  of course play a role in guiding them to see some of  the benefits and opportunities of digital payments. My hon. Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness mentioned examples of people for whom digital payments may be very useful indeed, such as those on lower incomes and migrant workers.<\/p><p pid=\"a82.1\/4\">We launched a call for evidence last year to better understand the role of cash and digital payments in the new economy, to explore questions such as how we can maintain access to cash for those who need it, and to better understand the trajectory of cash use. We concluded that although we are probably heading towards a cashless society, we should seek to facilitate and encourage that. Cash&#8212;our coins and notes&#8212;will be with us for a long time to come, so its continued availability in all parts of the country for all groups needs to be planned carefully by the Government, financial institutions such as the Royal Mint and the Bank of England, and the payments industry.<\/p><p pid=\"a82.1\/5\">We are working closely with the industry, which recognises the challenges. Last year, LINK, the UK&#8217;s ATM network, announced an independent review of  access to cash, chaired by Natalie Ceeney, in response to some of the concerns and criticisms raised over the course of 2018 about the decline in the number of ATMs, particularly in rural areas. It is true that there are probably too many ATMs in some of our urban areas, but there is real concern about the number of ATMs in smaller market towns, on the smaller high streets of larger cities such as Bristol, and particularly in villages. The review is exploring the risks of leaving people behind as we increasingly utilise digital payments. As we heard, its interim report found that many consumers still value having cash.<\/p><p pid=\"a82.1\/6\">The wholesale cash industry is also considering the infrastructure required to continue to service cash use as it declines. That will be a serious challenge in the years to come, and we want to be prepared for it. How can we ensure that every shop, restaurant, post office and community in every part of the country, including rural areas, continues to be able to obtain the cash it needs? How can that business model be either profitable or supported by the rest of the economy? In addition, the payments industry is progressing initiatives such as Request to Pay, which can help increase and promote financial inclusion. The Request to Pay service aims to give payers more control over outgoing payments and to help people avoid the cliff edges that can be created by irregular incomes or unexpected bills.<\/p><p pid=\"a82.1\/7\">The rise in digital payments has been remarkable. It is not unique to this country; it is happening in all parts of the world, including in perhaps unexpected places such as Africa and the developing world. Contactless payments in this country grew by 99% in 2017, and we expect that trajectory to continue. We welcome proposals to enable the UK to embrace that change. There are no simple solutions, but we look at international examples, such as Singapore, Hong Kong and other parts of the world that are particularly engaged with this question. Hon. Members from across the House with proposals and ideas are very welcome to come to see me or other Treasury Ministers as we consider how we can continue to engage with this issue and drive the sector forward.<\/p><p pid=\"a82.1\/8\">We need to consider the impact of the increasingly digital world on society and our economy and find ways to overcome the challenges it presents. Cash use remains important, with more than one third of payments in  the UK made in cash. However, like my hon. Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness, we want to guide the economy and the public through the undoubted and probably irreversible journey to a cashless society, and we want to ensure that the UK is at the forefront of new technology while protecting the most vulnerable in our society.<\/p><p pid=\"a82.1\/9\">Question put and agreed to.<\/p><p pid=\"a82.1\/10\">Sitting suspended.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a365.1\/1\">My Lords, in my youth, the union was strong. Not only had the four nations survived two world wars side by side but there was a community of interest that bound people together.  Coal miners faced the same hazards in pits across Britain. The Gresford hymn is still played and sung annually at the Durham Miners&#8217; Gala to commemorate the 266 miners killed underground at the Gresford pit in 1934. Steelworkers from Merthyr to Shotton, Sheffield and Motherwell had common interests, and workers in the shipyards of Belfast and Glasgow, Liverpool and the Tyne shared common dangers.<\/p><p pid=\"a365.1\/2\">However, as those great UK-wide industries declined and departed, the solidarity of the union weakened. Devastated communities were left isolated&#8212;high and dry. Then the European project got under way. European development funds underpinned the economies of areas in decline, and nowhere has benefited more than Wales. European structural funds have invested more than  &#163;4 billion in supporting many thousands of jobs and creating new enterprises. Europe helped to stabilise the union at a time of profound economic and social change.<\/p><p pid=\"a365.1\/3\">Devolution has played an important part in creating stability. In Wales we regard Sir John Redwood not so much as the architect of devolution but as its cause. As Secretary of State between 1993 and 1995, two years before the 1997 referendum, he attacked the non-governmental organisations delivering services in Wales with Thatcherite zeal, halved public funding to the Welsh Development Agency and cut his own Welsh Office staff, outsourcing to the private sector. He banned the use of the Welsh dragon on a leaflet entitled Wales in Europe and refused to second staff to ensure a Welsh presence in Brussels. He boasted that he had returned &#163;100 million of the funding allocated to Wales, unspent, to the Treasury. He travelled home to Wokingham every night to avoid staying in Wales, refused to sign documents in the Welsh language because he did not understand them, and his rendition of the Welsh national anthem remains a YouTube classic that is very dear to our hearts. Therefore, we thank him for ensuring for us the slim majority of 0.3% that brought devolution to Wales two years after his regime, and we wish him a similar outcome for his dreams in the ERG.<\/p><p pid=\"a365.1\/4\">It is that same contempt&#8212;that imperial condescension, as the noble Lord, Lord Lisvane, put it, or colonial complacency, as the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, described it&#8212;which has been exhibited in the Brexit negotiations. As the noble Lord, Lord McConnell, pointed out, the devolved Administrations were not consulted. The Joint Ministerial Committee did not meet for eight months, the joint letter written by Mark Drakeford and Mike Russell in protest on behalf of Wales and Scotland was ignored and the recommendations by the committee chaired by the noble Earl, Lord Kinnoull, were put on the shelf. It is not surprising that the Government struggled and, in the case of Scotland, failed to get legislative consent to the withdrawal Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"a365.1\/5\">Brexit involves abandoning EU mechanisms that have delivered the most generous regional assistance that Wales has ever seen in favour of a shared prosperity fund of indeterminate size and effect. This fund will be in the partisan political control of a UK Government, dominated by England, whose instincts are, as my noble friend Lord Wallace pointed out, incorrigibly centralist. I do not think Wales will get a fair deal. European funds have been distributed on the basis of  need but I strongly suspect that this shadowy new fund will be distributed, like the Barnett formula, on a crude headcount.<\/p><p pid=\"a365.1\/6\">In the last year we have observed the abandonment by the Westminster Government of exciting plans for the Swansea tidal lagoon and the electrification of the railway to Swansea. Japanese investment is under threat in the proposed new power station at Wylfa, as we discussed earlier today. Agricultural support is not guaranteed beyond 2020. Jaguar Land Rover, Ford, Vauxhall, Toyota and Airbus&#8212;all industries with vital outlets in Wales&#8212;have announced plans to move investment into Europe. As for steel, Anthony Taylor, the former mayor of Port Talbot and a steelworker for 39 years, told the Financial Times last March that a hard Brexit would be disastrous for the local economy:<\/p><p pid=\"a365.1\/7\">&#8220;We are going to have to compete in markets that we are not big enough to compete in. It&#8217;s OK to say we will take back control, but control of what? It makes me a bit a nervous to see ministers going around the world trying to sign trade deals with anybody and everybody. It doesn't look good&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a365.1\/8\">Independence has not been a strong sentiment in Wales. It was a passion that dared not speak its name. A recent analysis has shown that in the 20 years between 1997 and 2017 the word &#8220;independence&#8221; appeared 150 times in the SNP manifestos but only 15 times in the manifestos of Plaid Cymru. It was therefore a sign of these Brexit times that Adam Price, who recently defeated Leanne Wood for the leadership of Plaid, campaigned on an independence platform and wrested the leadership from her.<\/p><p pid=\"a365.1\/9\">I wish the Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Lisvane, whom I congratulate on getting this debate, well. I will certainly study it and I promise to respect it in the morning. However, if Brexit happens, I am with the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, in believing that the movement for separation will grow. I hesitate to talk about Northern Ireland since I once asked the noble Lord, Lord Rogan, what was wrong with a united Ireland, and he told me to wash my mouth out. However, a special relationship between Northern Ireland and the EU through the Republic of Ireland could have a very positive benefits for the people and economy of that Province. The special economic zone of Shenzhen, founded in 1982 on the borders of Hong Kong, has caused a market town of 30,000 to grow into a metropolis of nearly 13 million people. We talked on Tuesday in this Chamber about the flood of expensive English lawyers who have already joined the Irish legal profession in Dublin to protect their existing businesses in Europe. Belfast could attract them and other leading service industries for the same reason. A referendum on the border is only a generation away&#8212;and I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord McCrea, will respect its outcome. There may be much attraction then for a prosperous Northern Ireland seeking at least a confederation with the south.<\/p><p pid=\"a365.1\/10\">Thirteen of the 27 countries of the EU have smaller populations and economies than Scotland, and five are smaller than Wales. If Brexit happens, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility to envisage a successful confederation of Celtic states as part of the single European market and in a customs union. There was a time when the United Kingdom was more united and devolution seemed just as far away. Perhaps the noble  Lord, Lord Wigley, and I should resume our talks, adjourned in 1967, for the formation of an alliance of Welsh radicals.<\/p><p pid=\"a365.1\/11\">Brexit, which makes people poorer, will weaken the bonds and, as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, has just pointed out, adds to the instability that the many problems of the modern world present us with now.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b186.1\/1\">My understanding is that that is the mechanism that will be employed.<\/p><p pid=\"b186.1\/2\">A number of noble Lords raised the question about the access of UK lawyers to the EU 27 and EFTA. That is not the purpose of this instrument, but I do not wish to ignore it. Clearly, we would like to see a withdrawal agreement that leads on, pursuant to that, to negotiations that can ensure that we have as wide a form of access to the EU 27 and EFTA countries for legal services, like other services.<\/p><p pid=\"b186.1\/3\">The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, made a number of perfectly good and valid points about where we are without a deal and the impact it will have upon the provision of legal services. This is a matter over which I have been in discourse with the legal profession for the past two years, and I have visited with a number of firms in jurisdictions outside the United Kingdom to discuss with them where they stand with regard to these matters, in particular in Paris. Of course, as the noble Lord, Lord Beecham has observed, this is not for the larger firms. It tends to be the very large firms&#8212;generally City-based&#8212;who are engaged in practice outside the United Kingdom, particularly in Europe.<\/p><p pid=\"b186.1\/4\">The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, asked about small firms and the impact on them. To a very large extent, it is the City firms who are employing European lawyers for a particular form of expertise. One has to bear in mind that small firms do not tend to have non-UK qualified European lawyers practising.<\/p><p pid=\"b186.1\/5\">It is perhaps worth noticing&#8212;lawyers will appreciate this, but others may not&#8212;that, in England and Wales any natural person may deliver legal services for pay, except in the defined, reserved areas, of which there are six. They cannot call themselves solicitors or barristers, but they are only prohibited from practising in the reserved areas, unless they are subject to appropriate regulation. In the event, EU lawyers who have not requalified&#8212;and I will come back to this point&#8212;tend only to be here in order to show expertise within the law of their own particular jurisdiction. To try to put it in context, this applies not only to EU lawyers but also, for example, to American lawyers, so that, when they are doing international transactions they have available to them expertise in another jurisdiction&#8217;s law.<\/p><p pid=\"b186.1\/6\">In addition, we have to bear in mind the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. After three years in the United Kingdom, an EU lawyer is in a position to apply to become a lawyer under the host state&#8217;s regulation&#8212;in other words, a solicitor or barrister. Generally speaking&#8212;and this is a point emphasised in the Bar&#8217;s briefing&#8212;those who intend to be engaged in reserved matters will take that qualification. That is why, when engaging with the profession on this matter, we have allowed for a transition period so that, by  2020, people who are intent on remaining in the United Kingdom to practise in reserved areas will have had the opportunity to move over under the three-year rule in order to have the host qualification to continue. The Bar&#8217;s briefing said that, in the experience of the Bar Council, most EU practitioners who are interested in delivering reserved legal activities, obtain one of the home titles in order to be more successful in our legal market. I hope that addresses this point.<\/p><p pid=\"b186.1\/7\">On the issue of consultation and negotiation, the question of professional legal qualifications was raised with the EU at a very early stage on the basis that it was an adjunct to citizen rights. At that stage, the EU was not prepared to negotiate on that issue as distinct from what they regarded as citizen rights. It was, therefore, not taken forward in the context of the withdrawal agreement. In the context of the political declaration, it is directed principally to goods, although others elsewhere will discuss the distinction between goods and services. At the present time, it is our present intention to engage, if we have an agreement with the EU, on the question of reciprocity and recognition going forward. We understand the importance of this.<\/p><p pid=\"b186.1\/8\">I might add that we have discussed the matter with those firms that generally operate in the EU and outside the United Kingdom. They have been aware of these issues for some time and very many of the lawyers whom they engage in their offices&#8212;for example in Paris and Hamburg&#8212;are now locally qualified or are qualified nationals of the host state. That is the way in which these practices are carried on.<\/p><p pid=\"b186.1\/9\">I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, that some restructuring has been required to allow for this, and that has to be accepted. It is restructuring that would not otherwise have been engaged in, but these firms have undertaken it in preparation for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. However, these tend to be the major City firms. You do not get the high street conveyancing lawyer trying to open offices in Paris&#8212;if they do, I suspect it is not terribly successful.<\/p><p pid=\"b186.1\/10\">I recognise the development of courts in other jurisdictions and, in particular, the point made with regard to potential developments in Ireland. I am well aware of many of my fellow barristers who have checked their ancestry just to ensure that they can secure an Irish passport. Lacking that, they have sought to secure a place at the Bar of Ireland. It may be apocryphal, but I understand that the fee for registration as a solicitor in Dublin went up rapidly from &#8364;300 to about &#8364;3,000. I may be doing the solicitors&#8217; branch of the profession a disservice in relying on that story, but these developments are taking place. Let us remember that, at the level of international litigation, the real competitors are Singapore, Hong Kong and New York, which are all places outwith the EU, albeit that there are specialist centres&#8212;Stockholm being one, in the context of shipping and arbitration; and Hamburg being another. We recognise that as well.<\/p><p pid=\"b186.1\/11\">I come back to the instrument itself. We are required to pass it because, otherwise, we will be in breach of our international law obligations under the WTO and, in particular, the GATTs. So it is necessary for this purpose. I hope that it will not be required. I express this view without qualification. It is only appropriate  and sensible that the Government make provision for what could be an eventuality. I am not going to revisit ground that the House has already covered in the context of earlier statutory instruments which were before it. I hope that it will not be required, but it is only proper and appropriate that we should engage with the profession in order to ensure that we are prepared for any foreseeable eventuality, however unpleasant and unrewarding it may be. I beg to move.<\/p><p class=\"italic\" pid=\"b186.1\/12\">Motion agreed.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I thank Gordon Lindhurst for bringing forward this interesting debate to commemorate the Korean war armistice.<\/p><p>I have to admit that my knowledge of the Korean war is somewhat limited. I am sure that this will be the case for many people, as the Korean war is known as the forgotten war, as noted by the two previous members. My main information came from &#8220;MASH&#8221;, the satirical American television show about a mobile army surgical hospital during the Korean war. When I was 17, I spent time with family friends who lived in Canada, and much of my time was filled watching back-to-back episodes of &#8220;MASH&#8221; on the novelty of multi-channel TV&#8212;we had only four channels in the UK at that time.<\/p><p>Although that dark comedy drama was fictional, depicting a group of doctors and nurses who served as the fictional 4077th mobile army surgical hospital during the Korean war, it exposed some of the horrors of the war and often used satire to do so. That was undoubtedly because it was semi-autobiographical, as it was based on the 1969 novel by Richard Hooker, &#8220;MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors&#8221;. The book was based on Richard Hooker&#8217;s own experiences as a surgeon in 8055th MASH in South Korea, and the main character, army doctor Hawkeye Pierce, is based on the author.<\/p><p>However, I really had no knowledge of the thousands of UK service personnel who fought and died in the war; nor that there was a memorial in West Lothian, which I am now keen to see for myself. The war was part of the cold war between the Soviet Union and the United States, with Korea split into two sovereign states and both Governments claiming to be the sole legitimate Government of all of Korea, neither accepting the border as permanent. The conflict escalated into open warfare when North Korean forces, supported by the Soviet Union and China, moved into the south on 25 June 1950.<\/p><p>The United Nations Security Council authorised the formation and dispatch of UN forces to South Korea to repel the North Korean invasion, and 21 countries eventually contributed to the UN force, with the United States providing around 90 per cent of the military personnel.<\/p><p>The UN force included service personnel from three Scottish regiments, as recognised tonight. I was harrowed to read that the youngest soldiers went out to Hong Kong and Japan to wait until they were 19 and considered old enough to go into battle.<\/p><p>I am pleased that Gordon Lindhurst has raised the profile of the memorial in West Lothian. The Lothians and west of Scotland branch of the British Korean Veterans Association, supported by the local authority, created the memorial nearly 18 years ago, but it is not well known. Therefore, it would be helpful if veterans and visitors could have improved signage on our motorways to help them to locate the memorial&#8212;not least myself; if I am going to go and visit it, that would be helpful.<\/p><p>The development of wider education programmes would also be welcome, building on the excellent work that has been done so far in West Lothian. Educating our young people about the reality of war and the sacrifices of those who were injured and died is so important. Education about the horrors of war takes many forms, be that in the classroom, in our museums and galleries, or through satirical dramas such as &#8220;MASH&#8221;.<\/p><p>In 1945, after millions of lives lost in two world wars, 51 countries signed up to the Charter of the United Nations, which provided a framework for international co-operation, dialogue and discussion to provide solutions to international social and economic problems, rather than conflict.<\/p><p>Tonight&#8217;s members&#8217; business debate has given us a chance to reflect on the impact of war on families and communities who have lost their loved ones, and we know that those who have seen war and suffered its effects, think that more should be done to avoid it. Revisiting our history, remembering forgotten wars and adhering to international treaties that respect human rights and freedoms are vital if we are to build a world free of wars and conflicts.<\/p><p>Once again, I thank Gordon Lindhurst for bringing the debate to the chamber.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1176.0\/1\">I rise to remind people that it was only two months ago that there was a debate on &#8220;Legislating for the Withdrawal Agreement&#8221;, when I  cited the then Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Dominic Raab\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24815\">the Member for Esher and Walton (Dominic Raab)<\/phrase>, and his ambition for<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1176.0\/2\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;a smooth transition to a comprehensive future economic and security partnership for business and citizens&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a1176.0\/3\">It was admirable and convincing, and it recognised the 2016 referendum. That day, I argued that we should look for a free trade arrangement&#8212;perhaps Canada plus&#8212;because I believed that that was deliverable. The Prime Minister said that she was more ambitious than that, and we now have a different deal before us.<\/p><p pid=\"a1176.0\/4\">Industries in my Gordon seat have embraced Brexit. They have prepared for change and considered the solvable problems of Brexit, and they have done so in good faith. Today, we can consider supporting the withdrawal agreement, fundamentally because of good faith.<\/p><p pid=\"a1176.0\/5\">In the Treasury Committee hearing yesterday, I asked the Chancellor whether, had we prepared in 2016, we could have had regulatory and certification preparation in place for WTO rules. That, at least, would have given us a realistic backstop from which to negotiate.<\/p><p pid=\"a1176.0\/6\">The industries in my constituency&#8212;the oil and gas majors, which employ 280,000 people, plus farming, the food sector, tourism and the financial and service sectors&#8212;need us to behave like grown-ups. They need us to recognise that they need a deal that works for businesses and jobs.<\/p><p pid=\"a1176.0\/7\">The Bank of England has run comprehensive stress testing, which the Chancellor recognised earlier. The good news is that under every circumstance and every scenario, our financial system is safe and robust. As I said to the Chancellor earlier, in future negotiations we should be extremely robust with the EU.<\/p><p pid=\"a1176.0\/8\">The stress tests were not forecasts. I have heard many Opposition Members say how damaging Brexit will be to our GDP, but I would like to remind them why this country is the second highest destination for foreign direct investment: it is among the top 10 freest markets in the world and it has a legal system and rule of law that mean that people want to be based here. In the first half of 2018, only China had higher levels of FDI than the United Kingdom; we were in front of the US, Singapore, Hong Kong, Spain and Holland. This is a country in which people are investing now and will invest in future.<\/p><p pid=\"a1176.0\/9\">What are the upsides if we get an agreement with the EU? The foreign exchange has discounted the pound so significantly that we could see a currency bounce. The stock market is falling again today because of the concern about no deal. As a businessperson, I recognise that concern. There is pent up investment in the system of potentially hundreds of billions of pounds, because companies have held back.<\/p><p pid=\"a1176.0\/10\">Fundamentally, I can support this deal because I support the Brexit vote. Being a Scot, I was involved in another referendum. Opposition parties seem unwilling to recognise that the people have spoken. I believe, democratically, in what they have said.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1122.0\/1\">My Lords, like many in this House, I see a no-deal Brexit as an extraordinary act of self-harm. In this House, discussion often focuses on the immediate impact&#8212;long border queues, stockpiling and chaotic airports&#8212;but although some of those are inevitable, they pale against the long-term consequences of living under WTO rules, which are no more than imperfect measures to limit some tariff barriers in some sectors.<\/p><p pid=\"a1122.0\/2\">It is a great sadness to me that after two years of negotiation, the May deal is not much better, frankly. When you read the political declaration, it is clear that it leaves the issue of frictionless trade completely unresolved. We see that in the backstop conundrum, in a sense. If it cannot be resolved, it will not resolve the frictionless trade problem for the economy at large. We are left with a situation where friction becomes part of our future relationship with the EU.<\/p><p pid=\"a1122.0\/3\">People talk a great deal about free trade deals,  but only the largest companies are ever able to take advantage of them because they require a mountain of documentation and are extraordinarily complex. The suggestion that they are in many ways a panacea is misinformation that, frankly, is often presented to  this House.<\/p><p pid=\"a1122.0\/4\">I recognise that a number of businesses have been sympathetic towards the May deal, but let us be honest as to why. It is because they see the transition arrangement embedded in it as a mechanism for delay. But it is not a delay to keep business, opportunity and jobs in the UK; it is a delay that enables them much more smoothly to transfer out of the UK those operations and jobs which will serve the 450 million people of the 27. If anybody has spent time talking with major companies and asked them about their investment plans in Europe for the next five or 10 years, they will all tell you that their overwhelming focus is to invest in the 27 money that, without Brexit, typically and historically would have come into the UK. It is an extraordinary act of self-damage. It is why the Bank of England scenarios talk about a reduction in openness. That is what Brexit is: a reduction in openness from a country that supposedly prides itself on being open. We are putting up huge barriers between ourselves and our major trading partner and hoping only marginally to reduce them with other countries around the world.<\/p><p pid=\"a1122.0\/5\">I want to raise an issue that seems seldom discussed in this House; that is, the crucial impact of Brexit in any form on our young people. I wonder why Brexiteers do not talk about it more often. At the heart of the Brexit plan is to remove from those young people their European citizenship and the rights and opportunities that go with it; for instance, the right to engage in a relationship with somebody else from the EU and being able to live near or with them&#8212;that essentially disappears. We have no right of residence. Young people who want to work abroad will never qualify for the various visas discussed, where one needs to earn &#163;30,000&#8212;we assume that it will be reciprocal&#8212;to be able to work abroad. Very large companies want to hire young people who can work in any of their European offices, be they in Madrid, Paris or London. Why would you hire a young Brit when they need a visa for every one of those countries, whereas somebody hired from the 27 needs none? We are seeing that reflected in a drop in hiring that is happening now and impacting our young people already.<\/p><p pid=\"a1122.0\/6\">I have heard in this House a lot of people say, &#8220;We have to accept the May deal as the general compromise&#8221;. There was a brilliant letter in last Monday&#8217;s Financial Times written by John Ure, who is an associate professor at Hong Kong University. Decrying that approach, he quoted from the old nursery rhyme, suggesting that those who take that view are basically saying:<\/p><p pid=\"a1122.0\/7\">&#8220;Keep a-hold of nurse, for fear of finding something worse&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a1122.0\/8\">This is the time to have courage. No deal is completely unacceptable; the May deal is completely unacceptable. When people say, &#8220;The British public are weary of Brexit; they just want it over&#8221;, that might be true for this minute, but when they face the consequences of Brexit and see the impact on their lives, that will be forgotten in a flash. There will be huge anger. They will turn to people in this House and the other and say, &#8220;When the facts were on the table, why did you deny me the chance to become familiar with those facts and then express my opinion again? Why did you take that from me and deny it to me?&#8221; If this House is concerned about anger, it should recognise the anger that will come from those who have to live with the consequences  of any form of Brexit, knowing that they were denied the opportunity to express their views about their future and their country when information was on the table.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a340.0\/1\">Our thanks are certainly due to the noble Baroness, Lady Suttie, for this important debate about integrating sustainable development goals across government departments. I declare my interests as an emeritus professor at UCL and chair of a small environmental consulting company that works in developing countries. I am not sure that as much progress has been made as some of the government rhetoric indicates&#8212;so I follow the remarks of previous speakers. More should definitely be done to state and explain these broad goals. This is the first essential for effective policy and more could be done. Having one department in charge&#8212;DfID&#8212;inevitably biases the process towards the views of that department.<\/p><p pid=\"a340.0\/2\">There is no doubt that DfID&#8217;s focus on humanitarian and democratic objectives has been effective, in policy and in engaging the public in these aspects of sustainable development. But there has not been the same focus, as the noble Baroness, Lady Suttie, also emphasised, on public information, public debate and joined-up policy in the many other areas, such as the environment, economic planning and long-term climate change, agriculture and energy. In the UK, these areas are jointly the responsibility of government departments and civil society&#8212;for example, professional, technical and commercial bodies, universities and many other organisations, including charities and donors.<\/p><p pid=\"a340.0\/3\">The meteorological agencies around the world are an example of governmental bodies, and I was involved as chief executive of the Met Office. They did then, and do now, play an active role in helping government departments work towards sustainable goals: for example, in advising communities about weather extremes, floods and droughts, all of which are increasing as a result of climate change. But even technical departments of that sort, working with other environmental, medical and health organisations, have to work out how these environmental extremes affect health, the economy and the environment.<\/p><p pid=\"a340.0\/4\">However, it has been disappointing to see in the last 10 years or more that in the UK, after 2010 the coalition Government and then the Conservative Government deliberately suppressed some of the integrated policy methods&#8212;particularly the one in which the Sure Start programme, which followed America, had been very effective. As I have seen, these were stopped in many villages and elsewhere in the UK. Equally, we had quite an effective system in Britain of regional economic initiatives. These were also immediately suppressed by the Conservatives when the coalition Government came to power. During a recent science committee meeting in the House of Lords, Rolls-Royce commented that, as a result of the demise of these regional economic initiatives, many companies that feed into big companies such as Rolls-Royce were not working so well. There has been partial reinstatement with local enterprise boards, but they are not as effective at what we had before.<\/p><p pid=\"a340.0\/5\">International bodies and networks also play a leading role in the United Nations and intergovernmental organisations, and in international charities. Some of them have been very effective. We had a remarkable afternoon here in the House of Lords when Jimmy  Carter came to describe his campaign for disease-free water, which he explained in his speech. The United Nations technical agencies have a long history of taking on more complex issues, regionally and globally. These agencies have also helped Governments with sustainable development, and have had a big role in feeding into the United Nations centre in New York. For example, the International Maritime Organization, which is based here in London&#8212;an NGO with which I am involved&#8212;supports and works with them. It recently took on the role of guiding the global shipping industry to reduce its carbon emissions, which of course significantly exceed the carbon emissions from aviation. Sustainable global policies should aim to reduce the volume of shipping, although this would probably impact on the global economy. The question of the economy and the environment has to be kept in balance at all times, but this new initiative by the IMO is a very important development.<\/p><p pid=\"a340.0\/6\">A similarly important sustainable goal would be the limitation of vehicle emissions, which, even though it is being discussed, is not happening in the UK. In France, by contrast, there are road signs encouraging motorists to limit their speed in order to reduce emissions. In Britain, the signs on a motorway will tell you how fast you have to go to get to Bristol in 90 minutes, or whatever it is. That is why the UK is not raising this kind of sustainability goal. I have raised this question in Written PQs, with no satisfactory result.<\/p><p pid=\"a340.0\/7\">Last week I was in Malaysia at a meeting of climate environment networks, in particular the Asian area of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They were reviewing the issues in Asia. For example, there are critical issues such as the loss of forests, which is affected by global warming and sea-level rise but also by logging when richer countries remove their trees. This is a very important question. It is not just everybody working together. One fears that some countries are taking resources, which is having a bad effect on poorer countries.<\/p><p pid=\"a340.0\/8\">Another important development is increased disease in some Asian countries. It is a major issue that needs to be considered internationally. Another is the question of water. It was remarkable to hear at the meeting that water availability in the slum areas of big cities is about 20% of what it was 10 years ago. With a greatly reduced water supply in urban communities you have women queuing up to get water at 3 am. This is an issue that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, emphasised.<\/p><p pid=\"a340.0\/9\">The Asian Network on Climate Science and Technology has been set up in Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong, with support from the Malaysian Commonwealth Studies Centre at Cambridge. This has led to Asian scientists and technicians focusing on meetings in that part of the world rather than going to the United States or the EU. We need much more technical strength, solidity and co-ordination in the developing regions of the world. When you focus on that, you find that all sorts of developments are encouraged, which do not happen so well if all the technical people go and have their meetings in developed countries.<\/p><p pid=\"a340.0\/10\">One network of technical groups has been very effective in looking at the effects of climate on urban areas. It is interesting that these networks have already  developed new approaches, such as restoring communities after massive floods and using computer-based planning networks for extreme weather conditions. Some of these methods are of considerable interest, even to developed countries such as the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a340.0\/11\">In conclusion, global collaboration and sustainability are an important part of the UK&#8217;s policies, and we should work as closely as we can with all the networks of the world. As other speakers commented, the UK has big problems of its own and we should learn a lot from others.<\/p>",

Friend will forgive me, I will press on and put my remarks on the record.<\/p><p pid=\"a841.2\/2\">We are taking a whole-of-government approach as we seek to enthuse Government Departments, the devolved Administrations, local government and industry bodies alike. Increased exports are not just a public good in themselves, but provide so much more.<\/p><p pid=\"a841.2\/3\">Our strategy recognises the need to find better ways to talk to exporters, business organisations and private sector providers of export support. That was why we ran a nationwide system of consultation involving roundtables, meetings, workshops, user surveys and the like to make sure that we understood the barriers that businesses faced, and to ensure that we never go back to the low levels of exports that were bequeathed by the previous Government. Many businesses said that they did not have the expertise to export, or that they lacked knowledge about local business cultures, regulations or consumer needs. That is why the Government are taking steps to use their unique position to help companies to connect into local markets and to overcome barriers to export. That can include supporting the creation of consortiums for UK firms, thereby convening businesses from throughout a supply chain to present overseas buyers with a complete, and expert, UK offer. One such example is the Infrastructure Exports: UK consortium.<\/p><p pid=\"a841.2\/4\">We are developing new digital services to help companies to report trade barriers so that our growing trade policy function can prioritise dealing with the obstacles that are most damaging to UK businesses. We are building up&#8212;most importantly, I think&#8212;a national network of export champions involving businesses that have successfully exported and can give their expertise, advice and mentoring support so that other firms can do the same. After all, Conservative Members never forget that it is business that does business, not Government. We are simply there to facilitate and support. We have successful pilots in the midlands engine and the northern powerhouse, which represents a time-efficient and trusted way to gain the information and skills for businesses to begin to export overseas.<\/p><p pid=\"a841.2\/5\">The Department for International Trade is leveraging its extensive overseas network in 108 countries worldwide to help to attract potential local customers. This includes participation in large expos such as Dubai 2020, or the DIT-inspired Great British festival of innovation and creativity held in Hong Kong in March this year. We are supporting the Small Business Saturday movement, as well as our annual Export Week, which we are currently in, and which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State promoted in Bristol last week. I am hosting a food and drink export event in my constituency, and I hope that colleagues on both sides of the House will consider doing the same.<\/p><p pid=\"a841.2\/6\">We are supporting supplier fairs where foreign buyers can bring specific opportunities directly to UK businesses. Through the Prime Minister&#8217;s trade envoys, we have focused missions to highlight specific areas of expertise to overseas buyers. Giving UK business world-class support in overseas markets is why we have appointed Her Majesty&#8217;s trade commissioners in nine regions of the world. They have the experience and independence to tailor our export offer to their region and meet its unique challenges.<\/p><p pid=\"a841.2\/7\">I will move swiftly on through my speech as I am aware of the limited time. My hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Outwood talked about  opportunities outside Europe&#8212;she is absolutely right. The IMF originally said that 90% of global growth is expected to be outside Europe in the next 10 to  15 years, and it now predicts that even in the shorter term. The Commonwealth offers enormous opportunities as well, and we have a strong record there. In the year to June 2018, UK exports to the Commonwealth amounted to &#163;56.5 billion&#8212;a 9.5% increase from the year to 2017&#8212;which resulted in a trade surplus of  &#163;4.3 billion.<\/p><p pid=\"a841.2\/8\">We have a very positive future to look forward to. It is a shame that the only Member from the Labour party to turn up for this debate had only one thing to say, and that was to preach doom and gloom. We are proud of the exporting record of this Government, proud of the fact that we have provided record employment, and proud of the fact that we, not the Labour party, will continue in government&#8212;<\/p><p pid=\"a841.2\/9\">House adjourned without Question put (<phrase class=\"standing-order\" code=\"9(7)\">Standing Order No. 9(7)<\/phrase>).<\/p>",

We also lodged an amendment to highlight the significant opportunities for Scotland&#8217;s digital economy that are available through the UK industrial strategy. I will come back to that.<\/p><p>The minister opened the debate by emphasising&#8212;rightly&#8212;the importance of the digital economy and by providing an update on initiatives in that regard, including the digital growth fund and digital boost. We welcome those initiatives.<\/p><p>However, Scotland still faces challenges that must be addressed if we are to achieve the objectives of increasing productivity and building Scotland&#8217;s reputation as an innovative nation. I will consider how we might best address those challenges by approaching them through the framework of the Scottish Government&#8217;s economic policy of inclusive growth, internationalisation, investment and innovation.<\/p><p>On inclusive growth, the Scottish Government needs to do much more to ensure that the benefits and opportunities of digital are available to all. Ofcom has reported that the level of internet use is significantly lower in Scotland than it is in the rest of the UK. Some 23 per cent of Scottish households do not have access to the internet and 21 per cent of the population do not have basic digital skills.<\/p><p>Finlay Carson, Jamie Halcro Johnston and Colin Smyth said that limited digital access is of particular concern in rural areas. According to Audit Scotland, 370,000 households in Scotland still lack superfast internet speeds, and the issue is expected to be resolved for fewer than half of those households by the Scottish Government&#8217;s original 2021 deadline. As Mike Rumbles said, that is glacial progress, indeed. It is clear from the data that the Scottish Government needs to do much more if it is to meet its original targets and prevent hundreds of thousands of people across Scotland from being digitally excluded.<\/p><p>On investment, the recent report &#8220;Automatic &#8230; For the people? How Scotland can harness the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution to increase economic and social prosperity&#8221; highlighted concern about the increasing digital skills gap that is emerging in schools, colleges, apprenticeships and universities. James Kelly, Patrick Harvie, Daniel Johnson and other members mentioned that.<\/p><p>The issue reflects the position after 11 years of SNP Government. Since 2008, the number of maths teachers has declined by 15 per cent, the number of science teachers has declined by 12 per cent and the number of computer science teachers is down by nearly a quarter. There has also been a decline in the number of college places and apprenticeships that are dedicated to science and digital subjects. If we are to equip Scotland&#8217;s workforce for a digital future, we need to address that underinvestment or the workforce of the future will not be prepared to capitalise on the digital opportunities.<\/p><p>On internationalisation, we face a critical shortage of digital support in the business environment. Nora Senior, the chair of the Strategic Board for Enterprise and Skills, told the Economy, Jobs and Fair Work Committee that only 9 per cent of businesses in Scotland have embedded digital in their business operations compared with 43 per cent of businesses in competitor countries. The digital gap presents a massive challenge if we are to increase productivity, and it presents a massive challenge for companies that are looking to increase their global trade and exports.<\/p><p>The global export market and international trade are increasingly dominated by online commerce and digital platforms. I saw that at first hand earlier this year during a trade mission to Hong Kong and China. I met a number of trading companies whose business models for import and export are now predominantly online. That means that they trade largely with other businesses that will use only e-commerce and digital platforms. Scottish businesses will lose out on massive trading opportunities that are available in the global market if we do not address that digital gap.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a886.0\/1\">My Lords, I rise to speak to my Amendment 25, which is a very specific amendment and rather esoteric, but I will come on to that in a moment because I really just wanted to register my agreement with the previous speakers that this Bill is far too restrictive. We are banning ivory items and ivory inlays and items containing ivory that have no possibility of being recarved in the Far East for sale on to that market and no prospect of having any value in themselves. An ivory carver sitting in Vietnam, for instance, would have no interest in carving a sliver of ivory to go into a false 18th century box. It would just make no sense at all and it would be nonsense. We ought to have a sense of proportion about what we are trying to do in this Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"a886.0\/2\">What we are trying to do is to stop large lumps of ivory being exported to countries where they will be recarved and converted into the items that their populations think are attractive and for which they will pay good money. This is not an emotional business; it is purely a financial business. If we ban the export of large items of ivory, or their sale in this country&#8212;because they will be smuggled out of this country eventually, just as rhino horns are smuggled out of here, which is a similar problem&#8212;we will achieve what we can achieve in respect of saving the African elephant using the antique ivory trade.<\/p><p pid=\"a886.0\/3\">As has been said, the protection of the African elephant is not down to what is sold as Christie&#8217;s in King Street in London. It is down to whether we can finance the actions against the poachers, whether we can train the police and protection officers in those countries, whether we can arm them properly, and whether we can ensure that the supply routes where the ivory is taken out of the country are shut down. That is what it is really all about. It is not about this gesture politics Bill. That is what it is about, and that is what we should be concentrating on.<\/p><p pid=\"a886.0\/4\">I add something that has not been mentioned because it is not politically correct to do so. A lot of ivory is not obtained by rogue poachers; it is done with the connivance of people who are very powerful in the countries where the elephants are, and they make a lot of money out of it.<\/p><p pid=\"a886.0\/5\">My noble friend the Minister assures me that several of the countries which have large numbers of elephants are in favour of us banning the sale of ivory. I am perhaps too cynical. Perhaps I have lived too long a life dealing with rogues and rascals both in politics and in business, but if I were trying to make money out of selling ivory, I would try to shut down part of the market which I thought conceivably&#8212;however misguidedly&#8212;could be competition. In other words, I would of course say, &#8220;Ban the ivory market. Ban, ban, ban&#8221;, so that I can kill the elephants in the savannah and make money by selling those tusks to Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"a886.0\/6\">I should apologise, because perhaps I should have made that speech during Committee but, as some noble Lords will know, I was under the depredations of various surgeons then, so I apologise for not making it then.<\/p><p pid=\"a886.0\/7\">My Amendment 25 is rather esoteric. It is even more esoteric than the Northumbrian pipes of the noble Baroness, Lady Quin. Under the Bill, an item which is detachable and can stand alone is an individual item and is therefore treated as such. This is not usually important, but it is very important if you are dealing with scientific instruments. The way that 18th-century or early 19th-century mercury barometers are regulated is by a little knob that pulls out. It is detachable and independent of the barometer itself. You would use it to adjust the vernier on the scale to measure the height of the mercury and to put pressure on the mercury reservoir at the bottom of the barometer, when you regulated the barometer to show the correct barometric pressure, to make sure that the mercury was at the right level. So it has two functions.<\/p><p pid=\"a886.0\/8\">My amendment is specifically designed to say that this knob should be treated as part of the barometer, not as a separate item, because these knobs were almost always an ivory disc&#8212;not dissimilar, I have to say, to the discs used in so many other things, such as portrait miniatures, tickets for theatres, and so on, which have no commercial value for recarving. They have commercial value because there are artistic elements to them, but the knob has no commercial value. If I tell your Lordships that they are 2.54 centimetres in diameter, those of you with a scientific bent will know that that is an inch. They are of a maximum of an inch in diameter, very thin and on a metal shank. All I am trying to do by the amendment is to ensure that antique dealers do not have to throw away the integral knob when they sell the barometer.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b464.0\/1\">My Lords, it is always a great pleasure to follow the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, and I congratulate her and the staff of her distinguished sub-committee for their immense labours in producing a report on this highly complex and intractable issue. I was interested to hear that it is regarded as being the second largest stumbling block to the withdrawal agreement which is in the process of being negotiated.<\/p><p pid=\"b464.0\/2\">We are looking at a number of agreements, the first of which is the withdrawal agreement, which will cover a number of components: the question of finance&#8212;how much to pay&#8212;citizens&#8217; rights and the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. We expect future agreements to cover the relationship between the UK and the EU in a number of areas, principally trade and security, and there will be other agreements to cover ongoing participation in the EU programmes to which the noble Baroness referred. The governance of each of these agreements contains three elements or components. The first is management of the agreement, the second is dispute settlement, and the third is enforcement after dispute settlement.<\/p><p pid=\"b464.0\/3\">The withdrawal agreement has been published in draft form with the areas of agreement coloured in green. From this it appears that agreement has been reached under draft Article 157 for the establishment of a joint committee responsible for the supervision and implementation of the agreement. That covers the first management component of the agreement. The joint committee is to be a political committee, but one of its functions under draft paragraph 4(c) is to,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b464.0\/4\">&#8220;seek appropriate ways and methods of preventing problems that might arise in areas covered by this Agreement or of resolving disputes that may arise regarding the interpretation and application of this Agreement&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b464.0\/5\">That is intended to be the first stage, the political stage, in the settlement of disputes, but what about the second or appeal stage of dispute resolution? There is still substantial disagreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union over how to deal with this and how a dispute settlement should be enforced. On the one hand, the EU has proposed that the European Court of Justice should be the final arbiter because it says that the draft withdrawal agreement still embodies many provisions of EU law and the CJEU has declared itself to be the only binding interpretative authority of EU law. On the other hand, the United Kingdom has argued that it is unacceptable that the appeal body, the final resolution body, in a dispute over the withdrawal agreement or indeed any agreement it concludes with the EU, should be a court whose judges are drawn only from the continuing EU member states. That is the nub of the matter.<\/p><p pid=\"b464.0\/6\">Of course, the issue is bedevilled by the irrational demonisation of the European Court of Justice, first by those who campaigned to leave the EU and later by the Prime Minister, who has lost no opportunity to declare that leaving the jurisdiction of the CJEU is one of her red lines. I have never understood how that court could have been painted in such scarlet colours. In the first place, its function has never been to lay down draconian law which binds us all in servitude, but to interpret law which, even if it starts with the Council of Ministers or the Commission, has been subjected to a democratic process in the European Parliament. The United Kingdom has, since joining the EU, had full representation in these three bodies.<\/p><p pid=\"b464.0\/7\">Secondly, we have always provided a distinguished judge to sit on the court. Sir Konrad Schiemann, the former United Kingdom-nominated judge of the  court between 2004 and 2012, said in evidence to the Committee that,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b464.0\/8\">&#8220;in the Luxembourg court the tradition is that you lose your nationality the moment you join the court, which makes no distinction between judges of one nationality and another. &#8230; The tradition was that you were not there to plug the point of view of your national Government. That was not your job. Your job was to try to decide the law in the light of the general European interest&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b464.0\/9\">That, indeed, is the way in which the Court of Justice has operated: it is not a court of competing national judges.<\/p><p pid=\"b464.0\/10\">Thirdly, the United Kingdom has, through the power of its legal advisers and advocates, been very successful in the European Court of Justice. The European Commission does not bring cases that it does not expect to win. Of the 63 cases the Commission brought against the United Kingdom that resulted in rulings between 2012 and 2016, the UK submitted a defence in only 30 of those 68 and conceded the rest. In the cases the United Kingdom defended, its success rate was 53%. Its overall success rate of all cases in the period 2003-16 was 25%, the highest of any of the 28 member states. Penalties have never been imposed on the United Kingdom by the Court of Justice for failing to abide by its judgments. In other words, our Governments have always accepted its judgments, even in the cases that we have lost.<\/p><p pid=\"b464.0\/11\">The Government&#8217;s response to the Committee&#8217;s report of <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-07-05\">5 July<\/phrase> says that they will &#8220;respect the role&#8221; of the European Court of Justice in the interpretation of EU law in disputes between member states. They expect the EU in return to &#8220;respect the role&#8221; of our Supreme Court. That is a gnomic utterance: what does it mean? I hope the Minister will enlighten us. It certainly does not help to resolve the current dispute on the appropriate legal body or arbitration process to resolve disputes.<\/p><p pid=\"b464.0\/12\">The Committee explored the idea of locking on to the EFTA Court as an independent judicial body, but is rightly not enthusiastic about it because it would require the agreement of Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland radically to revise the purpose and structure of that court to accommodate a far greater caseload than it was designed to carry and to extend its jurisdiction in economic matters into areas of justice, security and family law. It is clearly not appropriate.<\/p><p pid=\"b464.0\/13\">Is there not room for more creative thinking? The institution of the European Court of Justice exists. Its physical building and its administration exist. The United Kingdom has played its full part in its procedures, has been part of its development and has been successful both in the judicial sphere and in advocacy before it. Would it not be sensible to create a special chamber of the European Court of Justice for dealing with disputes arising out of the special circumstances of our leaving the EU? We are not leaving Europe. The judges of that special chamber could comprise an equal number of members of the continuing court and members or former members of our Supreme Court, together with an eminent president from a neutral jurisdiction. This is the important point: since it would be a part of the Court of Justice, it could meet the European Union&#8217;s requirement that only that court can interpret provisions of EU law where that this necessary. At the same time, there would be participation from the United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"b464.0\/14\">That special chamber would be of particular advantage if disputes arose in respect of the future agreements: the elusive trade deal, agreements concerning our participation in existing EU programmes, the security stuff, the European arrest warrant, Interpol, data protection, family matters and in those areas where the Government wish to continue to participate and co-operate in other fields. It could also be a forum for pursuing individual rights, those of European Union citizens in the United Kingdom and United Kingdom citizens in the European state. We would not want European citizens in the United Kingdom to have remedies solely in the courts of this country if that meant that our citizens abroad in Europe would have remedies only from a European court.<\/p><p pid=\"b464.0\/15\">I cannot help comparing the present impasse to the successful negotiations over Hong Kong, where the innovative principle of &#8220;one nation, two systems&#8221; was developed, and the Court of Final Appeal, which replaced the Privy Council, introduced non-permanent judges to supplement its Bench&#8212;I see one of them here today. Judges from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand play a part in assisting the Bench in the Hong Kong court.<\/p><p pid=\"b464.0\/16\">Incidentally, I believe that the answer to the Northern Ireland impasse would be to declare Northern Ireland a special administrative region. With direct access to both the EU and the UK, it would be highly attractive as a centre for financial and other services&#8212;legal, accountancy and banking. I am sure that Wales would jump at the chance of becoming a second Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"b464.0\/17\">Would the Government&#8217;s aversion to the European Court of Justice, fuelled by the empty and ill-informed rhetoric of the Brexiters, stand in the way of such a solution? Surely it would be more acceptable to the public of this country to know that if enforcement proceedings in the nature of fines or the withdrawal or suspension of concessions were imposed on us, it would be as a result of an order of an established and transparent court, whose proceedings were open and readily accessible, rather than some obscure, supranational arbitration body such as that outlined in the Government&#8217;s response to this excellent report.<\/p>",

Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Frank Field\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10197\">the Member for Birkenhead (Frank Field)<\/phrase> and my near neighbour <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Simon Clarke\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25657\">the hon. Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland (Mr Clarke)<\/phrase> on securing the debate. It is great to come together across the party divide to champion our area, because the hon. Gentleman and I both recognise how freeport status for Teesport could help and support our constituents.<\/p><p pid=\"a171.0\/2\">My constituency lies at the mouth of the River Tees, where the North sea brings its cargo from around the world and ships queue to bring their goods to the third-largest port in the UK. It is from that port that  steel from Redcar&#8217;s blast furnaces once sailed forth to build the world. Today, sadly, the site is desolate; the steelworks is now closed, and the 3,000 jobs it sustained are gone. But the land sits waiting, ready to drive a new industrial renaissance for Teesside. A freeport could be the key to unlocking the site&#8217;s huge value and delivering thousands more jobs. It could create employment and economic activity in an area where the need is high.<\/p><p pid=\"a171.0\/3\">The same is true across the UK, as the hon. Gentleman said. Of the country&#8217;s 30 largest ports, 17, including my own, are in the bottom quartile of local authorities in the index of multiple deprivation. They are crying out for the inward investment that a freeport could draw in, so we must take a radical look at proposals to support their economies.<\/p><p pid=\"a171.0\/4\">Like the hon. Gentleman, I make no apology for lobbying for freeport status on behalf of the port in my constituency. Teesport has strong structural advantages that should make it favoured for freeport status, including a deep-water facility that provides lock-free access to the sea and strong road and rail services. The facility already handles 5,000 vessels and 40 million tonnes of cargo a year. The port is integral to the Teesside manufacturing complex, incorporating chemicals, engineering, renewable energy and agritech.<\/p><p pid=\"a171.0\/5\">The South Tees development corporation is overseeing the former SSI site, the biggest industrial opportunity that the UK has seen since the second world war. The development corporation&#8212;the only one of its kind outside London&#8212;has set out its ambition to create 20,000 additional jobs in high-value manufacturing over 25 years, with &#163;1 billion in gross value added for the local economy. That programme would be substantially enhanced by the creation of a freeport. Incorporating the development corporation area into a freeport area, together with the Teesport facility, and in conjunction with adjacent industrial sites such as Wilton and North Shore, could help the region to build on its strengths in chemicals, steel, energy and logistics and realise our vision to become the most attractive place in the country for high-value manufacturing.<\/p><p pid=\"a171.0\/6\">With the North East of England Process Industry Cluster leading the way, Teesside is the location for the largest integrated chemical complex in the UK&#8212;the second largest in western Europe in manufacturing capacity. The sector has inputs to a range of other key industries such as aerospace, automotive and life sciences. It is highly productive and competitive but faces a number of challenges, such as increasing global competition, high operating costs and skills shortages. A freeport could be part of a range of policy solutions to maintain and enhance the attractiveness of investment in the chemical sector in the UK and on Teesside. Freeport status for Teesside could make the area the gateway of the north, rebalancing the economy and making the region&#8217;s manufacturing base more competitive and attractive.<\/p><p pid=\"a171.0\/7\">As the hon. Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland noted, a study commissioned this year by the global construction company Mace Group shows that a freeport in Tees Valley could create more than 17,500 jobs and contribute more than &#163;1 billion to the local economy&#8212;more than enough to offset any loss to the Treasury in import tax revenue. That should be considered when we weigh up the economic advantages. For an area in which unemployment is above the national average and many in work have to travel further afield or take insecure jobs, the proposal could be transformative.<\/p><p pid=\"a171.0\/8\">As I mentioned, there are many areas similar to mine that have suffered deprivation and industrial decline, and that could see an economic boost delivered by a freeport. A Freeport could also future-proof many of our other industries, which are battling to stay increasingly competitive in turbulent world markets. We only have to look around the world to see how our competitors are taking full advantage of freeports. Approximately 3,500 freeport zones exist, employing 66 million people across 135 countries. We are clearly lagging behind the rest of the world in this area.<\/p><p pid=\"a171.0\/9\">Freeport zones are recognised around the world as playing a major role in retaining, reshoring and growing domestic manufacturing activity and boosting trade. There are 250 free trade zones in the US, and Freeport zones also play a major role in the economies of Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. However, I would urge caution when we are developing the model, to ensure that there is no erosion of employment rights, environmental rights or health and safety rights. It is really important that we look at the models that are being used around the world if we come to develop our own.<\/p><p pid=\"a171.0\/10\">My view diverges slightly from that of the hon. Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, who said the advantages of freeports are dependent on being outside the EU. We could be taking advantage of them right now&#8212;indeed, he mentioned the legislation that we had in the past for models in the UK. Other member states already have freeports, including the ports of Bremerhaven in Germany, Le Verdon in France, and Shannon in the Republic of Ireland. In fact, there are currently over 85 freeport zones in the European Union. There are no barriers, but there is a lack of political will.<\/p><p pid=\"a171.0\/11\">While this is the first debate that we have dedicated to the benefits of freeports, it is not the first time we have made this case in the House. Many Members, including myself and my neighbour, the hon. Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, have championed freeports for our own areas; indeed, I tabled amendments to the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill that would have established the legislative basis for free zones to return to the UK. Until 2012, we had the legislation in place for five freeports, but unfortunately the statutory instruments creating them expired, and freeports were never fully explored. Moreover, the Secretary of State is already empowered to designate any freeport by statutory instrument under section 100A of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979, which was referred to earlier and which is still in force.<\/p><p pid=\"a171.0\/12\">I say to the Minister that the Government have an opportunity here to deliver transformative change to deprived areas across the UK, including my own. There could be no better expression of the northern powerhouse than delivering a freeport boost to northern ports and ports across the country, stimulating manufacturing, rebalancing the economy and creating jobs. I beg the Government to give serious consideration to this issue without delay.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b2332.1\/1\">My Lords, I am afraid I am going to strike a rather discordant note. I want to focus on Amendments 59 and 60. It is widely accepted that by far the most significant markets for ivory are in the Far East. The Secretary of State acknowledged in his impact assessment that the United Kingdom ivory market has not been linked to the trade in recently poached ivory. There are many other factors at play in the illicit international trade in wildlife that will have a far greater impact on demand for ivory than the trade in antiques here in the United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"b2332.1\/2\">With respect to the noble Lords who have moved these amendments, I therefore struggle to understand how the requirements proposed in Amendments 59 and 60&#8212;to report on the impact of this Bill on the elephant populations in Africa and on the demand for ivory in other countries&#8212;would be carried out. How exactly would one attribute to the Bill a change in the demand in Hong Kong for raw ivory, for example?<\/p><p pid=\"b2332.1\/3\">With respect to the noble Lords who have proposed these reports, there appears to be a premise behind both amendments that the UK&#8217;s fairly minimal international trade in objects made from ivory is encouraging the demand for ivory in the countries of the Far East. As I explained on Monday in Committee, if we exclude piano keys, the total number of antiques incorporating ivory exported from the UK to the entire world amounted to 766 items in 2016 and just over 1,000 last year. The exported objects comprise a  mixture of both solid ivory carvings and objects that incorporate ivory, such as musical instruments or furniture with inlay. The latter are of no interest to buyers in the Far East. As I have previously said, these numbers are small fry when compared to the volumes of ivory traded in the ivory consumer markets.<\/p><p pid=\"b2332.1\/4\">I was tempted to support these amendments so that afterwards I could say, &#8220;I told you so&#8221;, but I do not believe that we should spend taxpayers&#8217; money in that way, especially when I know the answer already. We have to recognise the most significant factor in stopping the trade in poached ivory is not whether the UK is selling antiques or not, but whether the restrictions promised by China and Hong Kong are effectively enforced and whether it is possible to prevent the market from transferring to neighbouring countries in the region.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a2241.0\/1\">My Lords, the breaking news today is that Monsieur Barnier, the EU negotiator, may have blinked. Also, the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has agreed to stay on. Being reluctant but optimistic on Brexit, this portends well. In the circumstances, this Trade Bill is a necessary piece in the Brexit jigsaw.<\/p><p pid=\"a2241.0\/2\">A question to start, however, is this: will this Trade Bill survive the environment in which it must serve or will it require amending once the conditions under which we are leaving the European Union are known? It would appear that the architects of the Brexit vision did not anticipate the complexity of the negotiations in addition to the unfolding contagion in important emerging markets together with trade tariffs distorting globalisation, all of which could become centre-stage challenges. Those are insecure foundations on which to build a secure future.<\/p><p pid=\"a2241.0\/3\">The noble Lord, Lord Lilley, who is not in his place, did make some substantive points about renegotiating trade agreements; nevertheless, the Government have to shoulder the consequences of their policies and actions. History will judge whether the architects of Brexit made a fundamental error of judgment by looking to the future through blinkered vision, along with a negotiating flaw of not being sensitive to the unsurprising strength of opinion across the Channel that could possibly haunt us further. Time will tell, and shortly at that. At this late stage we must be flexible, opportunistic and respectfully Machiavellian. All that said, we are where we are&#8212;but where are we? We must either wrap up what was started or change tack, decisively searching for an assured future. As Cicero said, &#8220;Where there&#8217;s life, there&#8217;s hope&#8221;, so in that we may take some comfort.<\/p><p pid=\"a2241.0\/4\">There are many aspects to this Bill, but I will focus my central remarks on a cornerstone of our economy: financial services. The Bill represents a building block, and it needs to do so. It is inconceivable that the EU 27 would allow as important a sector as financial services to remain fully offshore. Brexit may indeed mean Brexit, but Brexit also means consequences. Post-Brexit  pressure will undoubtedly grow on the City of London and other centres around the United Kingdom. The European Central Bank is already implementing its location to the continent in mandatory stages. The combination of principle and the possibility of rich pickings will place further sustained pressure on the financial services sector. The list of annual rankings of international financial centres is published today or tomorrow. Let us keep an eye on how London fares both now and in subsequent years, having mostly maintained its position at number one up to now.<\/p><p pid=\"a2241.0\/5\">The financial services sector is on the move and we must be diligent and keep abreast of that. The likes of Frankfurt, Paris, Toronto, Tokyo, Seoul, Astana and Moscow along with others are the founding members of the newly established World Alliance of International Financial Centres, to be headquartered in Frankfurt and incorporated under Belgian law. Currently, London has observer status only. The Minister may wish to become acquainted with this alliance.<\/p><p pid=\"a2241.0\/6\">Then there is China&#8217;s increasing influence in Europe and the world at large. As in times past when the pound was superseded by the dollar, so a potential parallel yuan could become a base currency for the changing face of global geo-economics, which the likes of Ankara, Tehran and others might find increasingly appealing. China&#8217;s impact is growing. It is delivering west-bound the infrastructure that supports economic growth and the development of the old Silk Road. The UK has experience of and proven ability in supporting and promoting infrastructure development. Together we can advance east-bound, thus increasing trade and connectivity, improving quality of life and reducing the cost of living. In the first five years since the belt and road initiative was announced, 103 countries worldwide have signed 118 agreements with China. China is delivering west-bound the infrastructure that supports economic growth and development along the old Silk Road route and far beyond. The UK&#8217;s expertise is considered to be well placed, with useful experience in supporting and promoting that infrastructure development.<\/p><p pid=\"a2241.0\/7\">But corporate partnership in the spirit of local content is fundamental and I would urge UK players to seek out co-operation agreements with local players of merit, wherever the trillions of dollars are going to be unfolded. Many countries and regions along the belt and road have considered integrating the initiative with their own development programmes&#8212;including Mongolia&#8217;s Prairie Road, Kazakhstan&#8217;s Nurly Zhol, and the Eurasian Economic Union&#8212;with Pakistan having high expectations, together with the EU&#8217;s Juncker investment plan. The belt and road initiative has been incorporated into the documents of many international mechanisms including the UN, the G20 and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.<\/p><p pid=\"a2241.0\/8\">The US-China trade war is not close to being resolved and its impact is already being experienced in Asia, particularly in those countries that have existing good trade relations with China such as South Korea and Singapore. UK trade with these countries has had an upward trend during the last years and is likely to be impacted as these countries get caught in the crossfire. China warned yesterday that it will take countermeasures  if the United States escalates the trade war. The United Kingdom needs to take a holistic approach. Technological advancement makes access to any financial centre easy. This is a good time to look to the future and fully understand and respect the importance of partnerships. As Amina Turgulova, head of global markets at the Astana International Financial Centre in Kazakhstan reminded me just this morning, while London will always be an attractive destination with many opportunities, there must be a clear and innovative development plan based on partnership. It follows that it is imperative that we build strategic links with other capital markets. Linkages and partnerships are paramount. The London Stock Exchange Group is working on links with the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and the London Metal Exchange belongs to the Hong Kong exchange.<\/p><p pid=\"a2241.0\/9\">There is a real necessity for a regulatory framework to adjust to changes; this will distinguish the leading financial centres from the rest. No less a body than TheCityUK is calling for the UK to make the most of the once-in-a-generation opportunity to recalibrate and repurpose its trade and investment policy to benefit the wider economy once it leaves the EU. I commend its thinking to the Government and refer the Minister and her team to its report of January 2017, entitled Future UK Trade and Investment Policy. TheCityUK&#8217;s latest report of <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-08-30\">30 August<\/phrase> 2018, entitled A UK-EU association agreement and future UK free trade agreements, in effect builds on last year&#8217;s report by going further into the detail of the issues that will concern financial and related professional services. I share many of its conclusions.<\/p><p pid=\"a2241.0\/10\">The potential presented by deals that focus on regulatory coherence and co-operation, as well as next-generation international trade and investment agreements, would not only strengthen London&#8217;s position as the leading global financial centre but bring new growth opportunities to key financial centres across the country. Trade policy is useful ammunition in the tool box; equally, it serves as a carrot. I absolutely recognise the importance of trade, which is vital to allowing people to work their way out of poverty, supporting job creation, value addition and clean industrialisation. A message to the world at large is that trade is as critical to us as it is to others. The Government should ensure, however, that equivalent levels of market access are accorded. The Minister referred to reciprocal access.<\/p><p pid=\"a2241.0\/11\">Agreements with implications such as these for consumers, businesses, development and human rights, to which should be added the scourge of corruption, should have maximum scrutiny. As I understand it, it is suggested that the replication of some FTAs and EPAs is the way forward. I can see the benefits, but does this approach merely store up problems for the future and need to be challenged? Scrutiny and approval of all agreements on the overseas front should become mandatory. I anticipated a shake of the Minister&#8217;s head. Her opening remarks served as a comfort to a degree. However, although I am broadly supportive of much that is before us, I request that the Government reflect on the benefits of scrutiny and participation by allowing a framework that covers consultation with stakeholders. I was enthused by the reference to public support.<\/p><p pid=\"a2241.0\/12\">We need a more formal system of accountability, definition of the devolved Administrations&#8217; role, full debate, approval by both Houses&#8212;including a dedicated committee&#8212;and parliamentary scrutiny in the process proposed. I recognise that this requires a seismic change but our country&#8217;s future should centre on change to prepare for tomorrow&#8217;s world. The role of Parliament in approval and ratification processes for international trade agreements&#8212;enshrining the Ponsonby rule, whereby international treaties have to be laid before Parliament 21 days before ratification&#8212;should be embraced unequivocally. The Government&#8217;s performance in ratification timelines is, if I may choose my word carefully, precarious. This needs attention.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>This week, more than 1,400 people travelling from 47 countries will attend the 2018 social enterprise world forum here in Edinburgh. Delegates will have the opportunity to hear from pioneering social entrepreneurs, take part in debates and benefit from master classes.<\/p><p>Many will know that the forum, now celebrating its 10th anniversary, is a product of Scotland. In 2008, with the support of the Scottish Government and its enterprise agencies, Community Enterprise in Scotland&#8212;a social enterprise in Glasgow&#8212;delivered the inaugural event in Edinburgh in 2008. For the subsequent 10 years, this Scottish export has toured the world, with cities competing for the opportunity to play host. In cities from Johannesburg to Hong Kong, more than 7,500 social entrepreneurs and supporters have attended to date, contributing knowledge and passion to this global movement, and since that first event back in 2008, Scotland has secured its reputation as a world-leading social enterprise nation.<\/p><p>This time last year, my predecessor Angela Constance travelled to New Zealand to participate in the formal handover ceremony confirming Edinburgh as 2018 host. By doing so, she confirmed Scotland as the only country to host the world forum twice. I sincerely pay tribute to Angela Constance for her dedication to the sector.<\/p><p>We should be very proud that our country has taken such a lead and is viewed as leading the global social enterprise movement. Although this week&#8217;s gathering is of countries that are separated by many miles, what unites them and each and every social enterprise is the determination to do good and put something back into communities and societies and the fact that they are motivated by a belief in the ability to transform positively.<\/p><p>The chance to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the social enterprise world forum provides us with an opportunity to reflect on the growth of social enterprise in Scotland over that decade. However, although we are contributing to the debate that recognises the forum&#8217;s 10th anniversary, Scotland&#8217;s association with socially responsible business is much older than that, going from New Lanark in the 19th century, in my constituency of Clydesdale, to the co-operative and community business movements of the 1970s and right up to the present day. Over the past decade, the Scottish Government and all parties in this Parliament have continued to champion social enterprise, working with the sector to put in place a comprehensive ecosystem of support. Incubators, accelerators, free business advice, 16 local social enterprise networks, leadership programmes and social investment are all on offer for aspiring social entrepreneurs, whether they are starting a cafe supporting refugees or a fitness gym providing mental health support.<\/p><p>The Scottish Government knows the power of using social enterprise as a tool to tackle inequality and promote inclusive economic growth. However, social enterprise does not only empower communities; it is also incredibly good for the economy. The sector contributes &#163;2 million gross value added each year and employs around 80,000 people.<\/p><p>The inclusive economic growth that social enterprises demonstrate is why, in December 2016, we launched Scotland&#8217;s first ever dedicated social enterprise strategy. Fully co-produced with the sector and set over 10 years, it sets out three strategic priorities: stimulating more social entrepreneurship, developing stronger organisations and realising market opportunities. Since the launch of the strategy in December 2016 and its accompanying action plan in April 2017, we have invested more than &#163;7 million to realise those ambitions. That has included more than &#163;2 million for the social entrepreneurs fund, which provides advice and seed capital to more than 160 start-ups; &#163;660,000 for the Social Enterprise Academy to get social enterprise learning into every primary and secondary school in Scotland, reaching more than 300 schools to date; &#163;2 million for free business support through Just Enterprise, with more than 1,800 social enterprise leaders benefiting; &#163;270,000 for the community shares Scotland service, providing an innovative way for communities to raise the funding that they need and supporting projects such as Govanhill baths and the Rockfield centre; &#163;200,000 for Big Issue Invest to deliver its &#8220;Power up Scotland&#8221; programme, providing corporate mentoring and investment to 13 social enterprises over the next two years; more than &#163;100,000 for the Council of Ethnic Minority Voluntary Sector Organisations, which will support more social enterprises such as Radiant and Brighter, an employability social enterprise supporting migrant communities in Glasgow that I visited last month; and more than &#163;400,000 for the partnership for procurement programme, which provides technical support to people who are interested in forming consortia to bid for large contracts.<\/p><p>The sector continues to grow. The Scottish Government is committed to conducting a census of social enterprise in Scotland every two years. In September last year, the results of the second census were announced. There are now more than 5,000 social enterprises in Scotland, which represents a growth of almost 10 per cent since 2015. Women lead 64 per cent of them, including Hey Girls, which was recently chosen to deliver the Scottish Government&#8217;s initiative to provide free sanitary products to school pupils and students. Some 79 per cent sell directly to the public. Brewgooder is an example of one of those. It produces a social enterprise craft beer with profits going to tackle water poverty in Malawi. Rural Scotland now accounts for 37 per cent of Scotland&#8217;s social enterprises, despite being home to only 18 per cent of the nation&#8217;s population, with the highest densities of social enterprise being found in the Highlands and Islands. Further, 70 per cent of our social enterprises are led by, and are accountable to, people in particular communities, such as the Mull and Iona Community Trust, which was set up by residents with a focus on sustainable development and which recently celebrated its 20th year.<\/p><p>The sector is growing its reach internationally, too. Some 7 per cent of our social enterprises trade internationally, such as the Social Enterprise Academy, which now operates in 12 countries.<\/p><p>Scotland has a great deal to celebrate, especially now that local authorities are developing their own strategic approaches. Only last night, Glasgow City Council launched its local social enterprise strategy, developed in partnership with Glasgow&#8217;s social enterprise network.<\/p><p>With so much happening across Scotland, and given the vibrancy of the sector, it is vital that this story is properly captured, understood and shared for the benefit of all. That is why I am delighted to announce that the Scottish Government will provide &#163;90,000 to the Yunus centre for social business and health at Glasgow Caledonian University&#8212;named in honour of Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus&#8212;to help to establish Scotland&#8217;s social enterprise collection. That work will build on existing materials held by the university in honour of John Pearce, an influential figure in Scotland&#8217;s community enterprise movement.<\/p>",

I will not deal at length with Amendment 17 moved by my noble friend except to say that I have considerable sympathy with it.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/2\">Starting with Amendments 18 and 19, the 10% threshold chosen for the Clause 7 exemption is another major aspect of the Bill that has caused enormous concern among those who handle antiques. In Committee in the other place, the Minister, David Rutley, rightly explained that objects,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b2147.0\/3\">&#8220;such as inlaid furniture or a dish or a teapot with a small ivory handle are not valued on the basis of their ivory content. Further, in such pieces, the ivory is incidental and integral to the item. It cannot be easily removed, so it is not vulnerable to recarving&#8221;.&#8212;[<i>|Official Report<\/i>, Commons, Ivory Bill Committee, 14\/6\/18; col. 92.]<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/4\">The Minister also made it clear at column 98 that the Government have no intention of unduly affecting artistic and cultural heritage.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/5\">There are plenty of objects with, say, 20% or 30% ivory content, and thus where ivory is still not the predominant material, such as inlaid or veneered Indian boxes and antique silver coffee pots, to which precisely the same characteristics apply; they are not valued on the basis of their ivory content. The ivory is incidental and integral to the item and thus not vulnerable to recarving. The Minister in the other place also said:<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/6\">&#8220;It was refreshing and encouraging to hear in evidence that the 20% threshold will work for the vast majority of musical instruments, and that the enforcement agencies feel comfortable that that is a way to take the process forward&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Commons, Ivory Bill Committee, 14\/6\/18; col. 109.]<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/7\">It is therefore a mystery why the Government have opted for a 10% threshold for one group of items and 20% for another. It is inconsistent and it is illogical.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/8\">What are the particular features of an object such as an inlaid Georgian tea caddy with 12% ivory inlay that renders it any more likely to be reused or valued for its ivory content than a musical instrument such as a baroque lute containing the same proportion of decorative ivory inlay? In the Second Reading debate in the other place and in the Public Bill Committee sittings, no examples were given by the Minister there of known cases where antique objects inlaid with ivory had been valued based on their ivory content or had been bought for the purpose of having their ivory removed. Neither do I believe were Art Deco bronze and ivory sculptures cited, nor were antique silver tea and coffee services demonstrated to have been sold for these purposes. In fact no evidence has been brought forward by anyone in any of the debates to suggest that where ivory represents less than half of the volume of a historical object, it contributes to poaching.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/9\">To discover whether items made from a mixture of ivory and other materials are being bought by people from the Far East, it would be helpful to have some data. Unfortunately, as I have already mentioned, the readily accessible UK export data for ivory held by the CITES secretariat distinguishes only piano keys from other carved items, so we do not know how many inlaid wooden boxes or bronze and ivory sculptures are being exported to China, but I would hazard a guess that the number is very low. It would be surprising if the Animal and Plant Health Agency had evidence of antique items where ivory is not the principal material being purchased in vast numbers and at prices well above the value of their ivory content, with a view to removing the ivory in China and selling it at the low price commanded by second-hand ivory.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/10\">The witness from the International Fund for Animal Welfare to the Bill Committee in the other place spoke on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-06-12\">12 June<\/phrase> 2018 at column 14 and quoted $450 per kg as the price of raw ivory. A Georgian sterling silver tea pot worth &#163;2,000 might contain an ivory handle weighing 80 grams. Using the IFAW figure, that 80 grams would  currently be worth &#163;36. As an old and pre-shaped piece, it would be worth even less, perhaps only &#163;10. Why would someone pay &#163;2,000 for the purpose of acquiring ivory worth just &#163;10? If they removed the ivory they would also damage the integrity, and thus reduce the value, of the item for which they had paid &#163;2,000.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/11\">How should we respond to the grandmother who owns a genuine early Victorian silver coffee pot with an original ivory handle or insulator, who is prevented from selling it and using the &#163;1,800 proceeds to contribute to her grandchild&#8217;s university education? No one has demonstrated how a genuine antique of this nature has any connection to the poaching of elephants, so why should its owner be penalised in this way? The Minister in the other place referred in Committee at column 92 to the federal system in the US having a 50% by volume limit combined with a 200 gram weight threshold. It is understood that this restriction applies only in respect of objects that are not antiques.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/12\">For interstate sales of genuine antiques there is no de minimis requirement at all. A visual inspection of an object will usually be all that is necessary to decide whether the ivory content falls above or below a 50% threshold. A 50% cut-off would therefore in fact lead to better levels of compliance by the public. In contrast, a 10% threshold falls right across the middle of the range of ivory contents found in boxes decorated with small pieces of ivory inlay. That 10% means that both the owners of these items and enforcement officers will invariably be required to perform complex calculations to determine the proportion of ivory they contain. There will be uncertainty as to the accuracy of the assessments. All of this is entirely unnecessary because regardless of whether the ivory content falls above or below 10%, small slithers of inlay have no possible re use. It should be noted that the cases where wildlife groups have questioned the age of ivory have always focused on solid ivory carvings and not on objects such as bronze and ivory sculptures or measuring instruments where ivory does not represent the majority material.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/13\">While on this subject, I must comment on the misleading information contained in the report recently prepared by the pressure group Avaaz and referred to at Second Reading by the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch. The report involved the radiocarbon dating of 109 solid ivory trinkets acquired from 10 European countries. It found that three-quarters of the items tested were dated after 1947. Its sampling and data presentation left a great many questions unanswered. In fact, it is doubtful whether its approach to data interpretation would have passed the scrutiny of a GCSE statistics candidate. For example, the ivory items chosen were clearly not selected at random because had that been the case, antique cutlery, inlaid boxes or even piano keys would have featured in the results.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/14\">The group made one purchase in the Republic of Ireland and managed to conclude on a bar chart that 100% of the ivory in Ireland is antique. Furthermore, not one of the trinkets tested represented the types of historical objects anyone would wish to see exempted from the Bill. Although described in the report as &#8220;fake antiques&#8221;, these objects were not pretending to  be anything other than the bangles, beads and unsophisticated tourist mementoes that they clearly were. They certainly would not have been described as being of artistic, cultural or historical merit by an experienced professional antiques dealer. For the UK, just five suspicious-looking carvings, including two letter openers, were tested. The most recent of all these was found to date from between 1954 and 1956, a time when there were no restrictions on the cross-border trade in ivory, and British tourists to Africa and the Far East regularly returned from their holidays with ivory souvenirs.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/15\">I mention all of this in the context of the de minimis concept to underline that it would be far more effective if the Bill were to focus on solid ivory carvings and objects where ivory is the predominant material. No one has demonstrated problems with objects where ivory is incorporated with other old materials. The dating of such items is easier because the ivory can be judged in the context of the age, craftsmanship, wear and style exhibited by the other materials and the object as a whole. I should also ask: just how is this problematic 10% threshold realistically going to be policed? The register envisaged by Clause 10 will contain many thousands of images of antiques whose ivory content will sway around the 10% mark. A wildlife crime officer sitting at a desk will be unable to make a compliance judgement based solely on a couple of images posted online. Every time officers view one of the many borderline cases, will they be compelled to dispatch an accredited civilian officer to check it out? Would that really be a sensible use of resources for wildlife crime personnel? Choosing a threshold that results in fewer borderline cases would surely represent a much better approach as it would enable officers to direct their energies towards the solid ivory trinkets that represent the area of higher risk.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/16\">In summary, so far as the UK is concerned objects comprising less than 50% ivory are no more likely to pose a threat to elephants in the wild than objects containing less than 10% ivory, and the higher threshold would enable a more focused deployment of resources. In France, 20% is the level below which items containing ivory do not need a sales permit. Those with more than 20% ivory need a permit confirming that the items date from before 1947. New York state has a more restrictive arrangement, but also uses a cut-off of 20%. All these other countries seem comfortable with assessing a 20% cut-off and the Minister is happy to use 20% for musical instruments. If my noble friend finds it hard to go over 50%, it would at least bring consistency to what is already a complex piece of legislation if both the musical instrument and Clause 7 thresholds were brought in line at 20%.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/17\">Amendment 21 relates to Clauses 7 and 8. To be valid, the exemptions for items of low ivory content and musical instruments require the owner to register them under the provisions of Clause 10. I am concerned that, as it stands, this registration requirement will cause two significant problems. The first I alluded to at Second Reading. My concern was for the many items of domestic antique furniture and other objects that contain very small amounts of ivory, for example the escutcheons around locks on a Victorian mahogany chest of drawers or a small slither of ivory running  around the edges of a jewellery box. Many of the owners of such items could well sell them without even noticing these features and yet, if they did so without registering them, they would be breaking the law.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/18\">The Minister&#8217;s response to this, in Hansard on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-07-17\">17 July<\/phrase> 2018, at col. 1197, was to explain, if I understood him correctly, that the package of penalties would be tailored to the level of misdemeanour. The implication of this was that the penalties would be low for breaches that represented genuine mistake and complete ignorance. With respect to my noble friend, I do not believe it is a wise use of officers&#8217; time and Defra&#8217;s or the police&#8217;s resources to have to deal with such cases. Whether the fine is &#163;50 or &#163;5,000, forms still have to be completed and statements taken. The hapless people who have made the error will feel aggrieved and resentful, end up wasting a great deal of time, and to what end? It is all because an antique box with a tiny bit of ivory, similar to countless other boxes, was not registered on a government database.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/19\">The second problem with registration is that it has the potential to result in the destruction of low-value furnishing items, such as antique furniture acquired by businesses that carry out house clearances. If the charge for registration were set at the current fee level for CITES re-export permits, which is between &#163;37 and &#163;59, it would prove a significant deterrent to the sale of items such as a Georgian toilet mirror with small amounts of ivory inlay and ivory knobs. Ordinarily such an item could fetch just &#163;100 to &#163;150 and bring in a profit of perhaps &#163;50. The time taken by a dealer or auctioneer to register it and the charge for doing so would wipe out their profit and be wholly disproportionate to the problem the Bill aims to address, particularly when these types of items are so remote from anything connected to the poaching of elephants.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/20\">If registration proves financially unviable for the seller or their agent, to comply with the law such antiques would need to have the ivory prised from them and be replaced with another material. To be done properly would involve the work of a skilled craftsman, the cost of which would not be recouped from the proceeds of sale of the object&#8212;besides which the object would lose its integrity. A toilet mirror with ivory escutcheons on its integral drawers would probably sell for the same price as one featuring decorative wooden inlays and ebony knobs. The one featuring ivory could end up being thrown away by the owner or the dealer because the cost of selling it would outweigh the profit. Is discarding such items truly necessary or appropriate?<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/21\">Some years ago, there was a campaign to educate the public on the green or environmentally friendly credentials of owning and reusing antique furniture. It went under the title &#8220;Antiques are Green&#8221;. Work was commissioned to look into the environmental impact of new and antique furniture. The results showed that a modern chest of drawers has a carbon impact 16 times higher than its 1830s antique equivalent. Surely we, and Defra in particular, should be encouraging green behaviour in respect of these items and certainly not forcing them into landfill.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/22\">There is clearly no link between offering for sale in the United Kingdom an 1830s chest of drawers containing tiny ivory elements and demand in China for ivory as a commodity, nor is there a link with the poaching of elephants in Africa. As my noble friend Lady Rawlings said at Second Reading, Chinese buyers are unfortunately not drawn to English antique furniture, so they are not buying such items for their own market. Besides, why would anyone pay several hundred pounds to ship to Hong Kong a table for which they may only have paid &#163;200 to an antique dealer in the UK? Dispensing with the need to register those Clause 7 and 8 objects and musical instruments that incorporate very small amounts of ivory would go some way towards addressing the two problems I have described.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/23\">Turning to Amendment 22, when assessing the proportion or ivory contained in an object, Clause 7(1)(b) requires the ivory to be &#8220;integral&#8221; to the piece. &#8220;Integral&#8221; is then defined as being when the ivory cannot,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b2147.0\/24\">&#8220;be removed from the item without difficulty or without damaging the item&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/25\">The impact would be that those ivory components that can be readily removed, or were intentionally designed to be removed and reattached, would be treated as separate from the rest of an item, even if the ivory element overall amounted to just 5% of the whole. The removable components would presumably be considered as substantially or even 100% ivory in their own right and would not benefit from the Clause 7 exemption. If the item is one of historical value, but not necessarily of outstandingly high historical value, it would not be saleable without the detachable ivory elements being removed and its integrity compromised.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/26\">This seems to me to be mildly absurd. This definition of &#8220;integral&#8221; is far removed from how the term is normally understood. Take the case of the small ivory knob on an antique mercury barometer, used both to adjust the Vernier on the mercury scale and to adjust the bag of mercury in the reservoir at the foot of the barometer. This is designed as an essential and, in my use of the word, integral part of the original object. The same would apply to the thin ivory lids on the small wooden containers that fit snugly into the compartments of a 19th-century Indian sandalwood sewing box. Those components are no less integral to those pieces than were the inlaid letters in the Chippendale commode I referred to earlier. What is important is that they should be original to the piece.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/27\">I fail to see the purpose of the restriction as drafted in the Bill. Is there some fear that components that are detachable are being replaced with modern alternatives? If so, what is the evidence of this? If the knobs or lids I have referred to are no longer attached to the original object for which they were made and are being sold separately, I accept that they should be treated as ivory objects in their own right, but where it is clear they form part of a single object of low ivory content, all the ivory and the entire object should be included in the calculations for de minimis purposes.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/28\">On Amendment 23, I have already highlighted the problems that arise from the choice of a low de minimis threshold. Irrespective of the precise drawing of that line, there will always be difficulties in accurately  computing the proportion of ivory found in complex and unusually shaped antique objects. Some may contain voids, the volume of which would be impossible to ascertain without taking the object apart and probably damaging it. In the case of a silver fork with an ivory handle, the metal from the prongs would fit into a drilled hole the size of which can vary considerably between such items and be impossible to ascertain without forcing the two materials apart.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/29\">In the art world, both the physical condition of an object and the extent to which its components are original are crucial factors. In this year when we celebrate the 300th anniversary of the birth of the great cabinet-maker Thomas Chippendale, there has been no more painful example of the importance of these factors than the recent revelation that the original inlaid ivory lettering was prised out of a Chippendale cabinet and replaced by ivorine prior to offering it for sale. My noble friend referred to that earlier. In the event, the piece valued at several million pounds failed to sell. That the climate of uncertainty and panic caused by overzealous legislatures should make the owner of a masterpiece of that nature consider such an action is frightening and should serve as a flavour of the problems that lie ahead if we rush into this. Even if no physical damage was caused by the removal process, the damage to the integrity of the piece represented nothing short of vandalism, as my noble friend said.<\/p><p pid=\"b2147.0\/30\">I hope that the Minister would thus accept that, in order to ascertain the proportion of ivory in an object, it should not be necessary for anyone even to consider carrying out any act that could run the risk of irreversibly damaging it. It should be accepted that this should apply to both the owner and any officer checking their calculations. This could mean that the actual proportion of ivory and the readily measurable proportion sometimes differ, but I see no reason why this should present a problem.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b2118.2\/1\">My Lords, I will deal with Amendments 5, 6, 8 and 9 in this group, and start with Amendment 5. Clause 2 represents a feature of the Bill that has resulted in the largest number of concerned comments from people who handle antiques, so it is no coincidence that we have today several amendments that address this clause.<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/2\">The dateline chosen for Clause 2&#8212;for objects of,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b2118.2\/3\">&#8220;outstandingly high artistic, cultural or historical value&#8221;&#8212;<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/4\">is, as I say, causing considerable concern. According to Clause 36(3)(a), only cultural objects made before <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-01-01\">1 January<\/phrase> 1918 would be eligible for an exemption certificate. It is mystifying that 1918 has been used for this exemption when it appears that even an ordinary upright piano made in 1965, with keys faced in ivory, would qualify for exemption, yet a great work of art created by a leading artist from the 1920s or 1930s would not. As things stand, no items from the Art Deco movement  would gain an exemption certificate. Art Deco is greatly celebrated in the fields of architecture and artistic design, and in 2003, the Victoria and Albert Museum devoted a major exhibition to the subject.<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/5\">The Minister in another place has previously expressed the desire not,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b2118.2\/6\">&#8220;to unduly affect artistic and cultural heritage&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class=\"offrep\" id=\", Commons, Ivory Bill Committee, 14\/06\/18; col. 98.]\"><i>Official Report<\/i>, Commons, Ivory Bill Committee, 14\/06\/18; col. 98.]<\/phrase><\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/7\">Is my noble friend the Minister aware that modern British art of the 20th century, by artists both living and dead, is a thriving, distinctively British and well-respected genre? On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-06-20\">20 June<\/phrase>, the auctioneer Christie&#8217;s devoted its entire day&#8217;s sale to the subject. The sculptor Richard Garbe worked in a number of different media in the 1930s, including bronze and ivory. His monumental work includes sculpture in the collection of the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff, and many of his works would be considered pre-eminent by the panel that considers acceptance of historical objects in lieu of tax. The effect of the 1918 cut-off date would be to prevent his great works being sold or exported by their owners.<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/8\">Since objects for which an exemption certificate is being sought have to pass the inspection of a prescribed institution, there is very little chance that a work by Garbe would be by an impostor. Many such works will already have full provenance, describing the art galleries where they have been displayed previously and their previous ownership, particularly if they formed part of a well-recognised private collection.<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/9\">The Clause 8 exemption for musical instruments allows the continued sale of musical instruments dating from as recently as 1974. If the intrinsic features of the ivory contained in post-war musical instruments are not seen as having a direct or indirect connection with modern-day poaching, it is difficult to see why a moving sculptured tablet, fashioned by Eric Gill in the 1920s, should not be afforded the same protection.<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/10\">Having 1947 as a common dateline for the Clause 7 and Clause 2 exemptions would be logical and sensible and would recognise the great contribution of 20th century art to the cultural life of the United Kingdom. For those reasons, therefore, I am intrigued to know why 1918 was chosen, and I do urge on the Government a rethink in respect of this anomalous date.<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/11\">I turn to Amendment 6. As things stand, the restricted way in which Clause 2 has been couched means that ivory carvings containing an amount of ivory incapable of meaningful reworking, such as small Japanese netsuke, have to meet the &#8220;outstandingly high&#8221; quality criteria. I question why this needs to be the case.<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/12\">Perhaps I should first debunk one oft-repeated myth&#8212;referred to on Second Reading by the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, at col. 1147, and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, at col. 1157&#8212;that the United Kingdom is the world&#8217;s largest legal ivory exporter. Indeed, my noble friend the Minister referred to the United Kingdom, in the debate on the first group of amendments today, as one of the largest exporters. The ivory export data submitted by the Animal and Plant Health Agency to CITES in respect of 2016, unlike data for the previous year, categorised  ivory carvings under two headings. Of a total of 5,050 commercial and personal exports of worked ivory items, an incredible 4,284&#8212;that is, 84%&#8212;comprised piano keys. This represents about 82 pianos. The Government do not publish a breakdown of the remaining 766 worked ivory items exported that year, but doubtless these will include portrait miniatures, antique furniture with ivory inlay as well as solid ivory carvings. Of the items that were not piano keys, 367 were destined for China and Hong Kong. That year, Belgium exported sufficient raw ivory tusks to China and Hong Kong to create more than 20,000 small carvings and trinkets.<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/13\">I understand that Hong Kong&#8217;s official stockpile of ivory tusks and worked ivory amounts to the equivalent of between 1 million and 1.5 million ivory carvings. The TRAFFIC report about the trade in antique ivory recorded a considerable drop in the number of objects made in ivory offered for sale in London between 2004 and 2016, and a fall of 47% in respect of like-for-like visits to the same antiques markets, streets or premises. That does not suggest that the presence of antiques for sale in the UK is fuelling a market for objects made from ivory, whether for home purchase or overseas consumption.<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/14\">Regardless of whether some exports of low-value large ivory carvings may have been bought for recarving by workshops in the Far East, the same cannot be said of small carvings such as Japanese netsuke. They are already too small to be worth purchasing with the intention of turning them into something else and invariably have a hole passing through them, which would also make recarving pointless. As I said, our ivory export numbers are small, so the UK is not supplying large numbers of these to buyers in the Far East. Likewise, objects that incorporate small amounts of ivory mixed with other materials, such as small pieces of inlay in wooden Vizagapatam boxes from India, will never be reused, and these objects are not sought by buyers in the Far East.<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/15\">Amendment 6 would continue to require all objects that contain 10% or more ivory to come under scrutiny and be issued with an exemption certificate. However, where the finite ivory content is less than 30 cubic centimetres, the item would not need to meet the &#8220;outstandingly high&#8221; criterion. Assessors would simply confirm that the object predated 1918 or 1947. Small trinkets bought 30 years ago in East Africa would not pass that test and would not be granted a certificate.<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/16\">On Amendment 8, the question of religious items fashioned from ivory was raised on Second Reading, and rightly so. Many antique ivory items have religious relevance, the most obvious being ivory crucifixes. The inspiration of faith has drawn many artists to generate some of Europe&#8217;s most significant works of art. Great religious paintings come to mind, but within the field of sculpture, there are many thousands of representations of biblical scenes carved from ivory. The very early ones&#8212;15th century pieces&#8212;would undoubtedly fall under the &#8220;outstandingly high&#8221; heading, but there are many works from later centuries that have been finely executed. And we should not forget other religions. Hindu gods are frequently represented in ivory&#8212;a material that was readily available in India from its own indigenous Asian elephant. In Judaism, the handles on the end of the antique wood poles that help unroll  the Torah scroll sometimes incorporated ivory. All of these items are devotional in nature, and, with this amendment, the Bill would recognise an entire field of human creativity inspired by religion.<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/17\">Finally, I turn to Amendment 9. Under the Bill as drafted, unless it is a musical instrument, any antique object containing 10% or more ivory would have to pass the test of being,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b2118.2\/18\">&#8220;of outstandingly high artistic, cultural or historical value&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/19\">It is not entirely clear just how many items the Government envisage would fall into that exemption, but we have been given the impression that very few would do so. It may be helpful to give just a few examples of the types of objects of historical interest that contain 10% or more ivory and which would appear unlikely to meet the Government&#8217;s proposed test. Red and white Victorian chess pieces, for example, are often contained in the drawer of a Victorian chess table&#8212;my noble friend referred to those earlier. These are of the classical type drawn by Tenniel in his illustrations to Lewis Carroll&#8217;s Through the Looking Glass. Reference has also been made today to Sheffield sterling silver English cutlery with carved handles. The list also includes Victorian needle cases and pin boxes; Georgian theatre tokens which gained the possessor admission to a particular seat or box for the season; 18th-century fans with ivory sticks and painted paper leaves; and Anglo-Indian sewing boxes and tea caddies, particularly those made in the 18th and 19th centuries in Vizagapatam on India&#8217;s eastern coast&#8212;the East India Company often arranged their supply to the UK. The list is pretty endless and a source of enormous concern to many people who value our heritage.<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/20\">Does Parliament really need to restrict, in the way proposed, the sale of objects not connected with the trade in poached ivory? An individual who does not wish to purchase an antique containing ivory has the right not to do so. Equally, a person who owns an antique silver tray with ivory handles may feel uncomfortable converting it into money. That is their choice. Without a pattern of evidence showing that there is a link between the demand for ivory as a commodity in the Far East and the sale of genuine antique objects such as those that I have described, is it really Parliament&#8217;s place to tell the owners of those items that they can no longer sell them, or indeed that antiquarians can no longer buy them? After all, these are objects that it would be perfectly possible to have checked by those who have specialist knowledge.<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/21\">We need to understand, too, that the objects at threat from an overly restrictive Clause 2 include the cultural inheritance not just of Europe but of Asia&#8212;including the great civilisations of India, Japan and China&#8212;and of Africa. Though many ordinary tourist souvenirs may have come from Africa, there are plenty of examples of the continent&#8217;s own great art, including its indigenous population&#8217;s commentary on the colonial era. That is exemplified by West African Loango carved tusks, such as those from the 19th century, depicting vignettes of life at the time they were carved. These show images of enslaved Africans, as well as missionaries and colonial officers. They serve as a reminder of past injustices and it would be perverse if they were to be lost to future generations.<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/22\">There is also considerable concern among those who appreciate our cultural and social history about the ultimate loss of the objects that fail to meet the Clause 2 exemption test. There appears to be a lack of understanding about what is likely to happen to these objects, particularly the quirky and interesting items. Such objects provide us with a commentary on our past. I am sure that existing owners will continue to look after them, but when they are no longer able to do so, perhaps because they have to go into a care home, or when they die, what fate will then befall these objects? It is absolutely certain that the museums of this country do not have the capacity or the funds to accept or care for every single antique incorporating ivory that may be offered to them. There is no guarantee that the children or relatives of owners will be interested in historical objects&#8212;so how will they deal with their inherited items? Like any item that holds little interest to a younger generation, many of these historical objects will simply be put in the dustbin.<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/23\">It is well established that when no financial value is associated with an object, it will most likely be discarded. Carrier bags are a good current example. As with real estate, when an antique retains a monetary resale value, that helps to ensure that its owner maintains and cares for it. Objects that are 100 years old certainly need looking after, and there are specialist colleges and institutions whose raison d'&#234;tre is to restore and conserve them. Are we really saying that we want these objects, which help to describe our social and cultural history&#8212;objects that originate from an earlier era&#8212;to be thrown into the dustbin of history? Surely we are all sufficiently well informed these days to recognise that a silver teapot would not be made with ivory insulators today, but we can understand that 90 years ago ivory was the plastic of its era. It is perfectly possible to appreciate and continue to buy and sell historical objects that happen to incorporate old ivory while appreciating that we do not wish to make such items today.<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/24\">To rectify these concerns, the exemption certificates could be extended to cover objects that are of a standard suitable for acquisition only by qualifying museums&#8212;that is, by UK-accredited museums or members of the International Council of Museums. The Bill already defines the meaning of qualifying museums and so, who better than museum curators and other specialists, who handle antique objects on a regular basis, to judge whether an object containing ivory has the qualities that would be required for acquisition by any of these government-recognised and properly constituted museums?<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/25\">It has been suggested that the term &#8220;museum standard&#8221; is too subjective, but it is no more subjective than the existing wording,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b2118.2\/26\">&#8220;outstandingly high artistic, cultural or historical value&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b2118.2\/27\">The proposal does not change the subsection (3) factors that must be taken into account by the Secretary of State and the prescribed institutions when deciding whether to grant an exemption certificate. The Clause 2 exemption would remain a very narrow one. It would mean that low-grade tourist souvenirs, such as letter openers and carved African figures from the 20th century, or mass-produced items of the type that could be  bought in the ivory-carving shops of the Far East, would not be on sale in the UK. It would also mean that we are respecting our history. Owners of legally acquired objects such as a silver teapot with an ivory handle could be able to sell their possessions. Art collectors, who may have put part of their pension investment into antiques incorporating ivory, would not suddenly find that they are without funds for their retirement. I beg to move.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a817.2\/1\">It is a pleasure to contribute to what has so far been a somewhat enlightening debate.<\/p><p pid=\"a817.2\/2\">The starting point of my analysis in this debate, as a democratic socialist, is: what structures of governance are best situated to deliver maximum economic benefit to working people in delivering the highest-possible quality of life and public services and amenities to serve their interests? That underpins my thinking. When I think of the benefits of the Union, I think back to my own grandparents and my grandfather fighting with the Royal Artillery, making common cause with people from across the United Kingdom to defeat fascism in Europe.<\/p><p pid=\"a817.2\/3\">That common cause transcended into the spirit of 1945 and that 1945 election, which delivered the first majority Labour Government, who fundamentally transformed this country, delivering the welfare state and the pillars that underpin modern civilisation in this country. That is why I never had any doubt about joining the Labour party at the age of 16. I knew that, although it might not have delivered only good, it had delivered everything that had been good in this country in the preceding 70 years. I had no doubt that every great societal achievement and all progress this country had achieved had been delivered by the solidarity of working people acting in the labour and trade union movement. I never had any doubt either that the United Kingdom served their interests when the British state was mobilised in their service. Indeed, when I look at Scotland today, I think of the benefits that we have achieved. If nothing else holds true, Scotland benefits every year from &#163;9 billion that it would not otherwise have to invest in the provision of public services that ensure that quality of life for people in Scotland is better than it otherwise would be. That is equivalent to  &#163;1,470 per person in Scotland every year. For as long as that figure is correct, there can be no socialist analysis for unpicking and destroying a Union that delivers that economic and social benefit for the people of Scotland.<\/p><p pid=\"a817.2\/4\">The SNP&#8217;s analysis is so awry when it comes to dealing with that reality that it has run away from the idea of full fiscal autonomy because the transfer is undisputable. Looking at its latest analysis in the so-called growth commission report, we see that it tries to compare Scotland with other advanced economies. Speaking about the target of reducing the fiscal deficit in Scotland to under 3% of GDP within five to 10 years, Scottish Trends&#8217; John McLaren says that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a817.2\/5\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;it clearly involves a tighter fiscal strategy over this period than is likely for the rest of the UK. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), currently expects the UK to have a deficit equivalent to 2.3% of GDP in 2021-22 and falling, which should allow for an easing in public expenditure settlements over time. Meanwhile Scotland will be moving from a deficit equivalent to nearly 6% of GDP towards a 3% target. It doesn&#8217;t take a mathematical genius to work out the implications.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a817.2\/6\">As long as those implications may threaten the interests of working people in Scotland, I am opposed to the notion of separation and am committed to the idea of the Union.<\/p><p pid=\"a817.2\/7\">The growth commission assumes that an independent Scotland would achieve a GDP per capita growth rate that is 0.7% greater than it would be if it remained in the UK. However, the justification for that figure is extremely tenuous, relying on territories or countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore in the comparison set, despite explicitly rejecting their low-tax, high-income-inequality economic models. Remove Hong Kong and Singapore from the comparable countries growth rate analysis and 0.7% becomes 0.26%. If that were the case, instead of the 25 years that the growth commission assumes that it would take to generate &#163;9 billion of revenue to close the gap with the UK, it would take 67 years. However, &#163;9 billion is of course less than the &#163;10.3 billion effective fiscal transfer that Scotland received from the rest of the UK in 2016-17, which we would of course lose on day one of independence. To test that assumption further, if we look back at the independence White Paper, the equivalent figure used then was in fact only 0.12% per annum. On that basis, it would take over 140 years to close the gap with the UK. Why on earth would anyone vote for that?<\/p><p pid=\"a817.2\/8\">If we look at the performance of the three countries that the growth commission explicitly cites as being those they seek to learn in particular from&#8212;Denmark, Finland and New Zealand&#8212;then, using the growth commission&#8217;s own data source, the superior growth rate becomes an immaterial 0.06%. It is becoming apparent that the comparisons are utterly fanciful. On that basis it would take nearly 300 years to close the gap with the UK&#8212;the entire length of time that the United Kingdom has existed&#8212;which is utterly absurd and demonstrates that the growth commission is bereft of any intellectual rigour.<\/p><p pid=\"a817.2\/9\">Then there is the albatross of the currency. In designing a currency regime or mechanism for an independent country, it is critical that the regime offers the country a credible means of adjusting disequilibria&#8212;deficits and surpluses&#8212;on its balance of payments. If it does not, it is doomed to fail in the absence of a risk-sharing agreement or transfer mechanism, and we have seen  that play out in Europe when Greece and Ireland suffered heavy internal devaluations and mega-austerity. That is an important lesson in the economic history of currency regimes. In thinking about the appropriate currency regime for an independent Scotland, it is crucial to have the adjustment question at the back of our mind at all times.<\/p><p pid=\"a817.2\/10\">If Scotland were to become an independent country, it would become a net exporter of hydrocarbons. It is well known in currency economics that the crucial role of oil price changes in affecting the competitiveness of the non-oil sector must be addressed in designing a currency regime for a country with a diversified non-oil export sector and an oil sector. Otherwise, the non-oil sector gets crowded out, which has implications for jobs, output and the sustainability of the balance of payments and interest rates. It is the classic Dutch disease phenomenon. However, all the literature on the currency issue that has been generated since the referendum, including the Scottish Government&#8217;s growth commission report, does not even address that particular issue.<\/p><p pid=\"a817.2\/11\">Regardless of the currency regime that an independent Scotland might choose, it would need a market-credible pool of foreign exchange reserves to run a currency regime. From the evidence of similar sized economies, that would amount to &#163;40 billion, which is around one third of Scotland&#8217;s annual GDP and not a sum of money that a newly separate Scotland could borrow on international financial markets. The only way that such an amount could be accumulated is through running budgetary surpluses for a number of years, but an austerity programme would need to be run in any case in order to establish the &#8220;hard currency&#8221; effect, so the reserve accumulation issue can be seen as reinforcing that effect.<\/p><p pid=\"a817.2\/12\">The growth commission&#8217;s alternative to the 2014 White Paper&#8217;s formal currency union would be to adopt the pound, much as Panama adopts the dollar, Montenegro adopts the euro and so on. That is a currency substitution system, but such a system is viewed as inherently unstable by economists because it is subject to the whims of individuals&#8217; expectations and the effects that these can have on demand for money, which can lead to changes in supply through the balance of payments. There would be no effective control over the money supply in Scotland and no lender of last resort function because changes in the current account of the balance of payments would directly affect the money supply in the Scottish economy. For example, a surplus on the current balance would increase the quantity of sterling in the economy, which would have inflationary implications. Conversely, a current account deficit would draw money out of the economy with deflationary implications.<\/p><p pid=\"a817.2\/13\">To deal with such flows, a separate monetary authority would need to be set up to smooth those effects, but the evidence from similar-sized economies to Scotland, such as the Nordic countries, is that foreign exchange reserves of upwards of &#163;40 billion are needed to achieve that. If the monetary authority were prepared to offer deposit insurance of &#163;120 billion of retail deposit accounts in Scotland, it would need to accumulate foreign exchange reserves of &#163;160 billion, which is greater than the entire Scottish GDP. Those are extraordinary figures.<\/p><p pid=\"a817.2\/14\">Where would the money come from, given that the balance of payments of an independent Scotland would have a deficit of between 2% to 5% of GDP? It would  need in the region of &#163;6 billion to &#163;7 billion just to cover those international obligations. The only way those sums could be achieved would be through a massive austerity programme. For context, the Scottish NHS budget every year is just &#163;13 billion. We can wipe that out right away. The proposal is simply not a sustainable proposition that anyone of a socialist background could endorse.<\/p><p pid=\"a817.2\/15\">All the points I have made focus purely on the monetary implications, but let us look at the competitiveness of the non-oil export sector with the effect of the oil price changes. That would massively impact on the competitiveness of the Scottish economy, entailing mass industrial closures of a scale we saw through the 1980s. Indeed, any alternative, such as a form of sterlingisation with a currency board, would need the currency to be backed 100% by foreign exchange reserves, which again is an unsustainable position. Such systems require considerable amounts of foreign exchange&#8212;both cash and reserves&#8212;to back deposit accounts. The Hong Kong experience shows that &#163;200 billion of reserves are required to run a currency board. Those massive sums of money in turn require policies of fiscal austerity, balance of payments surpluses and no lender of last resort function. Again, the loss of competitiveness issue would not be addressed in that set-up. It is simply not viable as a currency option unless the Scottish Government are intent on handing over large sums of Scottish taxpayers&#8217; money to hedge funds and speculators.<\/p><p pid=\"a817.2\/16\">Interrogating the Scottish growth commission&#8217;s proposals demonstrates that they cannot offer a socialist solution to separation. That is why the growth commission has achieved only one thing: it has demonstrated that the huge benefits we derive from being part of the fiscal, monetary and political union are as relevant and integral to quality of life in Scotland today as they have ever have been. That is why we continue to argue as the socialist Labour party that we must marshal the forces of the British state to deliver the best quality of outcomes for the people of Scotland by utilising its fiscal and monetary powers to deliver world-class public services for the people of Scotland. We stand by that commitment today, as we did in 1945 when this party built the national health service and the welfare state.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1185.0\/1\">My Lords, I declare my interest as a former president of the British Antique Dealers&#8217; Association. I am sure that your Lordships agree that we should all be extremely proud that the UK represents the largest art and antiques market in Europe and the second largest in the world. Through its specialist dealers and major auction houses, it offers a concentrated source of expertise and knowledge, unmatched anywhere in the world.<\/p><p pid=\"b1185.0\/2\">I warmly welcome the aims of the Bill and its desire to conserve elephant populations. The appalling slaughter of the African elephant in such large numbers in recent years is a matter of grave concern to us all. The Government should be proud of the action that they have already taken to tackle the illegal wildlife trade and protect elephants from being poached. This action includes expanded British military training in anti-poaching skills for African park rangers, a project with China to deliver training to African border forces, and additional funding for Interpol to increase its work with key nations in tracking shipments of ivory. As we have heard from many noble Lords this afternoon, we hosted the Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference four years ago, and another is due here in the autumn. I therefore think that we are selling ourselves a little short when we say that we are lagging behind other countries in our fight against elephant poaching.<\/p><p pid=\"b1185.0\/3\">It is recognised that China is the world&#8217;s largest market for ivory, where it has been continuously imported as a raw material up until the end of last year. As recently as 2008, 62 tonnes of ivory tusks were released  from Africa and sold to China. Hong Kong&#8217;s official stockpile of ivory in 2015 amounted to 78 tonnes. I mention these figures to provide context for the situation in the UK, where our market is not one of ivory as a commodity but of antiques, some of which happen to incorporate ivory.<\/p><p pid=\"b1185.0\/4\">It is on our cultural heritage that I really wish to reflect. I am fascinated by the evolution of mankind&#8217;s cultural and artistic development, as seen through the monuments, works of art and domestic items that earlier generations have left behind. We have access today to many objects from earlier times that were created under conditions of which we would not now approve. It is inevitable that items created in earlier centuries will reflect the social, economic and political norms of their era. The most obvious example is books. The views espoused in some printed matter from the past might now be abhorrent to many, but we do not ban its sale. The people who read those books today are well able to interpret the opinions they contain in the context of the period in which they were written. I believe that we should take the same approach with old artefacts that incorporate ivory.<\/p><p pid=\"b1185.0\/5\">We recognise that the ivory found today in antique objects came historically from thousands of dead elephants, some of which died from natural causes and others, sadly, were killed for their tusks. But I believe the British public are all intelligent enough to understand that buying an antique that incorporates old ivory does not mean they approve of objects made from modern, poached ivory.<\/p><p pid=\"b1185.0\/6\">This contrasts enormously with the attitude of some Asian buyers. As we have heard, they have a culture of acquiring ivory for its own sake, regardless of age, and they generally do so in the form of solid ivory carvings, many sold by weight. It should also be noted that Asian buyers buy fewer western antiques; attempts to interest them in doing so have largely proved unsuccessful. The British Antique Dealers&#8217; Association has been trying for several years to garner more interest from Chinese buyers in items such as English antique furniture or silver, and it has proved an uphill struggle. In 2013, the European Fine Art Foundation, which runs the world&#8217;s most significant art fair, in Maastricht, gave up its plans for a fair in Beijing.<\/p><p pid=\"b1185.0\/7\">The vast majority of western antiques containing ivory are not therefore exported to the Far East. Consequently, despite claims to the contrary, they do not contribute to the vast market for ivory carvings that exists in China, Hong Kong and other countries in Asia, such as Vietnam. There is not even the danger of such items being mixed in with the carvings on sale in the ivory shops of Hong Kong. When did anyone last spot a 19th-century English silver teapot with carved ivory handle sharing shelf space with rows of modern, cellophane-wrapped carved Buddhas?<\/p><p pid=\"b1185.0\/8\">The structure of the Bill provides a framework for measures to prevent modern ivory trinkets being offered for sale. Such trinkets include solid ivory tourist carvings that may have been acquired legally in the 1940s or 1950s but hold no real cultural significance, either for the people who made them or for mankind in general. However, I urge your Lordships to be aware that, as presently worded, the Bill will have a significant impact  on the future of many culturally or historically important objects that do not meet the extremely limited exemption criteria, particularly items containing 10% or more ivory that fall foul of the Clause 2 criteria.<\/p><p pid=\"b1185.0\/9\">I will explain my concerns more precisely. The Bill allows people to continue to own any ivory items that do not qualify for those exemptions. It also lets owners give them away or pass them on to their beneficiaries on death. I realise that some of your Lordships may imagine that this would be sufficient to protect these items for future generations. I cannot, however, agree that these items will be protected. When the owners of prohibited cultural property die, their objects will not necessarily be wanted or appreciated by their remaining family members. Museums will not automatically accept every gift offered to them; they have neither the storage space nor the funds to look after them. Furthermore, museums may well be unwilling to accept artefacts already represented in their collections.<\/p><p pid=\"b1185.0\/10\">If the objects have no financial value, there will be no incentive for an indifferent or busy executor or beneficiary to bother to find a new owner. As my noble friend Lord De Mauley said, many items will be abandoned or thrown away. Even if not discarded, because they lack a resale value, there will be no financial incentive to spend money on having them restored or conserved for posterity. I am concerned not only for the artefacts themselves but for the preservation of examples of our social history. We should all remember that antiques have a big following in Britain, as the viewing figures for &#8220;Antiques Roadshow&#8221; show.<\/p><p pid=\"b1185.0\/11\">Although the Government have published an estimated cost to businesses, they have not attempted to quantify the cost to individuals of rendering their treasured antique possessions worthless. Dealers and auction houses are merely the conduit between one permanent owner and the next. For every item currently in a dealer&#8217;s stock or being handled by an auction house, there will be many more similar items held privately. The potential losses must be considerably larger to citizens than to businesses. Can the Minister therefore inform me whether the Government have attempted to compute the loss to the Exchequer arising from this measure, as it will undoubtedly make a dent in the tax take from both inheritance tax and capital gains tax?<\/p><p pid=\"b1185.0\/12\">We should also consider the works of art that emanate from cultures in other parts of the world, many of which have ended up in this country. Ivory has been regularly used in religious artefacts, as the noble Baroness, Lady Flather, mentioned, whether crucifixes or carvings of Hindu deities. If these religious objects end up discarded, would that not amount to a form of iconoclasm?<\/p><p pid=\"b1185.0\/13\">The use of ivory is prevalent, as we have heard, in Indian, Asian and African culture. Although we do not wish to encourage the purchase of modern-day ivory trinkets by people of the Far East, we cannot write off the figural carvings of high aesthetic appeal from the Ming dynasty, or the high-quality Guangzhou tribute pieces that were made for the Chinese imperial court. While introducing their ban on modern carving workshops, the Chinese themselves will continue to  recognise their own cultural inheritance by permitting auction sales of cultural relics. Is it our place to dismiss the culture of such a great civilisation in such a way?<\/p><p pid=\"b1185.0\/14\">The same may be said of Japanese culture. As my noble friend Lord Cormack said in his eloquent speech, you have only to read Edmund de Waal&#8217;s book The Hare with Amber Eyes to appreciate the lure of those masterpieces of the carver&#8217;s art in boxwood, porcelain, lacquer or ivory: the netsuke. How many netsuke made from ivory will be rendered valueless, as my noble friend said, while their wooden counterparts of similar artistic merit will continue to be sold?<\/p><p pid=\"b1185.0\/15\">It is normal for this House to ponder matters in a less hurried way than is sometimes the case in the other place. After this fascinating debate this afternoon, with so many interesting and different views, I hope that your Lordships will give careful thought to these concerns. Essentially, this is a good Bill which has cross-party support, but it could be improved by making certain that it creates the correct balance between recognising our cultural heritage and providing the framework for prohibiting the sale of modern-day ivory in Britain&#8212;and of course protecting the elephant.<\/p><p pid=\"b1185.0\/16\">I started by stressing the importance of and need for change. It would be perfectly possible to introduce effective amendments without delaying the Bill&#8217;s passage or in any way watering down the important message it sends out to other countries about the serious attitude we take to elephant poaching. We might all agree that we surely do not want to live in an ivory tower.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a367.2\/1\">I congratulate everybody who has helped to get this important Bill to this point, including the many campaigners and organisations who have pushed for it over the years, and I thank the civil servants and the Clerks who have  worked so hard and all those who gave their time to give evidence to the Bill Committee. It was a pleasure to be part of that Committee, and I echo the words of <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Simon Hoare\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25427\">the hon. Member for North Dorset (Simon Hoare)<\/phrase>: it was Parliament at its best, working constructively and collaboratively across party lines to ensure that this groundbreaking Bill was as good as it could be.<\/p><p pid=\"a367.2\/2\">The Bill matters deeply because the illegal wildlife trade has grown rapidly in recent years. It is now estimated to be the fourth-largest international illegal trade and worth over &#163;15 billion per year. The illegal wildlife trade drives corruption, undermines the rule of law, threatens sustainability in developing countries and has been linked to other forms of organised crime, such as arms, drugs and human trafficking. The number of elephants in the wild has declined by almost a third in the last decade, and around 20,000 a year are still being slaughtered owing to the global demand for ivory&#8212;an average of around 55 a day.<\/p><p pid=\"a367.2\/3\">There are now approximately 415,000 African elephants left. In the last decade, their numbers fell by about 111,000, mainly owing to poaching. While the UK is not one of the countries of most concern in terms of its contribution to the global illegal ivory trade, there is recent evidence that our legal ivory market is still being used to launder illegal ivory, and ivory is being shipped legally and illegally to Asian countries. TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, surveyed the UK ivory market in 2016 and found that while ivory sales had declined since 2004, the UK was still a net exporter of ivory. There was also some discrepancy in the numbers: the UK reported that only 17 raw tusks were exported to other countries, but importing countries reported 109 tusks that had come from the UK. UK ivory traders were also unclear on the laws around the legal ivory trade. The Bill is therefore vital and long overdue, and I am delighted to have been a member of the Committee and to be speaking on it today.<\/p><p pid=\"a367.2\/4\">I want to focus my comments on two areas that I do not believe have been suitably progressed during the passage of the Bill. First, I will speak to new clause 1, in the name of my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Sue Hayman\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25358\">the Member for Workington (Sue Hayman)<\/phrase>, and the issue of widening the scope of &#8220;ivory&#8221; to cover species besides elephants. I recognise the amendment the Secretary of State has brought forward, about which we will no doubt hear more, and which will allow the scope of the Bill to be widened in the future, but I cannot help feeling we have missed an historic opportunity to do so here and now.<\/p><p pid=\"a367.2\/5\">As I mentioned in Committee, there is a phrase used by medical students: first, do no harm. It is something that we ought to abide by in this place when passing legislation. I have a real concern, backed up by evidence, that by limiting the Bill to elephant ivory, we may have a disproportionate impact on another species, as poachers and dealers look elsewhere to feed their markets. Just as I did in Committee, I wish to speak, in particular, about the noble hippopotamus&#8212;known, of course, as the river horse&#8212;and to support my hon. Friend&#8217;s comments about the hippo.<\/p><p pid=\"a367.2\/6\">The number of hippos in the world has crashed by 95% in the last 30 years&#8212;that is inconceivable&#8212;and that is widely acknowledged to be a knock-on effect of the increasing restrictions on the trade in elephant  ivory. Since the convention on international trade in endangered species imposed the ban in 1990, 30,000 tonnes of hippo teeth have been exported from Africa. For example, a few years ago, in the Virunga national park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, there were 29,000 hippos, but now there are just 1,300. The hippo is vulnerable and on the red list of threatened species, and there is deep concern that it is being poached and hunted for its teeth as loopholes are closed around elephant ivory.<\/p><p pid=\"a367.2\/7\">In 2014, some 60 tonnes of hippo teeth were exported to Hong Kong from Africa and from there were sent on to European countries. If the purpose of the Bill is to close markets that are driving the trade, and given that there is clearly a strong integrated global trade in hippo teeth that has a huge effect on the species, it is vital that we take this opportunity to send out the message that we in this country do not believe that hippos should be killed or poached for their teeth and ensure that we do not, through the Bill, have a damaging impact on the hippopotamus.<\/p><p pid=\"a367.2\/8\">I accept that the Government have tabled amendment 3 to allow them to widen the scope in the future, but I have not heard any arguments either in Committee or today that have convinced me that we cannot broaden the scope now. On the point about the conference in the autumn, if the Government were to accept our new clause today, or in the Lords, we would still hit that timetable&#8212;there would be no delay in the process. My hon. Friend the Member for Workington has clearly set out the legal position showing that the Government are on safe ground and that there would not be sufficient means for a challenge. We are missing a vital opportunity. The arguments about delays to the legislative process do not stack up. The Government should come on board and support our new clause. I sincerely hope that any delay in broadening the scope arising as a result of having to wait for secondary legislation will not have a devastating knock-on consequence for the hippo and other species.<\/p><p pid=\"a367.2\/9\">I welcome the fact that the Government amendment does not limit the animals that may be covered in the future simply to those registered as &#8220;protected&#8221; in CITES. I believe that they were won over by the excellent representations that my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Kerry McCarthy\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11455\">the Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy)<\/phrase> made very powerfully in Committee, when she said that we should look at this through the prism not just of protecting endangered species but of our moral obligation. We ought to be driving out poaching and the hunting of animals for the use of their body parts because it is morally reprehensible, whether the animals are endangered or not. I am grateful that the Government have taken that on board.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b455.0\/1\">My Lords, it is truly an enormous pleasure for me to participate in this debate because I recently became a member of the European Union Committee. I pay unreserved tribute to the committee members and the members of staff, including the clerks, who produced the report.<\/p><p pid=\"b455.0\/2\">We are indeed at a critical juncture in respect of the matter in hand, with the Prime Minister&#8217;s Chequers meeting, the publication of a White Paper and so much to be done before the autumn. What makes the report stand out, as so beautifully enunciated by the noble Lord, Lord Boswell, is that it is a successful attempt to move above and beyond the often emotional observations of the commentariat: either claiming that the EU is bullying us and out to destroy the United Kingdom or that we have been unable to clarify our position on anything of substance. Although I would have preferred more advances to have been made by our Government in some respects, I can only  hope that the shared collective statements about a very positive post-Brexit relationship can take substance before the October European Council.<\/p><p pid=\"b455.0\/3\">Of course, these negotiations are substantially focused on trade, but we need to see this whole discussion in the context of some remarkable developments which are clearly beginning to affect us all and may do so enormously in future. President Trump is shortly to meet President Putin. I speak as the chairman of the British Ukrainian Society, which tries to build bilateral links between our country and a country which has suffered grievously from Russian aggression.<\/p><p pid=\"b455.0\/4\">We in Europe have collective energy interests. Nord Stream 2 will go ahead, avoiding Ukraine. Russia presently supplies 30% of Europe&#8217;s energy needs&#8212;40% in the case of Germany&#8212;and this will rise. All of us in Europe will, to a greater or lesser extent, be affected by this huge gas transmission system. I simply point out that Russia has a history of pricing its energy on the basis of how it determines the political attitude of the recipient country. That in itself means that we have a common interest in looking at our energy security.<\/p><p pid=\"b455.0\/5\">One of the most telling observations about politics was once made by the late German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who said that politicians go in to politics to resolve a given set of problems but, once resolved, they cannot move on. That applies to institutions as well. It is very important, as we have this negotiation, to move away and understand the challenges that face us both across the channel and among ourselves, and not adopt positions that are frankly completely ossified.<\/p><p pid=\"b455.0\/6\">This report highlights or notes our shared common strategic foreign policy and defence interests. The post-Brexit partnership with the EU, in my view, has not been given the importance that it should have been thus far in this key area. I therefore greatly welcome the European intervention initiative, spearheaded by President Macron and structured in a way that enables the UK to participate in crisis situations near Europe&#8217;s borders. It may well be that the defence umbrella with which the United States currently provides Europe will undergo change. In fact, we know that President Trump has expressed dissatisfaction with the levels of European defence spending on NATO. In these rather known unknown circumstances, it is simply imperative that Britain should not be treated as a detached third party. Of course, we are in the context of NATO&#8212; but imaginative defence, security and intelligence structures should be pursued in our common interests in Europe.<\/p><p pid=\"b455.0\/7\">If we reflect on the past 20 years or so, we can see that a number of very disagreeable regimes have disappeared. In developing countries broadly, we have seen a great acceptance of the values of more active civil society, judicial oversight and electoral processes. These are values that are shared right across Europe. The belt and road project initiated by China is truly massive and focused particularly on infrastructure development. Yet investment does not come with any requirements on good governance. With our generous aid budgets and access offered to our markets, these must continue to be used to encourage good governance.<\/p><p pid=\"b455.0\/8\">I say this because the UK and the European Union essentially share the same values. As China becomes ever more a player on the world stage and the United  States feels that its generosity and world view is insufficiently appreciated, it is most important that the UK and the EU co-operate, as we recently saw at the Paris climate change conference, on consumer protection or over Iran, based on our common values or perceptions. I hope that some of those issues come to elevate the context of these negotiations. If, after all, our European neighbours thought that we would set off a chain reaction with the departures of other countries, that has certainly not happened at all.<\/p><p pid=\"b455.0\/9\">I turn to the issue of the financial sector and the City of London. There have been assertions by some, including the European Banking Authority, that the UK&#8217;s financial sector has not adequately prepared for Brexit. The City of London provides a level of expertise, lending and specialist activity that is unique. Indeed, there has been an enormous amount of preparation for exactly the process that is taking place. Inevitably, new arrangements will be made by many British-based financial institutions to set up activities within the EU, but what needs to be understood within the EU is that the City of London is an immense asset for the whole of Europe. If its ability to function is materially impaired, the major beneficiaries will not be Paris, Frankfurt or Dublin but New York, Singapore and Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"b455.0\/10\">Of course, the essence of these negotiations are about trade and creating a customs structure, but what this report sets out so admirably, in the clearest possible terms, are the current positions in respect of trade and services of the European Commission, the European Parliament and the UK Government. It does the same thing in the areas of trade. At the heart of this is the need to have a mutually beneficial customs relationship and a mechanism for adjudicating disagreements. As my noble friend Lord Boswell indicated, a price will have to be paid on both sides. However, it is worth reminding ourselves at this juncture that, with the difficulties currently happening within the European Union, the United Kingdom has absolutely no interest in anything but a prosperous and harmonious European Union, as we seek to maintain the breadth and depth of our trade relationship.<\/p><p pid=\"b455.0\/11\">I heard a speech very recently by that most experienced European figure, Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso, in which he repeated that the EU always reaches agreement at the last moment, whether discussing matters internally or with third parties. Indeed, we saw that illustrated over the migration crisis, and I suspect that that is precisely what will happen in our negotiations. It is perfectly true that the hand of an individual, business or country is strengthened if there is a threat of walking out of a negotiation. What, however, is undeniable is that all of us who have tried to follow the whole Brexit process know how immensely complex and entwined our commercial relationship is with the EU. Therefore, any enthusiasm for this tactic on my part is tempered by my difficulty in answering the question of the extent to which Her Majesty&#8217;s Government have prepared for such an eventuality&#8212;because I think, however regrettably, that the hour, if ever there was one, has probably passed.<\/p><p pid=\"b455.0\/12\">I conclude by repeating the last sentence of the conclusions of this excellent report, because it says it all:<\/p><p pid=\"b455.0\/13\">&#8220;The success of the negotiation can then be measured by the willingness of all parties to compromise, as they discover mutual interests and deliver shared benefits&#8221;.<\/p>",

It goes on to say that&#160;this is because they judge another culture solely by the&#160;values and standards of their own culture. Of&#160;course, seeing other cultures as different doesn't necessarily mean that we see them as superior. The example that was given in this course document of ethnocentrism, bizarrely, is in relation to Cuba and the American invasion of Cuba in 1960, following the Cuban revolution, which brought Fidel Castro to power. Now, it's news to me that the Americans aided Cuban exiles in the invasion of Cuba in 1960 because they regarded America as superior to Cuban people. It was, of course, a geopolitical event at the height of the cold war, and there's a historical context that seems to be wholly missing from the text that describes what happened in Cuba all those years ago. There doesn't appear to be any mention whatsoever of the nature of the Castro regime, which was imposed upon Cuba following the ejection of the equally awful person Fulgencio Batista, who was the dictator of Cuba before Castro succeeded.<\/p><p>This, I think, is deplorable, because if a generation of children is brought up with misconceptions being taught at school in this way, then that is undoubtedly going to bias their view of the subject that that is an example of. Now, of course, the Castro regime has been condemned by human rights organisations roundly over many, many years. Human Rights Watch has said that, under Fidel Castro, the Cuban Government refused to recognise the legitimacy of Cuban human rights organisations, alternative political parties, independent labour unions or a free press. He also denied international monitors, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and&#160;international non-governmental organisations like Human Rights Watch,&#160;access to the island to investigate human rights conditions. One of the reasons why the Americans supported the invasion of Cuba in 1960 was because they thought that capitalism, free enterprise and democratic societies were superior to communist society. Surely we've enough experience of communism in the last 100 years, perhaps, not to think that that is a challengeable proposition. So, to describe that as an example of ethnocentrism is actually a total misleading of the children who were being taught it. Now, if that is happening in that one area, it can be happening in others as well. This is a very important element of education that is perhaps not being well taught.<\/p><p>There are many other controversial topics where there is another side to the case as well, and I'm not sure that that is taught in school. Just take poverty, for example, and famine. What's the cause of poverty and famine, by and large? Why is it that some countries succeed in creating wealth and others don't, and that some countries have actually gone backwards in the last century, compared with where they were in the early part of the twentieth century? If you look at the richest countries in the world, they're countries like Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea, which were nowhere 50 years ago in the tables of wealth creation, whereas Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Argentina have all gone the other way. In the 1920s, Argentina was one of the richest countries in the world, and thanks to decades of misgovernment by leftist and quasi-fascistic political parties and kleptocratic leaders, Argentina's economy was ruined. So, there are many reasons why wealth is created, but generally speaking, state control isn't one of them.<\/p><p>In relation to poverty in developing countries, the intellectual infrastructure of wealth creation is simply not there.&#160;Is 'trade not aid' taught in schools, for example? Professor Peter Bauer, who was a professor of international development economics when I&#160;was a student back in the 1960s, said that aid, generally, is taxpayers' money that is collected from poor people in rich countries to give to rich people in poor countries, and we've seen many examples of that&#160;demonstrated over the years. Now, I'm not suggesting that overseas aid is always bad, of course&#8212;lots of aid projects are good&#8212;but if you convey the impression that the only way in which poor countries can become rich countries is by a transfer of wealth from richer countries, then that is, again, a misunderstanding of the nature of the economic process. Competition is a discovery process: bad ideas don't succeed, good ideas do. So, these are issues that ought to be properly factored into the curriculum. We have issues such as intergenerational wealth transfer, as well, in relation to poverty. In this generation, we frequently hear people talking about austerity, but what is austerity? Austerity is our experience of the last seven years of Conservative Government where the national debt has doubled. Now, that is an intergenerational&#160;wealth transfer; we are spending today money that will have to be paid back by generations of tomorrow. Are these issues properly dealt with in the Welsh bac course? I've seen no evidence of that whatsoever.<\/p><p>There is a course called 'consumerism'. Now, there's a loaded term, if ever there was one. I looked up the definition of this in a dictionary and it was described as 'the belief that increasing consumption of goods is economically desirable'. Well, there are not many people, I think, who would regard the increasing consumption of goods as being a bad thing, and generally speaking, the poorer you are, the more goods you want to consume. This is a good thing. So, why are we teaching something called consumerism to children in schools? It all goes back, I suppose, to the Rousseauian idea of the noble savage&#8212;back to nature, the simple life where we scratch a living from the soil&#8212;but this isn't the kind of lifestyle that normal people want to pursue.<\/p>",

I congratulate the new Minister, my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"George Hollingbery\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24936\">the Member for Meon Valley (George Hollingbery)<\/phrase>, on both his elevation and the case he made in favour of the agreement, while also thanking my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Greg Hands\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11610\">the Member for Chelsea and Fulham (Greg Hands)<\/phrase> for all he did for the new Department for International Trade.<\/p><p pid=\"b817.0\/2\">The contrast with the other side of the House is striking: acres of unoccupied Benches, considerable misgivings about free trade, Divisions on what should be uncontested issues and appeals to colleagues by sensible free traders such as <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Chris Leslie\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10354\">the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Mr Leslie)<\/phrase>, who is not in his place now, for his party not to be the party of narrow protectionism. It is a disappointing sight, with the shadow Secretary of State the closest thing we have in this country at the moment to a Trump-style mercantilist, unable, sadly, to see the benefits to consumers from lower tariffs and lower costs of imported goods bringing down our cost of living and inflation, as well as opening markets for our goods and services, especially to Japan, where the power of the &#8220;made in Britain&#8221; brand is strong and above all based on the quality of product and service.<\/p><p pid=\"b817.0\/3\">There are issues ahead, of course, and I would welcome comments from the Minister on some of them in the time remaining. We will need confirmation that this agreement will be rolled over during the transition and thereafter extended until it can be widened and deepened. When does the Minister expect progress on this? There may be opportunities to bring down the cost of Japanese electrical vehicles which would speed up the reduction of both diesel vehicles and emissions in the UK. What assessment has the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy made of the potential for this? And what opportunities has the trade and working group identified for us to take forward? What would be the impact on the terms of this and any other relevant bilateral agreements were the UK to be part of a future trans-Pacific partnership that includes Japan?<\/p><p pid=\"b817.0\/4\">Our value to Japanese foreign direct investment depends not least on the ease with which manufactured goods here can access EU markets. Are Ministers clear about the implications of that? In terms of future transparency and parliamentary oversight, does the Minister agree that pre-consultation is the key? What is unsatisfactory about the EU withdrawal agreement arrangements is the idea that after a negotiation Parliament can send the Government back to the negotiating table; that is not a very practical approach. Now that we have EU-negotiated agreements with Korea, Vietnam, Singapore and Japan&#8212;not all implemented yet&#8212;this encouraging progress in the continent where growth is most likely to be the greatest gives us further opportunities to expand, for example through a services agreement with Hong Kong, Australasia, China and the nations of south-east Asia as well as India.<\/p><p pid=\"b817.0\/5\">In all of this, the opportunities for our international trade to go further and deeper are considerable. Nothing, of course, will be easy, but I hope the Minister will make a statement that will be strongly supportive of much closer UK trading relationships with Asia, where we need to open many doors in lands where trust is so important.<\/p>",

At that time, we were doing an inquiry into the three options for south-east airport expansion. I went into it completely open-minded, but at the end of the inquiry I was absolutely convinced that Heathrow was the only viable option. Five and a half years have passed, and I have seen this Government and the coalition pass the buck on making a decision on this important topic&#8212;whether there was a general election or a mayoral election coming up&#8212;so I am really glad that we are now having the vote.<\/p><p pid=\"d706.0\/2\">However, the issue has been ignored and put on the back burner for 50 years. In 1968 the Roskill commission on south-east airport capacity was launched, and since then we have been on the continuum of not grasping the real opportunity to invest in our infrastructure. I contrast what we have done with what has happened with Hong Kong airport. The difference is that that airport is owned by the state and there is a very clear commitment and understanding that investing in a country&#8217;s infrastructure helps it to grow.<\/p><p pid=\"d706.0\/3\">I recognise the difficult time that many MPs have had in making the decision on how to vote. I completely understand the role of constituency MPs in serving the views and opinions of their constituents. But I would ask everybody else for whom this is not a direct constituency issue to think of the national interest, and what will happen to our economy in 10, 20 or 50 years&#8217; time if we do not invest.<\/p><p pid=\"d706.0\/4\">I say this for a particular reason. During the Transport Committee inquiry, we had some of the big international airlines come and talk to us about what their preferred option was. They said, &#8220;Actually, this is not an issue for us any more because we plan 20 years ahead, minimum, and so we have already started to discount the UK as our hub.&#8221; I know that we are in a race against time, but I want us to be putting forward a really clear message that we will invest in the infrastructure and in the people of this country. I am therefore very proud to be voting for the Heathrow option.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a2147.3\/1\">My Lords, I am delighted to have secured this topical debate today and I look forward to hearing noble Lords&#8217; contributions. Perhaps I may take this opportunity to welcome the Minister to her place and say how appropriate it is, on the longest day and the summer solstice, that in responding to the debate she represents the department known as the &#8220;department of sunshine&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a2147.3\/2\">The G7 summit earlier this month, hosted by Canada and held in Quebec, aimed to promote the rules-based international order to advance free and fair global trade, promising talks leading to more trade between the subscribing nations. Why does the G7 matter? In my view, it matters precisely because it bridges trade relations between the EU and world trade through the World Trade Organization. In looking at the implications for our future trade relations in this debate, we must ponder the reasons for the failure to reach agreement in Canada.<\/p><p pid=\"a2147.3\/3\">The background to the June G7 summit was the latest UK trade figures in April 2018 showing a widening of the total UK trade deficit to &#163;9.7 billion in the last quarter for which figures are available. This change was due mainly to falling exports in both goods and services. Exports of goods fell by &#163;3.1 billion due to falls mainly in exports of machinery, pharmaceuticals and aircraft, while exports in services fell by &#163;2.5 billion. I find the figures surprising given that the pound is at a low level. In this situation one would have expected exports to have risen. Given the fact that we are negotiating our exit from the European Union, it is perhaps not surprising that our trade deficit in goods with the EU has grown while that with non-EU countries has improved.<\/p><p pid=\"a2147.3\/4\">Looking at the backdrop to these figures and the failure to reach agreement at the G7 summit, I conclude that trade relations pose the greatest threat to the global order. In a post-Brexit world, we in the UK are seeking to negotiate our own trade deals, with the Government aiming initially to strike a good trade deal with the EU and subsequently with America, India, Australia and so on. Success will depend on all players playing by the rules but, following Donald  Trump&#8217;s behaviour at the summit and subsequently introducing tariffs on trade, respect for these rules is now in doubt.<\/p><p pid=\"a2147.3\/5\">I am delighted to say that Yorkshire seems to have bucked the trend. Trade figures show that the region outperformed the national average in the first three months of 2018, with an increase in both the amount of goods that Yorkshire exports and the number of companies exporting. In terms of food and farming, Yorkshire is well placed to compete with other regions of the UK and internationally. Exports to China from Yorkshire are growing, helped in particular by the sale of pigs&#8217; trotters and other parts to China where they are considered delicacies.<\/p><p pid=\"a2147.3\/6\">Without doubt, the EU is the UK&#8217;s most important market for food and drink exports, followed by the US and China. It generated &#163;13.3 billion of the total food and drink exports in 2017, which accounts for 60% of the total. The EU has 36 preferential trade agreements with more than 60 countries, representing 15% of all UK-traded goods, not just food and drink. Many Commonwealth countries have economic partnership agreements with the EU, giving preferential access for their goods to what will be a market of 440 million consumers after Brexit. The application of the EU&#8217;s standard rules of origin on the day after Brexit would be hugely damaging to UK-EU trade. Will my noble friend the Minister give the House a commitment today that the Government intend to negotiate specifically that this could not possibly happen?<\/p><p pid=\"a2147.3\/7\">In terms of the share of national exports as a percentage of world exports, China, excluding Hong Kong, led in 2016, followed by the EU, then the United States. As a major trading nation, the UK should welcome every opportunity to improve its international trading relations, so it was a disappointment that the June G7 summit was divisive and inconclusive. The attempt by President Trump to persuade the G7 partners to readmit Russia, following on from the decision to impose US tariffs on steel and aluminium, poisoned the atmosphere of the talks, which were then doomed to fail. Russia was admitted to the G7 in 1997 and removed in 2014, following the annexation of the Crimea. We should remember that in August 2014, Russia announced a ban on imports covering a wide range of agri-food and drink products from the EU, the US, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine and other countries. In the year following the ban&#8217;s implementation, UK food and drink exports to Russia fell by 52%. EU food and drink exports to Russia fell by 53%. US threats to impose tariffs on EU and Chinese exports to the US look set to raise the temperature in international trade talks further still, with consequent retaliatory measures. Rising trade tensions globally do not augur well for trade; nor do the signs of the world index in stock markets across the globe falling, as we saw this week. Signs of slower economic growth can be increased only by the prospect of a trade war between the US, the EU and China.<\/p><p pid=\"a2147.3\/8\">How can we best navigate these choppy waters in international trade? How do we replace the existing market of 505 million consumers on our doorstep with alternatives? There appears to be no simple answer. Current international tensions highlight the dangers  of leaving a trading bloc of 505 million consumers, of which we have been an intrinsic part since 1973. This debate provides the Minister with an opportunity to share on their behalf the Government&#8217;s priorities for future trade talks, mindful of the importance of talks to the food, drink and other manufacturing sectors.<\/p><p pid=\"a2147.3\/9\">I conclude with a small number of questions for my noble friend the Minister. The World Trade Organization&#8217;s existing trade dispute settlement mechanism currently dictates that the EU Commission manages trade disputes on behalf of the UK and other member states. Can the Minister assure the House that by the time we leave the EU on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-03-29\">29 March<\/phrase> 2019, the Government will be in a position to defend any trade disputes brought against the UK? Can she share with the House what the dispute resolution mechanism will be, as was envisaged&#8212;we would know&#8212;in the White Paper at the end of last year?<\/p><p pid=\"a2147.3\/10\">Finally, what is the current progress of the recent EU dispute brought before the World Trade Organization, relating to the US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports? As a general rule, what is the average length of time for such a dispute to be resolved? No matter how difficult we might think our relations and negotiations with the EU have been, I think the Minister will confirm that future negotiations on trade matters with the World Trade Organization could be 10 times worse.<\/p>",

We are asking that:<\/p><p class=\"indent\">&#8220;Within 12 months of section 1 of this Act coming into force, the Secretary of State must publish and lay before each House of Parliament a report on the international ivory market.&#8221;<\/p><p>The idea is that the report would provide practical analysis of the impact of the Bill on demand for ivory in the United Kingdom and in other countries. Importantly, we would want it to consider the impact on nations or communities that generate income from ivory. We are also looking at the work of the Department for International Development in reducing the global demand for ivory and mitigating any negative impact that the provisions of this Bill would have on those nations or communities.<\/p><p>The reason for tabling the new clause is that it is important to keep a close, watchful eye on any implications of the Bill on the international ivory market and the communities that will be most affected by an ivory ban. During the evidence sessions, a number of hon. Members asked about the international ivory market and what contribution the Bill could make specifically toward deterring poaching and having a wider impact on the illegal worldwide trade.<\/p><p>Recent analysis has shown that the United Kingdom is the largest supplier to the world&#8217;s legal ivory market, with more than 36,000 legal ivory items exported from the UK in the five years between 2010 and 2015. It is also one of the largest importers to China and Hong Kong. As we also heard during the evidence sessions, seizure data shows that, alongside the legal market, the UK plays an increasing role in the illegal ivory trade in import, in export and as a transit country. The president of the Born Free Foundation, for example, said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\">&#8220;Investment in wildlife law enforcement in Africa is really important.&#8221;<\/p><p>He also said that, in his view,<\/p><p class=\"indent\">&#8220;there is a common linkage with our clear objectives in overseas development,&#8221;<\/p><p>which are to do with poverty and providing opportunities, and that:<\/p><p class=\"indent\">&#8220;If we are not investing in the&#8230;areas where elephants and other species live, we are not doing a great service either&#8230;to the people who live&#8230;downstream from those protected areas.&#8221;&#8211;&#8211;[Official Report, Ivory Public Bill Committee, <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-06-12\">12 June<\/phrase> 2018; c. 9, Q12.]<\/p><p>In the evidence session, the International Fund for Animal Welfare made reference to the discussion on Second Reading about how some of the Department for International Development&#8217;s budget might be used. I am aware that the hon. Member for Cheltenham also mentioned that on Second Reading. IFAW said that<\/p><p class=\"indent\">&#8220;the impact of poaching on communities is not isolated from the illegal wildlife trade&#8230;There are good opportunities that exist with our overseas development budget to take a more integrated approach to delivering holistic aid and support and anti-poaching measures, to help build communities and tackle corruption...It is all part of a jigsaw that really helps, but our overseas aid is another part that we could potentially re-examine and look at, to provide better integrated aid.&#8221;&#8211;&#8211;[Official Report, Ivory Public Bill Committee, <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-06-12\">12 June<\/phrase> 2018; c. 14, Q18.]<\/p><p>I do not know whether hon. Members saw it, but this morning CNN released a very interesting report on what has happened to the poaching of African elephants following the ban that the Chinese Government imposed on ivory on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-01-01\">1 January<\/phrase>. CNN went to Mozambique specifically to see whether that ban was having an impact on poaching. I will just mention a few things about that report, because if we are looking to introduce our own legislation we need to look at the impact of other legislation on ivory from around the world, to see what areas we need to work in; perhaps that other legislation is not being as effective as it could have been.<\/p><p>One of the things that the CNN investigation found was that six months after that ban smugglers were still working with near-impunity. As I said, CNN went to Mozambique, to the Niassa reserve, which is one of the last great wildernesses in southern Africa. What the CNN team found was that the different officers who work there trying to stop poaching told them that corruption is the source of poaching. Looking to invest, along with DFID, to start to tackle that corruption will be really important if this Bill is to have the effect we want.<\/p><p>CNN said that the huge Niassa reserve should be home to thousands of elephants, but it is now thought that less than 2,000 are left there, which is really shocking. As part of its investigation, CNN also interviewed the people actually doing the poaching. Just as the drug lord obviously does not go and harvest his own cocaine, in the same way the people who are actually making money out of poaching do not go out and shoot the elephants themselves.<\/p><p>CNN went to a prison where there was a suspected poacher, and he said: &#8220;We were in the bush when we found a group of elephants. I shot the first one, then I shot the second one.&#8221; He then said that he had already spent a year in jail for a separate poaching incident. But his choices are limited; he said that he would do anything to help his family escape grinding poverty. He said, &#8220;I went poaching because I was suffering. I had nothing to survive on and I was desperate.&#8221;<\/p><p>So the poachers who kill elephants are usually poor and just looking for a way to feed themselves and their family, and often they do not have alternatives to wildlife crime. Poverty is causing poaching in Mozambique. Even if the Chinese ban had ended the market, or if the ban that we are putting place ended it, the poachers on the ground would continue this behaviour.<\/p><p>The new clause is designed to consider how we can do something to tackle that problem, take the focus of the Bill beyond just this country and do something to look at what causes poaching in the first place.<\/p>",

I am a little unsure of the Labour party&#8217;s tactics in trying to shift the Transport Secretary from his position, because it seems to me that the longer he stays in post, the more incompetent he shows the UK Government to be&#8212;and they, unlike the franchises, have real competition. He finished by saying there was a lot of political points scoring and that we should all work together, but it would be best if he took on board some of the criticisms. Any criticisms made&#8212;or even valid observations&#8212;are dismissed out of hand as political points scoring, when they are not, especially given that the franchise system is on its knees.<\/p><p pid=\"b220.2\/3\">We have seen time and again that the Secretary of State is blinkered and ideological. He is a hardcore Brexiteer with the mantra, &#8220;Everything will be just fine. We just need to get on with it&#8221;, as illustrated by his proclamation that there will be no border checks post-Brexit and that lorries, just like on the US-Canada border, will not need to be stopped and checked. I have pointed out several times that that is wrong, but I have never had an admission of wrongdoing from the Secretary of State, and that is part of the problem.<\/p><p pid=\"b220.2\/4\">The Secretary of State&#8217;s ideological zeal is at its most visible when it comes to the railways&#8212;private sector equals good, nationalisation or public ownership equals bad and inefficient&#8212;yet, under the current set-up, state-owned railway companies from all over the world run franchises in the UK. The UK franchise system, based on the premise that public ownership is bad, is subsidising railways across the world. Chiltern Railways, CrossCountry, Northern, and Wales and Borders are run by Arriva, which is owned by Deutsche Bahn. Essex Thameside is run by Trenitalia UK, which is owned by the Italian state railway. Greater Anglia and ScotRail are run by Abellio, which is owned by NedRailways, and Abellio is also involved with the West Midlands franchise, along with the East Japan Railway Company. Southeastern, Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern are run by Govia, which includes Keolis, which is owned by the French state rail operator, SNCF. Keolis is also involved in TransPennine Express and will be part of the re-let Welsh franchise later this year.<\/p><p pid=\"b220.2\/5\">Italian, French, German, Dutch, Hong Kong and Japanese state rail companies are running franchises  in the UK. When I weigh this up, I start to wonder  whether the UK franchising system should be classed as foreign aid&#8212;because that is what it seems like. Money is flowing out of the UK to these other countries. It illustrates perfectly the pig-headed attitude of the Secretary of State and Tory Back Benchers.<\/p>",

[Hon. Members: &#8220;Hear, hear!] I think everyone agrees what a beautiful and wonderful animal it is. The number of hippos in the world has crashed by 95% in 30 years, and that is widely acknowledged to be a knock-on effect of the increasing restrictions on the trade in elephant ivory. For example, in the Virunga national park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo there were 29,000 hippos and there are now just 1,300. The hippo is vulnerable and is on the red list of threatened species, and there is deep concern that it is being poached and hunted for its teeth, particularly as the loopholes close around elephant ivory. In 2014, 60 tonnes of hippo teeth were exported to Hong Kong from Africa, and from there they were sent to European countries. If the purpose of the Bill is to close markets that are driving that trade, there is clearly a strong integrated global trade in hippo teeth that has a huge effect on the species.<\/p><p>Different countries are taking different steps. Uganda has banned the trade in hippo teeth, and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo the hippo is a protected species. It is vital that we take this opportunity to send out the message that we in this country do not believe that  hippos should be killed or poached for their teeth, and that our view is that our legislation on protecting elephant ivory will not have a damaging impact on the hippopotamus.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Sharma, for our second day in Committee. As the Minister has set out, schedule 3 provides some clarity over financial penalties, including notices of intent, recovery of penalties and proceeds of those penalties. The Opposition support the schedule as drafted. We are seeking clarity, however, from the Minister on certain aspects, before we give our support for its inclusion in the Bill. I would like to focus on paragraphs 6 and 7, which deal with the specifics of appeals and the recovery of penalties.<\/p><p>As with any piece of legislation such as this, the right to appeal is extremely important. It is correct that this is reflected in the Bill. It is also vital that the conditions of any appeal are presented with the utmost clarity to prevent abuse or a miscarriage of justice. Pre-legislative scrutiny by the Select Committee rightly raised concerns about how the Bill defined grounds for appeal, arguing that a first-tier tribunal should decide appeals as complete rehearings, which should take into account all matters, whether known to the local authority at the time of its decision or not. We are glad that the Government took that into account and amended the Bill accordingly. However, a number of questions about appeals remain, and I hope that the Minister can offer some clarity in his response.<\/p><p>Paragraph 6(5) of schedule 3 confirms the following:<\/p><p class=\"indent\">&#8220;On an appeal under this paragraph the First-tier Tribunal may quash, confirm or vary the final notice.&#8221;<\/p><p>That is an important requirement where the first-tier tribunal finds in favour of the landlord or agent. I think it is clear to us all that where the first-tier tribunal finds fully in favour of the landlord or agent&#8212;that is, it finds that the decision to impose the penalty was incorrect&#8212;it is quite a simple process; the final notice will be quashed.<\/p><p>However, where the tribunal finds in favour of a landlord or agent who has challenged the amount of the penalty rather than the decision itself, things become more complicated. I hope that the Minister can offer us some detail on the type of situations in which there may be a challenge to the amount of the penalty and in which the tribunal might be expected to find in favour and therefore vary that amount. Before it was amended, the Bill mentioned the amount of the penalty being &#8220;unreasonable&#8221;&#8212;a very vague term. That term has been removed from the Bill, but the current version still offers little clarity on that point. I hope that the Minister can give us assurances that more clarity will be provided on what constitutes genuine grounds for appeal on the amount of penalty. It is not hard to imagine a situation in which lack of clarity opens the door to an unprecedented number of appeals on the grounds that the cost is unreasonable.<\/p><p>What is more, there is confusion about the level of financial penalty that authorities will be able to charge. That was discussed in the Select Committee report, which raised concerns about how the Bill seemed to suggest that authorities could set the level of fee dependent on the cost of enforcement&#8212;something that we will come on to in more detail. That has the potential to place a significant burden on first-tier tribunals, and I wonder whether the Minister has considered the implications of this part of the Bill. Should we not have more clarity on what does and does not represent a reasonable or unreasonable cost?<\/p><p>Another aspect of the appeals system could benefit from closer Government attention. Any appeals system such as this is essentially a safety net for bad decision making at the first stage. That means that if a significant number of decisions are overturned at the appeal stage, something is going wrong at the enforcement or judicial level. We all know from dealing with casework in other areas&#8212;particularly disability benefit&#8212;how easy it is for that to happen. Sadly, in the case of disability benefits and first-tier tribunals, the Government are not doing enough to look at why so many decisions initially go against the claimant and are then overturned at tribunal.<\/p><p>If this Bill is wrongly enforced, it has the potential to impact negatively on a large number of businesses and landlords across the country. The time and effort needed to fight an incorrect decision would be significant; the legal fees and time investment needed could be extremely detrimental to businesses. It is therefore very important that some form of review date be put in place to guarantee a detailed look at how many appeals are being submitted, what percentage are successful and for what reason. That will give the Government the ability to identify consistently occurring issues and resolve them. I hope that the Minister will consider that and give us his thoughts on whether the Government would introduce a review of that type&#8212;for example, six months  after the Bill takes effect. I know that such a measure would be supported by landlords, agents and enforcement authorities.<\/p><p>Paragraph 7 provides important clarity on the recovery of financial penalties. Like paragraph 6, this paragraph has been amended following feedback from the Select Committee. We agree with the Government&#8217;s decision to amend the Bill to that effect. However, there are still question marks over how this aspect of the Bill will be enforced, and I hope that the Minister will be able to offer us assurances. One issue would be the recovering of fines from non-UK residents. We are all aware of the issues about foreign ownership in the property market. Characterised by a lack of transparency, London in particular is regularly cited as a haven for dirty money. That creates clear issues about enforcing good standards in the property market. Recently, that has been seen most acutely in the issues about the recladding of private tower blocks, which we discussed in the Chamber yesterday.<\/p><p>To give just a small example, I had to write to a well-known Hong Kong billionaire playboy called Stephen Hung, whom my office, after a long search, had identified as the ultimate owner of an unsafe tower block in my constituency. The water supply had been turned off for a whole week, and it was the third time that that had happened. Only through lots of interrogation did we find out who he actually was and put the situation right. There are therefore questions about how the Government expect local enforcement authorities to be able to enforce effectively the fines under the Bill when those responsible for the offences live in other countries.<\/p><p>The second issue is companies that are deliberately folded to avoid payment. Linked to my previous point about foreign ownership, the situation in the private rented sector is such that ultimate ownership of property can be obscured by multiple shell companies or other opaque ownership structures. It is not impossible to imagine a situation in which rogue landlords and agents are able to game the system&#8212;for example, ownership structures for property that might allow owners to avoid a fine by folding one company while keeping others going. That would also allow rogue landlords or agents to continue trading on the rest of their assets, thereby avoiding any potential ban. Overall, the Opposition support the inclusion of the schedule in the Bill, but I hope that the Minister will look at the points I have raised and will offer reassurance that they will be considered carefully.<\/p>",

The noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, led us off by looking at the regulatory and supervisory architecture. My noble friend Lord Lindsay then looked at market mutual access and spelled out how it was in the UK&#8217;s and EU&#8217;s interests that that should continue. The noble Baroness, Lady Liddell, reminded us that the financial services industry extends way beyond the City of London and that Edinburgh is a major centre, as is Leeds. The Chancellor of the Exchequer recently visited both those cities and met people involved in financial services. It also extends into places such as Bristol, Norfolk and Bournemouth. The industry really is a focus of strength for the whole UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a1365.1\/3\">My noble friend Lord De Mauley pointed out that regulatory challenges can also be opportunities, and he cited developments such as the adoption of the FCA regulatory sandbox. I felt that at points the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, dragged us back to a Second Reading of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill and I got deeply&#8212;no, perhaps I will not say what I felt about that. However, I want to focus on a point on which we do agree, which is the vital importance of the industry, with the &#163;60 billion trade surplus in financial services and the mutual benefit that it brings. The noble Lord, Lord Bruce, raised a very important point about the continuation of existing contracts which many consumers rely on, and I will come back to that later.<\/p><p pid=\"a1365.1\/4\">My noble friend Lady Neville-Rolfe talked about international co-operation and reminded us that the global architecture extends well beyond the EU. Of course, we can play a major role in the G7, the G20 and the OECD. The noble Lord, Lord Davies, talked about issues such as Solvency II and passporting, which, in his view, had been working particularly well, but his challenges to the report&#8217;s conclusions were heard. The noble Lord, Lord Desai, pondered whether rational self-interest would have a determining effect and questioned whether EU negotiators would recognise the importance to the EU of the City of London as a venture. The noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, talked about the potential challenges for the continuation of financial services and regulatory supervision. The noble  Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, concluded by reminding us of the burdens which taking back these regulatory powers will have on Parliament and how that regulation will be undertaken. I will come back to some of the questions that were raised, but it has been an extremely helpful debate.<\/p><p pid=\"a1365.1\/5\">The UK is home to the world&#8217;s pre-eminent global financial and professional services centre, in part because of smart regulation and supervision that have tread a careful line between allowing businesses to flourish, and protecting consumers and financial stability. In the latest iteration of the Z\/Yen Global Financial Centres Index, produced in March 2018, London again ranked first. That was not pre but post the referendum and post the triggering of Article 50. No other European city was in the top five. We want to preserve the world-leading position of our regulatory architecture and of our regulators. We are committed to high regulatory standards, and Brexit will never mean ripping up the rule book or a race to the bottom.<\/p><p pid=\"a1365.1\/6\">To sustain the level of cross-border activity between our firms and Europe&#8217;s businesses and consumers, we need a relationship that is robust enough to give confidence to those on both sides. We cannot rely on the EU&#8217;s existing equivalence framework, as has been mentioned. It is unilateral, piecemeal and unlikely to preserve and deliver much regulatory comparability over time. We need to agree a more comprehensive and stable bilateral deal that recognises the unique nature of the UK-EU future relationship. Paris and Frankfurt will not be the winners of market fragmentation; the winners will be centres such as New York and Singapore. We are aiming to shape a regime to manage future regulatory change that ensures that, although our rule systems might evolve separately, we deliver fully equivalent regulatory outcomes, maintaining commitments to support open markets and fair competition.<\/p><p pid=\"a1365.1\/7\">The Chancellor has set out a clear vision for our future relationship with the EU on financial services. This has been well received by the industry, and we are beginning to hear voices within the EU recognise the value of our proposition. Our vision is grounded in mutual recognition of equivalent regulation, with a dialogue on setting regulatory requirements and having supervisory co-operation arrangements that are reciprocal and reliable, and an independent arbitration mechanism to provide durable dispute resolution. Reaching agreement on this does not need to be a challenging objective&#8212;our rule books are already aligned and our markets are already deeply interconnected. We continue to ensure that our exit from the EU will be smooth and orderly. We made a big step forward in agreeing the legal text on the implementation period, which will keep market access on existing terms for firms and consumers.<\/p><p pid=\"a1365.1\/8\">Looking to the future, as the report notes, there are opportunities for the financial services sector to become more outward facing. The UK already has world-leading positions in the markets of the future, including fintech, for which we have developed what we call fintech bridges to other jurisdictions&#8212;most recently Australia. A recent report cited the prime centres for fintech around the world as Silicon Valley, Shanghai and the City of London, again underscoring the strength of our position.<\/p><p pid=\"a1365.1\/9\">We are world leaders in green and sustainable finance, or rupee and renminbi products, and we are committed to strengthening that position further. That also means expanding our bilateral relationships with key partners around the globe, including our economic and financial dialogues with China, India, Brazil, Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan. There are enormous growth opportunities for the future.<\/p><p pid=\"a1365.1\/10\">I shall now turn to some of the questions raised during the debate. The noble Baroness, Lady Liddell, and my noble friend Lady Neville-Rolfe referred to international bodies and standards. The Government remain committed to the full, timely and consistent implementation of agreed international standards. The UK is an active member of several international standard-setters, including the International Monetary Fund and the Financial Stability Board. The Government believe that continued participation in these organisations is essential to ensure the consistent adoption of international regulatory standards.<\/p><p pid=\"a1365.1\/11\">My noble friend Lord Lindsay and the noble Baroness, Lady Liddell, made a point about rule-taking or rule-making. Because of the size of the UK&#8217;s financial services market, the complexity of the products traded on it and the consequent risks to our taxpayers, we cannot sign up to accept automatically as yet unknown future rule changes. We must have the ability, if necessary, to deliver an equivalent outcome by different means while protecting UK taxpayers from potentially unacceptable risks. The noble Baroness, Lady Liddell, and my noble friend Lady Neville-Rolfe talked about continued access for skilled workers. We have repeatedly made it clear that we do not regard the referendum result as a vote for the UK to pull up the drawbridge. On the contrary, the UK will remain an open and tolerant country&#8212;one that recognises the valuable contribution that migrants have made to our society, especially in the realm of financial services.<\/p><p pid=\"a1365.1\/12\">The noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, asked about the transition period. We have now reached an agreement on the implementation period. This agreement and the statements made by the Bank of England and the FCA give business confidence about the future arrangements that will apply immediately after the UK&#8217;s exit.<\/p><p pid=\"a1365.1\/13\">Furthermore, our regulators have announced that they are prepared to act to enable firms accessing the UK from the EU to continue to operate in the UK without having to apply for UK authorisations for the duration of the implementation period. But we cannot provide full reassurance to firms on our own; we need a bilateral solution with the EU to resolve hugely important issues such as continuity of contracts.<\/p><p pid=\"a1365.1\/14\">The noble Lord, Lord Bruce, raised particular points on contracts. The Financial Policy Committee estimates that 10 million UK policyholders and 38 million EEA policyholders could be affected by these changes. There is a shared interest for both the UK and the EU in ensuring that we avoid outcomes that impose unnecessary costs and disruption on individuals and businesses. That is why we are focused on agreeing a deep and special future partnership with the EU. But of course, as a responsible Government, we continue to plan for all scenarios. It is vital that we work with our EU partners to put technical arrangements in place to  avoid market disruption. Furthermore, the Treasury announced on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-12-20\">20 December<\/phrase> 2017 that it would legislate if necessary to ensure that contractual obligations of EU firms with UK-based customers, such as those in insurance contracts, can continue to be met.<\/p><p pid=\"a1365.1\/15\">The noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, questioned whether it was unrealistic to include financial services in a free trade agreement. All the EU&#8217;s recent free trade agreements make provision for financial services, from CETA to Japan, and the need for a close relationship is even more important for two markets as intertwined as ours. In the TTIP negotiations, the EU even pitched a relationship based on mutual recognition of regulations and a dialogue on aligning future regulation.<\/p><p pid=\"a1365.1\/16\">Financial services firms across the UK have confidence that the Government are committed to leaving the EU in a way that underpins prosperity and avoids unnecessary disruption and dangerous cliff edges for businesses across the UK. We are making significant progress, and this has been well received by the industry. Since December we have reached agreement with the EU on the implementation period. We have agreed a technical dialogue on cliff-edge risks, to be led by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, and the Chancellor has set out a clear vision for our future relationship with the EU on financial services. These measures have been well received by the industry in the UK. We continue to work closely with businesses located throughout the United Kingdom to ensure that they are prepared for a smooth and orderly withdrawal from the EU. We will continue to do that and remain grateful for the quality and contribution of this report to that effort.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b115.0\/1\">As my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Zac Goldsmith\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24911\">the Member for Richmond Park (Zac Goldsmith)<\/phrase> said, this is good news. It is very rare to have good news that is supported by all parties in this House. I cannot say I disagree with anything that has been said by anybody on either side of the House, which is also pretty rare. I am delighted that the Bill has come before the House.<\/p><p pid=\"b115.0\/2\">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has shown huge leadership by pushing the Bill forward, and I think he will bring it in as swiftly as he possibly can. He is, of course, building on the work of other Secretaries of State before him, and particularly on the leadership of the right hon. William Hague&#8212;Lord Hague&#8212;and the former Prime Minister David Cameron, who said that we should leave this world a better place. I believe that by passing the Bill, we will do that.<\/p><p pid=\"b115.0\/3\">Africa needs elephants more than it probably realises in many cases, because it needs the tourism they bring. Many people in the House have young children. I am fortunate enough to have five grandchildren, and I want them to see the elephants. My eldest granddaughter, who will be 14 next month, has seen elephants, but if the ban does not go through and other countries, such as China and America, do not support it in a more limited form, my youngest, who is only three, may not see those iconic creatures, which we all think are fantastic for every reason we can possibly imagine.<\/p><p pid=\"b115.0\/4\">The saddest thing about elephant poaching is that it is the oldest elephants that are poached&#8212;because they have the biggest tusks, they are a target for the poachers. They are the wise ones of the herd, and they teach and explain to younger family members exactly how to behave. Unfortunately, we are getting some rather wild elephants that are delinquent because they have not had that training, so the sooner we can breed more elephants in the wild to keep the groups together and make those groups larger, the better. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, we need to keep the beautiful savannahs as they are.<\/p><p pid=\"b115.0\/5\">Poachers kill many rangers, and I would like more Department for International Development money to be spent on training more rangers. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"John Mann\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11093\">The hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)<\/phrase> spoke about using alternative technologies, and that is something that DFID could explore. We could spend more time training people in African countries to understand how they can best beat the poachers, who are pretty clever and are ahead of the game. We need to beat them at it.<\/p><p pid=\"b115.0\/6\">African elephants are important, but we need to look at other species with tusks that contain ivory, including rhinos and Indian elephants. We need to think hard about how we can include those species, but I do not want to water down the Bill. I want it to be specific, because it is important, but perhaps the Secretary of State will look at how he could include other species later, particularly to save the rhinos, which are on the verge of extinction.<\/p><p pid=\"b115.0\/7\">There are many other things that we could do to help the world, including the rainforests. Tigers are endangered, as are gorillas, giraffes and many more animals. We need to save them from extinction because, as I have said, I want my grandchildren and great-grandchildren to be able to go and see those different species. It is important for all of us to give future generations that opportunity.<\/p><p pid=\"b115.0\/8\">There are a couple more points that I want to mention, but I do not want to take too much time, because this debate is fairly short. It would be useful if DEFRA published a register showing how many exemptions have been issued under the historical, artistic and cultural definition every year, so that a picture could be built up of all the relevant artefacts, which would be verified by people who know what they are doing, such as the V&amp;A and other museums. That register ought to be publicly available, and it would demonstrate a commitment that the exemption is for the rarest and most important items only, not just any old ivory artefact.<\/p><p pid=\"b115.0\/9\">Several Members have mentioned the National Wildlife Crime Unit. I hope that the Secretary of State will be able to announce permanent funding for the unit, as its existing funding expires in 2020. That should be part of the UK commitment to enforcement. I also hope that the Border Force CITES team at Heathrow will have sufficient manpower and resources, as it will be the frontline of our defence against illegal imports coming into the UK and organised criminal activity.<\/p><p pid=\"b115.0\/10\">Finally, I would like to discuss Hong Kong. Although the Chinese support the ivory ban and, I am pleased to say, were ahead of us, I am told that in Hong Kong&#8212;I have a nephew out there&#8212;ivory continues to be passed off as mammoth tusks. It is perfectly legal to trade mammoth tasks, so will the Secretary of State work with Chinese leaders to try to shut down that market?  Perhaps he could include a ban on mammoth ivory to close that loophole. People can test the difference between mammoth and elephant tusks, but what border agent or police officer would know about that? They would not challenge it, so we have to be firm and make sure that we close as many loopholes as possible to save these iconic animals that we all want future generations to see. However, I continue to congratulate the Secretary of State on moving fast; I would like to see him do more and move faster.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1205.0\/1\">My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend Lord Lexden on introducing this debate and share his hope that the Government will arrange to commemorate the contribution of Empire and Commonwealth troops during the First World War. It is estimated that about one-third of the troops raised by Britain were from what was then the Empire: Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, India, the Caribbean, Africa, Fiji, Hong Kong and so on. In the short time available I shall say a very few words  about the Australian contribution, which was enormous and, in the final weeks on the Western Front, some would say decisive.<\/p><p pid=\"a1205.0\/2\">Australia supported this country from the start. When warning of impending war arrived by cable in July 1914, the leaders of both political parties, then engaged in an election campaign, pledged to support, help and defend the mother country, in Andrew Fisher&#8217;s words,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1205.0\/3\">&#8220;to our last man and our last shilling&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a1205.0\/4\">The first Allied shot of the war was fired on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-08-05\">5 August<\/phrase> by Australian artillery from Fort Nepean, Port Phillip, when the German ship &#8220;Pfalz&#8221; tried to leave Melbourne. The first Australian casualties were in September when the Australian expeditionary force to New Britain, in what is now Papua New Guinea, captured the German wireless station prior to capturing Rabaul and taking the surrender of German New Guinea.<\/p><p pid=\"a1205.0\/5\">On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-11-01\">1 November<\/phrase> the first convoy of Australian and New Zealand forces, accompanied, it is said, by the largest embarkation of horses in the history of the world, left Albany in Western Australia for Egypt, where the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps was formed.<\/p><p pid=\"a1205.0\/6\">On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-04-25\">25 April<\/phrase>, the ANZAC forces landed in Gallipoli and fought heroically with British, French and Indian forces in an eight-month campaign that was intended to shorten the war but ended in withdrawal. Some 7,600 Australians and 2,500 New Zealanders&#8212;a very high proportion of those engaged&#8212;were killed or wounded. Out of a total of 265,000 Allied casualties, 46,000 perished. During the next few years, Australia, with a population of less than 4.9 million, raised over 416,000 military personnel, all of them volunteers. Over 59,000 of them were killed or died of wounds and over 152,000 were wounded. The war enhanced Australia&#8217;s sense of nationhood, with the Commonwealth of Australia having come into existence in 1901. At the same time, it caused deep rifts in society.<\/p><p pid=\"a1205.0\/7\">In January 1918, the Australian Corps came into being in France under the command of Sir William Birdwood, who had commanded the ANZAC forces since Gallipoli. He was succeeded in May by General John Monash, an Australian of German descent. The corps consisted of 166,000 troops, equivalent to 9% of the British and dominion combat forces in France. An engineer by profession, Monash developed methods of combining the deployment of artillery, aircraft, tanks and infantry, which won important victories at Hamel and Mont St Quentin. With his troops, Monash had acquired a formidable reputation&#8212;a ferocious reputation to the Germans&#8212;and was knighted in the field by King George V in August, before spearheading the final assault on the Hindenburg Line, which led to the Armistice.<\/p><p pid=\"a1205.0\/8\">In a letter to a relative in 1914, Monash referred to Australia&#8217;s duty,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1205.0\/9\">&#8220;to help the Empire to crush a peril which may mean the end of Australia as a free country&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a1205.0\/10\">He and his countrymen did that, together with troops from many other nations. Their valour is commemorated annually on Anzac Day and Remembrance Sunday. The British Government have done much work, as have others, since 2014 to commemorate the centenary  of the war. As we approach the centenary of the end of the war, it would be fitting, as this country occupies the chair of the Commonwealth, for there to be a special commemoration of the contribution and sacrifice of the Empire and Commonwealth troops.<\/p>",

The Minister, to his credit, spent quite a lot of his speech arguing against government Amendment 22. I wondered why the Deputy Speaker did not call the government amendments and had some suspicions, now proved, that they were tabled too late. I add my disappointment at the seemingly lackadaisical attitude of the FCO. That, as my noble friend Lord Naseby said, is deeply disappointing when the issue is so important.<\/p><p pid=\"b938.0\/2\">I should like to refer to one or two points that have been raised. First, none of the overseas territories are on the EU blacklist of non-co-operative tax jurisdictions. Secondly, as I understand it, money laundering is a devolved issue for the overseas territories. Therefore, I question the assertion of the noble Lord, Lord Beith, that it comes under the area of international relations or international treaties. To legislate without even consulting their Parliaments, let alone asking for their consent, is deeply wrong. In addition, the EU withdrew its proposal for public registers in December 2016 on the ground of concern about human rights. Could this be another case that the overseas territories could pursue?<\/p><p pid=\"b938.0\/3\">Most countries are not adopting public registers. For the Caribbean overseas territories, the rival centres are the USA, Hong Kong and Singapore. They do not have public registers. To use an Order in Council for financial regulation, when the overseas territories have already adopted international standards, could expose the UK to legal challenge and be overturned on judicial review. I do not regard this as an exceptional circumstance where the UK Government should make laws.<\/p><p pid=\"b938.0\/4\">The other place may think it good short-term politics, but the serious economic consequences and damage to our relationship with the overseas territories, and with the Commonwealth, will be long lasting. Perhaps one of the noble and learned Lords in the House will give their services pro bono for judicial review.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c626.0\/1\">My Lords, I will speak extremely briefly on Amendment 57. This is merely a drafting suggestion on an issue where there is common ground with the Government. Trouble arises if you use the word &#8220;classes&#8221; to an insurance-based person like me, for whom it has a different meaning. To me, it means things like motor insurance, medical negligence or employer&#8217;s liability. I want to make sure that it is clear that one can not only follow the jurisprudence of Jonathan Sumption sitting in Guernsey&#8212;as has just been pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Faulks&#8212;and vary things a little bit by head, but also in terms of what I call the yield curve. The yield curve is a very simple thing: the longer you invest the money, generally, the higher the interest rate you get.<\/p><p pid=\"c626.0\/2\">For instance, if you invest the money for a month with the US Government at the moment you will get -0.25% or so; if you invest it for 10 years you will get 3% or so. On the whole, there is a gentle yield curve. That is reflected in Hong Kong and in Ontario, where they have a system of discount rates. In Hong Kong, if you will have future needs for between nought and five years in the court&#8217;s assessment, the discount rate used is 0.5%, between five and 10 years it is 1%, and over 10 years it is 2.5%. In Ontario they split it into two rather than three, and again it is based on the number of years of your future needs, which is assessed by the court: between nought and 15 years it is 0% at the moment, and over 15 years it is 2.5%.<\/p><p pid=\"c626.0\/3\">I therefore wanted to ensure in this amendment that the Lord Chancellor could set differential rates for something wider than classes, according to my meaning of classes: on the basis of the number of years of future needs, thereby following the successful Hong Kong and Ontario discount rate regimes.<\/p>",

We entered the research department together on exactly the same day in the 1960s.<\/p><p pid=\"a2078.0\/2\">It was a very eloquent speech, but it had one flaw. What I agreed with, and why I have torn up my other speech, is that my noble friend is quite right in saying that we cannot mess about with this question of whether we leave or not, or whether there is a border or not. He is absolutely right in saying that we cannot have a sort of fantasy border. If you leave, what it means is that you depart one set of rules and one market to go to another market. He is quite right in saying that at that point, you acquire a border. I absolutely agree with that.<\/p><p pid=\"a2078.0\/3\">The question is whether the whole future of this country is to be dependent, as his speech seemed to imply, on one issue&#8212;our relationship with the Republic of Ireland. Is our whole future to be dependent on that? I have to say that I do not think that it should be. There are ways around it, and they do not include having a fantasy border. For instance, if we have a border between two different markets and we do not go down the path, which was one of my noble friend&#8217;s alternatives, of the Republic joining us, what we must have, in the normal way in which these things are done, is a bilateral agreement between Britain and the Republic of Ireland. We should probably do that&#8212;make the final agreement&#8212;after we have come out, because we will then be totally in charge of our destiny and be able to make whatever agreements we want and the European Union, with which the Republic of Ireland will have to make its peace, will be less inclined to obstruct such a bilateral agreement.<\/p><p pid=\"a2078.0\/4\">There is no reason why we should not have a bilateral agreement&#8212;and there is no reason why we should be particularly nice to the Irish Republic, as it  has not been particularly nice to us in recent months. It is absolutely right, however, that we should try to maintain the good will and the pleasant relationship that we have had in recent times, but we can do it in the normal way in which these things are conducted. We do not have to have the whole of our policy towards the European Union obstructed by this one element. My noble friend suggested that to do this, we should turn our backs on what the British people have asked us to do and voted for us to do, which would be an enormous decision for us to have to make and quite wrong, in my view. A lot of what my noble friend said is good sense in terms of the actualities of the border and us leaving a market, but I think that his conclusion is the opposite of the right one.<\/p>",

Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Vicky Ford\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25614\">the Member for Chelmsford (Vicky Ford)<\/phrase> on securing the debate, and my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Lee Rowley\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25685\">the Member for North East Derbyshire (Lee Rowley)<\/phrase> and the hon. Members for Glasgow Central (Alison Thewliss) and for Stalybridge and Hyde (Jonathan Reynolds) on their contributions.<\/p><p pid=\"a461.0\/2\">We have had a very well-informed discussion of a wide range of financial services issues. It felt as if every discussion I have had over the last three and a half months as a Minister has been put under scrutiny. I will try to respond to all the points raised. I acknowledge  the deep knowledge and experience of my hon. Friend the Member for Chelmsford, in both her work in financial services, infrastructure and project financing and, more recently, her work as a Member of the European Parliament, particularly on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.<\/p><p pid=\"a461.0\/3\">Before I get into the substance of the issues, it would be useful to acknowledge that today&#8217;s debate is occurring not in a vacuum, but in the context of a strong and resilient economy. GDP growth has remained solid at 1.8% in 2017, extending the period of continuous growth to five years. That is higher than the 1.5% forecast at the autumn Budget. The UK economy has beaten expectations, and the Treasury and the Government will continue to set ourselves the mission to beat the forecasts. As Economic Secretary to the Treasury, I am committed, along with my Treasury officials, to ensuring that the financial services industry retains its place on the mantel as a beacon of prosperity for this country.<\/p><p pid=\"a461.0\/4\">As I continue to tell industry and my colleagues in Government, financial services constitute the plumbing of this country&#8217;s economy. We do not want to be reticent about describing and applauding that. Financial services, as others have mentioned, represent 12% of total UK economic output, and the industry contributed &#163;72.1 billion to the Exchequer in 2016-17&#8212;11% of total Government tax receipts. It is a critical industry for our nation.<\/p><p pid=\"a461.0\/5\">As others have also mentioned, more than 1 million people are employed in the financial and insurance sector in the UK. Some 63% of those jobs are outside London, with 52% outside London and the south-east. That includes 98,000 in the north-west, and 87,000 in Scotland&#8212;including, I understand, that of the spouse of the hon. Member for Glasgow Central. Those figures represent the livelihoods of people up and down this country and, as the hon. Lady pointed out, they represent a multitude of jobs beyond the square mile. As I often point out, there is a whole ecosystem of support services and economic activity related to financial services. Bank tellers, mortgage brokers, salespeople, and IT staff form the backbone of this industry in the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a461.0\/6\">The Government&#8217;s approach to financial services is based on ensuring that the sector does what it should: effectively channelling savings and capital flows into productive investment to allow the real economy to manage financial risk, take advantage of commercial opportunities, and boost economic prosperity up, down and across the country.<\/p><p pid=\"a461.0\/7\">Our historical success has been based on being the most open and dynamic financial hub in the world and having the deftness to continuously innovate and adapt, but there is no room for complacency. We cannot and will not rest on our laurels. The success of financial services has helped elevate the UK to the status of a post-industrial economy. My hon. Friend the Member for Chelmsford made reference to the industrial strategy, which was launched in November 2017 to prepare the whole UK economy for the future. We are taking action across a range of sectors. We published an investment management strategy. I look forward to responding to the recommendations of the green finance taskforce, which reported in March. We are poised to continue to be leaders in innovating in these sectors, to capture the value of innovation, capitalise on all opportunities and speed prosperity to all regions of the United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"a461.0\/8\">Close alignment between our financial sector and other parts of the economy is therefore crucial to the success of our industrial strategy. Financial services is a high-growth, high-tech driver of the UK economy and we are working to ensure that, in the face of rapid change, the UK remains the No. 1 place in the world to conduct financial services business. We are fully committed to that mandate, as demonstrated in the announcement of our FinTech sector strategy last month, which is intentionally aligned with and complementary to our industrial strategy.<\/p><p pid=\"a461.0\/9\">I want to run through current Government thinking on the regulation of financial services, which is key to how the sector will thrive in a post-Brexit Britain. I also want to reassure hon. Members that the changes required to the financial services regulatory framework following our exit from the EU are an integral part of the Treasury&#8217;s exit planning. The Government are listening to the views of industry&#8212;the International Regulatory Strategy Group was mentioned&#8212;and of course to those across Parliament. I look forward to further work with my Treasury colleagues on financial services regulation as we prepare for our departure from the European Union.<\/p><p pid=\"a461.0\/10\">Following the financial crisis 10 years ago, the Government introduced necessary changes to seek to restore public trust in financial services. I recognise that that has been a long and difficult process, but we continue to attract international commendation for the robustness of our regulatory and prudential systems. In the last round of the Financial Sector Assessment Program, the International Monetary Fund found that the UK was fully compliant on the 19 Basel core principles for effective banking supervision. Only France and Switzerland are able to match that. A decade on from the crisis, we should never lose sight of the principal purpose of the regulatory and supervisory regimes: to ensure financial stability and protect taxpayers from having to step in to deal with failure. The key lesson from the financial crisis has been cross-border co-operation, not a global race to the bottom or destabilising protectionism.<\/p><p pid=\"a461.0\/11\">That thinking extends to our approach to Brexit. It is crucial that our exit from the EU is smooth and orderly. As my hon. Friend the Member for Chelmsford said, we made a big step forward in agreeing the legal text on an implementation period, which will keep market access on existing terms for firms and consumers. In December, the Government said that, if necessary, we will legislate to ensure that the contractual obligations she mentioned continue to be met, which will benefit millions of UK consumers who have insurance policies from EU firms. It is in the interests of the EU to take similar measures for UK firms serving EU customers, and we continue to encourage co-operation between regulators. We are working on that active dialogue all the time.<\/p><p pid=\"a461.0\/12\">It defies logic that a loose relationship with the UK would give the EU the depth of co-operation necessary for a market as close as the UK, and vice versa. That means&#8212;I want to be crystal clear&#8212;that we do not intend to rip up the rulebook after exit. When I hear echoes that there should be a bonfire of financial services regulation post-exit, or a race to the bottom, nothing could be further from the truth.<\/p><p pid=\"a461.0\/13\">On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-03-07\">7 March<\/phrase>, the Chancellor set out a vision for our future relationship in financial services in what has been called his HSBC speech. The hon. Member for Glasgow Central asked about that vision. It was a thorough  analysis of the challenge and the opportunity and the need to prioritise financial stability, and argued for a deal that preserves the mutual benefits of the sector. Neither the UK or EU should be under any illusion about the significant additional costs that would be borne by Europe&#8217;s businesses and consumers if this highly efficient market were to fragment. It is a complex ecosystem that serves the UK and the EU. Oliver Wyman calculates that the wholesale banking industry would need to find $30 billion to $50 billion of extra capital if new regulatory barriers forced fragmentation of firms&#8217; balance sheets.<\/p><p pid=\"a461.0\/14\">To echo the Chancellor, the major winners from fragmentation would not&#8212;despite what President Macron suggests&#8212;be Paris or Frankfurt, Dublin or Luxembourg, but New York, Singapore or Hong Kong. That point was made by the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde.<\/p>",

I begin by thanking most sincerely all those who contributed to the report: our specialist advisers, Dr Anita Charlesworth, director of  research in economics at the Health Foundation, and Emma Norris, programme director at the Institute for Government; our committee staff, the clerk Patrick Milner, the policy analysts Emily Greenwood and Beth Hooper, and the committee assistants Thomas Cheminais and Vivienne Roach; and, of course, all the committee members, with their collective and individual wisdom and experience&#8212;a most agreeable and amiable group that it was my pleasure to work with. I think sometimes small lies are permitted.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/2\">Any difficulties that we had in our discussions were smoothed over with spiritual guidance from our resident Prelate, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Carlisle. We were sorry to miss the noble Lord, Lord Mawhinney, from most of our inquiry because of his illness, and I wish him well. The noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, is not happy that he will not be here today, but he is recovering from his illness. I wish him well and hope that he is back here soon. In the context of the debate, I am pleased to see the noble Lord, Lord Lansley, in his place. I wish him, too, a full recovery from his illness. We might have another time to discuss his reforms.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/3\">Now to the report. The inquiry started in July 2016 and lasted until December 2016&#8212;too short for us to cover all the issues in health and social care. Hence our call for evidence was targeted at the key challenges of the long-term sustainability of health and social care. We received more than 193 written submissions, amounting to 500,000 words. We took oral evidence from more than 100 key witnesses. We also received correspondence from more than 3,000 members of the public and hundreds of emails with personal experiences and heartfelt stories. I thank them all for writing to us. We also learned lessons as to how we might be able to engage with the public in future.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/4\">We published our report, which was 100 pages long plus annexes, with 34 key non-political recommendations, on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-04-05\">5 April<\/phrase> 2017. The report was well received, with favourable comments from a wide spectrum of media&#8212;radio, local and national television and later professional journals and blogs&#8212;and equally positive comments from think tanks. The Institute for Government has recently expressed an interest in taking forward one of our key recommendations, and is exploring the possibilities related to establishing an independent body&#8212;possibly an OBR-style body&#8212;for health and social care.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/5\">I also thank the chair of the House of Commons Health Select Committee, Dr Sarah Wollaston, who took evidence from me and four other committee members in a full session lasting over three hours, and also&#8212;in different sessions&#8212;questioned the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister on aspects of our report. All this gave the committee the feeling that we had done a reasonable job on the task given to us.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/6\">The long-awaited government response came in late February 2018. It is 39 pages long, and detailed and informative on current initiatives and developments, but a little short on addressing the report&#8217;s key recommendations. That is possibly because our important recommendations require a policy rethink and the Government need more time to consider them fully. Their subsequent response will&#8212;hopefully&#8212;be in actions. I am naturally kind and optimistic and I look forward to that.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/7\">This is an important year for the NHS. On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-07-05\">5 July<\/phrase> 2018 it will be 70 years since its inception. Lots of celebrations are planned: services in Westminster Abbey and York Minster, features at the Chelsea flower show, celebrations at Wimbledon and much more. I have no doubt that many reviews will be carried out and published by various think tanks around the 70th birthday. As we rightly celebrate, however, concerns continue to be raised about the long-term sustainability of the NHS: its ability to deliver quality care in the face of rising costs, the ageing population and increasing comorbidities, and its ability to cope with developments in expensive medicines and technology, in particular in diagnostic and other areas, with its crumbling infrastructure. For the first time, 52% of the population think that the NHS is the biggest issue facing Britain today. Public confidence in the NHS, in social care and in primary care, is falling.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/8\">The weaknesses in the delivery structures of health and social care are made worse by winter pressures on services, as evidenced by daily headlines of bed blocking, queues at A&amp;E, patients on trolleys in hospital corridors, cancellation of elective surgeries for months, and commissioning groups constantly rationing care.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/9\">Despite all this, the service, through its dedicated and hard-working workforce, tries to cope and to minimise hardship, and of course there are good initiatives and developments in the pipeline that will improve the service. What is needed, however, is a long-term fix.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/10\">A real celebration would be a political consensus, possibly delivered through an all-party commission&#8212;which has been asked for by many people, including politicians, political commentators and the media. Even our own Lord Speaker, in an article he wrote more than two years ago, asked for a commission to be established. The Government should initiate such a consensus. The Prime Minister&#8217;s legacy would then be the delivery not just of Brexit but, importantly, sustainable health and social care.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/11\">I now come to the report itself. It has seven chapters, ending with proposals for building a lasting political consensus. The inquiry found a lack of long-term planning. We were unkind enough to suggest a culture of short-termism. Everyone, it seems, is so absorbed in struggling with day-to-day troubles and with the uncertainty of year-on-year funding settlements that a culture of &#8220;here and now&#8221; has developed. Our comments, which were not designed to cause upset or to name and shame, should be taken as constructive.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/12\">We found that the five-year forward view of the chief executive of NHS England, Simon Stevens, was the only example of strategic planning for the longer term. By the way, if I might digress, in Simon Stevens we have somebody who has, in my view, been given the freedom and authority to be the change needed to build a healthcare system based on outcomes. I am glad that the Secretary of State asked in a recent statement for a five-year or even a 10-year forward financial settlement for the health service. This was one of our key recommendations.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/13\">The evidence we received pointed strongly to the fact that, at the heart of securing a long-term future for health is the need for radical service transformation: a change that involves a model of primary care moving  away from the small business model to one of bigger group practices, properly resourced and able to deliver on diagnostics. GPs should have the power and authority to shape the delivery of primary and community care, linking with and, at times, being part of secondary care and even involved in hospital care&#8212;a model away from the overburdened, bureaucracy-driven current model that we heard about. The model should be attractive for young doctors to flourish in, which would make recruitment to primary care&#8212;as it was before&#8212;a problem of the past. Equally, it should be a transformation that involves reshaping secondary care, with specialist services consolidated.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/14\">Reform is also needed to reduce the bureaucracy and regulatory burdens that play little part in delivering better health outcomes. The current statutory framework frustrates this agenda, but change is needed. With the current focus on integrated, place-based commissioning, the need for two separate bodies, NHS England and NHS Improvement, has to be questioned.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/15\">Appropriate funding of the NHS remains the key issue. Years of cuts have led to the decline of services, demoralised the workforce and caused a crumbling infrastructure that in some cases needs the services of a bulldozer. No doubt we will hear of the extra funds given in the last Budget, and prior to that, but significant deficits in the majority of trusts continue. A settled funding plan, with a year-on-year increase linked to the rise in GDP, is our modest recommendation. A possible increase in funding to mark 70 years of the NHS was suggested by the Prime Minister, who mentioned it in her evidence to the House of Commons Liaison Committee. If true, this has to be welcomed: how much and what it will be used for will be the important question. We received clear evidence for maintaining a service free at the point of need.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/16\">The lack of any long-term planning for the workforce is the biggest internal threat to the sustainability of the NHS and adult social care. Much of the workforce planning is fragmented. Too much training of our clinical workforce is done through the old model, lacking flexibility and with poor opportunities to update skills. Lack of leadership leads all and sundry to believe that they are in charge of workforce planning and training. It is rather like a bus with too many conductors but no driver. We recommended a strong, independent, well-resourced role for Health Education England to plan for the long term and be accountable. Clear leadership is needed. I gather that our perceived criticism has been taken to heart and that change is on its way. All I can say is: good, and congratulations&#8212;may the force be with you.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/17\">Prevention of ill health was a key component of Simon Stevens&#8217;s five-year forward view, but it has received little attention. There seems to be apathy, centrally driven, around planning for a co-ordinated prevention strategy. A service centred on illness is not sustainable. Much of cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer&#8212;40% of cancers&#8212;diabetes, mental health, lung diseases and possibly even dementia has a preventative aspect. We need to learn from models in other countries. I am sure that if the noble Lord, Lord McColl of Dulwich, had been here, he would have had much to say about our obesity epidemic. He has another arrangement in Hong Kong so cannot be here today.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/18\">The report also identifies the NHS as a poor adopter of innovations, unable to drive increased productivity, cut waste, use data effectively, reduce variations in care and, above all, reduce variations in outcomes related to inequality and deprivation. The difference in the life expectancy of people in Hackney and the West End of London is the same as that between those in England and Guatemala&#8212;about eight years.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/19\">Let me now come briefly to social care. Despite extra funding, pressures on social care and the NHS continue. Analysis conducted by the Health Foundation, the Nuffield Trust and the King&#8217;s Fund suggests a shortfall of &#163;3.5 billion in social care by 2020. Our report makes a plea for a long-term settlement for social care. As the Government develop their Green Paper on social care for older people, I hope that they will look at all alternatives, apart from the cap, including models of funding that operate in Japan and Germany through a system of hypothecated social insurance, with a defined contribution based on age and income, paid for by all throughout life, with a small top-up contribution made by those who need it&#8212;a system that reinforces the principles of social justice, equality and social solidarity to which everyone contributes. Those principles are the bedrock of our much-loved NHS. This is not an ideological suggestion; it is a suggestion based on the one-nation principle.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/20\">Let me now turn to accountability. There is a clear need for parliamentary accountability based on transparent information. To this end, following much discussion and an in-depth audit of 16 independent and semi-independent bodies carried out by Emma Norris, programme director at the Institute for Government, we tested an idea with many witnesses and received broad support. We made three recommendations to establish an office for health and care sustainability with a clear and defined remit. The Government responded to this recommendation in 80 words and referred to two websites. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Carlisle may well take this further. It is an important recommendation, deserving greater debate and attention, and I hope we will have the opportunity for that at some time.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/21\">We are often told that our NHS is the best in the world. Why? Because the Commonwealth Fund, which is based in Massachusetts, places our NHS at number one. The fact is that the fund has its own agenda and uses a methodology to back it. Inconveniently, it also puts the NHS at number 10 for outcomes&#8212;and outcomes are what matter to patients. That is what they look for. On the other hand, the Legatum Institute, a London-based think tank, places the NHS 20th, Bloomberg places it 21st and the WHO places it 16th in the world. We need a service based on outcomes. Our outcomes in cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancers and lung diseases are not good compared with those of other, richer countries. A service that is considered accessible and low cost but is poor on outcomes is like having a coffee machine that is cheaper to buy but cannot make coffee.<\/p><p pid=\"a1660.9\/22\">Time has come for a political consensus to make our much-loved NHS a service that delivers the best care for all, is cost-effective and becomes the model of the best care in the world. We have been there before and we can be again. It is doable, as long as the NHS  does not continue to be a political football for those who hope to win votes. I hope that this debate is the start of that political consensus. I beg to move.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1645.1\/1\">My Lords, I look at this amendment and note that it is about the continuity and safety of transport. I have fewer fears than my colleagues about the matter of safety, because the industries concerned were moving towards standardisation decades before the EU was formed. The area where I am very alarmed is the whole issue of traffic rights. I spent 22 years in aviation, 20 of them working for BOAC and British Airways and, towards the end, as the number 2 in British Airways&#8217; marketing department. That was the world pre-open skies and pre-EU, and it was horrific. Literally every city pair had a different agreement about it. All of them had to be agreed. Those were the days when Hong Kong was a colony, which was a golden card in negotiations. The idea of having to start from scratch and do all 134 city-pair negotiations is very difficult to understand.<\/p><p pid=\"b1645.1\/2\">Similarly, we have the same problem on the roads. The professionals who talk about the port of Dover say that the slightest delays through the port will cause chaos to the point where we have to worry about fresh  food getting to our plates. The noble Baroness, Lady Sugg, laid on for interested Peers a meeting with the Secretary of State. He gave a very smooth presentation, which I would pr&#233;cis as, &#8220;It&#8217;ll be alright on the night&#8221;. He justified this by saying that it would be in both parties&#8217; economic interest to conclude sensible and rational agreements. I think he is a bit heroically naive; I have spent most of my professional career in negotiations, and I have always found rationality to come a rather poor third place after emotion and power. The reality of these negotiations is that they will be conducted by politicians and bureaucrats.<\/p><p pid=\"b1645.1\/3\">The great thing about the EU is that it is refreshingly transparent. Perhaps more people should read what it produces more frequently. From time to time, in this negotiation, it produces guidelines. The first sets of guidelines were more or less delivered as agreed by the Council, and the latest set was agreed on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-03-23\">23 March<\/phrase>. A six-page document was published with those guidelines adopted by the European Council at the meeting on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-03-23\">23 March<\/phrase>; one paragraph says that,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1645.1\/4\">&#8220;the European Council has to take into account the repeatedly stated positions of the UK, which limit the depth of such a future partnership. Being outside the Customs Union and the Single Market will inevitably lead to frictions in trade. Divergence in external tariffs and internal rules as well as absence of common institutions and a shared legal system, necessitates checks and controls to uphold the integrity of the EU Single Market as well as of the UK market. This unfortunately will have negative economic consequences, in particular in the United Kingdom&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b1645.1\/5\">They are very clear about just how firm their position is. One has to recognise that they are representing the EU 27. They are there to meet their demands, and every member has a veto on this agreement. We have left the club: they are not looking after us anymore; that is not their responsibility.<\/p><p pid=\"b1645.1\/6\">So where do we stand? We have an emotional battle to fight&#8212;emotional or political, call it what you like&#8212;and we also have a power battle to fight. Do we have any cards? One card that we have with the EU is money, but we more or less agreed that anyway, so that one goes away. The other thing that we used to fight on over the decades after World War II when establishing air rights was reciprocity. That means, &#8220;You can&#8217;t come to our airfield unless we can come to yours&#8221;. The problem with that is that we are a bit of everybody else&#8217;s aviation activity. For us, the world is where we need to be and the world, at the moment, is determined and available through the European Union. If we cannot have access to the world, then our industry will be seriously damaged.<\/p><p pid=\"b1645.1\/7\">I hope that my pessimism is not justified, but I think that getting a better deal than the status quo is, sadly, highly unlikely. I hope that the Minister will be able to assure us that the energy is there to try to achieve the status quo, because otherwise it will damage us and it will damage our EU friends, but it will damage them a great deal less than it will damage us.<\/p>",

Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Louise Haigh\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25357\">the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Louise Haigh)<\/phrase> for securing this important debate and for her excellent and well-informed speech. It is of great interest&#8212;not only to me, but to the public, who I am sure will be listening closely to the Minister&#8217;s response today. I also want to thank the hon. Members for South West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) and for Witney (Robert Courts), my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Chris Ruane\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10518\">the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane)<\/phrase> and the Scottish National party spokesperson, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Philippa Whitford\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25318\">the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Dr Whitford)<\/phrase>, for their thoughtful and passionate speeches, even though I do not necessarily agree with all the things that were said.<\/p><p pid=\"a187.0\/2\">As we heard, life expectancy has always gradually increased. Between 1920 and 2010, it increased from 55 to 78 years for men and from 59 to 82 years for women. However, the improvement began to stall in 2011 when the coalition Government came in. That cannot be just a coincidence. Since then, for the first time in over a century, the health of people in England and Wales has stopped improving, and has flat-lined ever since.<\/p><p pid=\"a187.0\/3\">I must emphasise that researchers do not believe that we have reached peak life expectancy. The Nordic countries, Japan and Hong Kong all have life expectancies greater than ours and they continue to increase, so why is life expectancy flat-lining in the UK? Why is Britain being left behind and fast becoming the sick man of Europe? I know that the hon. Member for South West Bedfordshire said that that was not the case, but academic research by Danny Dorling, published in November 2017, which I have here, said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a187.0\/4\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Life expectancy for women in the UK is now lower than in Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. Often it is much lower. Men&#8230;do little better.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a187.0\/5\">I think the hon. Gentleman needs to check his facts.<\/p><p pid=\"a187.0\/6\">The life expectancy gap between the richest and poorest in this country is nothing less than shameful. According to the Institute of Health Equity, the longest life expectancy in the country is, not surprisingly, in the richest borough: Kensington and Chelsea. Men in Kensington and Chelsea can expect to live to 83 and women to 86. Unsurprisingly, you will find the lowest life expectancy in my part of it: the north and Scotland. In Glasgow, life expectancy for men is 73 and in West Dunbartonshire it is 79 for women&#8212;10 years of difference for men and seven years for women. The difference within the richest borough, Kensington and Chelsea, is even more stark. Despite living in the richest borough in the country, the most disadvantaged within it can expect to live 14 years less than their most advantaged counterparts. Does the Minister agree that this is completely unacceptable?<\/p><p pid=\"a187.0\/7\">The north-south divide remains as relevant as ever when we look at healthy life expectancy&#8212;the years that people can expect to live a healthy life. In the south-east, the healthy life expectancy is 65.9 years for men and 66.6 years for women. However, people can expect a shorter healthy life expectancy in the north-east, where men have a healthy life expectancy of 59.7 years and women 59.8 years. That is significantly lower than the England average. Looking after those people during that unhealthy part of life means a huge cost to the NHS. It also means that the inequality gap in healthy life expectancy at birth between the south-east and the north-east is 6.2 years for men and 6.8 years for women.<\/p><p pid=\"a187.0\/8\">What will the Minister do to address the life expectancy and healthy life expectancy gap between the rich and poor, and the north and south? It is simply unacceptable that the least advantaged in our society bear the brunt of this Government&#8217;s policies&#8212;wherever they live. Austerity is not a choice. It is a political ideology, which harms the poorest and the most vulnerable in our communities.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1177.1\/1\">I am delighted to second the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, and I will seek to do so as briefly as he did, partly because he was so comprehensive in the arguments for a customs union and partly because we chewed over many of these issues in Committee and we plainly should not deal with them again. So I will not go into the issue of Northern Ireland&#8217;s border with the Republic of Ireland, because I spoke twice on that in Committee.<\/p><p pid=\"b1177.1\/2\">I assume straightaway, because I have a regard for his intelligence, that the Minister responding to this debate is not going to suggest that the referendum result or the Conservative manifesto disqualifies us from proceeding in the direction suggested by the noble Lord. If I am wrong about that, I would be delighted to come back to it later. But there is one point made in the manifesto that I will dwell on for a moment&#8212;and, as clergymen occasionally say at the end of sermons, share with you all&#8212;because it allows me to bridge to the main argument we have today, which is about trade and trade opportunities for this country.<\/p><p pid=\"b1177.1\/3\">I confess to the House straightaway that I used to make my living helping to write manifestos, and so I have a certain regard for these things. The manifesto said at the beginning:<\/p><p pid=\"b1177.1\/4\">&#8220;People are rightly sceptical of politicians who claim to have easy answers to deeply complex problems&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b1177.1\/5\">So I ask the House to turn its attention to what we have been promised on trade.<\/p><p pid=\"b1177.1\/6\">We are told by the Secretary of State for International Trade that a free trade agreement with the EU will be one of the &#8220;easiest in human history&#8221;. He also told us that, by the end of March 2019, the Government will have put in place or drafted or agreed up to 40 trade agreements with other countries. That is the backdrop. It seems to me that those propositions invite a little scepticism, and in a moment or two I will suggest to the House why that is the case.<\/p><p pid=\"b1177.1\/7\">I have a degree of expertise in this area for which I do not seek to make extravagant claims&#8212;I do not know as much about trade as the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, does, and I know that expertise is a dangerous thing in the present climate. But I did, either on my  own or with others, negotiate free trade agreements between the European Union and Mexico, Chile and most of the countries of the Mashreq and Maghreb region. We were part of the negotiation team for China&#8217;s accession to the WTO. We failed with Russia&#8212;for all sorts of reasons which the House will not be surprised about&#8212;and we made only limited progress with Mercosur, the San Jos&#233; dialogue and the Andean pact countries. So I know how difficult these things are, and some of the problems that will be faced in addressing the agenda mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Kerr.<\/p><p pid=\"b1177.1\/8\">The first thing we have to do is secure our market in the European Union&#8212;50% of our trade. We then have to think about the 12% of trade with countries with which the European Union has concluded agreements already and the 8% with which it is negotiating trade agreements already. That adds up to about 70%. Of the remaining 30%, about half is with the United States, a quarter with China and Hong Kong, and the rest with everyone else.<\/p><p pid=\"b1177.1\/9\">How are we going to manage with the countries with which the European Union has negotiated deals already? I spent a particularly dreary afternoon on Maundy Thursday looking through the European Union-South Korea trade deal. It was dreary not because it is not a good deal&#8212;indeed, it is such a good deal that the Foreign Secretary not long ago boasted about the great increase in British trade with South Korea&#8212;but because it is even longer than a long day&#8217;s journey into night. It runs to 1,400 pages, 900 of which just list tariffs. The idea that you can simply Snopake the words &#8220;European Union&#8221; and insert &#8220;United Kingdom&#8221; and grandfather that trade agreement in nanoseconds&#8212;even nanoyears&#8212;is absurd.<\/p><p pid=\"b1177.1\/10\">First of all, the South Koreans know that we are the demandeur. They will know that we have a trade surplus with South Korea at the moment, which might make them a little resistant to being as helpful as they were with the European Union, which is, anyway, a much bigger market than the United Kingdom&#8212;500 million to about 65 million. There are technical issues as well that will be particularly demanding. I will not try to explain to the House&#8212;because I have only a vague notion of what it means&#8212;the problem with trigger volumes preventing surges of agricultural imports to a country. But that issue is one that will involve not just negotiations with South Korea but tripartite negotiations between us and the European Union as well as the South Koreans.<\/p><p pid=\"b1177.1\/11\">Even more important are rules of origin&#8212;something that used to be well understood by the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. Not long before the Foreign Secretary made a speech saying that there was no reason why we should not, after leaving the European Union, stay in the single market, the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union pointed out that, on balance, he was in favour of staying in the customs union because, even though you would not then be able to do independent trade deals on your own, the issue of rules of origin was so important that we had to stay within the union so that that did not present problems for us.<\/p><p pid=\"b1177.1\/12\">Rules of origin is a problem that comes up straightaway when you look at the South Korea deal. Under rules of origin, each party is able to do without tariffs provided that up to 55% of what it is exporting is made in its own back yard. That is fine within the European Union, but the car industry in this country makes only 41% of the cars that we export in Britain. So straightaway, cars&#8212;and you can go down the list of tariffs&#8212;would not be able to go tariff free into the South Korean market.<\/p><p pid=\"b1177.1\/13\">The South Korean trade deal provides 99% tariff-free access after five years. It is a terrific piece of trade diplomacy. Incidentally, it provides that access after five years, but the trade deal that the South Koreans did with Australia does not come into full working order, even on a more limited range of goods, for 20 years&#8212;so it was a very good piece of negotiation by the European Union. The idea that we can just do that and all the other trade deals overnight, over a month or over a year, without any problems is for the birds. It belongs to the category denounced in the manifesto.<\/p><p pid=\"b1177.1\/14\">After we have dealt with the issue of the 12%, or maybe 20% by then, of the market that is covered by existing or future trade deals&#8212;&#8220;future&#8221; before we leave the European Union&#8212;between the European Union and other countries, we then deal with the three other categories of country. The first is China. China, admittedly, has done a trade deal with Switzerland and also with Iceland. Switzerland has done 38 trade deals with other countries, as opposed to more than 50 between the European Union and other countries. The deal between Switzerland and China is a very good example of how difficult it is to get into bed with an elephant. The Swiss have agreed hardly anything with the Chinese about services and nothing about cars, but they have accepted that China will have, for a number of goods, tariff-free access to Switzerland straightaway. In return, Switzerland gets tariff-free access to China after 15 years. So sleeping with elephants is a bit of a problem. I imagine that we would be looking to open up prospects for services&#8212;which, as the noble Lord said, is not an issue particularly involved here&#8212;but, apart from that, I am not quite sure what we would be hoping to get out of any future deal with China.<\/p><p pid=\"b1177.1\/15\">What about Australia and the Commonwealth? As the noble Lord said, one of the basic axioms in trade policy is that you double the distance and halve the trade. The notion that the Australians will open up their market further for us without making demands in return is, again, nonsense. They will ask for us to make concessions in the field of agriculture, which may take some explaining to small and medium-sized farmers in this country.<\/p><p pid=\"b1177.1\/16\">What about India? I noticed the other day that the European Union suggested that it might be easier to do a deal with India when we were no longer members of the European Union. In fact, we were always the back-markers when it came to negotiations with India. Why? Because we were concerned about opening up access to our services in India. Why? Because the Indians wanted in return for anything we were prepared to ask for greater scope for visas for Indians coming to this country, and we were not prepared to allow that.<\/p><p pid=\"b1177.1\/17\">Finally, the United States represents 15% of our market, but we expect Richard Cobden&#8217;s legatee, President Trump, to open up the American market to the United Kingdom&#8217;s exports. Are we serious? We would be pressing for opening up procurement with the United States, and the United States would be pressing for opening up procurement with us in the National Health Service. I am not going through chickens again because we had chickens up to our eyebrows in Committee, but I remember a wonderful speech given by my noble friend Lord Deben about chickens. I wish I could remember every word of it, but it was a pretty compelling argument on the difficulties of doing a food deal with the United States. President Trump will not be there for ever&#8212;but, in my experience, the Americans were not pushovers when it came to doing trade deals.<\/p><p pid=\"b1177.1\/18\">I have two last points. Is our ability to do trade deals or to export overseas held up by the fact that we are members of the European Union? When I last looked, Germany was a member of the European Union. Germany exports two and a half times as much to China as we do and exports more to India than we do. So the reason we do not do better in export markets must lie somewhere else. I do not agree with the point made by the Secretary of State for International Trade. I do not think that it is because British businessmen and exporters are&#8212;what was his expression?&#8212;fat and lazy. That is not why we do not do better. The truth is that between only 10% and 15% of companies in the country actually do serious exporting. They are mostly medium-sized or large companies&#8212;and guess what they want? They want the best access possible to the closest market. And where is that?<\/p><p pid=\"b1177.1\/19\">So I do not think that blethering on about global Britain, or pretending that we have not been global Britain for years, or repeating &#8220;The Road to Mandalay&#8221; whenever one is travelling, is going to make a spectacular difference to our trading opportunities. I think very strongly that we will not do any better than we are doing within the customs union, given that we start from a position in which we export to the European Union three and a half times as much as we do to the United States, five times as much as we do to the Commonwealth and six times as much as we do to all the BRICs combined.<\/p><p pid=\"b1177.1\/20\">So I support the amendment with some enthusiasm and I repeat what my noble friend Lord Hailsham said in Committee: namely, that there are times in one&#8217;s political career when what is alleged to be party loyalty comes way behind trying to stand up for the national interest. I intend to do that on this amendment and elsewhere on Report, and in doing that I think I will be repeating what I would have been able to say with the full support of my party for most of the time I have been a member of it.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1019.2\/1\">Before the House adjourns for the Easter recess, there are a number of points I wish to raise very quickly.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/2\">I am delighted that we are leaving the European Union. Our Prime Minister has had a great deal to put with in the past year. She has had to hold the hand of the American President and she is continually kissed on either cheek by European bureaucrats, yet she has got us to a wonderful point as we leave the European Union. I absolutely agree that Brexit means Brexit and we are going to make a success of it.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/3\">It is crazy that Southend is not a city. We should be declared a city. As part of the bonus as we leave the European Union, we are going to have a trade fair. We are going to invite countries from all over the world to trade their goods and services with Southend.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/4\">I am very worried about the number of Asian elephants. The number has fallen dramatically from 1 million to 42,000. The elephant tourism industry is not helping the situation.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/5\">Having participated in the &#8220;Save Live Music&#8221; rally outside Parliament, I backed the Planning (Agent of Change) Bill, promoted by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"John Spellar\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10558\">the right hon. Member for Warley (John Spellar)<\/phrase>. We should, however, also tackle the excessive pricing of music tickets and those in the entertainment industry more broadly. Being disappointed when attempting to purchase tickets online is one thing, but this disappointment is further compounded when tickets appear, often within seconds of selling out, on websites for an extortionately inflated price. That has got to stop.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/6\">I have previously raised the matter of diesel particulate filters. There is a loophole in the law and it needs to be addressed.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/7\">I was delighted to welcome the Secretary of State for Health to our first-class hospital in Southend earlier in the year. I congratulate all the women and men who work there. I await the outcome of the sustainability and transformation partnership consultation, which finished on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-03-23\">23 March<\/phrase>.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/8\">A wonderful local constituent, Carla Cressy, has highlighted the plight of women with endometriosis. I have now become a trustee of her charity and will work with her to heighten awareness of that debilitating illness.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/9\">I have raised the issue of food labelling. I support Diabetes UK and Compassion in World Farming in calling for better labelling.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/10\">Hepatitis C is an illness that can be cured. It is a deadly virus, and I hope the House will unite to make sure that everyone is cured of it.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/11\">On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-03-15\">15 March<\/phrase>, I sent a letter on funeral poverty, which was signed by 22 other Members of Parliament, to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. I asked her to look again at the &#163;700 cap currently imposed on funeral expenses within the social fund funeral payment. The cap has been in place for 15 years. It needs to be changed.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/12\">Last month, I had the privilege of visiting a refugee camp in Malatya in Turkey, where some 10,000 Syrian refugees are living. What we saw was heartbreaking, but the camp is extremely well run. It is absolutely incredible how it was built within such a short space of time.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/13\">With a constituent, I had a meeting with the Fisheries Minister. I see a clear way forward for fishermen in Southend.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/14\">I took part in a debate about live exports. Transporting live animals for slaughter is totally unsatisfactory.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/15\">I was very disappointed that my 10-minute rule Bill was objected to on the Friday before last. I cannot understand why. It is a very good Bill that would end fuel poverty.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/16\">There is a lot of controversy about the Cayman Islands, but I think they are being badly treated at the moment. I have made overtures to the Secretary of State for International Trade for them to be included in the GREAT festival, which the UK is hosting in Hong Kong this month.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/17\">The Music Man project in my constituency is now in the Guinness book of records for tinging the most triangles. We look forward to an event at the Royal Albert Hall.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/18\">Later this year, I am celebrating 35 years in Parliament&#8212;well, I say that I am celebrating&#8212;and it is also the 50th anniversary of Leigh Orpheus male voice choir, which will be presiding at the event.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/19\">Rossi&#8217;s ice cream is the best in the world. We need to sell it in the House.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/20\">I visited the ambulance centre in Chelmsford last month, and I pay a full tribute to all the women and men who work under increasing pressures.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/21\">Thanks to the spring clean initiative of my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Victoria Prentis\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25420\">the Member for Banbury (Victoria Prentis)<\/phrase>, we had a spring clean in Southend.<\/p><p pid=\"b1019.2\/22\">I close, Mr Speaker, by wishing you, all your deputies, all colleagues and all the people who work here a very happy Easter.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a253.1\/1\">I beg to move,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a253.1\/2\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">That this House has considered e-petition 200299 relating to GCSE English literature exams.<\/p><p pid=\"a253.1\/3\">It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Sharma.<\/p><p pid=\"a253.1\/4\">The more perceptive among us will remember that we have been here before. We debated this issue just before the general election. I think it was on the last full day of business. Understandably, the debate was rather rushed and the Petitions Committee did not have time to do any public engagement on the matter.<\/p><p pid=\"a253.1\/5\">When we received a new petition in this Parliament, we therefore decided to schedule it for debate and to conduct some public engagement. We had a huge response, showing that people believe that how we examine and test pupils&#8217; knowledge is not just a technical matter; it says much about the things we think are important&#8212;the skills and knowledge that we value. People are also increasingly worried about the mental health of our young people. I will come to that later in my remarks.<\/p><p pid=\"a253.1\/6\">There are many exam systems throughout the world, and they do not necessarily relate to the success or failure of the education system. On the one hand, there are systems such as those used in Singapore and Hong Kong, where there is rigorous and frequent testing. Those are very good at some things&#8212;there is no doubt about that. However, when I was in Singapore some years ago, people asked us how to teach creativity, because they thought they had ironed that out of their system. On the other hand, in Finland nobody sits an exam until they are 16 and it is viewed as one of the best education systems in the world&#8212;on some measures, the best. I do not say that because I think Ministers can import exam systems from elsewhere. In fact, over the years we have had far too much of Ministers going abroad and trying to bring in a system from a completely different cultural background. I am simply saying that how we examine is a choice&#8212;one choice among many.<\/p><p pid=\"a253.1\/7\">It is clear from the feedback that both parents and teachers are worried about the impact of frequent testing and the type of testing we have on young people&#8217;s mental health. Way back in 2016, what was then the Association of Teachers and Lecturers did a survey of its members. Over half of the respondents said that they knew one student who had tried to self-harm. One of the teachers said that there had been<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a253.1\/8\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;a huge increase in physical symptoms of stress and incidents of self-harm.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a253.1\/9\">On the other hand, the chief inspector of schools has told The Times Educational Supplement that it is a &#8220;myth&#8221; that children in England are over-tested. It is difficult to know who to believe: the teachers who are on the ground every day or a chief inspector with no  teaching qualifications at all, whose nomination was rejected by the Select Committee on Education. I will leave people to make their choice.<\/p><p pid=\"a253.1\/10\">It is true that there is a lot of mental ill health among young people today. The charity YoungMinds published figures showing that one in four children and young adults displays symptoms of mental ill health, and that one in 10 children and one in five young adults has a diagnosable mental health disorder.<\/p><p pid=\"a253.1\/11\">When we did our public engagement on this subject, we found that mental health was an issue for many people. We carried out some public engagement with pupils from Christ the King Catholic High School in Preston, to whom we are very grateful. Our staff used those responses to design an online survey for students, teachers and parents. There were extra boxes for teachers to allow them to make comments. We had more than 16,300 responses. Of the students involved, 54% said that they thought about exams most of the time and 53% said that they were stressed most of the time because of their exams.<\/p><p pid=\"a253.1\/12\">Interestingly, that was not the prime reason for people wanting a change in the system. The main reason was that they felt exams tested memory rather than understanding &#8212;77% of students and 84% of teachers told us that. That gives people like me pause. I grew up in a system&#8212;like most people here, I suspect&#8212;where memory was important. We had to remember lots of things for exams. I was lucky: I did not find it particularly difficult. However, we need to ask not what was suitable for us, but what is suitable for the next generation. We need to ask ourselves: is it really necessary to have so much emphasis on memory in a society where information is available at the touch of a button? That question hardly ever gets asked in our system.<\/p><p pid=\"a253.1\/13\">We are often dependent&#8212;this has happened under both political parties&#8212;on the whims of whichever Secretary of State for Education happens to be in office at the time. We all remember <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Michael Gove\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11858\">the right hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)<\/phrase>, who decided that history should be &#8220;our island story&#8221;, ignoring the fact that that story is probably seen very differently in different parts of these islands and by different communities within them. He also took a sudden dislike to &#8220;Of Mice and Men&#8221; being on the curriculum. I do not know why&#8212;perhaps he was hit over the head with a Steinbeck novel when he was small and has been traumatised ever since.<\/p><p pid=\"a253.1\/14\">Because of that, we have seen frequent changes to our exam system. We had the English baccalaureate. We had tiering, which came and went. We had coursework and then the abolition of coursework. Then we had linear courses with exams at the end. It is no surprise, therefore, that the current Secretary of State has had to promise teachers that there will be no more changes, in an attempt to woo people into the profession. Frankly, I am surprised there are any teachers left. In all this noise, what does not get asked is: what do children need to learn and how do they need to learn it to fit them for the society that they are growing up in, rather than the one that we grew up in?<\/p>",

Gentleman will recognise that it is an independent, limited company, and it is important that the airport has the freedom to operate in the way it does. I am privileged to have the airport in my constituency, and I support it. In recent months, I have spoken to every managing director or chief executive involved to encourage and facilitate more flights to and from the airport, which is playing a part in contributing to its success. It has grown by 8%, but other airports across the country have grown by similar amounts because of the success of the UK economy.<\/p><p pid=\"b84.0\/2\">Welsh businesses will be at the forefront of the UK&#8217;s biggest ever trade festival, which kicks off in Hong Kong later this week. I am determined to ensure a close working relationship between the Welsh Government, my office and the Department for International Trade on foreign direct investment and our export ambitions. This is what businesses and communities want. Last week, the Department for International Trade and I held workshops in my office in Cardiff bay to better understand the barriers to exporting and the opportunities in which each Government can play a part in supporting those ambitious companies. I will host a similar event in north Wales next week.<\/p><p pid=\"b84.0\/3\">Certainty and continuity for businesses and communities are themes that we are extending to our approach to leaving the European Union. As Members will be aware, we have been working closely with the Welsh Government on the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill. Our initial approach was to retain all EU powers at UK level on a temporary basis to provide the certainty and security that the business community has called for, and we have committed to working with the devolved Administrations on how these powers will work and their onward transfer to the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Ireland Assemblies and Parliaments. However, having listened carefully to the concerns raised by the devolved Administrations, we have tabled an amendment to clause 11. The assumption is that the powers should be devolved, but with an order-making power to enable the UK Government, working with all the devolved Administrations, to legislate and to protect the UK common market. This will apply only in a limited number of areas and on a temporary basis. We have published analysis showing that we expect there to be only 24 areas of policy where we will need to discuss the possibility of legislative frameworks with the Welsh Government.<\/p>",

I am asking that we dispose of some prevalent misconceptions that our prosperity depends only on free trade agreements and being part of the customs union. It is actually relatively at the margins of the overall prosperity of our economy.<\/p><p pid=\"b1060.1\/2\">It is not necessary to be a very large country or part of a large trade bloc in order to be prosperous. Many very small states export a far higher proportion of their GDP across customs frontiers. For example, Switzerland&#8217;s exports are worth 66% of its GDP, and South Korea&#8217;s are worth 42%&#8212;far higher than the UK&#8217;s. Neither of these countries are in any kind of customs union, so they achieve this across traditional customs frontiers and their people have very high living standards. In fact, the EU is Switzerland&#8217;s main trading partner, and it is not even a member. Other small trading countries include Singapore, whose exports are actually far bigger than its GDP at 172% of GDP, and Hong Kong, whose exports are 187%, because it imports and exports such large volumes. But neither is part of a customs union or of any kind of single market; they just get on with it.<\/p><p pid=\"b1060.1\/3\">Control over our own laws offers far greater opportunities to develop our economy and export than the removal of customs checks when trading with other countries. The cost of customs processes is low and declining in comparison with other costs, such as anti-competitive regulation, behind-the-border barriers to trade and the reduction of tariff barriers. South Korea had substantial tariff barriers before the free trade agreement. We gain the opportunity to focus on those matters in trade negotiations, alongside investment in science and tech, educating our people, and ensuring flexible labour markets and a competitive tax regime. So much of the debate about leaving the EU lacks this perspective.<\/p><p pid=\"b1060.1\/4\">Even so, our future opportunities outside the EU are important. Even the European Commission expects 90% of global economic growth over the next 10 to 15 years to be generated outside Europe. The UK can flourish outside the EU, perhaps not with a Corbyn Government&#8212;that might be a bit of a problem&#8212;but certainly with a sensible Conservative Government. The only question is whether we all work hard to embrace these opportunities or continue trying to hide from them. Outside the EU, instead of pretending that that we can insulate ourselves from a rapidly changing world and from the effects of technological and societal change, with a failing model of regulation and centralised power&#8212;without all that&#8212;we will have the freedom and flexibility to respond, adapt, survive and prosper.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a921.6\/1\">I am pleased to speak in today&#8217;s general debate and talk a little about my views as we move towards phase 3, with a specific focus on the pensions, asset management and long-term savings industries, and our future trade in those services.<\/p><p pid=\"a921.6\/2\">Some 24% of people employed in the UK in the general insurance, life assurance and pensions sector work in Scotland&#8212;many in my constituency of East Renfrewshire, due to its access to the Glasgow financial district and the central belt as a whole, as well as the easy links down to London. These industries want a deal. Why? It is because no deal means that banks, insurance companies and fund managers could not provide services across the UK from the EU. Contracts, particularly for derivatives, which run over exit day could simply become unenforceable. Business liability insurance contracts often stretch decades ahead. Insurers could, as a result of a no deal Brexit, lose their licence to do insurance in the customer&#8217;s jurisdiction. Cross-border pension payments from the UK into the EU and vice versa simply could not be paid. It would defy common sense not to have a Brexit deal on financial services, given that the insurance and long-term savings sectors are so largely aligned and integrated, and our trade in services is vital to both parties.<\/p><p pid=\"a921.6\/3\">The UK&#8217;s asset management industry is the second largest in the world, managing nearly &#163;7 trillion-worth of assets, serving a global client base. Similarly, numerous investment funds used by pension providers are set up under Irish law or other EU-based jurisdictions. More than 150 UK managers are managing Irish funds right now, with more than 2,000 Irish-domiciled funds sold in the UK. That is more than &#8364;600 billion in fund assets managed by UK managers in Ireland on behalf of UK investors.<\/p><p pid=\"a921.6\/4\">The Association of British Insurers said last summer that a no deal Brexit is &#8220;unacceptable&#8221;. The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association was even more blunt when it said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a921.6\/5\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;WTO-only would cause major disruption. On no account could the pension fund industry support a regime based only on WTO rules. This would be likely to cause economic harm, create regulatory barriers and undermine essential pensions support services.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a921.6\/6\">That was why the industry welcomed the Mansion House speech. Clarification and honesty of the reality of what we are confronting allows people to move forward. If we leave the single market, passporting, which is a central pillar of the EU financial services regime, will end. Currently, there are 336,421 passports held by UK firms, and many firms hold multiple passports for multiple member states. The London Market Group recently published figures suggesting that the UK insurance sector takes in &#163;14 billion a year of business connected with the EU.<\/p><p pid=\"a921.6\/7\">That clarity was needed. Now we need to start talking about successor arrangements, with the transitional period being a time for firms to adapt to changes in the marketplace and regulatory structures. A primary risk for institutions that access EU markets from the UK is the post-Brexit loss of that access on a short-term or longer-term basis, because no equivalence decision has been issued in time. A lack of agreement on equivalence would also affect elements of financial services infrastructure, such as access to clearing houses or payment services, or the provision of custody services to certain clients.<\/p><p pid=\"a921.6\/8\">Bottoming out that equivalence process for the UK as a third country must be a priority. If we want to maintain and enhance this country&#8217;s position as the leading global financial centre, we will need to be regulated in accordance with the highest global standards. That is important for not just UK firms, but third country institutions, such as those based in the US or Hong Kong, which cannot make use of the passport system and must establish an authorised presence in an EU member state. For this reason, many third country institutions have chosen to base themselves in London through a UK subsidiary as their primary point of access to EU markets through passporting, and we want them to be able to continue to do so.<\/p><p pid=\"a921.6\/9\">We also need to agree successor arrangements for passporting of deposit taking and lending business under the capital requirements directive and the alternative investment fund managers directive. Third country recognition is absolutely vital, and the process for that needs to have been sorted out long before we have left. UCITS&#8212;Undertakings for the Collective Investment of Transferable Securities&#8212;are required to have their management companies established in an EU member state, and so a bespoke mutual recognition agreement that would allow UK entities to continue fulfil their UCITS roles will be necessary.<\/p><p pid=\"a921.6\/10\">Pension schemes are subject to EU legislation, both as institutional investors affected by EU financial market regulation, such as MiFID II&#8212;the markets in financial instruments directive&#8212;and the European market infrastructure regulation on the derivatives market, and, significantly, directly under the directive on institutions for occupational retirement provision, on workplace pension schemes. IORP II is due to be implemented in the UK by January 2019.<\/p><p pid=\"a921.6\/11\">During the negotiation of IORP II, the UK was successful in warding off the threat of an EU solvency regime for pensions, which could have resulted in a bill for British business of up to &#8364;650 billion. This remains on the agenda of EIOPA&#8212;the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority&#8212;which is the EU-level pensions regulatory body. Everyone knows I would like the maximum possible access to the single market, but it is essential that any future moves by the EU to propose a new EU solvency regime should not apply to defined benefit schemes in the UK. The absolute worst case scenario for UK pension schemes would be to find themselves more vulnerable outside the EU to the damaging regulation that was successfully blocked when the UK was inside the EU.<\/p><p pid=\"a921.6\/12\">More broadly, a good trade deal is vital to the pensions industry because of the significance to employers that sponsor pension schemes across the manufacturing sector. A bad Brexit will have huge detrimental economic impacts on those sectors, which would put huge pressure on those employers&#8217; ability to fund their schemes. Pension schemes need full access to the global financial markets, both for investments that will give them the resources to meet their pension commitments, and for de-risking and hedging purposes so that they can manage their risks. We need the UK financial services industry to remain as strong and vibrant as it is today.<\/p><p pid=\"a921.6\/13\">I have spoken in two Westminster Hall debates recently: one on the European Free Trade Association and one on alternatives to a no deal Brexit. I shall not repeat what I said there, but I remain of the view that EFTA-EEA membership finds a neat balance by reflecting that the EU referendum result, although decisive, was not overwhelming. Is it a perfect option? No. I want that bespoke deal and believe and trust in the Prime Minister to bring back the best terms possible, but if we need a plan B, for whatever reason, it cannot be to crash out on World Trade Organisation rules. The Prime Minister should have the maximum flexibility she needs to do the right deal and should not being hemmed in by individuals and groups from either side of the Chamber.<\/p><p pid=\"a921.6\/14\">Back in East Renfrewshire, are people dancing down the streets of Barrhead and Clarkston at the thought of Britain leaving the EU? No. But they are not drawing down the blinds and taking to their beds, either. What they want, and what they need, are practical, workable solutions to be put forward in the national interest, pragmatism over ideology, and optimism that is merited but grounded in reality. That is why the Prime Minister&#8217;s Mansion House speech was so welcome. This is a negotiation, but I hope that the EU will engage with the suggestions constructively and that we will be able, at long last, to move forward at pace.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c366.1\/1\">I am grateful for that intervention, and I wonder whether the way this operates in Ireland might be a model for an opt-in pattern for us to think about if we take this issue through to the next stage of making practical considerations.<\/p><p pid=\"c366.1\/2\">Unlike other EU citizens, UK citizens may retire to Ireland without having to establish whether we have sufficient resources or are in possession of health insurance. In fact, if we are visiting Ireland we do not even need a European health insurance card to get healthcare services&#8212;only a passport or some form of identification to prove UK citizenship.<\/p><p pid=\"c366.1\/3\">Interestingly, that did not happen without parliamentary debate and intervention 96 years ago, much of it initiated, interestingly, by the Conservatives and Unionists of that time. I quote from Hansard of <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-06-26\">26 June<\/phrase> 1922, when Colonel John Gretton&#8212;Conservative, Burton&#8212;asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c366.1\/4\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;whether acceptance of the status of a citizen of the Irish Free State, under&#8230;Clause 3 of the suggested Constitution for Southern Ireland,&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c366.1\/5\">would deprive<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c366.1\/6\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;the person so accepting of his rights as a British subject in Ireland&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"c366.1\/7\">To which Mr Winston Churchill&#8212;for it was he&#8212;replied:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c366.1\/8\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;The answer is in the negative.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c366.1\/9\">Mr Gideon Oliphant-Murray, a Unionist MP from Glasgow, pressed the question:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c366.1\/10\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Is it not a fact that a citizen of a British Dominion is, ipso facto, a British subject?&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c366.1\/11\">To which Mr Churchill replied:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c366.1\/12\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;So will he be in the Irish Free State.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c366.1\/13\">Mr Oliphant-Murray:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c366.1\/14\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;That is not the case.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c366.1\/15\">But Mr Churchill was having nothing of it:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c366.1\/16\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;It is the case.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-06-26\">26 June<\/phrase> 1922; Vol. 155, c. 1663.]<\/p><p pid=\"c366.1\/17\">If Winston Churchill felt the need to ensure that individuals should not be stripped of their wished-for citizenship in 1922, surely Conservative Members are honour-bound and loyalty-bound to respect the citizens of 2018 in a similar fashion. All it took was an expression of will on the part of the Conservatives and Unionists of the time and the rights to vote for the Westminster Parliament, as well as the rights of abode and work, were safeguarded. Political will was also brought to bear in relation to Hong Kong, with the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990 and the subsequent 1997 Act, which allowed non-Chinese ethnic minorities to acquire full British citizenship.<\/p><p pid=\"c366.1\/18\">I raise these as examples of political need but also flexibility, initiative and a respect for the individual caught up in the crossfire of state game-playing. This is a matter of political will, indicative of what the Government respect&#8212;the simplistic legal interpretation of Brexit  zealots, which just so happens to bolster an ideological adherence, or the quiet right of citizens to express their will in accordance with international law. I wonder whether the Government took the opportunity to raise this matter with Guy Verhofstadt when he visited yesterday, and who I note also supports our proposal.<\/p><p pid=\"c366.1\/19\">This is not an abstract concept or a nicety of legalese. My daughter Lowri has been able to action her right to live and work in France and Spain without constraint, just as I, somewhat longer ago, was able to action my right to study alongside Irish students in Ireland. I speak for many, many of my constituents when I say that we are proud to exercise our rights as citizens of Wales and citizens of Europe. The state may present its citizens with a referendum and then seek to interpret the frankly uninterpretable result, but it may not strip us of our rights. How our laws are made may change, but that does not give this place the legitimacy to interfere with my children&#8217;s rights as autonomous individual citizens. What of those young people who were not of an age to vote in 2016? Who are we to say that they may not have the choice that was tacitly agreed in the newly forged relationship with Ireland back in 1922&#8212;the choice to opt into a layered citizenship that reflects their individual choice of identity, as Welsh, Scottish, English, and European?<\/p><p pid=\"c366.1\/20\">Anyone with a grasp of the history of Wales will know that our country&#8217;s very name in English deliberately implies two things: first, that we are different&#8212;foreign. But the root of the word was used by the Anglo-Saxons not only to imply foreign, but to imply Roman associations. Wales&#8217;s links with Europe are indivisible from the name imposed on us. Not all of us will recall that we were citizens of Rome 1,600 years ago, but many of us would remain European citizens in the 21st century.<\/p>",

I then made the journey in reverse. In that respect, it could be said that I am a migrant to Scotland. Of course, Scots can be found in every corner of the world, and we in turn welcome people from across the world to this country.<\/p><p>However, there is no doubt that Brexit has huge implications for all of us, and there are some areas in which we can only begin to estimate the impact on our economy and on individuals. That said, although this is a time of huge uncertainty, we can be clear about Brexit&#8217;s impact on the labour market. Some 181,000 EU nationals live in Scotland. The majority are Polish, followed in succession by Irish and Spanish nationals, but I will talk about specific sectors in a moment.<\/p><p>As we know, Scotland&#8217;s population is projected to decline if we do nothing. We are also, unfortunately, ageing; indeed, our population is ageing more rapidly than the population elsewhere in the UK. As a result, we absolutely depend on inward migration to meet our population growth target, so if that migration is absent and EU nationals are unable to come here, our population will inevitably decline, which will have severe negative impacts on our economy. It will lead to labour shortages in key industry sectors and in public services that we hold dear.<\/p><p>Let me touch on some of the most affected sectors. As we have heard, the soft fruit industry relies on seasonal labour and the majority of its employees come from the EU. The industry has grown substantially over the past 20 years and now contributes more than &#163;1 billion to the economy, so we simply cannot afford to lose it. The same applies to farming more generally.<\/p><p>However, that is not the only concern for our fruit growers; another is how we can deliver that fruit in order to add to our exports. In what is already a very constrained sector&#8212;Scotland is short of 11,000 lorry drivers&#8212;the impact of losing the foreign driving capacity that partly fills the gap will be severe.<\/p><p>The hospitality sector will experience the double whammy of losing not only EU employees, who make up a significant element of the workforce, but EU visitors to this country, which will have a material effect on the industry and the country&#8217;s GDP.<\/p><p>I also point out that EU nationals comprise 9 per cent of students and almost 25 per cent of research staff in our universities. We risk losing talented European staff and academics: no one can tell me that that will not be bad for the education sector and the economy.<\/p><p>There will also be an immense impact on our NHS. There has been a 96 per cent drop in the number of nurses wanting to come to Scotland, vacancy rates are up and one in five doctors is thinking about leaving. Brexit and the Tories&#8217; lack of a response on migration are contributing to driving doctors and many other essential professionals out of the country.<\/p><p>What can we do? We should have a differentiated immigration system that is linked to specific sectors, but I take Claire Baker&#8217;s point that it needs to be flexible and go wider. I point out, however, that we have had a differentiated system before: the fresh talent scheme was introduced by the Labour and Liberal Democrat coalition, and we could have such a scheme again.<\/p><p>I agree with the seven principles that have been set out by the Scottish Government but, frankly, we need to get on with this and deliver practical action with a bit more urgency. Brexit is round the corner. I very much welcome the tone and tenor of Jackson Carlaw&#8217;s approach, but I absolutely urge him to use his influence&#8212;but soon&#8212;on the UK Government so that it comes to the table and creates a differentiated system that actually works for all of Scotland.<\/p>",

He suggested that, because the bank levy is a tax on a balance sheet, there is no Laffer curve effect. I dispute that. Banks are mostly international&#8212;for example, our largest bank, HSBC, is a very international bank&#8212;and they can choose where they deploy capital. Their finance director will sit and decide where to allocate capital around the world. If the taxation or regulatory regime  in a particular jurisdiction leads to the returns in that jurisdiction being unattractive, they will rationally respond to that by allocating their resources&#8212;in this case, their bank equity&#8212;somewhere else. There is unquestionably a Laffer curve effect in relation to the bank levy.<\/p><p pid=\"a227.5\/2\">Before I take the two interventions that I promised to take, and will, let me just say that all that links to a related point mentioned by the shadow Chief Secretary, the hon. Member for Bootle: the disapplication of the bank levy to the non-UK part of a UK-headquartered bank&#8217;s balance sheet. In these international times, a bank such as HSBC can choose where it is headquartered and domiciled. HSBC was famously thinking about moving two or three years ago. HSBC is a good example because I think the majority of its balance sheet is non-UK&#8212;it has huge operations in Africa and the far east. Were we to continue to levy the bank levy on HSBC&#8217;s non-UK balance sheet, there would be a powerful, perhaps even irresistible, temptation for it to change its arrangements such that those profits and that balance sheet were booked through some other centre, such as Shanghai, or probably more likely Hong Kong, or possibly Singapore.<\/p><p pid=\"a227.5\/3\">It is beneficial to the UK to have those HSBC assets booked here, because, of course, we get the corporation tax, including the corporation tax surcharge, booked through London, and there are clearly jobs connected with that. If we leave the bank levy on the non-UK balance sheet&#8212;the business is done overseas but booked here&#8212;and drive the booking overseas, we will lose that corporation tax and those jobs. The change to the bank levy is a sensible measure that will protect London&#8217;s status as an international financial centre, because the relevant part of the balance sheet is very internationally mobile.<\/p><p pid=\"a227.5\/4\">I think there are two, or perhaps even three, interventions stacking up, so I shall happily take them all.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a68.0\/1\">I beg to move,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a68.0\/2\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">That this House has considered social housing and regeneration in Earl&#8217;s Court and West Kensington.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/3\">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Owen. Last Thursday, Property Week carried the story that Capital &amp; Counties Properties plc, the promoter of the Earl&#8217;s Court development, is about to sell the Empress State building to the Mayor&#8217;s Office for Policing and Crime for around &#163;240 million. Capco confirmed the leak. Indeed, using the &#8220;cui bono?&#8221; test, Capco was responsible for the leak, which gave a glimmer of good news to its shareholders, who have only had bad years in recent years, ahead of its full-year figures for 2017 being published later this week.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/4\">At over 30 storeys, Empress State was the tallest commercial building in London when it was built in the early 1960s. When it was vacated and sold by the Ministry of Defence, the Metropolitan police rented it from its new commercial owners. When Capco acquired the freehold in 2014, it gave notice to the Met and got consent from a complicit Conservative Administration&#8212;with only weeks to spare before they lost control of Hammersmith and Fulham Council&#8212;to approve Empress State&#8217;s redevelopment as 440 mainly luxury flats.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/5\">Why give up now on luxury residential development, which was previously seen as not just another licence to print money, but a way of integrating the key Empress State site into Capco&#8217;s master plan for Earl&#8217;s Court and West Kensington? The answer is that throwing in the towel on Empress State is the clearest sign yet that not just the master plan, but Capco itself is in serious trouble and is seeking to cut and run to save its own skin.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/6\">This is a story about arrogance and greed; about politicians who thought they could treat people as commodities, units of production and pieces on an electoral chessboard; about developers who could not believe their luck and then fell prey to changing political and market forces; about a vibrant part of London full of industry, commerce and entertainment that was ordered to be razed and replaced with monotonous high-rise blocks as safe deposit flats for the investment market; and about a proud community of 2,000 people who have stood firm for 10 years against the threat of their homes and community being demolished and dispersed.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/7\">Ten years ago, Capco conceived a master plan for 77 acres of land straddling the borders of Hammersmith and Fulham and Kensington and Chelsea. It was dubbed Earl&#8217;s Court, although the majority of the land lay in the marginal North End ward of Hammersmith and Fulham. It was billed as the biggest urban development outside China, with an estimated built-out value of &#163;12 billion.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/8\">The plan was audacious, because although designated as an opportunity area, this was no derelict, brownfield land. One third of the site comprised the Earl&#8217;s Court exhibition centre, including its iconic 1930s entrance, which is now sadly demolished despite the UK having only a third of France&#8217;s exhibition space and a quarter of Germany&#8217;s. One third comprised the maintenance,  manufacture and stabling of a significant part of London Underground in the Lillie Bridge depot, which was a major employer of skilled labour. One third comprised two estates of predominantly council housing: Gibbs Green and West Kensington. Around 2,000 of my constituents live there in 760 good quality, spacious, affordable 1950s, 1970s and 1990s low or medium-rise homes.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/9\">In place of all that, Capco promised 7,500 high-rise flats, of which only 11% would be additional affordable homes that stretched that definition to its limits by, for the most part, offering nugatory discounts on extortionate market prices. Interestingly, now Capco is aching for a deal&#8212;any deal&#8212;to get out of the scheme, it does not say, as most developers do, &#8220;Look at our viability assessment. It is all that we could afford.&#8221; It says, &#8220;We did what Conservative politicians asked, and they wanted precious little affordable housing and not one new social rented home.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/10\">At the start of the process in 2008, Capco told me with similar candour that it did not want to include the estates in the master plan. Developing the exhibition centre and depot meant negotiating with a single partner, Transport for London. Bringing in the estates meant not only a political minefield, but buying up the land interests of the hundreds of freeholders and leaseholders who had bought the desirable homes, flats and maisonettes on Gibbs Green and West Ken.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/11\">Why did Capco succumb? Because the ideologically driven council in Hammersmith and Fulham decided to attract the attention of its political masters in the Department for Communities and Local Government by showing that whole areas of social housing could be wiped and reconceived as luxury developments&#8212;they called it &#8220;sweating the asset&#8221;. For Capco, demolishing the estates was the price of the Tories&#8217; co-operation with the scheme.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/12\">Capco drove a hard bargain. The inequality of arms between developers and local authorities is not unique to Hammersmith. The deal done with TfL on the exhibition sites was hugely preferential to Capco, despite TfL owning the freehold&#8212;perhaps <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Boris Johnson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10999\">the right hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson)<\/phrase> was also not trying too hard&#8212;but that looks like a master stroke compared with the deal that the Hammersmith Tories did for the estate land.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/13\">In 2013, Hammersmith and Fulham Council made a deal to receive &#163;90 million for the estates, plus space in the new development to replace the homes lost. Uniquely in the experience of most planners and developers, however, that sum was not index-linked&#8212;as if property prices never rise in central London.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/14\">Moreover, the council needed to deliver vacant possession of the land. That meant buying out 171 leasehold and freehold homes, which is normally the developer&#8217;s task. The maximum needed to acquire the homes was budgeted as &#163;60 million, although valuation experts assessed the true figure as between &#163;150 million and &#163;174 million. The council has already purchased 26 homes at an average price of &#163;552,000, excluding compensation, which is well in excess of the estimated &#163;350,000.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/15\">The true value of the land is not recorded, but reading across from the valuation of the exhibition centre site, which is, suggests that a more accurate figure is around &#163;1 billion. By accepting no more than 10% of  the land&#8217;s value and by underestimating the costs of acquiring vacant possession, the council could now be left with a zero receipt and a maximum of 672 replacement homes for residents of the estates, having sold 88 homes to cover its shortfall. That will also not guarantee a home for all residents in the new scheme.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/16\">For reasons of time, I must return another day to what I regard as one of local government&#8217;s great financial scandals: how not just prime land, but whole communities were sold for a song to serve an extreme political agenda of gerrymandering and social engineering. Most of the guilty men of the previous Conservative Administration&#8212;and they were all men&#8212;have taken their poisonous philosophy elsewhere, but Capco still squats on Earl&#8217;s Court and West Ken like a toad.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/17\">Capco is represented by its chairman, Ian Hawksworth, who is now most famous for being on the guest list for the President&#8217;s Club dinner, and Gary Yardley, its managing director, who is quick to pick up lavish bonuses for the granting of planning consents with negligible community benefit and huge community loss. Its development partners are even less savoury. They include Hong Kong-based mega-developers Kwok Family Interests. One of the family, Thomas Kwok, is currently serving a five-year sentence for bribery.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/18\">Although I have referred, and will continue to refer, to Capco as the developer, in fact the estates were purchased through an obscure entity called EC Properties LP. The sole partner capital contributed to EC Properties LP is &#163;2 paid in cash by Jersey-registered EC Properties LP Ltd. These and further labyrinthine arrangements appear designed to put Capco in control while shielding it from liability and allowing it to take advantage of offshore tax arrangements.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/19\">Before being tempted by the prospect of rich pickings in Earl&#8217;s Court, Capco&#8217;s business was commercial and retail estate management, specifically through its ownership of Covent Garden. It has no experience as a major land developer, and it shows. It does not have control of the master plan site; it has no option on Lillie Bridge depot, which is owned by TfL; the estate residents, through their lawyers, dispute that the conditional land sale agreement for the estates is enforceable; and now the deliverability of its scheme has been further undermined by the sale of the Empress State building.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/20\">Capco&#8217;s scheme, the value of which fell by 20% in 2016, includes &#163;1.8 billion of enabling infrastructure costs. At &#163;148 per square foot, that is more than three times the cost of larger development schemes in London. Other residential developers have commented on Capco&#8217;s extreme construction costs, which are thought to be 30% to 45% above the market rate.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/21\">Capco&#8217;s assumptions for residential value, which are significantly higher than the local market and schemes elsewhere in London, have not been realised. Sales are slower than expected: flats have been selling at a rate of less than one a week. At one point it was selling one flat a fortnight, at which rate it would take more than 150 years to sell the entire scheme, yet the business plan relies on a high sales rate of 480 private homes a year. Unsurprisingly, Capco has tried in recent months to sell some or all of the site to overseas investors in America, South Africa, Japan, China and Saudi Arabia, but it has had no takers. Frankly, any developer, however much of a gambler, would be beyond reckless to take any of the Earl&#8217;s Court site off Capco&#8217;s hands.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/22\">With no money in the scheme and none from outside, Capco&#8217;s only other option is to return to planning and come up with a new master plan with increased heights and density. Sadly for Capco, that option also looks like a dead end. With Eric Pickles at the Department for Communities and Local Government, the right hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip as Mayor in City Hall, and Stephen Greenhalgh in Hammersmith Town Hall, anything was possible, but the political weather has changed. Now Sadiq Khan is Mayor and has very different ideas about what constitutes affordable and sustainable development. He has also made a strong commitment to tenants&#8217; ballots and said that he wants<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a68.0\/23\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;to make sure people living on social housing estates&#8230;are at the heart of any decisions&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/24\">involving demolition. Stephen Cowan, the Labour leader of Hammersmith and Fulham Council, has described the Earl&#8217;s Court scheme as &#8220;unviable&#8221; and &#8220;undeliverable&#8221; and called on Capco to return the estates to the council. He has the full support of the North End ward Labour candidates, Councillor Larry Culhane, Councillor Daryl Brown and Zarar Qayyum. It appears that he also has the support of the deputy leader of Kensington and Chelsea, Councillor Kim Taylor-Smith, who spoke about the scheme at a meeting of the full council on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-01-24\">24 January<\/phrase>.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/25\">On Monday, I wrote to the chief executive of EC Properties, whose parent company is Capco, to seek a meeting to consider the site&#8217;s future. I told him that on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-06-14\">14 June<\/phrase> the facts on the ground in Kensington had changed. I wrote:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a68.0\/26\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;I want to make it very clear that I do not believe the continuation of this development under the current terms is right. And, as a minimum, if this is to continue I want to see more social and more truly affordable housing included in this scheme.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/27\">I am pleased to see my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Emma Dent Coad\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25706\">the Member for Kensington (Emma Dent Coad)<\/phrase> present, because part of the site is in her constituency. As she knows, my reference to <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2018-06-14\">14 June<\/phrase> was to the Grenfell Tower fire.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/28\">So what happens now? It is too late for the exhibition centres that were demolished in an act of vandalism, but it is not too late to build an acceptable replacement on the site. It is far from too late for the Lillie Bridge depot, which is still owned by TfL, to undergo sympathetic redevelopment to preserve necessary infrastructure for the tube and new affordable homes. If hon. Members will forgive me, however, I will turn my focus to the estates, or rather to the people who live there.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/29\">I first got to know West Ken and Gibbs Green in 1985 as the newly selected council candidate for Gibbs Green ward. The first campaign that I had to fight was to stop the then Tory council putting a relief road through the West Ken estate. It has been a pleasure to represent the area as a councillor and MP for 28 of the past 32 years. Although on aggregate it is a low-income community, it includes people from every walk of life, ethnicity, nationality and profession.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/30\">Residents reacted with horror to the prospect of demolition of their homes. At first, there was no guarantee of rehousing in the area&#8212;only the statutory requirement to rehouse secure tenants in suitable alternative accommodation. Even when residents were told that homes would be available on the site, there were strings attached. Homeowners, private tenants and households who moved into the estates after the land sale agreement  was signed in 2013 have no guarantee of finding a replacement home in the area on eviction. Secure council tenants who move into the first phase of replacement homes could see their service charges triple to between &#163;2,500 and &#163;3,500 a year on top of rent. Having been initially promised like-for-like replacement homes, residents who currently have spacious flats and houses built in the 1960s and 1970s, some of which have gardens and off-street parking, have now been told simply that replacement homes will meet the legal minimum size standard. Even if the developer had the finances and political support to begin evicting residents tomorrow, redevelopment of the estates would still take at least 20 years to complete.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/31\">Residents have done everything they can to make it very clear what they do not want: demolition. In December 2009, a year after learning of the possible demolition of their homes, residents from 83% of households on the West Kensington and Gibbs Green estates signed a petition to oppose it. In March 2012, 80% of residents who responded to the council&#8217;s consultation on the scheme said no to demolition.<\/p><p pid=\"a68.0\/32\">Residents have also been very clear about what they want instead: community ownership. In March 2011, they formed West Ken Gibbs Green Community Homes, a community-controlled not-for-profit organisation with membership from more than two thirds of households on the estates. It was set up with the intention of exercising council tenants&#8217; right to transfer.<\/p>",
