            "body": "<p pid=\"a229.1\/1\">We already have, and have had for a long time, processing in other countries within the UK asylum system. For example, the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which I think both he and I support, means processing cases in other countries. It is also what happened for the Hong Kong scheme.<\/p><p pid=\"a229.1\/2\">We know that the cost is now &#163;400 million, and we can conclude that it is possibly considerably more. According to the treaty, there are additional per-person costs&#8212;if anyone is actually sent&#8212;to cover asylum processing, to cover accommodation costs for five years, and to cover three meals a day for five years. That is in the treaty, but the Government will not tell us how much all that adds up to. We know from the impact assessment for the Illegal Migration Act 2023 that the Home Office was prepared to say that the average cost of sending someone to a theoretical third country would be &#163;169,000&#8212;a remarkable level of precision for a figure picked out of thin air. However, it will not have chosen a figure for that assessment that was higher than the Rwanda costs, because it will not assume that it would have to pay for three meals a day for five years everywhere. That suggests that the actual figure per person is higher. Maybe nearer &#163;200,000 per person? Again, if that is wrong, Ministers should tell us.<\/p><p pid=\"a229.1\/3\">Otherwise, it suggests that if the Home Office manages to sort out its legal wrangles and get flights off the ground, another whopping bill is coming. Suppose the Home Office manages to send 100 people to Rwanda this year, which is what the Court of Appeal said was Rwanda&#8217;s capacity. Well, that means another &#163;20 million cheque. If that is wrong, again, tell us the additional per-person costs.<\/p><p pid=\"a229.1\/4\">Ministers say that they cannot possibly tell us any of these things because it is somehow commercially confidential. What a load of total nonsense. This is not a contract with a company with shareholders and intellectual property rights and competitors who will not bid if they think all their cost details will be scrutinised by other companies; this is an agreement with a sovereign state. If the Kigali Government choose to contract out housing to a private provider, that might have some commercial considerations, but that is a matter for them, not for us. Ministers claim that it will somehow  make it harder to agree deals. Again, they are making up these arguments because they are embarrassed and do not want to reveal the figures.<\/p><p pid=\"a229.1\/5\">In other areas, the Government have told us the facts. In March 2023, the Prime Minister announced &#163;476 million over three years for the agreement with France. It was set out in detail, with &#163;124 million in 2023-24, &#163;168 million in 2024-25 and &#163;184 million in 2025-26. We know what the future spending will be on that agreement with France, so why not tell us the future spending agreed with Rwanda? The work with France, which we support, covers coastal patrols, drones and technology. It needs to be properly scrutinised to ensure that we are getting value for money, but we support working with the French police along the coast to prevent dangerous boat crossings and to protect our border security. We want to go further, working with other countries to tackle the criminal gangs, but why publish those details in full and set them out several years in advance for France and not for Rwanda? The Government cannot claim that it is because they might be trying to negotiate agreements with other countries compared to Rwanda and not with France. They might have to negotiate future agreements with Belgium, the Dutch police and other Governments, given that the borders inspectorate has pointed out that many of the smuggler routes pass through there, but that is not preventing the Government being public about the facts on the France scheme. It is time that the Government gave us the facts that Parliament would normally be entitled to, and that the public and, crucially, the taxpayer should be entitled to. How much of taxpayers&#8217; money have they promised to Rwanda for a scheme that is failing?<\/p><p pid=\"a229.1\/6\">The motion sets out some of the facts that we want: payments made or scheduled, including the fourth and fifth year figures; the per person costs; the memorandum of understanding that sets out the money agreement; and the agreement between the Home Office and the Treasury while the Prime Minister was Chancellor on costs and numbers, so that everyone has the chance to see what doubts the Prime Minister had, rather than their being hidden away from the taxpayer. We are holding this Opposition Day debate to give the Government the chance to give us the proper figures, which cross-party Select Committees such as the Public Accounts Committee, the Home Affairs Committee and the Liaison Committee have been asking for.<\/p><p pid=\"a229.1\/7\">The Government also claim that none of that matters because the costs will be outweighed by the savings on asylum hotels, but I must break it to them that all this money for Rwanda is in addition to asylum hotels. It has been reported this week that the Prime Minister told the Home Office to keep open some asylum hotels. We know their plans for bases and barges have been unravelling. One hundred people were quietly moved out of Wethersfield in the Home Secretary&#8217;s constituency and moved into hotels. Plans to put people into Catterick, in the Prime Minister&#8217;s constituency, have now been dropped. It is costing more to keep people on the Bibby Stockholm than it is in hotels. It is total chaos and a total mess, which is why there are 20% more people in asylum hotels than there were a year ago when the Prime Minister promised to end them. Rwanda does not change any of that. In fact, their migration legislation, supposedly to enable Rwanda, is likely to make the backlog and the costs worse.<\/p>",

He is relentless in highlighting social injustice and, in this case, the lack of freedom of speech for Jimmy Lai and others; we know that similar things are going on in Tibet. However, as the three main speakers in this debate mentioned, because of the difficulty in monitoring what is happening in Tibet, we do not hear as much as we should from journalists there.<\/p><p pid=\"b410.1\/2\">My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Kerry McCarthy\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11455\">the Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy)<\/phrase> made an extremely important point about the climate and the vulnerable nature of Tibet. Having hot-footed her way back from COP28, she has given us her update on the environmental concerns about that fragile part of our beautiful planet, where third pole ice storage and permafrost is thawing, with dreadful consequences for the river system. We know that a lack of water can cause long-term problems, including social ones, and she has made an important point. She also highlights the potential for Indo-Chinese relations to sour, and makes the important point that when we  speak to leaders from the PRC, we must consider the trade relationship, which is very important to the UK&#8217;s economy, but crucially must not leave our values at the door. Will the Minister say when she last raised the issue of freedom of religion or belief in Tibet with her counterpart in the PRC?<\/p><p pid=\"b410.1\/3\">The Foreign Secretary is in the other place. What impact does the Minister think his previous business interests have? What is the impact of the clear speeches he was giving in Sri Lanka and other places in which China has an interest? Might that cloud the judgment of Ministers as they speak one to one with counterparts in the People&#8217;s Republic of China, or with those who represent the PRC in London? Can she also outline what representations are made to China, during trade talks, on the subject of Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet? We should not have one box for trade and one for human rights; they should be part of the same dialogue. What reassurances can she give concerning the issues raised today?<\/p><p pid=\"b410.1\/4\">In conclusion, we have heard valuable contributions from members of the APPG for international freedom of religion or belief, who speak out regularly about the lack of freedom for so many to practise their faith abroad. We also heard the cultural and environmental concerns that my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol East has about the Tibetan plateau. On the specifics of how we do our diplomacy, what reassurances can the Minister give me and the House on the important subject of freedom of religion or belief in the People&#8217;s Republic of China, specifically as regards Tibetan Buddhists?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b2015.0\/1\">My Lords, it is such a great pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Alton, who is such an incredible subject-matter expert. I rise to make a brief and narrow contribution to this important debate, specifically on the role that the Royal Navy has played in enforcing sanctions. Enforcing sanctions is never easy, but we are fortunate that the Royal Navy has a permanent presence in the Indo-Pacific, comprised of two offshore patrol vessels: HMS &#8220;Tamar&#8221; and HMS &#8220;Spey&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b2015.0\/2\">I declare an interest as the Prime Minister&#8217;s trade envoy to Singapore, and I had the pleasure of visiting HMS &#8220;Spey&#8221; two weeks ago. HMS &#8220;Tamar&#8221; has already played an important role enforcing UN sanctions targeting North Korea&#8217;s illegal weapons programme. The ship patrolled the East China Sea, in very rough sea conditions, ensuring that items destined for illicit activities were not able to make it to North Korea. This is the first Royal Navy permanent presence in the Indo-Pacific since the handover of Hong Kong to China. It is because of this presence that, just a few weeks ago, during the state visit of the President of South Korea, we were able to sign an agreement, the first of its type, committing to joint enforcement of sanctions resolutions.<\/p><p pid=\"b2015.0\/3\">Our offshore patrol vessels are small, just 90 metres long&#8212;in fact, Kim Jong-un is known to have luxury yachts larger than that, complete with waterslides, all while his citizens suffer from extreme poverty&#8212;but in this case, size does not matter. In fact, we are better off having smaller ships in the region. They have tremendous capability and are very well suited for the region and the specific job at hand. In fact, they are perfect for capability-matching with Indo-Pacific nations that we work closely with. Larger vessels can sometimes overwhelm the host nations&#8217; maritime forces. The design  of these ships enables us to show the flag very effectively. They have an adaptable flight deck and bunk space for 50 people in case they are required for humanitarian assistance and disaster response across the region.<\/p><p pid=\"b2015.0\/4\">It is critical that we keep them there. The region wants them; the region welcomes them. They are an enduring presence that also builds and reinforces cultural links, including to more neglected parts of the region, in a less demanding or provocative way than a larger warship. I hope the Minister will join me in paying tribute to the ship&#8217;s companies of HMS &#8220;Spey&#8221; and HMS &#8220;Tamar&#8221;. I know he will agree that we must not take them for granted. To keep them going, a tremendous amount of work goes into ensuring personnel and supplies are in the right place at the right time. This is no easy task. It is the tyranny of distance.<\/p><p pid=\"b2015.0\/5\">We need to consider now what we do beyond 2028 when their scheduled deployment finishes. Should we deploy Type 31s to the region? Probably, but as an addition to, not a replacement for, our offshore petrol vessels. I end by thanking my noble friend Lord Swire for securing this very important debate and for his longstanding contributions to safety and security in the region.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1091.1\/1\">I absolutely agree. At the start of my speech, I alluded to what my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport said about 1.2 million people in Greater Manchester being digitally excluded. We do not know the figures nationwide, but that is a serious worry to me and something we have to bear in mind when we talk about such mergers. I will develop that argument further when I sum up. With fewer major players in the market, pricing decisions might prioritise company profits over consumer value. I hope the issues raised will be thoroughly examined by the CMA in its investigation.<\/p><p pid=\"a1091.1\/2\">Let me turn to the second key question, about access to the UK mobile networks. It is important that the Government safeguard national and personal data if the merger moves forward. Recently, Vodafone secured a contract to provide video conferencing and recording services at UK military courts. If the merger proceeds, Three would then hold them as well. That becomes significant when we learn that CK Hutchison Holdings, the owner of Three, is a conglomerate based in Hong Kong and registered in the Cayman Islands, established in 2015, as mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill.<\/p><p pid=\"a1091.1\/3\">At this early stage, it is only right to ask, in light of national security concerns that have been raised in this House and elsewhere, whether any assessment has been made of CK Hutchinson&#8217;s connections with the Chinese state. If so, does the merger pose any risk to individual security or that of the nation? Would the merger involve excluding Government contracts from the merger to ensure data security? These are crucial points that demand careful consideration and a robust plan to protect sensitive data and national interests. Is the economic security sub-committee of the National Security Council looking at the merger? As this decision is a matter of national security, will Parliament have an active role in this decision-making process?<\/p><p pid=\"a1091.1\/4\">Before the Minister responds, I draw his attention to a report of the Intelligence and Security Committee. The Chair of the Committee, the right hon. Member for New Forest East, will correct me if I am wrong, but it says:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1091.1\/5\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Effective Parliamentary oversight is not some kind of &#8216;optional extra&#8217; &#8211; it is a vital safeguard in any functioning Parliamentary democracy&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a1091.1\/6\">Therefore, I hope the Minister will assure us that Parliament will be engaged and informed throughout the significant decision-making process. That is a hugely important point&#8212;I cannot emphasise that enough&#8212;given the potential national security risk if the largest mobile network in the UK is significantly controlled by a foreign company.<\/p><p pid=\"a1091.1\/7\">Ultimately, the decision on security issues rests with the Investment Security Unit in the Cabinet Office, with final approval resting with the Prime Minister. I hope the Prime Minister will consider the sensitive material involved in the merger including, but not limited to, the data from 27 million customers, along with contracts for the NHS, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Defence. Whether the merger goes ahead remains to be seen, but many questions have yet to be addressed. In winding up, will the Minister shed some light on the vital issues raised today in this vital debate?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c941.1\/1\">I praise and congratulate my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer on bringing forward the Bill. As we have previously discussed, it will implement the important measures set out in the autumn statement.<\/p><p pid=\"c941.1\/2\">We have already debated some of the key measures that were included in the National Insurance Contributions (Reduction in Rates) Bill, which was considered in the other place yesterday. I do not want to go over the arguments on fiscal drag and lower taxes, as I have set out my views previously, but I commend the Government for bringing forward those measures quickly and in the right way, as they will go some way to easing the tax pressures the public are feeling.<\/p><p pid=\"c941.1\/3\">My right hon. Friends on the Front Bench are well versed in my views on the tax burden, so I will not go on about how about I feel about that or measures we can bring in going forward. However, I would like to press them to ensure that we think about long-term provisions and that the next Finance Bill goes further by raising thresholds for income tax, including for higher-rate taxpayers, and for national insurance.<\/p><p pid=\"c941.1\/4\">It is worth noting that in the Budget after the general election of summer 2015, the then Chancellor outlined plans to increase the tax-free threshold to the equivalent of 30 hours&#8217; pay at the national living wage. The new &#163;11.44 national living wage rate for 2024 commences in April, so if the tax-free threshold rose to cover 30 hours per week next year, that would equate to &#163;17,000 to &#163;18,000, rather than remaining at &#163;12,570 through to 2028, as currently planned. I press my right hon. Friends to keep that under review&#8212;thankfully, all tax measures are under review&#8212;and to prioritise uplifts to those thresholds, because we believe in enabling people to keep more of their earnings.<\/p><p pid=\"c941.1\/5\">At the same time, when we see GDP figures not growing as fast as they could, as we have today, it is important to focus on how we can grow the economy much more, and with that people&#8217;s incomes. We want to see more growth in those GDP figures, but they represent the impact of high interest rates and what they mean for inflation. High interest and inflation have placed a burden on businesses and households. The Bill outlines reductions in business taxation that are well timed and well placed but, as ever, they need to be kept under review. Businesses grow the economy by employing more people, which helps economic growth, and that is the space where we, as a Government and a country, want to be.<\/p><p pid=\"c941.1\/6\">It will not surprise my right hon. Friends on the Front Bench that I wish to speak to certain clauses, as I have spoken about clauses on business taxes in the past. I want to focus on the provisions in clause 21 and schedule 12 of the Bill, on pillar two and the global minimum corporation tax measures that we are adopting. I have been on record about this previously, but the Minister is also well aware of my long-standing concerns over the implementation of pillar two measures. Binding ourselves to pillar two undermines our fiscal sovereignty and risks deterring investment into our country. I labour this point because we have just seen the publication of our GDP growth forecasts. Obviously there will be revisions in our growth forecasts, even by financial institutions, and we should be mindful of that, but this measure undermines our competitiveness. It is known that some 130 countries have signed up to pillar two, but, unlike the UK, barely a quarter of them are implementing it at the end of the year. Given our economic backdrop and GDP forecasts, I would rather see a delay in the implementation of this measure.<\/p><p pid=\"c941.1\/7\">A written parliamentary answer earlier this month shows that just 30 countries are implementing this measure at the same time as we are. They will be followed by Japan in April, and then Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Hong Kong and Singapore from January 2025. We also know that the US, our big economic ally, is not likely to implement the measure, so by pressing ahead with this fiscal measure, we are basically limiting the scope that we give ourselves&#8212;oxygen, basically&#8212;to develop and grow.<\/p><p pid=\"c941.1\/8\">When the Finance (No. 2) Act 2023 went through Parliament last year, it contained more than 150 clauses, which were spread over two parts, with a further five schedules, covering 170 pages in total. Many of us remember carrying those weighty tomes into the Chamber and flicking through all the pages. There was a large and complex change in tax laws. But despite that legislation being passed in the summer, this Bill makes even further changes to pillar two and the domestic top-up levels. Clause 21 and schedule 12, which cover those changes, span 55 pages and include multiple amendments to the Finance (No. 2) Act passed only a few months ago. I recall saying that the amendments alone would generate more complexity to the system. I say politely to those on the Front Bench that the 55 pages here point to the complex nature of the matter. The fact that we are amending something that went through the House not that long ago says it all.<\/p><p pid=\"c941.1\/9\">No impact assessment has been provided of these measures, which give effect to the accounting periods beginning on or after <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">31 December 2023<\/phrase>. Companies  and partnerships will be impacted by the changes coming into effect in less than three weeks&#8217; time, even though the Bill will not receive Royal Assent until next year. We must be cognisant of the burdens that we are again putting on businesses. I am no fan of accountants, but by putting more burdens on to businesses, we are increasing their dependency on accountants and on process, which we should be freeing them from. I ask the Minister to provide us with further details as to why these changes are needed when the previous Finance Act was passed only earlier this year, and with an impact assessment  of them.<\/p><p pid=\"c941.1\/10\">I would like to understand the merits of the global minimum income tax, and I hope that, in the same way that all tax is under review, Ministers will consider removing all the provisions from our statute book in due course, because other countries will not follow suit or are delaying implementing some of these measures.<\/p><p pid=\"c941.1\/11\">I wish to comment on clause 2, relating to research and development tax credits. It merges the current R&amp;D expenditure credit with the small and medium-sized enterprises scheme. These tax credits help and support businesses to invest and take risks, and, importantly, to innovate and grow, set up jobs and employ people. I have previously raised the concerns that some businesses have about the complexity of claiming them and the processes that they experience. I am aware of many businesses that have spent more than a year having their claims investigated, with multiple rounds of questions and inquiries from HMRC officials. There are many live cases, which I will not reflect on now, but previous Treasury Ministers have committed to hold discussions on them.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1796.0\/1\">My Lords, I have a large number of notes here, in the hope that I can do this debate justice by responding to as many noble Lords as possible. I thank my noble friend Lady Anelay of St Johns for getting this debate on the schedule in such a timely manner, celebrating this 75th anniversary, and for her extensive work on human rights over many years, as many in the Chamber have acknowledged. I also thank all noble Lords for their thoughtful contributions.<\/p><p pid=\"a1796.0\/2\">The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the foundation stone upon which we have built an enduring framework of rights and freedoms&#8212;a framework for freedom, equality, opportunity and justice that provides agreed benchmarks to hold all states to account. As reinforced by my noble friend Lord Ahmad in his   intervention at the UN in Geneva today, the Government put promoting and protecting human rights at the heart of what we do. That means working with allied countries, institutions and civil society to protect and bolster the international human rights architecture and advance our human rights priorities. My noble friend Lord Ahmad met with a large number of civil rights individuals&#8212;150, I believe&#8212;on Thursday of last week at a celebration event for this 75th anniversary. This means taking action in public and in private when states fail to live up to their obligations. It also means making sure that our development work and broader diplomacy strengthens human rights in our contested and fast-evolving world.<\/p><p pid=\"a1796.0\/3\">We publish an annual Human Rights and Democracy Report, which sets out actions we have taken to tackle key concerns and to advance human rights, with a particular focus on our 32 priority countries. These countries are where we judge we can make a real difference through long-term, determined and sustained engagement.<\/p><p pid=\"a1796.0\/4\">On the UN Human Rights Council, we remain one of the most active and influential states working within the international human rights architecture. The noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, made an important point about some of the issues of some council members. We use our influence: for example, we have isolated Russia in the system of late, particularly with regard to elections for the HRC. As my noble friend Lady Anelay said in her opening remarks, as leading members of the UN Human Rights Council, we have taken robust action to hold Russia to account for its actions in Ukraine and for repression at home. I say to the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth, and the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, that we continue to call out wrongs. We have called out China for its treatment of Uighurs and democracy activists in Hong Kong, and we will continue to do so. Let me reassure my noble friend Lady Helic that we have led on resolutions establishing or removing UN accountability mechanisms for Syria, South Sudan and Sudan, among other states, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Collins of Highbury.<\/p><p pid=\"a1796.0\/5\">We have broadened our human rights sanctions regime to punish those responsible for human rights violations in a range of priority countries. Indeed, if I consider some of the actions taken, in part through the ongoing and long-serving work done by my noble friend Lady Anelay, we have embedded human rights in all our gender equality and development work. Our international development White Paper sets out how we will continue to work with countries to protect human rights through peacebuilding and supporting justice and strong institutions.<\/p><p pid=\"a1796.0\/6\">Gender equality is one of our priority issues that sits at the nexus of our diplomacy and development work. We are pursuing the three Es outlined in our international women and girls strategy: educating girls, empowering women and girls by championing their health and rights, and ending gender violence. In response to the attempted rollback of the rights of women, girls and LGBT+ people in many parts of the world, we have sanctioned 15 individuals and entities during the last year alone for gender-based violence  and acts of sexual violence in conflict. We are also working with countries such as the United Arab Emirates to secure a UN Human Rights Council resolution on girls&#8217; education and climate change.<\/p><p pid=\"a1796.0\/7\">Trade was raised by a number of noble Lords. We are increasing the debt and poverty partnerships to enable the UK to achieve positive human rights impacts. For example, seeking to establish and secure growing trade relationships increases the UK&#8217;s influence and facilitates open conversations. We therefore raise human rights concerns during these conversations to ensure that our trading agreements continue to promote and protect rights.<\/p><p pid=\"a1796.0\/8\">In response to my noble friend Lady Anelay, the Government&#8217;s overseas security and justice assistance policy and guidance provide that rigorous assessment of whether UK engagement may contribute to a violation of human rights or international humanitarian law prior to any justice or security sector assistance being provided. I can reassure my noble friend that the guidance will be updated shortly and will reflect the views of a broad range of shareholders.<\/p><p pid=\"a1796.0\/9\">A number of noble Lords raised attacks on human rights in conflict zones. We have also prioritised support for accountability mechanisms. The UK-led referral of the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court was the largest in the court&#8217;s history. We are also supporting Ukrainian war crimes investigators, and we are working with the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court to prevent atrocities and hold perpetrators to account in Ukraine and elsewhere.<\/p><p pid=\"a1796.0\/10\">I shall try to answer some of the very diverse questions that noble Lords have put. My apologies if I do not reach all of them; if I do not, I pledge that we will write so that noble Lords can have the detailed answers that all the questions deserve.<\/p><p pid=\"a1796.0\/11\">I say first to the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, that the UK has a long-standing tradition of ensuring that rights and liberties are protected, and of abiding by the rule of law, both domestically and internationally. We do not believe it is necessary to leave the ECHR in order to deliver on our major priorities, including tackling illegal immigration.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1456.0\/1\">My Lords, legal migration is important to the British economy, but it needs to be properly controlled and managed. In the past decade we have welcomed more than half a million people through humanitarian routes, principally from Ukraine, Hong Kong and Afghanistan. We in the Labour Party support these humanitarian routes, but the overall figures, which are way above these humanitarian routes, are out of control. People are understandably worried about housing, getting local GP appointments and access to public services when they can see that their communities are growing. The net migration figure stood at 672,000 last year, which is three times the amount at the 2019 general election. There has been a 65% increase in work migration visas this year, and this includes a 150% increase in health and care visas.<\/p><p pid=\"a1456.0\/2\">Yesterday&#8217;s announcement is an admission of the Government&#8217;s failure on the immigration system and the economy. The Prime Minister is now proposing policies he opposed six months ago and opposing policies he helped introduce. The Labour Party has said repeatedly that net migration should come down and called for action to scrap the unfair 20% wage discount, raise salary thresholds based on economic evidence, and bring in new training requirements linked to the immigration system as well as a proper workforce plan for social care. While the Government have been forced to abandon the unfair wage discount that they introduced, they are still failing to introduce more substantial reforms that link immigration to training and fair pay requirements in the UK, meaning that many sectors will continue to see rising numbers of work visas because of skills shortages. The Labour Party is also calling for a reformed and strengthened Migration Advisory Committee that could advise on the impact of all policies to ensure that the details are correct.<\/p><p pid=\"a1456.0\/3\">There has been a failure to invest in skills and apprenticeships. Some 160,000 fewer people have taken up apprenticeships under this Conservative Government. For engineering and manufacturing, apprenticeships have fallen by half while engineering visas have increased. The Government have resisted calls to link requirements for skills training to the immigration system, and the UK is failing to train and pay people in the UK properly, leading to a skills shortage and a low-wage economy that relies on migrant workers.<\/p><p pid=\"a1456.0\/4\">In addition to this, the asylum system is broken. As of October, the number of legacy asylum cases waiting over a year for a decision to be made stood at 32,109. There were, in addition, 85,000 cases under a year old that had not been dealt with; thus, the overall backlog has not been reduced.<\/p><p pid=\"a1456.0\/5\">The Home Office has now hit its target for the number of caseworkers working on asylum cases, reaching 2,500 full-time staff by the end of the summer. However, the turnover of staff rose between April and August 2023 to 36%, having previously dropped to 25%. This puts into question the level of expertise in the team and the quality of decisions being made.<\/p><p pid=\"a1456.0\/6\">Following changes to Immigration Rules, which make it easier to withdraw an application on behalf of an asylum applicant, the number of asylum withdrawals has risen to 17,000. In a recent Select Committee hearing, the Permanent Secretary stated that he did not know the whereabouts of these 17,000 people. It may be that the length of time that cases are being left before being processed allows people to abscond, or that details have become incorrect over time, particularly when they move address so frequently; or it may be that the Home Office is being stricter with its criteria for withdrawing cases.<\/p><p pid=\"a1456.0\/7\">I understand that the reason for the withdrawal is not noted. I ask the Minister: why is the reason for withdrawal not noted and does he believe that it should be? Either way, losing track of 17,000 asylum seekers is representative of the danger of allowing such a backlog to build up in the first place. Of course, legal immigration is important to our economy and, of course, we should meet our humanitarian obligations. But with net migration figures at 672,000 last year, with government policies that flip and flop, and local public services under pressure, it is inevitable that the voting public become sceptical and disillusioned. The Labour Party says there should be a longer-term plan for immigration for the economy and for our country.<\/p><p pid=\"a1456.0\/8\">I turn to a separate matter, which I received an email about today. I see that the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, is not in her place, so I will repeat the questions from Universities UK about the higher-education sector and how it may be affected. First, is the Minister able to outline timescales in terms of reference for the Migration Advisory Committee&#8217;s review of the graduate route visa?<\/p><p pid=\"a1456.0\/9\">Secondly, do any changes to the salary threshold and financial requirements for work and family visas apply to new entrants only and, if so, what is the situation for existing visa holders? Thirdly, can the Minister give clarification on what the new salary discount will be for roles listed on the immigration salary list if they are not part of the 20%?<\/p><p pid=\"a1456.0\/10\">Lastly, will the Government promote a clear message that international students are welcome in the UK, and that the Government remain committed to the international education strategy?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c43.1\/1\">I thank the Home Secretary for advance sight of the statement.<\/p><p pid=\"c43.1\/2\">Today&#8217;s statement is an admission of years of total failure by this Conservative Government&#8212;failure on the immigration system and failure on the economy. It is another example of the total chaos at the heart of this Government. Net migration has trebled since the last election, when the Conservatives promised to reduce it, as a result of their policies on the economy and on immigration, including the Prime Minister&#8217;s policy decisions. In a chaotic panic, the Prime Minister now opposes the policies that he introduced and thinks that the Government&#8217;s own decisions are a problem. Who does the Home Secretary think has been in charge for the past 13 years? More chaos, more veering all over the place.<\/p><p pid=\"c43.1\/3\">Net migration should come down. Labour has called for an end to the 20% unfair discount, for increased salary thresholds to prevent exploitation and for the inclusion of advice from a strengthened Migration Advisory Committee. Most of all, we have called for a proper plan, with clear links between the immigration system, training and the economy, and workforce plans, none of which are in the statement, because the Government have no grip and no proper plan. This is a chaotic approach.<\/p><p pid=\"c43.1\/4\">Immigration is important for Britain, and we have rightly helped Ukraine and Hong Kong. We benefit from international talent and students. That is why the immigration system needs to be controlled and managed, so that it is fair and effective, and why net migration should come down from record levels. But there needs to be a proper plan. It was this Conservative Government who brought in the 20% wage discount that allowed employers to recruit at less than the going rate, even though the Migration Advisory Committee warned against it, and even though it is completely unfair. They chose to apply salary thresholds that were lower than the Migration Advisory Committee originally proposed, and to not update them for years. As Chancellor and then as Prime Minister, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"None\" person_id=\"unknown\">the right hon. Member for Richmond (Yorks)<\/phrase> (Rishi Sunak) repeatedly blocked proposals to tighten the rules, including in May this year, and including when the Government refused Labour&#8217;s calls to end the unfair 20% discount. They repeatedly failed to listen to warnings about the failure to train or pay properly in the UK. Twelve months ago, I warned that work visas had substantially increased as a result of  major skills shortages in the UK and that the Conservatives were not taking any serious action to address those shortages. The Leader of the Opposition warned 12 months ago that the immigration system should be linked to new requirements to train up workers at home, but the Conservatives did nothing; unbelievably they are still doing nothing.<\/p><p pid=\"c43.1\/5\">There is nothing in this statement about training requirements or workforce plans. The Conservatives say that they want fewer shortage occupations, but it was only four months ago that they added bricklayers, roof tilers and plasterers to the shortage list. They have totally failed on construction training, and there are no plans to tackle that. Engineering apprenticeships have halved since 2018, so it is no wonder that engineering visas have gone up. Again, there is nothing to tackle those failures.<\/p><p pid=\"c43.1\/6\">Social care visas have gone up from 3,500 a year to more than 100,000 a year because the Government have failed for years to heed warnings about recruitment and retention in social care. They halved the budget for social care workforce recruitment and support back in the spring, and they are still not listening and still refusing to adopt Labour&#8217;s plan for a proper workforce strategy for social care, including professional standards and a fair pay agreement. They are failing to tackle the delays in the asylum system that have also pushed the net migration figures up. They are failing to tackle NHS waiting lists that are preventing the long-term sick from going back to work.<\/p><p pid=\"c43.1\/7\">The Prime Minister is just crashing around all over the place, reversing policies that he introduced, criticising policies he defended six months ago and introducing new immigration policies without any of the economic policies to match. A previous Prime Minister was accused of being a shopping trolley, veering around from one side to another. The current Prime Minister is clearly veering, but he certainly is not steering; he has just climbed into someone else&#8217;s shopping trolley and is being pushed around all over the place.<\/p><p pid=\"c43.1\/8\">Can the Home Secretary tell us where the workforce plan is on social care, on engineering, on bricklaying and on all the shortage occupations that the Government&#8217;s total economic failure has left us with? Has the Migration Advisory Committee advised on these policies? Where are the reforms to strengthen the committee so that it can do so? Why have the Government still not introduced our requirements on employers or on the Government to address the skills and labour shortages that are driving the increase in net migration in the first place? The Conservatives are in chaos. They have no serious plan for the economy, no serious plan for the immigration system, and no serious plan for the country. Britain deserves better than this.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a835.0\/1\">My Lords, it is my honour to follow my noble and learned friend Lady Hale, whose eminent career has included, of course, serving as President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, and being the first woman appointed President of the Supreme Court.<\/p><p pid=\"a835.0\/2\">We were brought up in different parts of the West Riding of Yorkshire, and both ended up being head girl in our different grammar schools&#8212;Yorkshire grit. I am particularly proud to have presented my noble and learned friend with her honorary fellowship of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Noble Lords will be grateful to my noble and learned friend for explaining why her membership had to cease in 2009. This of  course included a period as a non-permanent judge at the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong, where I am sure her wisdom benefited their system greatly.<\/p><p pid=\"a835.0\/3\">Noble Lords will also recall when, in September 2019, as President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Hale, found Boris Johnson&#8217;s prorogation of Parliament to be unlawful, thus terminating the suspension of Parliament.<\/p><p pid=\"a835.0\/4\">I congratulate my noble and learned friend on her remarkable maiden speech, of no less interest given the time since her introduction. It is so fitting that it should be about children&#8217;s mental health. I also congratulate the noble Earl, Lord Russell, for speaking so honestly, openly and movingly about the subject of children&#8217;s mental health.<\/p><p pid=\"a835.0\/5\">I declare my interests and experience. I trained as a child and family psychiatrist and later specialised in the psychiatry of learning disability. I have served as President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. His Majesty&#8217;s Government has just published my report My Heart Breaks&#8212;Solitary Confinement in Hospital Has No Therapeutic Benefit for People with a Learning Disability and Autistic People. We will be debating this in the topical debate to follow. I have also devoted several years to addressing child protection in families and institutions, and to considering the long-term mental health consequences of child abuse.<\/p><p pid=\"a835.0\/6\">Why is this all so important? Childhood is a period of extraordinary potential. If we get it right, we are investing in the whole of society&#8217;s future. Pregnancy and the first five years of a child&#8217;s life are the time when the foundations of healthy development are laid. Our relationship patterns are formed in the first few years of our lives, which also impacts on our future mental health. We know that adverse childhood experiences&#8212;ACEs&#8212;are key predictors of poor physical and mental health across the lifespan, and that poverty increases the risk that ACEs will occur during childhood. Half of all mental health problems present the first time before the age of 14, which is why prevention and population health really matter.<\/p><p pid=\"a835.0\/7\">There are rising rates of referral to mental health services. These services are overwhelmed. Social care and school staff are feeling overstretched. We know that burnout is higher in those who work with children. There are rising rates of self-harm and suicide, particularly in teenage girls. Families are struggling with the cost of living crisis. To understand the current state of children&#8217;s mental health, I suggest we need to look at their relational and physical environments. Let us think about the post-pandemic world that children are growing up in right now. What is it like for them at home, at school, online, in their local communities and in the wider world?<\/p><p pid=\"a835.0\/8\">Thinking about a child&#8217;s home environment, we need to acknowledge parents&#8217; own significant social and mental health needs. Many are anxious and stressed; they are worried about money, their jobs, their families and the world. But when parents feel calm, safe and connected, their emotional availability to their children increases. This enables them to listen to their children and recognise their needs and helps them develop their emotional resilience and mental health for life. Let us not underestimate the power of accompanying parents in the tough and important journey of parenthood.<\/p><p pid=\"a835.0\/9\">Thinking about a child&#8217;s school environment, we need to develop a culture of nurture as the foundation for learning. Nurture means creating a safe environment in which all behaviours are understood as a communication of underlying needs. When we realise this, we can transform a child&#8217;s experience in school and find ways of unlocking their love of learning and forming friendships.<\/p><p pid=\"a835.0\/10\">Thinking of a child&#8217;s online environment, we see that it is one of the biggest current dangers to a child&#8217;s mental health. The Online Safety Act will help, but it requires society to support parents and schools in making a radical change to the current status quo. Children&#8217;s friendships and the social media environment in which they meet have a toxic potential, with some children never able to switch off. The physical environment, including housing, school and transport, may all contribute to our mental health, and we often overlook chemical factors&#8212;I am thinking about a healthy diet and reducing the impact of pollution and climate change.<\/p><p pid=\"a835.0\/11\">We need to invest time and resources in building a population health approach that addresses the huge impact of health inequalities and the social determinants of health on the mental health of children. This requires a local, skilled workforce in population and public health too. We need an attachment, family-based approach that supports early relationships and secure attachments between parents and their babies. We need universally available family hubs and local community settings where parents can meet and share the ups and downs of family life and relationships.<\/p><p pid=\"a835.0\/12\">We need early diagnosis for autism. Too many authorities are delaying assessment of autism at the moment. It is a mistake. It is not cost-effective. We need a skilled, supported and well-paid workforce for children, including early years childcare workers, midwives and health visitors, pre-school, primary school and secondary school teachers&#8212;all the practitioners who support children&#8217;s health and development in our communities and education settings. I agree with the noble Earl that we need more psychotherapy and more family therapy.<\/p><p pid=\"a835.0\/13\">Focus on waiting lists for treatment misses the point. I suggest that we need less focus on mental health problems and more on emotional intelligence and resilience; more on understanding that it is normal to have strong feelings of sadness, grief and anger; more in relation to life and being human; and perhaps less focus on isolation and loneliness and more focus on human connection. A child&#8217;s emotional well-being and mental health cannot be considered, however, in isolation from their family&#8217;s health and well-being, and support for parents&#8217; mental health must also be prioritised.<\/p><p pid=\"a835.0\/14\">For those with milder problems, respectful, relational, family, school and community-based care is more effective than medicalising individuals. Mental health needs in schools can make a huge difference, and they should be there in every school. There are some excellent school-based initiatives. For example, nurture groups and whole-school nurture programmes are being planned across Surrey next year. The charity Place2Be offers  one-to-one therapies in several hundred primary schools. I declare an interest in that feelings groups in mainstream primary schools in South Yorkshire and in special schools are transforming children&#8217;s lives, using resources provided by Books Beyond Words, a charity that I founded and chair.<\/p><p pid=\"a835.0\/15\">CAMH services are needed to help children who are more seriously unwell. There is a move away from in-patient services to services being able to offer intensive community treatment, which I welcome. They need to offer long-term continuity of care, working closely with primary care and all agencies, and to support children at home or close to home. If required, in-patient admissions should be short, focused and timely to help prevent any problems developing further.<\/p><p pid=\"a835.0\/16\">I have been told about a young teenage girl, whom I shall call Emma. She started struggling with her mental health during her transition to secondary school; such a transition is a very difficult time. Her way of coping with difficult feelings was to stop eating. She lost weight rapidly. Despite attempts to treat her at home, she was admitted to a psychiatric ward against her will for refeeding. On the ward, she developed self-harming behaviours, in part influenced by her peers&#8217; self-harming behaviours around her. She was then diagnosed as autistic; it was a late diagnosis.<\/p><p pid=\"a835.0\/17\">After five months, Emma&#8217;s weight improved and an intensive community team agreed to support her within the hospital, including in a small school and a therapy group as well as during her transition back to the community. The community team supported her parents in their fight for her place at school to be restored. She has developed hobbies again and the whole trajectory of her life has been altered. Teams such as this, which can help children and young people with complex needs to recover, must be able to work in a thoughtful and flexible way. It takes commitment and perseverance from the team members, who need to provide powerful advocacy for both the child or young people and their family. Could more have been done to keep Emma at home?<\/p><p pid=\"a835.0\/18\">In my work looking at the reasons for people with learning disabilities and autistic people being detained in long-term segregation and the reasons for delayed discharges, risk aversion in the community seemed to be a key factor. At a round table yesterday, Dr Mezzina, a leading psychiatrist in the acclaimed mental health services in Trieste, Italy, challenged our concept of risk and suggested that institutionalisation is the main risk in mental health services. He questioned why we admit so many children and young people and why we do not have an open-door policy.<\/p><p pid=\"a835.0\/19\">What is the way forward? A number of key initiatives would make a difference, including investing in early years services, developing support hubs for young families and schools-based interventions for at-risk individuals. We also need a robust workforce plan to address serious recruitment and retention issues; that workforce must have competencies in working with children and young people with learning disabilities and autistic children.<\/p><p pid=\"a835.0\/20\">This Monday was World Children&#8217;s Day. The United Nations annual day of action for children, by children, it marks the adoption of the Convention on the Rights  of the Child in 1989 and attends to the social determinants of health and well-being, including poverty. Let us look forward to the day when every child can have a happy childhood, and let us remember that there is no health without mental health.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b642.0\/1\">My Lords, I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Evans: my enthusiasm to reinforce the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Strasburger, who I think made many important points in this debate, got me carried away.<\/p><p pid=\"b642.0\/2\">I am delighted to present the Green Party&#8217;s position on this Bill. I am very aware of the depth of expertise in this debate, but I reinforce the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Strasburger, in reflecting on the narrowness of the contributions and the short time your Lordships&#8217; House has had to absorb this Bill. I note that I am the only female contributor on the  speakers&#8217; list for this debate, which is perhaps one measure of the lack of diversity of views that have been able to participate. I also note that we are talking about further strengthening the Investigatory Powers Act, which, when it was brought in in 2016, was known universally as the snoopers&#8217; charter. Liberty described it as<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b642.0\/3\">&#8220;the most intrusive mass surveillance regime of any democratic country&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b642.0\/4\">Since then, a number of court cases brought by Liberty have brought in some restrictions in terms of the operations of the Act, which I very much applaud, but the Act was also subject to a petition from 130,000 people to speak out against the snoopers&#8217; charter. Of course, the speed at which we are operating now makes it very difficult to get such level of public engagement as we saw in 2016.<\/p><p pid=\"b642.0\/5\">We are talking about a further erosion of privacy and, as many noble Lords have said, this is a question of balance, but we are tilting the balance very clearly with these amendments to the snoopers&#8217; charter. What is particularly worrying is that this Bill is about granting the security services access to bulk data, which will clearly be used to build what are known as artificial intelligence machine learning models. In essence, the Bill lays the foundation for the Government to use rapidly developing artificial intelligence&#8212;so-called; I prefer to call it big data wrangling&#8212;in mass surveillance. Not only does this have huge ethical ramifications, but its adoption in surveillance would be extremely irresponsible, given that we do not know how these technologies are going to evolve in future. We have talked about trying to keep up with where they are, but we are potentially opening the door to let them race ahead much further than we can currently comprehend, as we stand in the House today.<\/p><p pid=\"b642.0\/6\">In other contexts I have drawn to your Lordships&#8217; attention the rapid increase of privatised medical testing and the widespread advertising of it that we have seen. The noble Lord, Lord Fox, referred to genomic data. What is being assembled is a huge amount of intensely private information about individuals, and if that is then to be opened and exposed to the state on a mass, untargeted basis, that surely is cause for grave concern.<\/p><p pid=\"b642.0\/7\">The Bill gives the Government unprecedented powers to monitor and target the entire British population and lays the foundation for use of artificial intelligence in surveillance. This is indiscriminate surveillance. Anyone can be monitored, regardless of whether they are a suspect. This is a complete assault on our right to privacy and raises a real question to ask about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<\/p><p pid=\"b642.0\/8\">Coming down to some of the detail, Clauses 1 to 4 allow for the mass trawling of social media and for the Government to collect data from every person&#8217;s web use, and Clause 14 allows the Government to obtain information from companies around every person&#8217;s web use&#8212;whereas, before, they were able to look only at specific data. In addition, the potential use of artificial intelligence as part of this Bill means that the Government could in theory identify everyone who is behind every single anonymous social media account, meaning that nobody would have anonymity online.<\/p><p pid=\"b642.0\/9\">I am well aware that many people express concerns about anonymity and the behaviour of anonymous accounts online. Here I declare my position as co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hong Kong. I am delighted that the UK has welcomed many exiles from Hong Kong who have sought refuge in the UK, but they remain deeply fearful about the very long arm of the Chinese state. Similarly, we have seen that many Russians have had good cause for concern about the long arm of the Russia state, which, despite the best efforts of our intelligence service, has proved itself capable of reaching within our borders. Anonymity is crucial to some people&#8217;s safety in the world. Lest we think of this as being just about states regarded as hostile by the UK Government, let us all remember the fate of Jamal Khashoggi and the actions of our friend and ally Saudi Arabia in his horrific death.<\/p><p pid=\"b642.0\/10\">The widespread use of surveillance means that this Bill would push the UK further away from what are considered democratic norms. What is more, as a number of other speakers have already said, this blanket surveillance is not necessarily effective. There is a real risk that, the more information you collect, the harder it is to see the needles in the haystack. This Bill erases some of the checks and balances already in place.<\/p><p pid=\"b642.0\/11\">We have seen how far this can go. Again, looking on the international stage&#8212;what China is doing to its Uighur population, what it has done in Tibet, and what is happening in Burma&#8212;these are situations where the more surveillance there is, the more issues arise. If the UK is heading in the wrong direction, what kind of model are we creating on the international stage? The UK likes to present itself as a leader, a model of democracy, speaking up for democracy in international contexts. We must not be a leader in allowing further steps towards autocracy.<\/p><p pid=\"b642.0\/12\">I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, who spoke of how these technologies have often been used in discriminatory ways. We know that the police, certainly, have unfairly singled out people based on their identity, and that has had dangerous, damaging consequences, both in relation to the treatment of individuals and in relation to communities&#8217; views of the police and our security services. If artificial intelligence is added into this mix, we know that there are built-in biases in the way in which the databases have been developed, and that is a real issue.<\/p><p pid=\"b642.0\/13\">We also know&#8212;I declare an interest here&#8212;that the police and security services in the UK have made disproportionate efforts to monitor politically active individuals, trade unionists and whistleblowers. Providing the police and the security services with greater surveillance capacities means that people who are acting democratically in our society could be&#8212;in fact, almost certainly will be&#8212;subjected to further unwarranted surveillance. As a number of other noble Lords have said, the fact that Part 5 of the Bill allows further extension of the Prime Minister&#8217;s powers to approve interception and examination of MPs&#8217; communications is a cause for grave concern.<\/p><p pid=\"b642.0\/14\">To conclude, I will share an experience from the weekend. On Saturday, I was at a protest against the proposed new coal mine in Whitehaven in Cumbria, which is opposed by, among others in your Lordships&#8217; House, the noble Lord, Lord Stern of Brentford. He  made similar points to mine about the messages we are sending to the international community. The slogan was &#8220;No Time for a Coal Mine&#8221;. At that protest, there were 100 or so supporters, and the four of us who were speaking had all advertised this fact on social media beforehand. For nearly all the two and a half hours we were there, flying above us was what I am told was a police drone. There were at this protest of 100 people&#8212;all advertised and entirely peaceful with no plans for direct action&#8212;at least six police officers, one of whom filmed my contribution and all the other contributions. That is the experience of people peacefully protesting within the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"b642.0\/15\">There was another story at the weekend that 15 government departments are monitoring the social media activity of potential critics and compiling files to block them from speaking at public events. This is the experience that people have of the UK state today. We have savage reductions in the right to protest; we have deeply concerning directions of travel, and the Bill is a further step in that direction.<\/p>",

Unfortunately, I have been focused on reading all three volumes of Chips Channon&#8217;s diaries; I have certainly learned a lot about what has gone on in the past in this Chamber.<\/p><p pid=\"b582.0\/3\">I have very firmly fixed in my mind my noble friend Lady Kennedy of The Shaws&#8217;s reference to the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Ahmad, as a &#8220;keeper&#8221;; that is what he is for me.<\/p><p pid=\"b582.0\/4\">As my noble friend Lord McConnell said, the world faces huge challenges with inequality, conflict and climate change. More than ever, we need a strong Britain on the world stage. But this Government have left Britain increasingly disconnected from our closest allies, with a tarnished international reputation and reduced influence in the world.<\/p><p pid=\"b582.0\/5\">I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Wilson of Dinton, that Labour&#8217;s foreign policy will prioritise reconnecting Britain for security and prosperity at home&#8212;a confident country, outside the EU but a leader in Europe once again. We will be a reliable partner, a dependable ally in NATO, a leader in development and at the vanguard of climate action. We will drive forward the industries of the future for Britain. With the right priorities, the right partnerships and the right values, Britain can and will thrive.<\/p><p pid=\"b582.0\/6\">I turn to the Middle East. I have talked before in the Chamber about the horrors that Hamas committed. I have not seen the films, but I have spoken to the families of people affected. Not only do they have the horror of knowing that their relatives are hostages,  but those relatives have had their families murdered, and that has to be at the top of our mind when we consider this issue.<\/p><p pid=\"b582.0\/7\">We all have to be determined to hold those people who committed these horrors to account. They cannot be allowed to get away with it. However, we also have to consider the impact in Gaza. We have heard that more than 11,000 Palestinians have reportedly been killed, and every one of those lives mattered. Two-thirds of the dead are women and children. As the noble Lord, Lord Purvis, said, neither should we forget the UN workers and humanitarian workers who have suffered the same fate. These deaths are shocking and cannot be ignored. The desperate reports from hospitals in northern Gaza, short of fuel and filled with civilians seeking shelter, are truly shocking. All parties must follow international law, acting with necessity, distinction, proportionality and precaution.<\/p><p pid=\"b582.0\/8\">Labour supports the independence of the International Criminal Court and recognises its jurisdiction to address the conduct of all parties in Gaza. In the Statement to the other place on Tuesday, which we have not considered but I hope we will cover in this debate, Andrew Mitchell said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b582.0\/9\">&#8220;It is not for Ministers to seek to state where the ICC has jurisdiction; that is for the chief prosecutor. The chief prosecutor has not been silent on this matter, and I am sure he will continue to express his views&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b582.0\/10\">In response to my right honourable friend David Lammy, who sought clarification on the Government&#8217;s position, he said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b582.0\/11\">&#8220;It is not for me to fetter or speak in the place of its chief prosecutor&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Commons, 14\/11\/23; cols. 511-13.]<\/p><p pid=\"b582.0\/12\">For the sake of clarity, I hope that tonight the noble Lord, Lord Ahmad, will confirm very clearly that the UK Government recognise the ICC&#8217;s jurisdiction to address the conduct of all parties in Gaza. Previous Prime Ministers have put that in doubt.<\/p><p pid=\"b582.0\/13\">Gazans need aid now&#8212;medicine, water and fuel. A full, comprehensive and immediate humanitarian pause in the fighting across the whole of Gaza is now necessary to alleviate Palestinian suffering and for Hamas terrorists to release the hostages. The noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, is right: Hamas&#8217;s stated aim is to wipe Israel off the map, it committed the most brutal attack on Jews since the Holocaust, and now it is using innocent Palestinians as human shields.<\/p><p pid=\"b582.0\/14\">We must not give up on the narrow openings that keep the prospect of peace alive. That means preventing escalation; condemning violence from settlers in the West Bank, which I personally witnessed in May and has continued at pace; condemning rocket attacks on Israel from Iran&#8217;s proxies in Lebanon and elsewhere; and creating a future where Gaza is not subject to occupation.<\/p><p pid=\"b582.0\/15\">Meanwhile, international diplomacy evolves and the facts on the ground are changing day by day, in relation to both hostages being rescued and Hamas&#8217;s capability to carry out attacks like we saw on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">7 October<\/phrase>. We must move to a full cessation of fighting as quickly as possible. The reality is that neither the long-term security of Israel nor long-term justice for Palestine   can be delivered by bombs and bullets. We must seek a path to a political process that leads to two states: a secure Israel and an independent Palestine.<\/p><p pid=\"b582.0\/16\">On defence, the gracious Speech says that the UK<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b582.0\/17\">&#8220;will continue to champion security around the world, to invest in our gallant Armed Forces and to support veterans to whom so much is owed&#8221;&#8212;<\/p><p pid=\"b582.0\/18\">who can disagree? The first duty of any Government is of course to keep our country safe. Labour&#8217;s commitment to NATO is unshakeable, and we will continue to steadfastly support military, economic and diplomatic support for Ukraine for as long as it takes. By fulfilling our NATO obligations in full and renewing the nation&#8217;s moral contract with our Armed Forces, only Labour will secure Britain&#8217;s defences for the future. As my noble friends Lord Coaker and Lord Tunnicliffe, who are with me on the Front Bench, said, the Government have hollowed out our Armed Forces since 2010, and they have cut the British Army to its smallest size since Napoleon. We need to ensure that we have those troops back on the payroll and ensure that we return their morale to make sure that they are fighting fit.<\/p><p pid=\"b582.0\/19\">On Ukraine, I reassure everyone that, although there may be a change of Government next year, there will be no change in Britain&#8217;s resolve to stand with Ukraine, confront Russian aggression and pursue Putin for his war crimes. One thing that was missing from the gracious Speech&#8212;given the Motion that was passed unanimously by the other place&#8212;was the need for legislation on the seizure of Russian state assets to repurpose them for the reconstruction of Ukraine. I hope the Minister will be able to reassure us tonight that that legislation will be placed. Not only do we have to make those responsible for this war accountable; we have to make sure that they pay for the reconstruction. We must continue to stand with Ukraine in every aspect that it needs, as my noble friend Lord Adonis said, until it is victorious over Russia in defence of its own territory.<\/p><p pid=\"b582.0\/20\">On China and the Indo-Pacific, the noble Earl repeated the Government&#8217;s policy on China through their interrelated strands of &#8220;protect, align and engage&#8221;. Of course, the Intelligence and Security Committee report described the UK&#8217;s approach to China as &#8220;completely inadequate&#8221; and said that Britain was &#8220;severely handicapped&#8221; in managing future security risks. I assure noble Lords that, in government, Labour will carry out a complete audit of UK-China relations so that we can ensure that the relationship reflects our interests and values and that we can set a consistent strategy for the long term, ensuring that everyone&#8212;business, civil society and Governments&#8212;fully understands our intentions.<\/p><p pid=\"b582.0\/21\">The noble Baroness, Lady D&#8217;Souza, and the noble Lord, Lord Stevens, were absolutely right to raise the issues around the Taiwan Strait. We want to see a dialogue and peaceful moves to address those issues. We have been clear about our serious concern about China&#8217;s increasingly aggressive actions towards Taiwan and the attempts to intimidate its democratic leaders. Of course, it is important to avoid accidents and miscalculations that raise tension or risk escalation, but these are part of a wider pattern of China becoming more assertive, as we have seen in its actions in Hong  Kong and the South China Sea. We have spoken about the repression in Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet, and I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Alton, that it is simply wrong and outrageous that China has brought sanctions against UK parliamentarians for raising these concerns.<\/p><p pid=\"b582.0\/22\">I want to conclude by referring to our new Foreign Secretary, the future Lord Cameron. I have on many occasions praised him for one vital legacy of his foreign policy&#8212;the way in which he followed on the leadership of Gordon Brown on the millennium development goals, ensuring that the international community focused on the sustainable development goals. Of course, in September, the UN Secretary-General called for a global SDG rescue plan to be met with a co-ordinated response&#8212;I hope from the United Kingdom, our international partners, civil society and business. I hope that the future Lord Cameron will be absolutely focused&#8212;and I shall certainly be focused on holding him to account.<\/p><p pid=\"b582.0\/23\">One issue that I have been particularly concerned about is nutrition. Nutrition financing has been disproportionately impacted by cuts to UK ODA, and there remains a major gender gap on nutrition spending. Some 149.2 million children under five years of age are stunted; 45 million are wasted and nearly 40 million are overweight. More than 1 billion women are experiencing at least one form of malnutrition. By 2050, climate change is predicted to increase the risk of hunger and malnutrition by 20%; 45% of deaths in children under the age of five are linked to malnutrition. This requires action, and on these challenges, while we are at the halfway point of the SDGs, we have a long way to go to meet them. Nutrition is pivotal to achieving SDG 2 on zero hunger, but it also underpins other goals related to health, education, peace, gender equality and poverty. Good nutrition means stronger immune systems and safer pregnancy and childbirth.<\/p><p pid=\"b582.0\/24\">Next week, as my noble friend mentioned, sees the publication of the Government&#8217;s White Paper on international development at the global food security summit, which I am very pleased to have been invited to and I shall be attending. The summit gives us the chance to put malnutrition back on the global agenda and ensure that the United Kingdom remains in its leadership role. Again, I shall make sure that the future Lord Cameron not only takes that leadership responsibility seriously but delivers on it and on the SDGs.<\/p>",

It is wasting our time and wasting our money.<\/p><p>It is wasting our money on producing the papers and on all the civil servants who are preparing the papers, and it is wasting our money on the minister&#8217;s salary. I like the minister and I enjoy debating with him, but I am afraid that he is in the wrong job. Imagine if he could deploy his talents on something more useful than a project that is not going to happen&#8212;namely, independence. What a pity that we are spending our afternoon on the issue.<\/p><p>Let me agree with some things that the minister said. I agree on the value that immigration can bring. If immigration is properly controlled and managed, it can bring great value to a country. We have a proud history of welcoming immigrants into Scotland. We had waves of immigration in the 19th century from Ireland, and in the early 20th century members of the Jewish population came from eastern Europe. We had immigrants from Italy, we saw immigrants from the new commonwealth, from Pakistan and Bangladesh, and we had Hong Kong Chinese. More recently, members of the Polish community came here and, much more recently, we had people from Ukraine coming here, being welcomed and enriching our society both economically and culturally. That has been a positive for Scotland.<\/p><p>However, we still have skills shortages&#8212;members who made that point are absolutely right. In sectors across Scotland, whether it is hospitality, the care sector or agriculture, there are issues with skills shortages. That is not unique to Scotland or the UK. Just this morning, I had a meeting with the new German consul general for Scotland. She was telling me that, in Berlin, where she has just been, there are bars and restaurants that are open only for a limited number of days per week because they cannot get the staff. That is not a consequence of Brexit, clearly, and it is the same in other European countries. We are all facing these challenges. As Alexander Stewart said&#8212;fairly, I think&#8212;all western economies are facing challenges around skills shortages. Simply to say that it is an issue of immigration policy alone is to see a very narrow part of the picture.<\/p><p>Let me tackle the key proposition&#8212;the basis of what we have heard from the minister and the Scottish National Party benches&#8212;which is that UK immigration policy is holding Scotland back.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b134.0\/1\">My Lords, I start by joining the House in saying how sorry I was to hear the news about the noble and learned Lord, Lord Judge. I always found him very patient with me, very erudite, very helpful and welcoming, and, most importantly, very witty; I will miss him. I compliment the maiden speeches of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Burnett of Maldon, and my noble friends Lord Houchen of High Leven and Lord Bailey of Paddington. My noble friend Lord Houchen is a walking embodiment of devolution, and my noble friend Lord Bailey&#8217;s speech was inspirational and a reminder of the virtues of community. Many congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Beith, on his 50 years in Parliament. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Hacking, for his generous personal remarks about me and my Front-Bench colleague; and I agree with every word that my noble friend Lord Strathclyde said.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/2\">It is a very great honour to represent the Government in closing this debate on His Majesty&#8217;s most gracious Speech. I will endeavour to respond to all the various contributions, while noting that it has, as ever, been a fulsome and insightful discussion spanning various policies, Bills and departments. First, I will make the general point that the legislative agenda we are debating is at its core about delivering a safe, strong and prosperous  United Kingdom. This is not shadow boxing, as alleged by the noble Baroness, Lady Taylor. Much has already been achieved, but we have to build on that and progress.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/3\">I note that the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, in his opening remarks, berated the Government for the things he claims we are not doing. I would argue that we are doing them all, and I will go into some detail on that. Obviously, the criminal justice Bill delivers on a number of measures, and it is perhaps worth starting with shoplifting, which came up several times. It was raised by the noble Lords, Lord Ponsonby, Lord Blunkett and Lord Hogan-Howe, and my noble friends Lord Borwick and Lady Bray, and it is a very important subject that deserves a mention. I wonder if noble Lords perhaps missed that on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">23 October<\/phrase>, the National Police Chiefs&#8217; Council published the Retail Crime Action Plan. That sets out a much greater police focus on retail crime, which includes shoplifting and violence towards retail workers. The action plan makes a police commitment to prioritise attendance at the scene where violence has been used or an offender has been detained by store security, and where evidence needs to be secured promptly and can only be done by police personnel.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/4\">On the same day, we also launched Pegasus, a unique partnership between police and retailers to tackle serious organised retail crime. It has been set up by the Sussex police and crime commissioner Katy Bourne, with funding from 13 national retailers, National Business Crime Solution and the Home Office. The retailers will provide data, intelligence and evidence to Opal, the national police intelligence unit on organised and acquisitive crime. That is intended to develop a better strategic picture and help forces to crack down on serious offenders.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/5\">The Government are very clear that violent and abusive behaviour towards any worker, particularly those who provide a valuable service to the public, is never acceptable. We took a significant step by introducing a statutory aggravating factor for assault against those who are serving the public, via the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, so at this point the Government do not intend to introduce further legislation such as the specific offence of assaulting a retail worker. We are clear that reducing violence and abuse cannot be achieved through legislation alone, so we intend to continue to work with members of the National Retail Crime Steering Group to reduce violence and abuse through our wider work.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/6\">Obviously, none of this works unless, as the noble Lord, Lord Hogan-Howe, pointed out, we also concentrate on reasonable lines of inquiry, which have been much in the news of late. The principle of pursuing all reasonable lines of inquiry is enshrined in the code of practice to the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996. In reality, it has not happened as much as it should. On crime and investigation, 42 of 43 forces received at least one area for improvement. On responding to the public, no force is rated &#8220;outstanding&#8221; and only 19% are assessed as &#8220;good&#8221;. The College of Policing has published new investigations guidelines and authorised professional practice to underpin a commitment to sorting this out. His Majesty&#8217;s Inspectorate will use its existing inspections framework to assess whether forces are following the college&#8217;s updated guidance. We should  acknowledge that there are already forces that are making significant commitments and delivering improvements, for example in Greater Manchester. They have made significant changes to the service they provide to the public, including an impressive 44% year-on-year increase in the number of charges recorded by the force, from nearly 19,000 to nearly 27,000.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/7\">Another subject that aroused a great deal of commentary, including from the noble Lords, Lord Ponsonby, Lord Dubs and Lord Dholakia, the noble Baronesses, Lady Chakrabarti, Lady Miller and Lady Jones, my noble friends Lord Patten, Lord Hunt and Lord Bourne, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee&#8212;I did listen carefully to the points that she was making&#8212;was to do with rough sleeping and begging. I will be clear: the Government want to ensure that vulnerable individuals on the street are directed to the appropriate support, while ensuring that police and local authorities can respond effectively to begging and rough sleeping and keeping communities safe. That is why we have introduced new tools to help direct individuals to engage with positive pathways, including accommodation, mental health support and substance misuse support, so that individuals who may have turned away help before can access the appropriate support they need.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/8\">That is backed by over &#163;2 billion over three years, because the Government have also made the unprecedented commitment to end rough sleeping within this Parliament, and to fully enforce the Homelessness Reduction Act. We have already embarked on a strategy to shift the focus to prevention and move vulnerable individuals into multiagency support. Any further details on future legislation will be set out in due course and, if a person is genuinely destitute and not causing any harm, we should be very clear: they will not be committing any offence.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/9\">The noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, raised the subject of fraud, and he was quite right to do so, but he neglected of course to mention that we published a fraud strategy earlier this year. There is considerable work going into the tackling of fraud, and it needs considerable work. The criminal justice Bill, for example, contains a ban on SIM farms, which, as noble Lords will be aware, are one of the facilitating factors in much of the fraud that is perpetrated in this country. The fraud strategy goes a long way and sets out an ambitious and radical plan for how government, law enforcement, regulators, industry and charities have to work together to tackle fraud. It just does not work unless it is a multiagency approach. I could go on, but we have talked about fraud a great deal from this Dispatch Box and I appreciate that time is limited, so I shall move on.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/10\">The noble Lord, Lord Hogan-Howe, asked me about a firearms review. It was a very good question, because it is vital that the public and officers have clarity and confidence in the investigatory systems in relation to police use of force, police driving and so on. That obviously includes the efficacy of investigations. That is why we announced the review, to which he referred, of the current framework and processes that are in place. The review, announced by the Home Secretary, will ensure that the legal and operational frameworks within which officers operate when using force and driving in the line of duty are robust and  command the confidence of both officers and the public. That is due to report to Ministers by the end of this year.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/11\">The noble Lord, Lord Hogan-Howe, and my noble friend Lord Borwick both raised the subject of facial recognition. We believe that facial recognition technology is an increasingly important capability for law enforcement and it is already being used in a number of ways within UK policing and security settings to prevent and detect crime, enhance security, find wanted criminals, safeguard the vulnerable and protect people from harm. The use of facial recognition technologies is at varying stages across UK policing and it is a priority for the Home Office to ensure that technology is being used in an ethical and effective way. That is all I will say about that subject at the moment, but I have absolutely no doubt that is a subject to which we will return in very short order.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/12\">A number of speakers, including the noble Lords, Lord Ponsonby and Lord Beith, mentioned small boat arrivals and the effectiveness of the Illegal Migration Act. The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, will appreciate that I cannot speculate on the ongoing court case, but I can note&#8212;which I think no one else noted&#8212;that there have been a number of newspaper stories recently about how many of our European friends and allies are looking at similar schemes. It will be interesting to see how they turn out.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/13\">What I can give are some interesting statistics. In terms of arrivals, there were just over 26,500 in 2023, up to <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">31 October<\/phrase>; that compares to 45,755 in total in 2022. In terms of crossing attempts, 22,000 were prevented in 2023. In terms of the mix of the sorts of people who were attempting to make a crossing, I note that, interestingly enough, because of the returns agreement with Albania, the Albanians have dropped off the list entirely. In terms of our partnership with the French, the joint intel centre activity since July 2020 has dismantled 82 organised crime groups linked to small boats; in 2022 alone, they arrested approximately 400 people smugglers. So the fact is that there is a good deal going on, and it is proving effective, but, obviously, there is a lot still to resolve, particularly after the courts have given their decision. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Beith, that of course we need legal and controlled migration, but I remind noble Lords that these people have arrived illegally and, in doing so, are being facilitated in arriving here by serious and organised criminal gangs.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/14\">I would like to thank those people who want to come and contribute to our great country, but, obviously, only if they do so legally. This is a generous, open and welcoming country, and I can give the statistics on why I think that. Over the last year&#8212;the year ending June 2023&#8212;of the 538,887 visas granted for work, 69,421 were for skilled work and 121,290 were for health and care. In addition, there were 498,626 study visas. As of <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">24 October 2023<\/phrase>, 243,700 Ukrainian visas had been granted. I am particularly delighted that 123,800 people have arrived in the UK since the Hong Kong BN(O) visa scheme route was initiated. If I may take a personal moment, I commend the Hong Kong Military Service Corps, whom we have talked about before, who were in the Gallery earlier watching some of this debate. As noble Lords will know, they will also be able to arrive.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/15\">However, we should also acknowledge, as we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Green of Deddington, that this is not simply a debate about numbers; there are a large number of other factors that go into migration, and it behoves us all to be extraordinarily careful about how we use language. My noble friend Lord Bourne made some very good points about the international dimension and the changing nature of the drivers of illegal immigration, and I am quite sure that he is right that it needs to be raised in multinational organisations.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/16\">On the asylum backlog, provisional data now shows that we have doubled the number of backlog decision-makers in post, so we are on track to clear the legacy asylum backlog by the end of this year. Of course, the history of this has been unfortunate, and it has perhaps not been done as quickly as we would all have liked, but the fact is that we are getting to grips with it and it will be dealt with very soon.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/17\">I turn now to the sentencing Bill, which seemed to attract a vast number of very differing opinions, including from the noble Lords, Lord Hastings, Lord Dholakia, Lord Hogan-Howe, Lord German, Lord Beith, Lord Macdonald of River Glaven, Lord German, Lord Blunkett and Lord Marks, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Chakrabarti and Lady Jones&#8212;I am sorry if I have missed anybody. The Government are planning to make sure that the prison estate is used to lock up dangerous criminals for longer, without further criminalising redeemable offenders by trapping them in a merry-go-round of reoffending. The most dangerous prisoners are guaranteed to be behind bars for longer, but we need to go further to keep the public safe. For the worst murderers, the only proper penalty is life imprisonment without the possibility of release by the Parole Board. We will ensure that, in these most serious cases, life will really mean life. Further, we will ensure that those who commit rape and other serious sexual offences will spend every day of their sentence behind bars and face the consequences of their actions. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Hastings, that it is the crimes that are nasty, not the sentences.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/18\">However, delivering public protection and cutting crime is not just about custody, as has been noted by most of the speakers. There is persuasive evidence that suspended and community sentences are, in certain circumstances, much more effective than short custodial sentences in reducing reoffending and aiding rehabilitation. In these cases, short prison sentences may even trap an offender in a revolving door of reoffending, cutting them off from work, housing and family and further criminalising them with each spell inside. So, the Government have decided to grasp the nettle and make a long-term decision that previous Governments have ducked by legislating for a presumption that sentences of less than 12 months in prison should be suspended. Home detention curfew enables eligible suitable offenders to be released early from prison on strict licence conditions, so that they can begin reintegrating into the community sooner. We will also therefore seek to extend eligibility to suitable risk-assessed offenders, so they can get a head start on reintegrating with the community and breaking free from the cycle of reoffending. I certainly hope that the House would back all those proposals.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/19\">A number of noble Lords have raised the subject of violence against women and girls, including the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, and the noble Baroness, Lady Chakrabarti. I have talked from the Dispatch Box before about the drive to operate consistently across the nation. Operation Soteria, which I have also mentioned, has developed new nationally operating models for the investigation and prosecution of rape, which all forces in CPS areas in England and Wales are implementing to ensure that the investigations of rape are suspect-focused and considerate to the needs of victims. We know that women and girls are more likely to be victims of crimes that fall under the umbrella of VAWG. The most recent statistics show that 26.5% of women have been victims of sexual assault or attempted sexual assault since the age of 16, compared to 6.1% of men. Domestic abuse alone is high volume: it affects 2.4 million adults every year. It is high harm&#8212;one in five homicides is a domestic homicide, and we have referred to the sentencing measures we will be taking there&#8212;and very high cost. The social and economic cost of domestic abuse is estimated to be some &#163;81 billion, at 2023-24 prices, over a three-year average period for abuse. We need to do more about prosecuting rape and to do more in this space; the numbers underline the importance of that. To try to make a political point that we have not been doing anything would be very wide of the mark.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/20\">I welcome the broad support for the victims Bill and thank noble Lords for it. In particular, I welcome back my noble friend Lady Newlove and thank her very much for her support. I hope my noble friend Lady Bray is right that this will help victims with closure. We believe that supporting victims by restoring trust, punishing offenders who commit very heinous crimes and ensuring that the public always have confidence in the criminal justice system are essential. The Victims and Prisoners Bill will improve victims&#8217; experience of the criminal justice system and restore confidence. As noble Lords are aware, there are a large number of items associated with this, the principle of course being that this is to support victims of crime to address the long-term challenge of victim confidence in the criminal justice system by transforming their experience from the moment a crime happens.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/21\">The noble Baroness, Lady Brinton, asked about stalking, and the noble Baroness, Lady Taylor, made a similar point. It is important to mention that stalking is a criminal offence. The definition of a victim in the Victims and Prisoners Bill is<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b134.0\/22\">&#8220;a victim of criminal conduct&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/23\">so victims of stalking are included in the definition. I appreciate that that is a bit convoluted, but it is taken care of to some extent.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/24\">The noble Lord, Lord Marks, asked about the Bill placing a duty on both criminal justice bodies and the police and crime commissioners. They have to keep compliance with the code under review. At the local level, police and crime commissioners will be under a duty to review criminal justice bodies&#8217; compliance with the code. At the national level, new oversight will bring together senior voices across the criminal justice system to consider how to drive improvement on the delivery of the code.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/25\">The subject of parole was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Marks, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, and my noble friend Lord Bourne. Public confidence has fallen following a number of high-profile parole board decisions to release serious offenders, but the Bill will enshrine public protection as the only factor in release decisions and introduce greater ministerial scrutiny to the release of the most serious offenders. These reforms will help to restore public confidence in the system and ensure that dangerous offenders are not released on to our streets.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/26\">My noble friend Lady Bray and the noble Baroness, Lady O&#8217;Loan, asked what discussions and engagement His Majesty&#8217;s Government have had with the judiciary on the measure to compel offenders to attend their sentence hearings. This was also referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Meston; I welcome his reappearance in the House. We engaged with the judiciary on the proposal to compel offenders to attend their sentencing hearing ahead of the announcements in August, but obviously we will continue to engage with the judiciary where appropriate, including on the implementation of the measures. I appreciate the points that noble Lords have made about the potential difficulties of that in certain circumstances.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/27\">I turn to the subject of Martyn&#8217;s law, which was referenced by the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, and my noble friends Lord Hunt and Lord Bourne. Martyn&#8217;s law seeks to enhance public safety by ensuring better preparedness for and protection from terrorist attacks. The Government carefully considered the scope of the requirements, including the impact on premises captured. It is reasonable that many locations should take appropriate, reasonably practicable measures to protect their staff from the horrific impacts of terrorism. Collaboration has been the cornerstone of the process. Pre-legislative scrutiny raised some important considerations regarding the standard tier requirements, which is why we will launch a consultation on the standard tier to ensure that the Bill&#8217;s measures strike the right balance between public protection and avoiding an undue burden on smaller premises; that consultation will be launched in due course. There is no intention to kick this into the long grass. We have heard from all of the various stakeholders in this. It is clearly a Bill that we need to see, but we have to do it in the right way. It is not negligence; it is about making sure that the law will work appropriately.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/28\">A variety of other matters were raised. I will start with the thorny subject of conversion therapy, which was mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Brinton. We are considering this issue carefully. I am afraid that I must disagree with the noble Baroness; I think it is a very complex issue. We will set out further details on it in due course. The priority is to tackle this issue in ways that are effective and avoid unintended consequences, particularly those that might affect young or vulnerable people. It is about taking time to fully consider the consultation responses and how best to reflect parents&#8217; roles and interests in the importance of legitimate clinical work.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/29\">Moving on to the criminal justice system, the Government will always make sure that the prison estate is used to lock up dangerous criminals, of course.  More offenders are in custody now than ever before, as has been mentioned. However, delivering public protection and cutting crime are not just about custody; as I have said, there is persuasive evidence that suspended and community sentences are more effective in certain circumstances. We remain committed to reducing the case load and speeding up justice, including by extending the use of 24 Nightingale courts. We are also opening two permanent super-courtrooms in Manchester and Loughborough.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/30\">My noble friend Lord Bourne asked about the new additions to the prison estate. I can give him the number: 8,000 are due to be delivered by 2025. A number of prisons are opening over the next two or three years, and that will add up to that particular number. I will not go into the details of precisely where.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/31\">The noble Baroness, Lady Benjamin, asked about racism in the police and legal system. I thank her for raising these important issues. On the specific issue of racism in prisons, the Prisons Strategy White Paper sets out our vision for prisons of the future, which includes ambitious plans to make prisons safer for staff and prisoners. As regards a meeting, I cannot commit my noble friends to meeting the noble Baroness but I can pass on her request to the MoJ, DHSC and the Department for Education and encourage them to meet; I will happily do so.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/32\">A number of noble Lords raised the subject of devolution. The noble Earl, Lord Kinnoull, the noble Lord, Lord Stunell, and my noble friends Lord Wharton and Lord Houchen gave good examples of the subject in action, if you will. It covers a number of different departments in Whitehall and various policy areas. I cannot possibly respond to all the specific questions that were asked but I will defer to the relevant colleagues in other government departments to respond in writing on unaddressed points.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/33\">In answer to my noble friend Lord Norton, the Prime Minister is, as he has noted, the Minister for the Union, and the Secretary of State for DLUHC is the Minister for Intergovernmental Relations, leading the work with territorial offices and territorial office Secretaries of State, who represent the distinctive voices and interests of people in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland across Whitehall and in Cabinet, representing the Government in each of their nations and co-ordinating the Government&#8217;s work with the devolved Administrations to support all citizens of the UK. Specifically, in delivering our security, criminal justice and border responsibilities, the Home Office plays an important part in navigating a combination of reserved and devolved matters on a UK-wide footprint. That is why, on devolved matters such as policing in Scotland and Northern Ireland, it is right and proper that the UK Government are an active influencer to ensure a coherent and UK-wide approach.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/34\">The noble Lord, Lord Stunell, and the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of York both raised the subject of transport and HS2. I thank them for their comments but will pass those comments on to the Department for Transport, which will be speaking in this Chamber on that matter on Monday.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/35\">My noble friend Lord Caine supplied very detailed answers to the noble Lords, Lord Bew and Lord Browne of Belmont, regarding the Northern Ireland devolution  settlement. They are rather too long to go into at this precise moment, but I will ask him to commit this to paper and send it to the noble Lords. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Bryan of Partick, that we are confident that the Illegal Migration Act does not impact the devolution settlement and is consistent with our international legal obligations.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/36\">I will digress briefly into the Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill, which was raised by the most reverend Primate and the noble Baroness, Lady Jones. I want to refer to one piece of data that was published by the Climate Change Committee. It shows that the UK will continue to rely on oil and gas to help meet its energy needs, even after the UK reaches net zero in 2050. This will include the use of gas for power generation with carbon usage and storage. I am not a net-zero or climate change sceptic; I would much prefer that we did not burn carbon. But I would also prefer that people did not suffer when it is cold. I would also prefer that we do not lose power or run out of power, and I would have hoped that both noble Lords would have reflected on their comments and also thought a little about our security when it comes to supply, and the sorts of people that we would be handing our money over to in order to keep our oil flowing.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/37\">Moving on to more topical matters such as the Israel and Hamas conflict, I particularly thank the noble Lord, Lord Hogan-Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Paddick&#8212;whom I congratulate on his new role with the Metropolitan Police&#8212;for their acute perspective on the difficulties of policing marches of this type. I restate that the police in this country are operationally independent and obviously should remain so. However, a number of very unfortunate issues have arisen, in particular around anti-Semitism and, perhaps to a slightly lesser extent but no less importantly, Islamophobia. Anti-Semitism has absolutely no place in our society. That is why we are committed to tackling it in all its forms. The police should take the toughest possible action against any form of anti-Semitism. It is important that the police and the Jewish community continue to work together to ensure security and promote community cohesion. Saying that does not infringe their operational independence. They must also, as I have said, police Islamophobia as and where they find it.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/38\">I have said on a number of occasions from this Dispatch Box that any arrests are very much an operational matter for the police. There have been about 30 arrests in London at protests related to the Israel-Hamas conflict, including racially aggravated public order offences. The Metropolitan Police Service has also made arrests not directly linked to protest activity and there have been arrests elsewhere in the country. It would be unwise to say too much more than that, but once again I thank both noble Lords with a policing background for their acute perspective on this.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/39\">While we respect the police&#8217;s operational independence, as a number of noble Lords pointed out we must also have trust and confidence in the police. The noble Baronesses, Lady Taylor and Lady Henig, made this point: the police have a lot of power. By the way, there are more of them; there are more police on our streets than ever before. The fact is that a number of changes  have been made, and again we have discussed those from this Dispatch Box on a number of occasions. They include those around the police dismissals review, which I will not go into again, and those to do with vetting. The noble Baroness, Lady O&#8217;Loan, made some very good points about this, and I agree that the Government must be determined to resolve the situation around vetting or re-vetting procedures.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/40\">The duty of candour to which the noble Baroness, Lady O&#8217;Loan, referred has not been introduced, but the duty to co-operate already provides clarity on the responsibilities for individual officers. This was introduced in 2020, since the issue was highlighted in Bishop James Jones&#8217;s 2017 report into the experiences of the Hillsborough families. We are keen that this duty becomes rooted within the police workforce before considering any further changes to legislation, but an organisational duty of candour aimed at chief officers, requiring them to ensure an ethical culture in the forces they lead, will complement the existing requirements on individual officers.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/41\">I will just tie up a few loose ends, if I may. My noble friend Lord Farmer made some extraordinarily good points about the family. I will not respond to them now but will make sure that they are reflected on by the Government.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/42\">We have covered a large amount of ground and I have done my best to respond accordingly. I have no doubt that there will be further debates to come and  I look forward to those discussions, but I finish by emphasising that the decent, hard-working and law-abiding majority are our chief concern. We have devised a legislative agenda which puts their interests first and will make our country safer and stronger. That is why we will be advancing our programme with confidence and energy in the weeks and months ahead.<\/p><p pid=\"b134.0\/43\">Finally, I offer my thanks to all who have contributed to this debate. These are vital issues and the considerable expertise&#8212;<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b332.4\/1\">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Hosie, and I congratulate <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Matthew Hancock\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24773\">the right hon. Member for West Suffolk (Matt Hancock)<\/phrase> on securing this important debate. I refer to my entry in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests. Indeed, just a few weeks ago, I attended Donny races along with many others from Barnsley, South Yorkshire and across the country.<\/p><p pid=\"b332.4\/2\">Horseracing is our country&#8217;s second largest sport&#8212;second only to football. Each year, races attract over 5 million spectators across the country, but it is not just people who attend the races that benefit from the sport. Horseracing supports 80,000 jobs and generates more than &#163;4 billion a year for the country, giving it a wider economic importance, as <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jerome Mayhew\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25904\">the hon. Member for Broadland (Jerome Mayhew)<\/phrase> and many others said. That is without mentioning the impact the industry has in generating a positive view of our country across the world, with events like Royal Ascot attracting international competitors and spectators. With that in mind, the future of racing must be protected for generations to come.<\/p><p pid=\"b332.4\/3\">In recent years, however, horseracing has been at risk of decline. Further to the pandemic, which cost millions in lost revenue, trainers are now also bearing the brunt of the cost of living crisis. That has impacted everything from the price of feed to the cost of transportation, but British horseracing was facing serious concerns even before these challenges. The UK has experienced a drop in the percentage of grade 1 races that it holds, as well as a crisis in equine talent moving abroad.<\/p><p pid=\"b332.4\/4\">One of the underlying causes of the decline is the level of prize money available to British competitions. Despite reaching record highs in 2022, British prize  levels are still significantly lower than rival competitions in France, Ireland, the USA, Australia, Japan and Hong Kong, as <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Laurence Robertson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10505\">the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr Robertson)<\/phrase> mentioned. A poor prize pot means poor incentives for everyone in the racing industry&#8212;from owners to spectators&#8212;to compete and take an interest in British competition.<\/p><p pid=\"b332.4\/5\">The racing industry has gone to great efforts to prevent decline and to see the sport grow. For example, as part of their new long-term industry strategy, the BHA has worked hard to secure a boost to prize funds and to publish a 2024 fixture list that includes 170 premier race days. Likewise, the betting industry has continued to foster its relationship with racing, including spending &#163;125 million on marketing to promote racing. Despite that, more must still be done to ensure the future of British racing. For many, that change will start with the horserace betting levy.<\/p><p pid=\"b332.4\/6\">Currently, the horserace betting levy is funded directly by bookmakers at a fixed rate of 10% of the gross profit made on British horseraces. Since its introduction, the levy has delivered around &#163;80 million to &#163;100 million of funding annually for the sport&#8212;a level that has been maintained in recent years despite declining turnover. Compared with other countries, however, the overall percentage of return that racing receives from the betting industry is on the low end of the scale at 3%. It is welcome, therefore, that the Government have committed to reviewing the levy to ensure that it delivers an appropriate level of funding for the sector. That review must answer the many questions being asked about the levy&#8217;s current structure.<\/p><p pid=\"b332.4\/7\">I ask the Minister for a clear update on the progress of the review, including whether the Department has made any judgment on whether the levy should be raised, linked to inflation or adjusted to cover all bets by British customers, including those on international races. It is essential that the review looks to protect racing and its relationship with the gambling sector in the round. In that vein, I also ask the Minister for an update on what the Department is doing to ensure that money paid by gambling firms for racing media rights is actually benefiting the sport. For example, what meetings has the Minister had specifically with media rights companies to ensure that money is moving from betting to racing in a way that positively impacts the sport?<\/p><p pid=\"b332.4\/8\">Concern has also been raised about the impact of the gambling White Paper and particularly&#8212;as has been mentioned a number of times in the debate&#8212;affordability checks on horseracing. Although I have only recently been appointed as the shadow Minister with responsibility for gambling, I have already met a number of charities and organisations that work to prevent gambling harms, providing a range of treatment, education and advice. Although there is, of course, a spectrum of gambling harm, I have seen at first hand that gambling addiction can have a devastating impact on the lives of individuals and their families. It is therefore important that gambling regulation is updated. Indeed, the last Gambling Act was introduced back in 2005, long before the huge growth in online and mobile gambling opportunities. An update to that is well overdue, and the Government must waste no further time in introducing a modern system of gambling regulation that is fit for the future.  Affordability checks will form an important part of that and must be set independently, rather than by the industry. These checks must be accompanied by online stake limits, data sharing between gambling firms and a crackdown on black market activity funded through the regulator.<\/p><p pid=\"b332.4\/9\">However, as well as ensuring that the law protects children and adults vulnerable to gambling harms, it is important to ensure that the regulation recognises that millions of people enjoy betting safely and without harm. The Government must therefore be very clear on how they will go about ensuring that affordability checks are frictionless for consumers, as they have promised. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Philip Davies\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11816\">The hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)<\/phrase> used the word &#8220;proportionate&#8221;, which I think is a good one. That is important for the sustainability of the gambling industry, which we know racing relies upon, and for ensuring that customers are not incentivised to leave the regulated market and turn to the black market. The safety of racehorses is also fundamental.<\/p>",

We can find inspiration in the words of empathetic leaders who have comprehended the gravity of this situation. One particular speech by Barack Obama comes to mind in which he eloquently articulated the need for hope and respect for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank without resorting to aggression, but rather with a sincere call for empathy and understanding.<\/p><p pid=\"c584.0\/3\">Secondly, it is time for us to take action, extend compassion and earnestly work towards a peaceful resolution for both sides. We cannot permit the continuation  of the suffering faced by the citizens of Israel under the existing status quo. Let us begin to strive for a future where Israel and Palestine can coexist in peace and prosperity.<\/p><p pid=\"c584.0\/4\">Thirdly, and constructively, to alleviate the short-term terror, we should agree to create a long-term plan along the lines that I suggested a few weeks ago in this House and for which I have had high-level endorsement. If we have a positive plan, which I will explain in one minute, of a future where everyone benefits, we can work towards it as partners for peace.<\/p><p pid=\"c584.0\/5\">So, Saudi Arabia&#8212;Mohammed bin Salman&#8212;should work with Egypt, Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians to build a huge port in Gaza, linked to Cyprus, so that Palestine becomes the Hong Kong of the region and its citizens become wealthy. Together, these countries&#8212;Egypt, Palestine, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Jordan&#8212;having become partners in this huge, positive construction project, can all develop the Sinai peninsula as a huge solar energy park as a source of clean energy for the planet, moving the region from oil and gas income to solar power.<\/p><p pid=\"c584.0\/6\">This partnership would build peace, co-operation and green energy on the vast scale that the world needs. My friend Samir Takla in Egypt is in close contact with President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and they would like this to happen. Perhaps the Minister, who has been so helpful in all of this, might invite the parties here to discuss this in a positive, constructive way, with the UK playing a co-ordinating role. Several organisations with which I am involved would be happy to help organise and facilitate such a conference and project.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>This Government is committed to ensuring that people can be confident that our buildings are safe. The Building Safety Act set up a new, robust regime, with a new Building Safety Regulator at its heart. In recent years, we have also changed statutory guidance on fire safety, with new measures including:<\/p><ul><li>a ban on combustible materials for residential buildings, hotels, hospitals and student accommodation above 18m, and additional guidance for residential buildings between 11m-18m;<\/li><li>a lower threshold for the provision of sprinklers in new blocks of flats from 30m to 11m;<\/li><li>a requirement for wayfinding signage for firefighters in residential buildings above 11m;<\/li><li>requirements for residential buildings over 18m to have an Evacuation Alert System, and for new residential buildings over 11m to include a Secure Information Box (SIB).<\/li><\/ul><p>We must never be complacent in our approach to safety. In July, I confirmed that I intend to introduce new guidance requiring second staircases in new residential buildings in England above 18m. This not only reflects the views of experts including the National Fire Chiefs Council and Royal Institute of British Architects, but also brings us into line with countries &#8211; including Hong Kong and the UAE &#8211; in having a reasonable threshold for requiring second staircases.<\/p><p>I can now announce the intended transitional arrangements that will accompany this change to Approved Document B. From the date when we publish and confirm those changes to Approved Document B formally, developers will have 30 months during which new building regulations applications can confirm to either the guidance as it exists today, or to the updated guidance requiring second staircases. When those 30 months have elapsed, all applications will need to conform to the new guidance.<\/p><p>Any approved applications that do not follow the new guidance will have 18 months for construction to get underway in earnest. If it does not, they will have to submit a new building regulations application, following the new guidance. Sufficient progress, for this purpose, will match the definition set out in the Building (Higher-Risk Buildings Procedures) (England) Regulations 2023, and will therefore be when the pouring of concrete for either the permanent placement of trench, pad or raft foundations or for the permanent placement of piling has started.<\/p><p>With these transitional arrangements, we ensure that projects that already have planning permission with a single staircase, the safety of which will have been considered as part of that application, can continue without further delay if they choose. This means that, for some years yet, we will continue to see 18m+ buildings with single staircases coming to the market. I want to be absolutely clear that existing and upcoming single-staircase buildings are not inherently unsafe. They will not later need to have a second staircase added, when built in accordance with relevant standards, well-maintained and properly managed. I expect lenders, managing agents, insurers, and others to behave accordingly, and not to impose onerous additional requirements, hurdles or criteria on single-staircase buildings in lending, pricing, management or any other respect.<\/p><p>Those who live in new buildings over 18m can be reassured that those buildings are already subject to the additional scrutiny of the new, enhanced building safety regime. Their fire-safety arrangements are scrutinised in detail at the new building control gateways and planning gateway one.<\/p><p>I realise that developers and the wider market are waiting for the design details that will go into Approved Document B. The Building Safety Regulator is working to agree these rapidly, and I will make a further announcement soon. In the meantime, I am confident that this announcement of the intended transitional arrangements will give the market confidence to continue building the high-quality homes that this country needs.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a373.0\/1\">My Lords, I begin by thanking all noble Lords for their contributions. As ever, it has been a fascinating insight, with valuable and experienced contributions.  Yes, there are many challenges posed to His Majesty&#8217;s Government. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Howe for introducing this debate, initiated by the Government, reflecting on the commitment, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, acknowledged, that the Leader of the House of Lords&#8212;my noble friend Lord True&#8212;gave.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/2\">I will begin by saying right at the outset that the Government share the concerns about many of the challenges posed by China under the Chinese Communist Party. My remarks today will probably reflect some of the sentiments and specifics raised. I listened very carefully, as I always do, to the contributions of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup, which showed a deep insight and really threw down a challenge to the Government. While I may not satisfy all his questions, I hope during my contribution I will be able to at least give some granular detail on some of the steps the Government have been taking.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/3\">There was a range of contributions, and I am sure that the noble Lords, Lord Coaker and Lord Collins, would acknowledge that the challenge in any relationship is immense, but the challenge in our relationship with China is complex. They both&#8212;indeed, most noble Lords, if not all&#8212;acknowledged that China is an important partner on the world stage, and we cannot ignore what China does and says and its influence around the world, which I will come on to.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/4\">Equally, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, who said that we must stand up and that we shall not concede or give way. At one point I felt that he was going into the famous football chant &#8220;We shall not be moved&#8221;, but he did not quite go into the depth of that particular chant. I agree with him, and I am sure that, as all noble Lords have indicated, when we look at China, we look at the complexity. The UK is taking on the systematic challenge of that relationship. That of course means protecting our national security, which the noble Lord, Lord Collins, specifically mentioned. It means working with our allies and partners. I am Minister for the UN, and it also means that we work with China in certain respects when it comes to particular issues. Russia&#8217;s illegal war in Ukraine is an example. We are engaging with China in that respect.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/5\">I agree with my noble friend Lord Balfe that we must keep communication channels open, even in the most testing of times. We are probably going through some of the most testing times in my time as a Minister. It is important that we keep discussion channels and sometimes back channels. I joked with my noble friend Lord Howe, who said that the best thing for a diplomat is to be discreet and to open back channels, which means you often say little; that would leave me with little to say at the Dispatch Box. Nevertheless, it is important that those channels remain open.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/6\">The noble Lord, Lord Purvis, spoke about the continuity of the relationship and the noble Lord, Lord Collins, focused on ensuring that we make it clear to China that security is our responsibility and that China&#8217;s stated ambitions and coercive policies challenge our interests, security and values. To the noble Lord, Lord Alton, the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, who is not here, and the other parliamentarians who have been sanctioned by China&#8212;the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, asked about this&#8212;we say that it is not acceptable to  directly challenge parliamentarians who use this Chamber and the other place. When we sanction, we do so under the rule of law so that anyone who is sanctioned has the ability to appeal. Can China say that? No, it cannot. We stand with those parliamentarians. I hope the noble Lord will agree that the Government have sought through direct engagement and through the FCDO to meet the challenges and concerns not just of parliamentarians but of others who have been sanctioned.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/7\">The first duty of any Government is to keep their country safe. Where tensions arise with other objectives on China, we will always put national security first. That is why, in answering some of the specifics on the actions the Government have taken, the new powers in the National Security Act make the UK a harder target for states&#8212;not just China&#8212;that seek to conduct hostile acts against the UK. This includes the foreign interference in our political system that the noble Lord, Lord Collins, referred to, espionage, sabotage and acts that endanger life.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/8\">We will continue to strengthen ourselves at home, particularly our economic security, democratic freedom, critical national infrastructure and supply chains. I will expand on that in a moment. We will also invest in cybersecurity and increase protections for academic freedom and university research. It is clear that with some of the global challenges&#8212;artificial intelligence is one, as the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, among others, acknowledged&#8212;it is important to understand that there is a role. Even the great Lady Ahmad said to me a couple of days ago how forward China was in its planning when it came to artificial intelligence. Our actions should not be words alone. We need to act decisively. Many countries around the world will look to us for support.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/9\">The noble Lord, Lord Alton, also talked about our engagement with China. On trade issues, when my noble friend Lord Johnson visited he used opportunities, particularly those with the media, to speak against the procedures and the erosion of rights in China, and particularly in Hong Kong, and to address those key concerns. As we balance our relationship with China, it is important that we call these issues out.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/10\">The noble Lord, Lord Alton, also talked about the relationship with the DPRK in relation to the Human Rights Council, as did my noble friend Lord Swire. The UK was pleased to co-sponsor the resolution on DPRK human rights adopted at the Human Rights Council on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">4 April<\/phrase>. We continue to call on the DPRK to engage constructively. I note the point about returnees. I will seek to get more detail on that and write to the noble Lord in that respect.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/11\">However, any attempt by a foreign power to intimidate, harass or harm individuals, or indeed communities in the UK, will not be tolerated. That is an insidious threat to our democracy and fundamental human rights. As the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, said, it is about our value system.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/12\">Yes, China has a great influence, and my noble friend Lord Howell talked about its influence on the Commonwealth&#8212;I will come on to that in a moment&#8212; and other parts of the developing world, as the noble Lord, Lord Purvis, mentioned. I share the noble Lord&#8217;s ambition about 0.7%, and I have been clear at this  Dispatch Box that cutting development support has not been as effective in terms of our approach. But, as my noble friends Lord Hannan and Lord Swire said, it is not just about calling out deficiencies in our own support; as my noble friend Lord Swire said, we need to fill the space. There has to be more co-operation and joint working, and we need to work not just on our own and on a bilateral basis but with other key partners as well.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/13\">On human rights, as the UK&#8217;s Human Rights Minister I share the concerns that were raised. People across China face widespread restrictions and violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including severe constraints on media freedom and freedom of religion or belief, as well as the repression of culture and community, be that in Tibet or elsewhere, as the noble Lord, Lord Collins, and my noble friend Lord Hannan mentioned. I was fascinated when my noble friend talked about the algorithm of diplomacy and how things are watched in a specific way. I must say that, although I accept that we live in a different world to that of 1945, the UK remains an influential player. Notwithstanding the war in Ukraine and the current crisis in the Middle East, I was proud of the strength of our diplomacy and advocacy and that we continued to build that coalition against China when it came to the abuse of human rights&#8212;and that is not without lobbying on its part. We achieved 52 countries, including ourselves, as my noble friend mentioned, and that was only yesterday. That demonstrates that we continue to focus, and it is important that we do not lose sight of these important issues.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/14\">The UK has consistently pressed China to improve its human rights record and we conduct independent visits to areas of major concern wherever possible. We support NGOs in exposing and reacting to human rights violations and use our voice on the international stage to effectively raise the reputational and diplomatic cost of human rights violations in China. We regularly raise our concerns at the highest levels with the Chinese Government quite directly, and we did so on the recent visit of my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary. However, it is important that we relay those points quite firmly.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/15\">I will share one experience among many others; the power of diplomacy is not just phone calls and the advocacy we do. It is the ability to sit down, not just with your friends and partners but with those with whom we disagree, and share home truths and the reasons why the values system we stand for&#8212;the democratic freedoms we enjoy&#8212;will benefit any country that wishes to progress.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/16\">On Hong Kong, which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, my noble friend Lord Hannan, and others raised, China&#8217;s imposition of the national security law in 2020 has seen the opposition stifled and dissent criminalised, and alternative voices across Hong Kong society have been all but extinguished. Changes to electoral rules have further eroded the ability of Hong Kongers to be legitimately represented at all levels of government. The UK responded rapidly and decisively to the imposition of the rather draconian national security law. As a demonstration of our commitment to   Hong Kong and its people, we opened the door through our British national (overseas) scheme. There were 176,000 applications.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/17\">Noble Lords also rightly mentioned the detention of Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong. He has stood up bravely for freedom and democracy, and I assure the noble Lord, Lord Alton, that we continue to raise this directly with Chinese and Hong Kong authorities and press for consular access in this respect.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/18\">The UK plays a leading role in co-ordinating an international response to human rights violations, and I alluded to the strength of working with partners. However, what is important, for example in the situation with the Uighurs, is that we need to broaden those alliances. If I may, I declare an interest as a Muslim, and this is the biggest internment of Muslims anywhere in the world. We need more of the Islamic world to stand up and speak out. I assure noble Lords that we are working on that, because it is important that we bring that focus through the strength of the relationships we have.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/19\">In his thoughtful response and reflections, the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, talked about Taiwan, as did the noble Lord, Lord Purvis. Many other noble Lords touched, rightly, on that relationship. The UK&#8217;s position on Taiwan has not changed: we do not support any unilateral attempts to change the status quo. The UK believes the issue must be settled by the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, without the threat or use of force or coercion. But we must be vigilant and that is why AUKUS is important.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/20\">We are disturbed by reports of coercion and intimidation in the South China Sea. We oppose any action which changes the facts on the ground, raises tension and hinders the chances of peaceful settlement of the disputes. My noble friend referred particularly to some of our maritime assets and the work done by the incredible people in our Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence. The UK is committed to international law, the primacy of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and to freedom of navigation and overflight. We oppose any action that brings those into dispute, and miscalculations should not be underestimated.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/21\">Several noble Lords referred to China and Russia. I will come on to the specifics but, to respond to the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, there is a lot going in the world at the moment and one recent development was the BRICS summit, including the BRICS-plus. When you look down the list, you see the UAE, Egypt, Ethiopia, Argentina and Iran&#8212;so the list is an interesting one. The noble Lord talked about the dollar denomination; prior to becoming a Minister, I was in financial services, in banking, and we recently saw the first rupee-denominated payment for oil from the UAE. These things should not be underestimated. There is a real challenge to some of the structures and systems that we are used to operating in.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/22\">I am glad, though, that many of the contributions also recognised the importance of engaging directly with China in our national interest&#8212;and we will, on many of the issues mentioned, including AI, which I  have already alluded to. Equally, as my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary said at Mansion House, disengaging with China<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a373.0\/23\">&#8220;would be a betrayal of our national interest and a wilful misunderstanding of the modern world&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/24\">Meeting the challenge of climate change, as several noble Lords said, cannot be achieved without engaging with China in the objectives we have.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/25\">I assure noble Lords that we align our efforts, as there is a need for what I would term mature diplomacy between two permanent members of the UN Security Council. We also align with the approaches of many of our closest allies, including those in Europe, the US, Australia, Canada and Japan. The Government are also investing in the expertise and capability to respond to the challenges China poses. We have committed to investing in the skills and knowledge of UK officials, giving them the tools to better understand China in responding to the systematic challenges that we face specifically from it. That includes, as the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, will be pleased to hear, investing specifically in Mandarin speakers at the Foreign Office.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/26\">I turn to some issues on the China strategy implementation, which the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup, focused on. The National Security Secretariat within the Cabinet Office co-ordinates the implementation of our approach to China across government. This gives us a clear view of China&#8217;s activities and allows the Government to prioritise our work in this respect. To touch on a few issues of specific support, the Government have published, for example, overseas business risk guidance in relation to China to help UK firms negotiate the ethical, legal and commercial questions they may meet as they do business in China. The Government have also committed to investing in the skills and knowledge of UK officials. We are looking at curriculum events and language, including a cross-government Mandarin offer, which is expected to train hundreds of civil servants this year alone.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/27\">The noble and gallant Lord will be interested to know that we are enhancing our economic security levers in this respect, which will enable the UK to deal with confidence with some of the challenges that China poses. The UK has taken robust action: we have announced the application of military end-use controls to China, as part of our revised export control regime; we have launched the National Security and Investment Act, giving the Government new powers to intervene in acquisitions where we have national security concerns; and we have strengthened the visa screening of Chinese academics and researchers in sensitive areas of research.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/28\">As my noble friend Lord Howell rightly said, we need to work with China, as the world&#8217;s largest investor in sustainable energy and the largest carbon emitter, as well. Engaging with China on climate change can only have a positive effect. China is responsible for over half the global demand for coal and currently operates 58% of its power from coal. We are pushing China to phase out its coal use and to increase ambition on its NDCs, so that its emissions peak earlier and it reduces them more quickly.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/29\">Several noble Lords, including the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup, and the noble Lord, Lord Alton, referred to the recent comments by MI5. The IRR made clear the position that China presents a defining challenge to the United Kingdom. The Government are working to embed an approach to future engagement with China that is in the national interest. In this regard, I am sure the noble and gallant Lord will acknowledge that it is important that we work with our key allies&#8212;namely, the Five Eyes&#8212;and we are doing exactly that.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/30\">I will turn to some of the other key points. There were a number of questions, particularly from the noble Lord, Lord Alton. If I may, I will write to him. On Chinese influence across the Commonwealth, which my noble friends Lord Howell and Lord Swire focused on, it is quite startling. In total, China has invested &#163;685 billion in Africa, the largest recent recipients including Ghana and South Africa. I recall during the last Australian election the Chinese Foreign Minister travelling to the Pacific Islands, particularly the Solomon Islands, and agreeing security guarantees and support. Therefore, I agree with many noble Lords&#8217; assessment that we need to fill the gap. There is no point just calling it out. I have heard it directly: &#8220;That&#8217;s great Minister; what&#8217;s the offer?&#8221; We need to stand by, focus and ensure we meet that challenge.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/31\">We are taking steps within the Commonwealth. My noble friend Lord Howell will know how passionate I am about the Commonwealth portfolio&#8212;so much so that I was given it back a few months ago. In all seriousness, it presents a huge opportunity for what more we can do working with key partners, particularly those emerging as economic powers within the Commonwealth family.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/32\">Tackling threats to higher education was raised. We have introduced a series of measures that will continue to tackle threats to higher education, including through the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023. The noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, is absolutely correct that my responsibilities do not extend to the Department for Education, but I will come back to her on her specific question. On the Confucius Institutes, I listened very carefully to her contribution, but I am sure she recognises that, as other noble Lords mentioned, there are concerns about interference in our higher education sector. We are taking action to remove government funding from Confucius Institutes in the UK, but currently judge that it would be disproportionate to ban them. This needs careful steps forward. Like any international body operating in the UK, the institutes need to operate transparently and within the law. The noble Lord, Lord Coaker, mentioned a number of other such areas as well.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/33\">On supply chains, I will clarify and give some detail on the questions raised by the noble and gallant Lord. We are taking action to protect our supply chains, in   the semiconductor strategy of May 2023 and the critical minerals strategy of July 2023, and we will shortly publish the UK supply and import strategy to support specific government and business action to strengthen our resilience in critical supply chains. I will of course share that with noble Lords.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/34\">On the BRI forum, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Purvis, my noble friends Lord Hannan and Lord Swire, and others that, had we not been in the current crisis, everyone would be talking about the meeting taking place between the Presidents of China and of Russia. Of course, the UN Secretary-General was also present in Beijing. We need to ensure that, while there are crises on the world stage, we are not distracted from some of the key objectives we have set ourselves.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/35\">China poses a defining challenge for the United Kingdom and many countries around the world, including our key Five Eyes partners, as well as in every area of government policy and everyday life in Britain. That is why the Government set out in the integrated review refresh, and why my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary explained in his Mansion House speech earlier this year, how we will protect our national security, align with our partners and engage with China where it is in our national interest to do so.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/36\">We have taken action, some of which I have outlined, including new powers under different legislation. We will align and deepen our co-operation with core allies to influence China and sustain pressure by broadening the range of countries we are speaking to. Also, importantly, we will engage with Beijing on key global issues, as I outlined, including the war in Ukraine. We will continue to press China to join the UK in pushing Mr Putin to cease hostilities and withdraw his forces from Ukraine.<\/p><p pid=\"a373.0\/37\">Noble Lords have made wide-ranging contributions and in the time available, I have not been able to answer a number of questions, so, as I said, I will come back in the usual way, through a letter. The Government value and appreciate the input and insights we have heard today, and the manner in which they were presented. In defining our relationship with countries such as China going forward, it is right that this Government&#8212;any Government&#8212;be challenged directly to share the detail, in order to see how we balance what is a complex but important relationship.<\/p><p class=\"italic\" pid=\"a373.0\/38\">Motion agreed.<\/p>",

I appreciate that all those represented here today, and in fact most Members of this House, are working with constituents in this situation. I will instruct my officials to review the information that we have available and send it to the hon. Gentleman and other interested Members. If he feels it is insufficient, then he should please give us guidance.<\/p><p pid=\"a56.2\/2\">One of the questions at the heart of this debate is our ability to house people satisfactorily here in the UK. With the Minister for Veterans&#8217; Affairs, we worked intensively over the first half of this year to ensure that almost all individuals in the Afghan bridging hotels were moved on into settled accommodation. The remaining individuals are in pre-matched situations where they are awaiting their property becoming available, so will swiftly move out of that accommodation. That is a success, but we need to ensure that we do not find ourselves in that situation again. It is for that reason that we have exercised a degree of caution in bringing individuals to the UK without accommodation available.<\/p><p pid=\"a56.2\/3\">We want to work with as many local authorities as possible to find further homes that we can then match with families in Pakistan awaiting entry to the United Kingdom. We all appreciate the pressures on local authorities: their own housing lists for the domestic population; handling Homes for Ukraine, the Syrian scheme and the Hong Kong scheme; and the consequences of illegal migration. Together, those factors make it an extremely challenging period for them. Since 2015, we have welcomed 530,000 people into our country on humanitarian grounds&#8212;more than at any time in our modern history&#8212;and much of that pressure lies with local authorities. That does not mean we should prevent individuals from coming to the United Kingdom. We need to work intensively with local authorities to bring forward more properties swiftly.<\/p><p pid=\"a56.2\/4\">A further avenue is to ensure that service family accommodation units are brought up to scratch, made available and matched with individuals and their families in Pakistan, or indeed in Afghanistan. Understandably, the Ministry of Defence is leading that work, and we are doing everything we can to encourage them to bring forward their hundreds of properties very swiftly.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1586.0\/1\">My Lords, the noble Baroness has made a very eloquent speech about the tragedies and the obscene abuses of the laws of war, such that we have not seen for decades. It was impressive that that was supported so strongly by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup. For a military leader to spend as much time as he did on that grotesque situation and the necessity to do something about it was very important.<\/p><p pid=\"a1586.0\/2\">However, we must not be complacent about the mechanisms in front of us. It is easy to look back on the former Yugoslavia and see the number of people serving in prison&#8212;some criminals are in British prisons at this moment&#8212;but we had a specific international criminal court to deal with crimes in Yugoslavia, set up by agreement of the Security Council. We have no chance whatever of getting a similar legal structure to deal with the crimes of this war. We should be realistic about that, but we should try our hardest to establish some new mechanism.<\/p><p pid=\"a1586.0\/3\">We should never forget that we are talking about the second invasion of Ukraine. There was a first invasion, in relation to which we performed lamentably. Once again, we must recognise that appeasement never works. Now that we face this situation, we in Europe must not equivocate about it&#8212;and I am proud of how the British Government have responded. However, the facts are that, without President Biden&#8217;s leadership and the massive contribution that has been made, NATO would not have been able to do what it has done. The Secretary-General of NATO, Stoltenberg, has done a sterling job, as have many others. We have, quite rightly, transformed a defensive alliance, saying that, when a friendly country&#8212;not a member of NATO&#8212;is attacked, we have the right to supply it with arms to defend itself. I think I am right in saying that we have never done that before in NATO. This is an important new power that we have taken, and it is wholly legitimate.<\/p><p pid=\"a1586.0\/4\">How have we done in terms of the rest of the world? The best definition of what we must achieve was provided in July by the G7 leaders of Britain, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Japan and the United States. In their strong statement, they affirmed their<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1586.0\/5\">&#8220;unwavering commitment to the strategic objective of a free, independent, democratic, and sovereign Ukraine &#8230; capable of defending itself and deterring future aggression&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a1586.0\/6\">I stress those last words. That is the task in front of us.<\/p><p pid=\"a1586.0\/7\">The Russian military is now rallying, as it so often does and as it did in the Second World War, as we all remember. It is rallying with the support of China and, most recently, of North Korea, and it also has Iran. That is a formidable combination; do not let any of us underestimate how it can be, and is being, mobilised.<\/p><p pid=\"a1586.0\/8\">One thing needs to be said about China. It is pretty clear that it has made President Putin recognise that he will not be able to resort to tactical nuclear weapons in this war. I profoundly hope that this decision is not changed in any way by China and that it stems from a profound belief that there can be no nuclear war. In favour of that being the right interpretation of China, at least it can be said that it is spending substantial sums of money on its own conventional forces. Of course, it has the capacity to use nuclear weapons too. Let us hope that China, this new power&#8212;it is a new power, and it is almost right to call it a superpower&#8212;will use its power in an intelligent way. When we debate China on many other aspects of this, we should show a little bit more realism about what China is and what it could become.<\/p><p pid=\"a1586.0\/9\">With elections coming in the United States, I believe that it is of paramount importance that the average American voter believes that Europe has responded fully and totally and made a commitment through NATO that is almost as much as we possibly can. I do not think that we are there yet, but I attach great importance to it. The American military has always been understanding about Europe&#8217;s contribution. It wanted more from Europe and it wanted more money, but it believes that we, and some of the key countries, such as France and others, have been ready. Germany has never responded sufficiently in the eyes of an American looking at its contribution. I pay tribute to Chancellor Scholz, in very difficult circumstances, because that has changed remarkably. It is vital that that change continues and is backed by real financial resources and real weapons, commitment and numbers of German military ready to fight.<\/p><p pid=\"a1586.0\/10\">One other thing that is most important when we look at China is that it understands that this country was deeply affronted when President Xi tore up the treaty over Hong Kong signed by Deng Xiaoping and Margaret Thatcher. It was a massive blow to international authority and devastating that a country emerging as a great country and a great superpower should have acted in that way.<\/p><p pid=\"a1586.0\/11\">What else can be done in the short term? Britain must step up its own commitment. A lot of it will come not so much in money, though it will eventually have to be paid for, but in taking very valuable weaponry&#8212;first, in the first few weeks, in dealing with tanks, and now more recently with the readiness to supply the long-range Storm Shadow missiles, which have been very effective. Each and every member of NATO, particularly the European members, will be watched very carefully, because the debate inside the United States is where this issue is going to be resolved. It is no good trying to escape it. We have to make sure that opinion is shifted in favour of what is happening in the response to Russia, China, North Korea and Iran.<\/p><p pid=\"a1586.0\/12\">This is a huge commitment, which cannot be undertaken by the United States, even with all its power, on its own. It is a fact that a substantial number of American  people do not yet understand the challenge and the threat. It is not getting through to decent, average United States people that there will have to be a major response. The American military must go out and campaign that Europe is responding. There are too many people in America who believe that we have not paid our fair whack for defence in NATO, and they are right. It is important that that understanding is changed; if it is not changed, we run a serious risk of a response from the United States that will not be sufficient to deal with the global challenges that it faces.<\/p><p pid=\"a1586.0\/13\">I will say this: I am very pleased that this country has understood that one way of explaining to the American people that we are paying our full whack and responding is through our having made an adjustment &#8212;not a major one, but a small contribution. We have, in effect, gone back east of Suez and accepted that there is a threat and a challenge in the Pacific. The United States should not be facing that purely and simply by itself. It will not be a very large commitment, but the impact of seeing a British aircraft carrier in Pacific waters, supported by escort vessels from the United States, Australia and New Zealand, matters to American public opinion. They then feel that we understand their security concerns. Many of them are more concerned about China than about what is happening in Ukraine. That is the reality&#8212;look at the opinion polls in the United States. We are still important movers of opinion.<\/p><p pid=\"a1586.0\/14\">I must declare an interest in that I am married to an American, but it has given me an understanding over many years of my life that America can do the right thing. There is inherently in the American people a capacity to do the right thing; they have done it in two world wars&#8212;though both times a little too late. This will predominantly be their war. We are helping them, and will help them right across the globe, where the horrors of the actions that we have seen in Ukraine will undoubtedly be reproduced. It is in that sense that we in this House see, as someone has already mentioned, that the cross-party nature of the contribution is very real.<\/p><p pid=\"a1586.0\/15\">I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Harrington, spoke about what has been done for refugees and the refugee movement. I have seen in Wiltshire&#8212;around our house and among our friends, and among anybody who has ever helped the refugees, right across the classes, trades and skills&#8212;an amazing response to try to help Ukrainian refugees. The spirit is there in this country, the spirit is growing in Europe, and the spirit will come in the United States. Until it does, we face formidable adversaries, and we should not for any moment underestimate them.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b498.0\/1\">I am not sure whether my hon. Friend has been reading my notes, but that was one of the points I was going to make. Those are issues that the CMA will have to look at very closely with an eye to making sure that consumers are protected.<\/p><p pid=\"b498.0\/2\">As has already been pointed out, the idea of an &#163;11 billion investment in 5G would be great if it were a bankable commitment, because I want to see the roll-out of high-quality 5G services across the whole country. As I have already said, that is essential if we are to have levelling up across the country, including in places such as the Rhondda.<\/p><p pid=\"b498.0\/3\">Several hon. Members, including <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Carol Monaghan\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25406\">the hon. Member for Glasgow North West (Carol Monaghan)<\/phrase>, pointed out that mergers in other markets have not always led to increased investment; if anything, there has been a tendency in the other direction. I hope that the CMA will look at that. It is worth bearing in mind that the EU&#8217;s competition directorate blocked CK Hutchison&#8217;s plan to acquire O2 from Telef&#243;nica in 2016. The CMA may well want to look at the reasoning behind that decision, as some of the issues may still pertain today.<\/p><p pid=\"b498.0\/4\">In any case, competition is not just about having three players competing for business. In practice, many consumers have little or no choice of operator because of local coverage issues. If the main player has only two other companies looking over its shoulder, it may too readily come to pricing decisions that extract maximum income for the company rather than provide enhanced value for the consumer. Again, I hope that the CMA will consider all those matters carefully.<\/p><p pid=\"b498.0\/5\">There is one other market-related issue that I hope the CMA will consider: the trained workforce. Vodafone states that the merger is expected to result in<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b498.0\/6\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;&#163;700 million of annual cost and capex synergies by the fifth&#8230;year post-completion&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b498.0\/7\">I want to know what that means for jobs. The market has regularly complained about shortages in its workforce. It is difficult to see how the merged company could make those significant savings without significant job losses, but until now it has been rather coy about that. Understandably, staff at the two companies and their union, Unite, are concerned about job losses, and we stand four-square behind those concerns. It would be an own goal for the UK telecoms industry to lose significant numbers of workers from its skilled workforce at this time. Far from helping to develop infrastructure in the UK, that could hinder it.<\/p><p pid=\"b498.0\/8\">Let me turn to security issues. The merger will require the approval of the investment security unit, which was moved from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to the Cabinet Office. In effect, that means that, in relation to security issues, approval will be a decision for the Prime Minister. I do not want to exaggerate the security issues, but it is worth bearing in mind that the new company would have to handle extremely sensitive material regarding 27 million customers, as well as contracts for the NHS, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Defence, as has already been said.<\/p><p pid=\"b498.0\/9\">Those contracts are currently with Vodafone, not with Three. In the case of the Ministry of Defence, for instance, Vodafone was recently awarded a contract to   provide video conferencing and recording services to UK military courts in cases relating to sexual offences. That is an important matter that we should consider carefully. Does it make sense to give such a role to a company, CK Hutchison Holdings&#8212;the owner of Three&#8212;that is a Hong Kong-based and Cayman Islands-registered conglomerate that was formed only in 2015?<\/p><p pid=\"b498.0\/10\">My questions for the Minister are as follows. What assessment have the Government made of the relationship between CK Hutchison and the Chinese state? If the merger were to go ahead, how would the Government seek to guarantee the security of national and personal data? Would they, for instance, consider carving out Government contracts from the deal? Under the provisions of the Telecommunications (Security) Act 2021 and the Government&#8217;s designated vendor direction, all telecoms operators are meant to strip Huawei from 5G by the end of 2027. What progress has been made on that, and what in particular has been done at Three and Vodafone? What impact do the Government feel that the Chinese security law in relation to Hong Kong has on Three and CK Hutchison Holdings?<\/p><p pid=\"b498.0\/11\">On the security issues, can the Minister tell us what stage the decision is at? Will any Government decision, and the reasoning behind it, be published? Will Parliament be engaged in the process in any way? The Minister will know that the Intelligence and Security Committee has expressed its concerns about the process. The Committee said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b498.0\/12\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;The fact that the Government does not want there to be any meaningful scrutiny of sensitive investment deals&#8230;is of serious concern.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b498.0\/13\">It went on:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b498.0\/14\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Effective Parliamentary oversight is not some kind of &#8216;optional extra&#8217; &#8211; it is a vital safeguard in any functioning Parliamentary democracy&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b498.0\/15\">That is particularly important for us to consider given that the Chinese state has sanctioned several Members of Parliament, including, incidentally, the Security Minister.<\/p><p pid=\"b498.0\/16\">Given the recent stories about the Chinese state&#8217;s attempts to infiltrate Westminster and serious concerns regarding Chinese involvement in other parts of our national infrastructure, how will the Government ensure that the merger, if it goes ahead, does not undermine national and personal security? How will the Government ensure that all ministerial meetings with CK Hutchison Holdings and its subsidiaries are published in full and in good time, in case there is any inappropriate lobbying?<\/p><p pid=\"b498.0\/17\">I want to say one final thing, because we are partly talking about China. Next week will see the 1,000th day of the incarceration of Jimmy Lai, who is a British national. The House will not be sitting, but I think all Members would want to put on the record that we believe he has been incorrectly and inappropriately held in custody. We would like to see him free.<\/p>",

Here at home, we have spoken&#8212;as many have today in the House in the preceding debates&#8212;about issues such as forced organ harvesting and the surveillance state that comes through the installation of cameras by companies such as Hikvision and Dahua, in which the noble Lord himself has taken such a keen interest.<\/p><p pid=\"b770.0\/2\">In the light of all that, the Leader of the House will not be surprised to hear me reiterate a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Newby. In another place earlier today, my good friend Tim Loughton MP, who is also one of those who has been sanctioned, expressed surprise that those of us who had been put in this invidious position were not told anything about the activities that were said to be taking place across the Parliamentary Estate. Will the Leader look at that issue again and have some regard to those who obviously have a direct interest in this?<\/p><p pid=\"b770.0\/3\">The foreign influence registration scheme contains a power to place a foreign power in the enhanced tier. That will require parliamentary approval. What is the proposed timetable? Can it be accelerated? Will the Chinese Communist Party regime be on that list? The Leader referred to the &#8220;very shortly&#8221; assurance that he was asked to give concerning the excellent report from the Intelligence and Security Committee, which says that China has penetrated<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b770.0\/4\">&#8220;every sector of the UK&#8217;s economy&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b770.0\/5\">This House&#8217;s Select Committee on International Relations and Defence has also said that China is not a strategic competitor but a threat. Although it cannot be reduced to one word, as the Leader of the House said, surely it is time for us to schedule a debate. I hope that, as soon as the response from the Government is forthcoming, we will have in government time the chance to discuss the Intelligence and Security Committee&#8217;s report, along with our own reports.<\/p><p pid=\"b770.0\/6\">Finally, will the Leader urgently consider establishing a small Joint Committee of both Houses to review infiltration, espionage, the subversion of our democratic institutions, the effects on places such as our universities, and these attempts to silence those of us who have been sanctioned by the CCP and our families?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b743.0\/1\">My Lords, I begin by thanking the Minister. I will come back to that in a few moments, because she has been extraordinarily helpful, and I know we have made significant progress from when the first amendment was moved on this issue.<\/p><p pid=\"b743.0\/2\">In parenthesis, before I begin&#8212;and because I will not weary the House with a second speech later, even if the opportunity is there&#8212;I would like to say how much I support what the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of King&#8217;s Heath, is trying to achieve with Motion 102A and Amendment 102B. Again, I have spoken on those previously, along with the noble Baronesses, Lady Northover and Lady Brinton, the noble Lord, Lord Ribeiro, from the Conservative Benches, my noble friend Lady Finlay&#8212;who is unable to be with us this evening&#8212;and many others who want to support what the noble Lord is trying to achieve.<\/p><p pid=\"b743.0\/3\">I turn to Clause 65 and Amendment 47B in Motion 47A in my name. As the Minister said, it would require a timeline for the removal of surveillance equipment that is connected to the internet and subject to the People&#8217;s Republic of China&#8217;s national intelligence law. I did say that I would like to start my remarks, and I do, by paying tribute to the Minister&#8217;s own efforts  and those of her officials, who have met with me now on several occasions&#8212;most recently on Thursday last&#8212;to discuss the concerns of Members of both Houses when it comes to the presence of Chinese-made surveillance cameras in our public procurement chain.<\/p><p pid=\"b743.0\/4\">As recently as yesterday, the Sunday Telegraph reported that the Co-op has decided to ban Chinese CCTV for &#8220;ethical and security reasons&#8221;. Given the Minister&#8217;s professional background in a previous life, she will know that, in doing this, it is following the example of Tesco. It would indeed be odd if supermarkets were ahead of public bodies in recognising the dangers posed by the CCP&#8217;s surveillance state. I was also very struck that the Deputy Prime Minister, the right honourable Oliver Dowden, speaking in another place this afternoon about allegations concerning espionage on the estate of your Lordships&#8217; House and that of another place, made a point of saying that one of his first actions in Whitehall had been to have surveillance cameras linked to Hikvision removed from his department. This is something that Sajid Javid also said when he became Secretary of State for Health. I simply say that, if supermarkets and departments of state are not suitable places for these cameras, where is? It would indeed be odd if we did not think about the 60% of public bodies that are estimated to have Hikvision cameras in use.<\/p><p pid=\"b743.0\/5\">This is not a new question that I am putting to your Lordships&#8217; House; this is something I have raised on over 40 occasions in the House or in Grand Committee since 2020. Both the Minister and the Leader of the House, the noble Lord, Lord True, have taken this issue seriously. When the noble Lord was in charge of this Bill, in its earliest stages, we had a meeting to discuss Hikvision. Because I want to get on with seeing a resolution of this issue, I am able to welcome the clear commitment from the Minister, given at the Dispatch Box, for a timetable for the removal of this surveillance equipment and these cameras from sensitive sites. However, it is worth noting, as I have said, how we got here.<\/p><p pid=\"b743.0\/6\">As the Government have recognised, there are at least a million Hikvision and Dahua cameras in the UK, installed across our high streets, job centres, schools, police forces, hospitals, universities, local government buildings and even government departments. I gently say to the Minister that, although she is right that military barracks or GCHQ are clearly far more sensitive sites than, say, hospitals or schools, some of this is about data collection. That involves every single citizen of this country, so it poses dangers for them too. I commend to her the recent Channel 4 documentary on Hikvision and the fantastic work of IPVM, Big Brother Watch, Hong Kong Watch&#8212;of which I am a patron&#8212;and other organisations that have outlined the security risk that these cameras pose, particularly in those sensitive public sector sites, but not exclusively so.<\/p><p pid=\"b743.0\/7\">It is quite something to consider that, as a country, we have willingly handed over the majority of our surveillance infrastructure, which watches the often public and sometimes intimately private moments of our lives, not just to the police or local authorities but to an authoritarian Government that the House of  Commons has found, on a resolution of the House, credibly accused of genocide. I declare a non-financial interest as vice chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Uyghurs.<\/p><p pid=\"b743.0\/8\">How ironic it is that we are debating this on the day we have learned that an alleged CCP spy has been operating across Parliament, based in the office of a Member of another place. We urgently need a bicameral group of senior parliamentarians to investigate this shocking lapse. The Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament has warned against the infiltration of our universities and other institutions. Only last week, the University of Cambridge ended a partnership with a subsidiary company developing Chinese weapons and military hardware. The line between crass naivety and outright collaboration is a fine one. We recall the Cambridge spies and the Soviet Union, and some of the disastrous consequences. It should send a shiver down the spine of every freedom-loving person to see swathes of the public surveillance procurement supply chain handed over to Chinese companies that are blacklisted for complicity in gross human rights violations by the United States and which are legally compelled under the PRC national intelligence law to pass on data to the Chinese Communist Party state.<\/p><p pid=\"b743.0\/9\">As we debate the timeline for their removal from our public procurement supply chain, the definition of what we should consider &#8220;sensitive sites&#8221; and the oversight that Members of this House and another place will have should be high on our agenda. Surely, for too long government policy towards China has favoured investment and trade at the expense of our national security, our values and human rights. We have underestimated the PRC, ignored the voices of those Uighurs, Hong Kongers, Tibetans and others who have been persecuted by the CCP and know it best, and failed to produce a coherent strategy to deal with the threat that the PRC poses. I am always struck by the phrase used by the noble Lord, Lord Patten of Barnes, who knows a thing or two about China. He describes it as cakeism&#8212;wanting to have your cake and eat it&#8212;to want trade deals on the one hand, but recognise the country as a threat to your national interest on the other.<\/p><p pid=\"b743.0\/10\">Despite the ongoing human rights crackdown in Hong Kong, China&#8217;s flagrant breaches of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the recent targeting of Hong Kong activists living in the UK, the Government have failed to hold any Hong Kong or Chinese official to account with targeted sanctions. I suppose at this juncture I should say that I have a sort of interest, in being one of two Members of your Lordships&#8217; House who have been sanctioned by the CCP. Most Ministers would privately concede, if pushed, that they share the view of this House that the treatment of Uighur Muslims is credibly genocide, yet they dare not publicly state it or take the kind of actions that the US is taking to ensure that the goods that we import from China are not made by Uighur forced labour. That is why I raised that very issue, linking it not just to slave labour but to genocide, in moving my original amendment.<\/p><p pid=\"b743.0\/11\">Last week, along with the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, and Sir Iain Duncan Smith MP, who has championed this cause in the  Commons, I met US Customs and Border Protection officials to discuss customs enforcement preventing goods coming to the US from China&#8217;s Uighur region where forced labour is present. It is striking how much the US is doing to tackle the issue of modern slavery, in comparison to our own rather lacklustre approach.<\/p><p pid=\"b743.0\/12\">These views are not mine alone but shared by the Foreign Affairs Committee in its recent report on the Indo-Pacific and the integrated review, and the joint Intelligence and Security Committee&#8217;s report on China, which both bemoan the woeful lack of a China strategy and seriousness from the Government over the security threats posed by the PRC. I commend to the Minister last week&#8217;s op-ed by Juliet Samuel, which made a forensic examination of what she described as the &#8220;King Kowtow&#8221; approach to trade with China&#8212;where, incidentally, instead of resilience we have a huge dependency and a trade deficit of over &#163;40 billion.<\/p><p pid=\"b743.0\/13\">Procurement and a renewal of our own industrial capacity would make a dent in that. We need a national resilience strategy, not dependency. Surely that is one of the lessons that we should have learned from Ukraine. Sadly, the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s recent visit to Beijing reflects the wrong approach. He has embarked on a fixed pathway of engagement with the PRC at all costs, failing to protect our national security at home while being unwilling to learn the lessons from our key allies, who have far more developed strategies for dealing with the PRC.<\/p><p pid=\"b743.0\/14\">The commitment by the Government this evening will not change consecutive Governments&#8217; woeful lack of a China policy overnight, but it does offer a glimmer of hope for the publication of a timeline for the removal of what the former Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner has described as &#8220;digital asbestos&#8221; from our public procurement supply chain. The Government should reflect on the worrying reasons for the resignation of the commissioner, Professor Fraser Sampson.<\/p><p pid=\"b743.0\/15\">When it comes to the Government&#8217;s commitment to prioritise the removal of this equipment from &#8220;sensitive sites&#8221;, which I welcome, I favour the clearest definition to cover our police forces, NHS trusts, schools, universities, government departments, military sites, transport networks and local government buildings. This clear definition will make it easier for the Government to readily identify the extent of the problem, and put in place a practical timetable for the removal of surveillance equipment that falls under the jurisdiction of the PRC&#8217;s national intelligence law after six months from the Bill receiving Royal Assent.<\/p><p pid=\"b743.0\/16\">I welcome the commitment from the Government&#8212;the most important thing of all in the concessions that the Government have offered&#8212;to a role for Members of this House and the other place in scrutinising annually the progress the Government have made in the removal of these cameras and this equipment, and hope that the responsibility for this will be given to the Joint Intelligence and Security Committee. Finally, it is my sincere desire that we can avoid such a public procurement supply chain fiasco in the future. I hope that civil servants and Ministers will learn the lessons from allowing Hikvision and Dahua cameras to spread across the public sector and avoid such a costly mistake for the taxpayer again.<\/p><p pid=\"b743.0\/17\">I started my speech by paying tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Rolfe, and the departmental officials who have worked on the Bill. I should like to end it in that spirit as well. I greatly appreciate the concerted engagement from the Minister, the quiet diligence of officials and the Government&#8217;s openness to moving on this important issue. In conjunction with that, I also thank Sam Goodman of Hong Kong Watch, of which I am a patron, as I have said, for some helpful background work. Given the commitment today by the Minister at the Dispatch Box to the publication of a timeline, a definition of sensitive sites and the allowance of some parliamentary oversight, I will not be moving this amendment to a Division. However, the House can be sure that I will watch this with an eagle eye and return to it, should the need arise in the future.<\/p>",

In line with the Citizens&#8217; Rights Agreements, a right of redress will continue to be provided through a right of appeal. The changes create streamlined arrangements for challenging a decision and align with the approach taken in the rest of the immigration system (where no dual right of redress exists).<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The same changes apply to the S2 Healthcare Visitor route, which provides a route of entry to the UK for people who, before the end of the transition period, had requested authorisation from their EEA home state or Switzerland to receive a course of planned healthcare treatment provided by the NHS under the &#8216;S2 arrangement&#8217;.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We are also making some minor, technical amendments to Appendix EU for clarification purposes.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Immigration Rules for Pre-1997 Gurkhas, Hong Kong Military Unit Veterans and Family Members<\/strong><\/p><p> <\/p><p>We are bringing the pre-1997 Gurkha settlement concession into the Immigration Rules and at the same time extending the policy to cover pre-1997 members of Hong Kong military units as announced in March 2023.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The policy recognises Hong Kong veterans have similar circumstances to Gurkhas, stationed in Hong Kong prior to handover to China, although never based in the UK. It will enable those eligible who were discharged before 1 July 1997, to settle in the UK. This will be done by extending the provisions of the settlement concession that already exists for former Gurkhas and their families to Hong Kong military unit veterans and their families; bringing both cohorts under the Rules provides greater transparency for these routes and fairness of treatment.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Changes to Appendix Electronic Travel Authorisation<\/strong><\/p><p> <\/p><p>We have made changes to clarify that the ETA exemption for applicants lawfully resident in Ireland who are travelling within the Common Travel Area, will require a person aged 16 or above, to demonstrate residency in Ireland, if required by a UK official, in order to benefit from this exemption.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The changes to the Immigration Rules are being laid on 7 September 2023.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>All changes in the Statement of Changes will come into effect on various dates from 28 September 2023.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a122.1\/1\">Yes, indeed&#8212;we consider all these cases. If I may, I will come on to that case, because the hon. Gentleman has been a champion of it. Let me assure him&#8212;I am sure he knows this&#8212;the Government have raised concerns about Mr Johal&#8217;s case with the Government of India, including allegations of torture  and his right to a fair trial, on over 100 occasions, and we will continue to do so. We take the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention&#8217;s opinion in this case very seriously. We have consistently raised concerns about Mr Johal directly with the Indian authorities and we will continue to do so, as I say. Having carefully considered the potential benefits and risks to Mr Johal of calling for his release, as well as the likely effectiveness of doing so, we do not believe this course of action would be in his best interests. But as I say, we will continue to raise his case with the Government of India.<\/p><p pid=\"a122.1\/2\">Let me turn now to two cases mentioned by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Catherine West\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25328\">the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Catherine West)<\/phrase> and the hon. Member for St Helens South and Whiston. The first is the case of Morad Tahbaz in Iran. We are pleased to see that British national Morad Tahbaz has been released on furlough. That is a first step, and we remain focused on his permanent release. Of course, the UK is not party to negotiations between the US and Iran; the details of any agreement are a bilateral matter for those two countries. But we do think that his release on furlough is a positive step.<\/p><p pid=\"a122.1\/3\">I turn now to the case of Mehran Raoof, also in Iran. We are supporting the family of Mr Raoof, who is a British-Iranian national and has been detained in Iran since 2020. Of course, his welfare remains a top priority. It remains entirely within Iran&#8217;s gift to release any British national who has been unfairly detained and so we should urge Iran to stop this practice of unfairly detaining British and other foreign nationals and urge it to release Mr Raoof.<\/p><p pid=\"a122.1\/4\">I turn now to the case of Mr Alaa Abd El-Fattah, in Egypt. Of course, we remain committed to securing consular access for dual British-Egyptian national and human rights defender Alaa Abd El-Fattah. We continue to raise Mr El-Fattah&#8217;s case at the highest levels with the Egyptian Government. We remain committed to supporting him and his family. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary met family members on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">6 February<\/phrase>, and Lord Ahmad has met family members several times&#8212;most recently on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">6 July<\/phrase>. Our ambassador in Cairo and consular officials are in regular contact with family members and they met most recently on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">5 April<\/phrase>. Of course, we will continue to offer all the consular support that we can.<\/p><p pid=\"a122.1\/5\">I was very grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Daniel Kawczynski\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11817\">the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)<\/phrase> for raising the case of his constituent Mr Saiful Chowdhury. Of course I give him my absolute assurance that we will be happy to correspond and raise this case. Perhaps we could exchange details after this debate. We look forward to corresponding on that case and we look forward to offering any support we can to Mr Chowdhury, so I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that case.<\/p><p pid=\"a122.1\/6\">Turning to the case of Jimmy Lai, which was raised by several Members, let me be very clear that we are using our channels with the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities to raise Mr Lai&#8217;s detention and request consular access. The Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, last met Mr Lai&#8217;s son and his international legal team on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">24 April<\/phrase> and officials continue to provide support. We continue to make our strong opposition to the national security law clear to the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong  authorities. It is being used to curtail freedoms, punish dissent and shrink the space for opposition, free press and civil society. The Foreign Secretary raised Jimmy Lai&#8217;s detention with Chinese Vice-President Han Zheng on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">5 May<\/phrase> and in his opening statement at the 52nd session of the UN Human Rights Council on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">22 February<\/phrase>. We will continue to raise this case and others.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a2255.1\/1\">My Lords, I will speak to Amendments 96 and 98 in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Lansley.<\/p><p pid=\"a2255.1\/2\">In answering a question last week, the Minister, my noble friend Lady Scott, said that the levelling-up Bill was a large one; she gave that as a reason for dropping the repeal of the Vagrancy Act. My amendment directly addresses that concern by deleting eight pages from the Bill: those introducing the untested concept of community land auctions, parachuted into the Bill at a late stage in the other place, hot from the bubbling vat of a think tank, without the normal process of cooling and maturing.<\/p><p pid=\"a2255.1\/3\">I say again how grateful I am to Ministers for their patience in discussions on CLAs and for the very comprehensive six-page letter received yesterday, addressing some of the concerns that I have spoken about.<\/p><p pid=\"a2255.1\/4\">One would have thought that a novel concept such as this one would have been subjected to some consultation before it appeared in the Bill: first, with those who have to operate it&#8212;namely, the planning authorities&#8212;and, secondly, with those who represent the landowners, who have expressed deep reservations about the proposal. So we were surprised to hear the Minister say, in winding up the debate in Committee:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a2255.1\/5\">&#8220;We will consult on community land auctions shortly&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, 18\/5\/23; col. 430.]<\/p><p pid=\"a2255.1\/6\">Over the weekend, I was reading the guidance issued in April last year for civil servants who are charged with developing policies such as this one. It says:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a2255.1\/7\">&#8220;Engaging with stakeholders as soon as possible gives them the opportunity to understand what&#8217;s being asked of the service team and why. It&#8217;s also a chance to build trust and understanding of each other&#8217;s needs and ways of working and lets them plan their time and involvement with the project&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a2255.1\/8\">Clearly, that engagement with the stakeholders simply has not happened here. I am not blaming the civil servants; Ministers clearly insisted on this clause going in. The guidance then adds a warning to civil servants to<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a2255.1\/9\">&#8220;think about what your users need, not what government thinks they want&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a2255.1\/10\">It is not as if this was a well-developed policy operating anywhere else. The only territory that has anything like community land auctions is, apparently, Hong Kong, where all land is in public ownership and so is not a great comparator. Some 12 years ago, in his 2011 Budget, George Osborne announced that he would pilot a land auction model. However, no progress was made, possibly because the proposition did not withstand critical scrutiny.<\/p><p pid=\"a2255.1\/11\">Writing in Property Week on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">19 January<\/phrase> this year, Nick Fell said that community land auctions<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a2255.1\/12\">&#8220;have no place in a bill that needs practicality, commitment and delivery while there is still time to get it off the ground &#8230; Community Land Auctions are not a practical solution and we doubt they will have legs&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a2255.1\/13\">The problem with this policy lies in the name: community land auctions. We all know what an auction is&#8212;the winner is the person who makes the highest bid&#8212;so there is a risk that planning decisions will be contaminated by financial inducements. Local authorities will have a financial incentive to designate for planning land over which they have an option, in preference to land over which they have no option, even if that land might be more suitable for development. The proposal works only if there is a proper market and the majority of landowners in an area are prepared to go through the hassle of putting in an option. There is a risk that those with the best sites for development sit on their hands, while those with speculative sites on the margin are the only ones who put in the options. My inquiries with land agents indicate that this is exactly what will happen.<\/p><p pid=\"a2255.1\/14\">At the moment, land is promoted by a landowner, promoter or developer at a significant cost, with a corresponding risk to financial capital, in order to establish that a site is deliverable. That process involves consideration of the land&#8217;s constraints&#8212;flood risk, archaeology, heritage, ecology, highways, topography, drainage, servicing, et cetera&#8212;as well as consideration of the ability of the land to remain viable after applying all the various policy requirements from the planning authority. If the most appropriate sites are to be allocated in local plans, CLAs will have only a limited impact, as landowners are unlikely to sell at any price other than the market price for the land. That is because most sustainably located suitable sites are already likely to be under contract&#8212;by way of an option or promotion agreement&#8212;to a developer, with a requirement to abide by the conditions set by those legal agreements until the point at which they expire. I have been told that the only take-up will be from  landowners with sites that are neither logical nor unconstrained, and which are most likely to be undeliverable or unsustainable as a result.<\/p><p pid=\"a2255.1\/15\">If a landowner thinks that his land is suitable for housing development, why should he not just wait and pocket all the windfall, rather than sharing it with the local authority? Most of them are able to take a long-term view, and that is the Achilles heel of the proposal. The chair of the local authority body, the Planning Officers Society, Mike Kiely, said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a2255.1\/16\">&#8220;In many urban areas, there&#8217;s a real shortage of development sites so those landowners with good sites are unlikely to opt for the CLA process&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a2255.1\/17\">He went on to point out that there is a danger that landowners with poorly located sites, or those on the edge of urban areas, may choose to go for a CLA to improve their chances of getting an allocation in the local plan and offering a generous incentive to the LPA, while the sites that have the better chances do not enter. Of course, local authorities are under enormous financial pressure at the moment.<\/p><p pid=\"a2255.1\/18\">Then there is the issue of the local planning authorities having the skills and human resources, and indeed the financial resources, to undertake the whole CLA process. The representative bodies of the planning authorities have highlighted the issue of increased financial risk in their responses to the recently proposed infrastructure levy. Concerns have also been expressed that the CLA process could slow up plan-making and housebuilding. The amendments to the Bill do not set out any timetable for the CLA process, but it would have to be very swift if preparation of the local plan is not to be delayed, as one commentator has remarked.<\/p><p pid=\"a2255.1\/19\">As we heard in an earlier debate, this is a levelling-up Bill but the most valuable sites are in the better resourced local authorities. Unless receipts from the options are shared, or there is some clawback, which is not proposed, the policy, if it works, will not level up. So this is not just an auction; this is a gamble. We want to make progress with the Bill, so unless I am provoked by an insensitive reply from my noble friend the Minister&#8212;which of itself would be a first&#8212;I do not propose to test the opinion of the House on this. However, I did not want to let the debate on the clause pass without putting on the record the very real reservations that have been expressed by those who will have to operate it.<\/p>",

Gentleman&#8217;s question is that if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it probably is a duck, and the Rwanda plan is so clearly and utterly misconceived, misconstrued and counter-productive. Labour Members like to vote for things that are actually going to work, which is why we simply cannot support that hare-brained scheme.<\/p><p pid=\"d653.1\/2\">With the Minister last week reiterating a deadline of December 2024&#8212;18 months from now&#8212;to lay out what safe and legal routes might look like, and by stating that those routes will not deal with the challenges facing Europe directly, he appears to be reducing the chances of getting the returns deal with the EU that we so urgently need. Let us not forget that this Government sent Britain tumbling out of the Dublin regulations during their botched Brexit negotiations, and it is no surprise that small boat crossings have skyrocketed since then. This Government must prioritise getting that returns deal. We therefore support Lords amendment 102B, which demands that the Government get on with setting out what these safe and legal routes might look like, not only to provide controlled and capped pathways to sanctuary for genuine refugees, but to break that deadlock in the negotiations with the EU over returns.<\/p><p pid=\"d653.1\/3\">I note that the Minister loves to trot out his lines about the Ukraine, Hong Kong and Afghan resettlement schemes, but he neglects to mention that there are now thousands of homeless Ukrainian families, and we have the travesty of thousands of loyal-to-Britain Afghans who are set to be thrown on the streets at the end of August. More than 2,000 Afghans are stuck in Pakistan with the right to come here, but they are not being allowed to do so. He simply must fix those resettlement schemes.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1959.2\/1\">I thank the Minister for those words. I say to my noble friend Lord Davies that there is of course a special place in our hearts for those who see the light, and we are very pleased that the other side&#8217;s loss was definitely our gain. We too wish him a long and happy retirement.<\/p><p pid=\"a1959.2\/2\">Back to the levelling-up Bill&#8212;and I thank the Minister for clearing up the long-standing anomaly relating to the Common Council of the City of London&#8212;my Amendment 62 would require the Government to publish a draft devolution Bill setting out their plans for comprehensive devolution across the United Kingdom to empower all local authorities in a wide range of areas where we know they do not currently have the powers to act for their communities in the way that we know that many councils are keen to do. These powers could include a whole range of areas that would enable councils to support local economic growth and help to rebalance and equalise living standards, potential and opportunity across the UK to ensure that every area gives its residents the best chance of contributing to the post-pandemic, post-Brexit economy, and would bring some much-needed hope back to every corner of the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a1959.2\/3\">The PACAC report governing England from last October set that out very clearly. The key question this raises is whether decisions are being made in the right place to provide effective government to the people of England. We found that the dominant reason for continued overcentralisation is a prevalent culture in Whitehall that is unwilling to let go of its existing levers of power. The trouble with the way that the levelling-up Bill deals with devolution is that it imposes the long arm of Westminster in selecting the chosen few who will benefit from additional powers. In many ways, that has the potential to add to the complexity instead of making the lines of responsibility and accountability clearer. Surely the devolution agenda has now demonstrated that decisions are best taken in the local interest&#8212;for local people, by their local elected representatives. That view was backed up in the Institute for Government&#8217;s recent report, How Can Devolution Deliver Regional Growth in England?, which argued that councils should have greater responsibility for transport, skills and planning to enable them to better support their areas.<\/p><p pid=\"a1959.2\/4\">The draft Bill would set out plans to ensure that the Westminster apron strings were untied for good and a new relationship of mutual respect and trust&#8212;of course, with the appropriate mechanisms for local accountability&#8212;could exist between government and local authorities. That would see an end to the expensive and wasteful bidding bingo to which local authorities are currently subjected just because they have ambitions to make things better for the areas they represent and their local people.<\/p><p pid=\"a1959.2\/5\">Additional powers could relate to, but not be limited to, housing; energy; childcare; transport, including buses and trains&#8212;we have an amendment on bus transport in a later group; and skills, training and employment. Many of those areas will require intense and effective partnership working, but councils are no stranger to that; the financial constraints that councils have been under in recent years have meant that almost nothing can be achieved without working across the public and private sectors and between all local agencies. This would require a new relationship of mutual respect and trust between local and central government.<\/p><p pid=\"a1959.2\/6\">I am sure that many of us hoped that the incredible, extraordinary response that local government delivered during the pandemic and in other recent crises, such as the cost of living crisis and the arrival of refugees from Ukraine, Syria, Hong Kong, Sudan and other places, would encourage the Government to think more broadly and deeply about devolution.<\/p><p pid=\"a1959.2\/7\">There was a powerful debate on local devolution in your Lordships&#8217; House on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">15 June<\/phrase> led by the noble Lord, Lord Shipley. We have already seen the power devolution has to deliver better outcomes for people, places and communities as well as for the economy. A Bill setting out a plan for comprehensive devolution across our country, building on what we have learned already, rather than a piecemeal approach where Whitehall picks the chosen few and keeps them tethered with promises of further jam tomorrow, is long overdue. At the end of the debate on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">15 June<\/phrase>, we were pleased to hear the noble Lord, Lord Evans of Rainow, state:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1959.2\/8\">&#8220;we recognise the importance of local democracy, and that devolution is essential for flourishing local democracy&#8221;. &#8212;[Official Report, 15\/6\/23; col. 2194.]<\/p><p pid=\"a1959.2\/9\">Devolution is a process, not a moment, and the country continues to see the model evolve and the benefits it brings. Let us take that on to its next steps and give local authorities all the powers and encouragement they need to do their best to deliver everything, everywhere, if not quite all at the same time.<\/p>",

I completely accept what my noble friend said about the independence of the judiciary, and I make no criticism whatever of those eminent judges who still function, to a degree, in Hong Kong. But will my noble friend perhaps think of convening a meeting with them? The fact is that they are lending a veneer of respectability to a dire situation. All our hopes were high at the handover in 1997, and they remained so for many years after. But there is now a sinister repression in Hong Kong that completely abrogates the treaty that China and we agreed to. The time has now come when either China has to accept that treaty again or those who are inadvertently giving a veneer of respectability to it cease to do so.<\/p><p pid=\"a1955.0\/3\">I make one final point. My noble friend said that there were no plans to raise this issue at the Security Council during our chairmanship. I would ask that he talks to the Foreign Secretary and rethinks that. This is of enormous importance; we are dealing with the second most important power in the world, after the United States, and we must do everything we can to see that the international rule of law is observed by China, not flagrantly abused, as it is currently.<\/p>",

The handover agreement promised Hong Kong certain liberties and freedoms, with a clear separation between the judicial systems of Hong Kong and the mainland, and the expectation of a move towards full democracy and universal suffrage for the election of a chief executive in the territory of Hong Kong. However, those freedoms have now been comprehensively eroded, with the system in Hong Kong barely distinguishable from that on the mainland and the levels of repression ever increasing.<\/p><p pid=\"b536.1\/3\">The implementation of the national security law is only truly beginning to be felt. It is clear that Beijing is attempting to ensure that its writ is felt not just in Hong Kong but around the world. Just days after the announcement of arrest warrants for Hongkongers abroad&#8212;including some who have sought refuge here in the UK&#8212;the Chinese Government have again demonstrated their intent to harass and intimidate those who bravely resist their steady erosion of the rights promised to the people of Hong Kong in 1997.<\/p><p pid=\"b536.1\/4\">This latest move is particularly chilling. Targeting activists&#8217; families is a sinister step, and it is incumbent on us to renew our condemnation of those actions as one unified voice across this House. However, it is not a surprising move, given that the actions of the Chinese Government have been ratcheting up in the past year, including the beating of demonstrators outside the consulate in Manchester, the bellicose language used against the state&#8217;s opponents and growing accusations of Chinese espionage in the UK. The fear of the many thousands of Hongkongers who have come to this country to seek safety is growing. The knowledge that their families in Hong Kong are seen as fair game by the authorities there demands stringent and urgent action.<\/p><p pid=\"b536.1\/5\">It is over a year since I first urged the Foreign Secretary to bring about cross-Government work to ensure the safety of Hong Kong dissidents here. We have had two further urgent questions on that point,  but today I do not believe the House is satisfied by the Government&#8217;s actions. The complacency cannot continue, given the reports that a Chinese spy attended a briefing here in Parliament just this week. Could the Minister clarify her assessment of that urgent situation? Given the activities of the last week, will she outline what consideration she has given to a sanctioning regime that fits the ratcheting up of pressure on dissidents and those trying to live their lives here in the UK in safety?<\/p><p pid=\"b536.1\/6\">There are steps that the Government should and could take today to send a clear signal to Beijing that those actions will not be tolerated. The Minister should take them. I said it last week and I will say it again: it is time for the Government to grow a backbone.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>The Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament (ISC) has today laid before Parliament a report examining the threat posed by the Chinese authorities and the United Kingdom&#8217;s response. I welcome the report and thank the committee for its efforts.<\/p><p>China poses an epoch-defining challenge to the international order. Under the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) it is becoming more authoritarian at home and more assertive overseas. We have been clear that our approach to China must therefore be rooted in our national interest and coordinated with like-minded partners.<\/p><p>The committee&#8217;s inquiry began in 2019 and took the bulk of its evidence in 2020, predating both the Integrated Review 2021 and the Integrated Review Refresh 2023. These are both comprehensive national security and international policy reviews that considerably strengthen our position on China. The government has already taken actions that are in line with many of the committee&#8217;s recommendations.<\/p><p>The Integrated Review 2021 articulated the United Kingdom&#8217;s robust stance towards China. It highlighted China&#8217;s increasing international assertiveness and identified it as the biggest state-based comprehensive threat to the United Kingdom&#8217;s economic security. It placed greater emphasis on defending our interests and values while preserving the potential for cooperation on shared interests.<\/p><p>The Integrated Review Refresh 2023 went further still, responding to subsequent changes in the strategic environment. In the IRR, the government recognised China as a systemic challenge with implications for almost every area of government policy and the everyday lives of the British people. The IRR also recognised China&#8217;s size and significance on almost every global issue, and set out the UK&#8217;s preference for better cooperation, understanding, predictability and stability with China.<\/p><p>Responding to this systemic challenge, the Government committed to:<\/p><ul><li>greater national security protections to safeguard the United Kingdom&#8217;s people, prosperity and security, including to communities now at home in Britain;<\/li><li>deeper cooperation and closer alignment with allies and partners to push back against behaviours that undermine international law, violate human rights and seek to coerce other sovereign nations; and<\/li><li>engagement with China bilaterally and in international fora to preserve and strengthen open, constructive, predictable, and stable relations.<\/li><\/ul><p>We are improving our understanding of interference in our society and our values and taking action to address it, whatever its source.<\/p><ul><li>We have passed the National Security Act 2023, which, in addition to helping us meet several of the committee&#8217;s recommendations on China, fulfils a number of commitments we made following publication of the committee&#8217;s 2020 Russia Report. The Act constitutes the most significant overhaul of our national security law in more than a century. It will put us ahead of many of our partners in enabling our law enforcement agencies and the security and intelligence services to deter, detect and disrupt the full range of modern day threats, including from China. In addition to modernising the offence of espionage, it introduces a range of new offences for foreign interference, assisting a foreign intelligence service, sabotage and theft of trade secrets, creates modernised and extended &#8220;acts preparatory&#8221; offences and creates enhanced investigatory powers.<\/li><li>The foreign interference offence created by the National Security Act will be added to the list of priority offences in the Online Safety Bill. This means social media platforms, search engines and other apps and websites allowing people to post their own content will have a legal duty to take proactive, preventative action to identify and minimise people&#8217;s exposure to state-sponsored or state-linked disinformation aimed at interfering with the United Kingdom, including from China.<\/li><li>We set up the Defending Democracy Taskforce in 2022 to lead work across government to secure the integrity of our democracy. This includes coordinating work to ensure the safety and security of our elections; tackling disinformation, working with Parliament on enhanced cyber security measures for parliamentarians; and leading a review into how we can protect diaspora communities in the United Kingdom from foreign attempts at control (so-called transnational repression).<\/li><li>We passed the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023 to further protect our campuses from threats to lawful freedom of speech, whether those relate to China or any other source. We have already appointed the first Director for Freedom of Speech and Academic Freedom at the Office for Students. The remit of this new role is to promote the importance of freedom of speech and academic freedom on campus and to have responsibility for investigating infringements of freedom of speech duties in higher education, with new sanctions or options for individual redress. We are also removing all government funding from Confucius Institutes in the United Kingdom.<\/li><\/ul><p>We have protected against threats to our economic security, wherever they come from. This includes taking steps to reduce reliance on Chinese technology and secure our critical national infrastructure against interference and evolving cyber threats.<\/p><ul><li>We have tightened our scrutiny of foreign investment in the United Kingdom, through the creation and use of new powers under the National Security and Investment Act (NSIA) 2021, allowing us to take a broader approach than many other countries. Our Annual Report shows that in 2022&#8211;23 we received 866 notifications and issued 15 final orders blocking, unwinding or attaching conditions to deals, of which eight had an acquirer linked to China.<\/li><li>We have banned Huawei from the nation&#8217;s 5G network, creating one of the toughest telecoms security regimes in the world.<\/li><li>We have reduced Chinese involvement in the civil nuclear sector, including taking ownership of the stake in the Sizewell C nuclear power project previously held by the Chinese state-owned company CGN.<\/li><li>We are committed to removing surveillance technology from sensitive areas of the government estate.<\/li><li>We have created the National Protective Security Authority to help British start-ups, academia and other organisations defend themselves against national security threats, by providing training and advice on how to harden their defences against threats posed by states, including theft of international property, exploiting academic research and deceptive use of professional networking sites to acquire sensitive information.<\/li><li>We signed a bilateral agreement setting out acceptable behaviour in cyberspace with China in 2015. As a responsible cyber power, we will continue to hold China accountable. This includes in July 2021, joining with international partners to publicly confirm that Chinese state-backed actors were responsible for the Microsoft Exchange servers attack that took place in early 2021, as well as other malicious cyber activity.<\/li><li>Our National Cyber Security Centre has shared regular technical advisories, drafted in close partnership with our international partners, to identify and provide the technical insight to detect and remediate specific state-sponsored malicious cyber activity. This includes working with agencies in the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand to issue a technical advisory in May 2023 to help organisations detect Chinese state-sponsored activity against critical national infrastructure networks.<\/li><\/ul><p>We have protected our academic and research sectors and addressed the risk of sensitive technology transfer.<\/p><ul><li>We have led the international community by tightening our export controls regime and adding China to the list of destinations subject to military end-use controls.<\/li><li>We launched the Trusted Research initiative to secure the integrity of international research collaboration, which is vital to the nation's research and innovation sector.<\/li><li>We have established the Research Collaboration Advice Team (RCAT) to provide tailored advice to researchers and institutions on how to manage national security risks in international collaborations. Since its launch in March 2022, RCAT has engaged over 130 research institutions and addressed over 350 specific queries, resulting in targeted mitigations of national security concerns.<\/li><li>We have expanded the Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) to include new areas of sensitive technology and to cover both researchers and post-graduate students. This allows us to tighten the screening of academics and researchers in sensitive fields and avoid transfer of sensitive material and knowledge.<\/li><\/ul><p>We continue to act in concert with our international partners, including to highlight and address human rights issues.<\/p><ul><li>We have continued to raise concerns about China&#8217;s human rights violations, including leading international condemnation of China over Hong Kong with G7 and Five Eyes partners, securing joint statements on Xinjiang at the UN and sanctioning Chinese government officials for violations against Uyghurs and other minorities.<\/li><li>We also introduced a bespoke immigration route for British National (Overseas) status holders from Hong Kong. As of 31 March 2023, we had approved 166,420 applications from BN(O) status holders to live in the United Kingdom. We also have suspended our extradition treaty with Hong Kong and extended our arms embargo on China to include Hong Kong.<\/li><\/ul><p>To support all this, we have increased investment in the capabilities that help us to understand and adapt to China&#8212;doubling funding for these across government. We have made particular efforts to align our approach with our closest allies and partners, including those in the United States, Europe, Australia, Canada and Japan.<\/p><p>We are grateful for the tireless work of our security and intelligence services to protect national security at home and abroad.<\/p><p>We are not complacent and we are keenly aware that there is more to do.<\/p><p>Wherever China&#8217;s actions or intent threaten the national interest, we will continue to take swift action. We welcome the committee and Parliament&#8217;s scrutiny and the proposals for further action. They are rightly challenging. We are alive to the need to make effective use of the new legislation and powers that we have introduced and to continue adapting our approach and actions to meet the challenge that China presents. In concert with our international partners we will continue to engage with China to preserve and create space for open, constructive, predictable and stable relations that reflect China&#8217;s significance in world affairs and to ensure our interests and those of our allies are best advanced.<\/p><p>The Government will consider the committee&#8217;s recommendations and conclusions with care to assess where further action should be taken. We will publish a full response in due course and in the usual manner.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1863.3\/1\">My Lords, I am grateful for the debates we have had on safe and legal routes and their importance. As has been stated hitherto, the Government are committed to providing safe and legal routes, and we recognise the United Kingdom&#8217;s role in providing protection for those in need.<\/p><p pid=\"a1863.3\/2\">The United Kingdom has been proud to offer for many years a range of global resettlement routes as part of our safe and legal offer. Our global resettlement schemes offer safety in the United Kingdom to refugees who have been displaced by conflict, violence and persecution, and identified by the UNHCR as the most in need of resettlement. Beside our global schemes, we also offer country-specific safe and legal routes for those from Afghanistan, Hong Kong and Ukraine.<\/p><p pid=\"a1863.3\/3\">I share fully my noble friend Lady Stroud&#8217;s desire, and indeed that of other noble Lords across the House, to do more as capacity permits. As such, we have committed to publish a report on existing and any proposed additional safe and legal routes. We have also committed to lay this report before Parliament within six months of the Bill achieving Royal Assent. These commitments are now enshrined in the Bill. In the report, we will set out any proposed additional safe and legal routes alongside our existing routes so that proposals can be considered in the round to help us identify any areas which may not be best served through our existing routes.<\/p><p pid=\"a1863.3\/4\">As has been explained previously, the Immigration Minister has committed to implement any proposed safe and legal routes as soon as practicable and, in any event, before the end of 2024. Minister Jenrick reiterated that commitment in the other place yesterday and I am happy to repeat it to your Lordships today. I might add that that is a commitment on behalf of His Majesty&#8217;s Government and not just by an individual Minister. I hope my noble friend will accept that I cannot speak for the Opposition in that regard.<\/p><p pid=\"a1863.3\/5\">My noble friend stated on Report that eight months is more than enough time to develop and implement a serious proposal. However, it is important that we dedicate sufficient time for this. To ensure that any new route is implemented effectively, it is important that we follow a proper process, thus avoiding any issues that could significantly negatively impact on some truly vulnerable people. Therefore, I submit that  we should continue to work to the timeframe to which the Immigration Minister has committed. A matter of a few months at most, maybe less, is not so great in the scheme of things, but ensuring a proper and considered development, followed by a smooth implementation, of any new safe and legal route could make all the difference to those who come through it.<\/p><p pid=\"a1863.3\/6\">Ultimately, I believe that the country needs to have a full consideration of how it needs its safe and legal routes to work, which will come through the report and subsequently through proper implementation of any new routes. This is the right way to ensure that we continue to provide sanctuary to those in need of international protection as part of a well-managed and sustainable migration system.<\/p><p pid=\"a1863.3\/7\">I hope that, on this basis, my noble friend and, indeed, the whole House will be content to agree Motion W. I beg to move.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c94.1\/1\">Sunday, in fact. The CPTPP involves no interference in our domestic affairs or our judicial processes, and no membership fees of &#163;200 million a week&#8212;just pure trading. It is so exciting for the British people to enter a market that is growing at a phenomenal rate.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/2\">The second achievement, AUKUS&#8212;the new naval agreement with America and Australia&#8212;gives us the opportunity with our allies to re-enter the Indian and Pacific oceans in a meaningful way, for the first time in my lifetime. The British media&#8217;s obsession with scandal and petty domestic issues is of great regret to me, because it does not focus on the extraordinary achievements of the CPTPP and AUKUS. When we go to the Dog and Duck in our constituencies, how many people come up to us and talk to us about AUKUS or the CPTPP? Nobody comes to talk to me about those things in my surgery or the local pub, and yet I feel passionately about them because they signal a huge pivot for Britain away from this obsession with our inconsequential continent, which is shrinking every day as a percentage of global population and GDP, and instead towards the far east, where the real growth is, not just for ourselves but for future generations of British businesspeople and entrepreneurs.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/3\">We now have a Mongolian intern in my office on a three-month secondment: Lomax Amarsaikhan, who studied at the University of Bristol. He is writing a report about British entry into the CPTPP and whether Mongolia ought to emulate us. I would like to ask you, Mr Gray, and others participating in the debate who have experience of how Britain signed membership of that very important organisation, and the logistics and wherewithal of our experience of entering the CPTPP, to contact Lomax. He will spend the next two months  with me, writing that report in Mongolian and English. It will be presented to the Mongolian Parliament, so that we can share with the Mongolians our experience of entering this huge new bloc and encourage them to consider whether it would be suitable for them to follow us.<\/p><p class=\"italic\" pid=\"c94.1\/4\">[Sir Roger Gale in the Chair]<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/5\">There are 195 countries in the world, yet only one has no coastline, with the Russians to the north and the Chinese to the south: Mongolia. What an extraordinary situation. More than any other countries in the world, Russia and China use brutality to oppress and subjugate their neighbours. They bully their neighbours and steal territory without remorse. That is quite extraordinary, given their status as permanent members of the UN Security Council. One would think that the five countries with the extraordinary privilege of being permanent members of the UN Security Council would be at the forefront of trying to uphold an international rules-based order predicated on the rule of law, democracy, human rights and all the other attributes of modern democratic societies and modern international relations that we feel so strongly about. Yet the Russians and the Chinese are doing the exact opposite: contravening the rules and regulations of the UN, the European Court of Justice and the International Court of Justice and trying to manipulate and threaten their neighbours.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/6\">Mongolia is a beacon of hope and democracy in that region. So many countries in that region&#8212;Russia, China, Burma&#8212;are oppressing their people. The reason I am so excited about Mongolia and feel so strongly about that nation is that despite its being subjugated by the Soviet Union as a satellite state and spending decades under a brutal, oppressive communist regime, whenever I go there I see the thirst and determination to grasp and nourish democracy and try to create a genuine democratic society in which there is rule of law and freedom of the press, and in which people can criticise politicians and get rid of them at elections.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/7\">We must support countries such as Mongolia, despite all the provocations from some neighbours and their past difficulties. We must support them economically and from a security perspective. For me, China is the biggest threat. I started to ask questions about China&#8217;s conduct in the South China sea seven years ago, of the then Foreign Secretary, Mr Hammond. I asked what the British Government&#8217;s attitude was to the Chinese seizure of hundreds of atolls in the South China sea&#8212;stealing them from Brunei, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and others and militarising the whole of the South China sea, a waterway through which 60% of the world&#8217;s trade passes.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/8\">The response from the Foreign Secretary and the Foreign Office, which is indelibly imprinted on my mind, was that they do not take a view on the dispute of uninhabited atolls in the South China sea. I very much regret that answer, because I feel that the militarisation of the South China sea and our turning a blind eye to the Chinese stealing hundreds of atolls, pouring concrete on them and militarising the area are the thin end of the wedge. They give the communists succour and the ability to know that they can continue to push the boundaries in their expansionist policies in the region.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/9\">It is not just the South China sea. We all know the situation with Taiwan and the difficulties that the Taiwanese Government are experiencing. We know that the Chinese have trashed the agreement over Hong Kong that they signed with Margaret Thatcher in December 1984. We had a debate in the House the other day about the subjugation of democracy rights activists in Hong Kong. We know the allegations regarding the brutal suppression of the Uyghurs and, of course, the situation in Tibet.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/10\">Two gentlemen, Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, made the biggest mistake in their determination to cosy up to the Chinese, because of the dollar, the huge power of the Chinese and their ability to invest money and provide big markets. We are rightly critical of other countries because of their human rights abuses, but we have turned a blind eye to the Chinese and their conduct. The mistake made by Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne was profound. I hope that this Government and subsequent Governments will be more adroit and more courageous in ensuring that we start to divest ourselves of our extraordinary overdependence on imports from China.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/11\">When I asked the former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how we were going to become less dependent on China, she said one word: CPTPP. By entering the CPTPP, we enter a market in which 99% of goods will be traded tariff-free. What is it that we currently import from the Chinese that we cannot import from the Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese, Singaporeans, Malaysians and others? That is the message that I want to get across to the Minister. I want us to use our entry into the CPTPP to encourage countries such as Mongolia to join us&#8212;fellow democracies like Mongolia and people who believe in the things that we do&#8212;in the new trading bloc. I want us to use our position to try to restrict Chinese entry into the CPTPP unless China starts to behave in a different way towards its indigenous population and its neighbours.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/12\">When I visited Mongolia, I was taken to the Gobi desert to inspect the Rio Tinto copper mine. Rio Tinto, based up the road in St James&#8217;s Square, is a major Anglo-Australian mining company. I spent the afternoon inspecting the world&#8217;s third largest copper mine in the world, the Oyu Tolgoi Rio Tinto mine in the Gobi desert. I was taken 1.5 km underground and spent the afternoon inspecting the honeycomb labyrinth of tunnels that make up the world&#8217;s third largest copper mine. It has an investment of over $15 billion and a massive impact on the Mongolian economy.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/13\">One thing I was particularly pleased to see was that 97% of all the mineworkers were Mongolian and that the mine had won major international environmental awards for the way that it mined and looked after the area in which it was mining. That has a hugely important economic benefit for Mongolia. I am proud and privileged to have played a small part in the negotiations between the Mongolian Government and Rio Tinto in reassessing and modernising the agreement so that it is now a win-win for both sides.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/14\">Let us not forget that only 7% of Mongolia has been explored. We already see vast opportunities in the mining sector, yet only 7% of this jurisdiction has been explored. The Mongolians are mining the copper and it is going straight across the border to the Chinese in its lowest-value form. It goes in huge railway compartments across the  border to China, which, as the Minister knows, is so thirsty for all minerals. It seems to devour all these things so quickly.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/15\">I say publicly to the Minister that the way to compete against the Chinese in Mongolia is by demonstrating to our Mongolian friends and partners that we want a genuine win-win partnership rather than the exploitative type of approach that they have experienced in the past. I am talking to UK Export Finance about the possibility of trying to bring British technology and expertise in copper smelting and refining. What better way to send a signal to the Mongolians that we are interested in increasing their economy, bringing added value to their output and giving them the power of having that processing industry in their own country, not just for Rio Tinto but for many other mining jurisdictions across the country?<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/16\">We have the opportunity to say to the Mongolians, &#8220;We are going to work with you. We are going to bring in this technology and, potentially, we are going to finance it.&#8221; I have &#163;2 billion burning a hole in my pocket at the moment. I do not often say that, but that is what I have generously been given by the Minister&#8217;s Department and UK Export Finance for cheap soft credit loans to facilitate British entities operating in and exporting to Mongolia. The solution need only have a minimum of 20% British content, but it is a huge opportunity for us. I pay tribute to UK Export Finance, in front of the Minister.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/17\">My interactions with Mr Tim Reid, the chief executive of UK Export Finance, have been tremendous. He and his team are very agile and adept at meeting and trying to work productively and effectively with us trade envoys to provide additional resource and opportunities for us to promote British exports with those additional soft loans and credit, which are extremely important. Can I please ask the Minister to take an interest as I progress with others in trying to bring British expertise into the Mongolian copper refinery industry? I will keep her up to date on my meetings with the chief executive of UK Export Finance, to let her know the progress on what I consider to be probably the single most important economic solution on which we can work together with the Mongolians to bring value-added processing to their copper industry.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/18\">The second issue is the capital, Ulaanbaatar. It is a beautiful city, which I have had the honour of visiting on four separate occasions. Mongolia is a huge jurisdiction with massive opportunities but a tiny population of only 3 million. I think it is going to be the next United Arab Emirates, Kuwait or Qatar within our children&#8217;s lifetime, not from oil but from minerals. Such is the wealth of the country, and so small is its population, that there is a genuine opportunity to create huge prosperity.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/19\">I look forward to the Minister&#8217;s visit to Ulaanbaatar, which she has promised to make at some stage; as she will see, it is one of the most congested cities in the world. Unfortunately, the Mongolians have one of the highest cancer rates in the world as a result of the extraordinary pollution in that city. I have been warned not to go in January and February, not only because it is about minus 40&#176;C, but because of the huge amount of pollution in the city as a result of the congestion.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/20\">The Mongolians have asked us to look at working with them to build a ring road around Ulaanbaatar&#8212;not quite an M25, but a ring road. That is their most important strategic project, because they can see that  their capital city is slowly being choked off. It is expanding extremely quickly and cannot cope with the level of congestion, which is causing them a significant problem. I say to those watching on television who have expertise in the construction, architecture or design of such arteries, or in any aspect of construction, please contact my office. As we continue to engage with the Mongolians, we would be very interested in providing them with the maximum number of British solutions possible, and that project could be financed by UK Export Finance.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/21\">I move on to critical minerals. I have already spoken extensively of my concerns about China&#8217;s brutal communist regime. As one of the Tory MPs sanctioned by Russia, I have already been banned from entering that country. The Chinese have already threatened to ban me from China if I continue to express anti-Chinese sentiments in the House. Perhaps this will tip me over the edge. I would be proud to join other Tory MPs who have been sanctioned in that way by the Chinese and the Russians.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/22\">China controls 80% of the world&#8217;s rare earth minerals. I want people to remember that for a second&#8212;it is extraordinary. We went to war in &#8217;56 in Suez because of our misunderstanding that Nasser would restrict the flow of oil. We were so profoundly concerned about our industry collapsing as a result of the restriction of that vital commodity that we went to war. It backfired on us spectacularly, but we are entering a period when critical minerals will have even more significance for our economy than oil did in the 1950s&#8212;I am absolutely convinced of that. When flying back to Heathrow across the North sea, we see the thousands of wind turbines that we are building. We have more offshore wind than any other country in Europe, yet not a single one of those turbines can operate without a magnet. That magnet is made from rare earth minerals.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/23\">How can we keep our wind turbines, cars and most of the economy and industry going in future without rare earth minerals? They will be hugely important and I am pleased that, as the Minister will know, we have a dedicated Minister for rare earth mineral strategy: the Minister for Industry and Economic Security, my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Nusrat Ghani\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25354\">the Member for Wealden (Ms Ghani)<\/phrase>. I am also talking to her about this issue.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/24\">When one country controls 80% of the world&#8217;s rare earth minerals, particularly a country as nefarious as China, we and future Governments need to start thinking about a strategy on becoming less dependent on the Chinese. At some stage in our lifetimes, they will threaten us by restricting access to rare earth minerals. I do not know when that will come&#8212;maybe over difficulties concerning Taiwan or difficulties with our freedom of navigation exercises in the South China sea; the only thing keeping that sea open is the implementation of those exercises by Britain and America. I do not know when the conflict will come, but I do know that, given the nature of the communist regime in China, it will attempt to restrict access to those vital minerals at some stage in the future.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/25\">We need to find alternatives, such as the mine in Mongolia that can potentially produce 10% of the world&#8217;s rare earth minerals. I have met representatives of the British company that owns the mine&#8212;they are based here in London&#8212;and I am very encouraged about the opportunities to exploit it, in collaboration with our Mongolian friends and allies, so that we can be less dependent on the Chinese.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/26\">The issue is not just about mining the rare earth minerals. We are bringing British processing industry to Mongolia to turn those minerals into magnets so that they can be air-freighted directly to Britain. That is the future. Relying on imports through China is no longer acceptable, whether from Kazakhstan or Mongolia. The next stage is for us to bring British processing industry to Mongolia. Again, that is a win-win situation for our Mongolian allies and ourselves, when it comes to turning the rare earth minerals into magnets. It is commercially viable, as the Minister will know, to air-freight magnets from a foreign jurisdiction directly to the United Kingdom, which would give us supplies of that vital commodity in the eventuality of difficulties or tension with the communist People&#8217;s Republic of China.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/27\">Before I finish, let me add a word about JCB, an extremely important British company based in Staffordshire, the county next to mine. No organisation or company better exemplifies the opportunities for British products in a country such as Mongolia. I visited the JCB dealership in Ulaanbaatar and met Gerry, the Mongolian gentleman who runs it with his wife and family. In the past eight years, the dealership has gone from 0% to over 25% market share for these sorts of machines in the mining industry in Mongolia.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/28\">I asked Gerry, &#8220;How do you do it? How do you compete against the machines from China? The Chinese just have a border to cross; we have to build these things in Staffordshire and get them across the world.&#8221; Gerry said it was about two things: the quality of the British goods and the after-sales service. We test these machines to destruction. The durability of the British products and the after-sales service are what differentiates British products from Chinese ones. That is what has given us such a competitive advantage over our Chinese competitors.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/29\">I was so impressed by Gerry and his team that on my last visit I invited the Mongolian Deputy Prime Minister to visit the dealership; I hope that the Minister visits it when she goes to Ulaanbaatar. Everything there is British-made&#8212;from the factory to the workshops and the areas where the goods are on display. There is even a golf driving range for customers that was built and designed by British architects and manufacturers. If we could bottle Gerry&#8217;s enthusiasm for selling British products, we would make a fortune. He is so proud of his partnership with the United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/30\">We need more political focus on Mongolia, and I have outlined to the Minister why Mongolia is so important. Earlier this year, I was in Kazakhstan as an election observer in Astana. While I was there, the Foreign Secretary visited Astana and signed some important agreements with this other extremely important democratic country. Kazakhstan is very similar to Mongolia: it has extraordinarily high levels of mineral production and is a post-Soviet satellite state, but it is a country that is inching its way towards democracy and the rule of law. I was impressed by what I saw as an election observer in Astana&#8212;genuine freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Mongolia and Kazakhstan, side by side, are the exciting democratic flowers that we need to water, nurture and bring into our rules-based order of democracy and freedom. They are two fascinating countries&#8212;  Mongolia and Kazakhstan, side by side&#8212;and there is no greater contrast than that between them and Russia and China.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/31\">The other day, I briefed the Foreign Secretary about the need for him to visit Ulaanbaatar, and he promised that he would consider that. I hope that the Minister will take that away with her. She can see my motivation and genuine excitement about the country. Will she engage with the Foreign Office and the Prime Minister about the possibility of a state visit for the President of Mongolia, or the possibility of our own Prime Minister inviting the Mongolian Prime Minister to the United Kingdom?<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/32\">Ulaanbaatar was flooded recently, and yesterday my Mongolian intern showed me a video of the destruction and devastation of Ulaanbaatar&#8212;some of the worst floods that the city has had for many years. I hope that when the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office looks at international aid, it looks a countries such as Mongolia. I want a team of British hydrologists and flooding experts at least to visit Mongolia and engage with the Mayor of Ulaanbaatar so that we can see how we can support our Mongolian friends and allies in dealing with what they perceive to be one of their biggest threats: their inability to control the flooding.<\/p><p class=\"italic\" pid=\"c94.1\/33\">[Carolyn Harris in the Chair]<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/34\">As the Minister will know from my Prime Minister&#8217;s questions, I always refer to the fact that my town, Shrewsbury, is flooded every year. We are working on a holistic solution to managing the River Severn and I chair the caucus of 42 MPs through whose constituencies the river flows. She will know the nightmare and devastation caused by a community&#8217;s flooding every year. That affects our friends in Ulaanbaatar, and I hope the Minister will take note.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/35\">When the Minister visits Mongolia, I will make sure she meets the only female governor in Mongolia&#8217;s 21 provinces, Bolormaa Enkhbat. She was chief of staff to the Mongolian Prime Minister and is now the country&#8217;s first and only female governor. She invited me to her province of Khovd, near Kazakhstan, which meant a three-and-a-half-hour flight from Ulaanbaatar. I was extremely impressed as she showed me around many opportunities for investment in her province. I very much hope the Minister will meet her.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/36\">Another thing I saw in the province, and which I hope the Minister will be able to see, is a hydroelectric power station built by the Chinese 10 years before my visit. I had never seen anything like it. I spent an afternoon walking around it and was blown away by the poor finish and poor quality. It is almost designed to fail&#8212;or disintegrate&#8212;at some stage. It would not pass muster here in the United Kingdom in a month of Sundays. If we are to compete against the Chinese on infrastructure projects such as that one, it is important we bring that expertise.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/37\">I want to pay tribute to Philip Malone, the outgoing British ambassador, who has had a career in the Foreign Office lasting more than 40 years. His first posting was in 1983 in Argentina, so we can imagine what a difficult slot that was. We did not have relations after the Falklands war and relations were done through the Swiss embassy. The professionalism and conduct of British ambassadors when one is overseas always gives one a tremendous  pride in one&#8217;s own country. Our ambassadors&#8212;the men and women privileged to do that role&#8212;are the best, and Philip Malone has been exceptional. I also welcome the incoming British ambassador, Ms Fiona Blyth, who is the first female British ambassador to Mongolia. I had the honour of meeting her recently, and I wish her every success in future.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/38\">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"James Gray\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10240\">the Member for North Wiltshire (James Gray)<\/phrase>, the chairman of the all-party parliamentary group for Mongolia, who does a great deal in promoting bilateral relations. I also pay tribute to the former Labour MP John Grogan, who tells me he is busy campaigning in Selby today and who I think will stand in Keighley at the next general election. He does a tremendous job as chairman of the Mongolian British chamber of commerce. I also want to thank Kevin Ringham, the civil servant who runs the Prime Minister&#8217;s trade envoy programme.<\/p><p pid=\"c94.1\/39\">Mrs Harris, you have been the third Chair today, so I cannot say it has been a great privilege to serve under your chairmanship only, as you have been there only part of the time. I hope the Minister realises how being trade envoy has given me a huge enthusiasm for Mongolia. It is a very important democratic partner for the United Kingdom and I look forward to her work and that of the Government in continuing to nurture relations with Ulaanbaatar.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"e233.0\/1\">I will begin with Lords amendment 2, which would remove the retroactivity provisions that state that the Bill would apply to anyone who arrived on or after <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">7 March 2023<\/phrase>, which is the date that the Bill was introduced in the House. There is a good reason generally why we do not allow legislation to apply retrospectively: so that there is legal certainty and people are bound only by the obligations that apply at the time. I accept without reservation that the law would be in disarray, for example, if new criminal offences had retrospective effect and people found themselves criminalised for things that they could not possibly have known to be unlawful at the time.<\/p><p pid=\"e233.0\/2\">I respectfully submit, however, that this is not that kind of point. There is no principled argument to be made. First, the Government made it clear that the date the Bill was introduced was the same date on which it would become effective. Secondly, a person cannot argue  in any compelling way that they decided to make an illegal crossing to the United Kingdom in March because they believed that they might end up in a hotel in Southampton, but now that they know they might have ended up going to Rwanda, they would not have made the illegal crossing. I am afraid that that argument does not work at all. I accept the Government&#8217;s position that the only way in which the policy will have the desired deterrent effect is if it has retrospective effect, so that we do not create perverse incentives for people smugglers to surge the crossings immediately before the Bill receives Royal Assent.<\/p><p pid=\"e233.0\/3\">The second tranche of Lords amendments includes those that the Immigration Minister identified as wrecking amendments&#8212;amendments 1, 7, 90 and 93&#8212;and I will deal with them collectively. Lords amendment 7 seeks to strike out clause 4(1)(d), which states that removal should take effect irrespective of whether there is a judicial review application. Lords amendment 90 seeks to strike out clause 52, which states that interim orders may not halt deportation. Lords amendment 93 seeks to strike out removal pending an age verification appeal.<\/p><p pid=\"e233.0\/4\">There is a wider point about those amendments. Collectively, they seek to dilute the deterrent effect of all removal provisions. Whatever we disagree on in this Chamber concerning current migration, we can probably achieve a consensus on one point: this situation will not get any easier to resolve. Whether the UNHCR is correct in saying that there are 100 million displaced people, or whether there are tens of millions, the reality is that famine, climate change, flooding and conflict will result in more and more people leaving their countries of origin to try to come elsewhere.<\/p><p pid=\"e233.0\/5\">Any nation that tries to resolve the situation in its domestic arrangements will have to follow a strategy similar to the one that the Government are pursuing. The first element of that strategy is to decide on a cap for admissions and then&#8212;likely with UNHCR support in the future&#8212;to give proper consideration in advance to who should come under the quota scheme. The current schemes that are working very well in relation to Ukraine, Afghanistan and Hong Kong provide a good starting point. The second element is to deter all illegal migration by ensuring, with only the narrowest of exceptions, that an individual gains absolutely nothing from doing this.<\/p><p pid=\"e233.0\/6\">The objective of the Illegal Migration Bill and, by extension, the Rwanda scheme is to remove illegal immigrants quickly without prejudice to their wider right to challenge the deportation order later, because the rationale is that speedy deportation deters others from coming to the country. Many eminent people agree with that proposition.

            "body": "<p pid=\"e211.3\/1\">No, I do not agree with the right hon. Gentleman. I think there is a role for safe, legal routes, and I want the UK to be respected internationally for the way in which we support those seeking sanctuary. That is what we have ensured in recent years by creating world-leading schemes, such as those for Ukraine, Syria and Hong Kong, and indeed there is also the global scheme, which is operated by the UNHCR. I do not accept the argument that I think he is advancing, which is that if we produce a larger safe and legal route to the United Kingdom, it will lead to a reduction in the number of individuals crossing illegally in small boats. The individuals we would likely bring to the United Kingdom under a safe and legal route are quite different, in the main, from those coming across in small boats. Most of our small boat arrivals are young men in their 20s and 30s who are already in a place of safety&#8212;France&#8212;with a fully functioning asylum system. The kind of scheme the Government envisage for safe and legal routes is one where we take families and vulnerable people directly from conflict zones or refugee camps elsewhere in the world. That is a very different system from offering a safe and legal route to predominantly young men in a place of safety to come to the United Kingdom. That does not denude the value of having safe and legal routes, but the purpose is different.<\/p><p pid=\"e211.3\/2\">Lords amendment 103 relates to the functions of the National Crime Agency, and I am afraid that it just amounts to legislative grandstanding. The NCA&#8217;s statutory functions already cover tackling organised immigration crime. As such, the amendment simply risks undermining  the operational independence of the director general by tying his hands as to how to organise the NCA to best deliver its objectives. As I said in answer to an earlier question, our colleagues at the NCA who work every day on organised immigration crime would be very surprised to hear the contention that they are not focused on this work, because they certainly are.<\/p><p pid=\"e211.3\/3\">Finally, Lords amendment 104, which was tabled by the Archbishop of Canterbury, is well-meaning but unnecessary. It is a distraction from the immediate priority of stopping the boats and tackling the threat to life arising from dangerous, illegal and unnecessary channel crossings. That is the aim of the Bill, and the Lords amendment does not reflect the actions that we have already taken through cross-Government initiatives to tackle the refugee crisis and through the ongoing work to deliver our strategic approach to tackling human trafficking. Moreover, it does not recognise how this country has responded to the result of crises, offering sanctuary to over 550,000 people through safe and legal routes since 2015.<\/p><p pid=\"e211.3\/4\">By getting a grip on illegal migration, we aim to reduce the pressure that it places on our public services and on community cohesion and to increase the capacity to support those who seek sanctuary here in the UK. The stop-the-boats Bill is designed to ensure that the UK can be an even greater force for good in the world by using our finite resources on those who truly need it.<\/p><p pid=\"e211.3\/5\">In conclusion, it is vital that this Bill reaches the statute book quickly and in a form that will stop the boats. It is riddled with exceptions and get-out clauses placed in it by the other place. If they remain, it will simply not work. We have to send a clear message back to the other place that it is now their turn to think again and to respect the will of the elected House. The public expect us to tackle this issue, to secure our borders and to stop the boats.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1331.0\/1\">My Lords, Amendments 3 to 5 to Clause 164 are in my name. They relate to a matter that I raised in Committee: threats of a more indirect nature. As I explained at that time, I chaired an inquiry in Scotland into misogyny and the manifestations of deeply unpleasant behaviour that women experience, some of it in the public arena and some of it online.<\/p><p pid=\"a1331.0\/2\">Based on that experience, I came to realise that many women who are parliamentarians, are in local authorities, head up NGOs or are journalists and, for some reason, annoy or irritate certain users of social media in any way receive horrible threats. We know about those from the ugly nature of the threats that Diane Abbott and many women parliamentarians have received. Sometimes, the person making the threat does not directly say, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to rape you&#8221;&#8212;although sometimes they do: Joanna Cherry, a Scottish Member of Parliament here in Westminster, received a direct threat of rape and the person who threatened was convicted under the Communications Act. Very often, threats of rape, death or disfigurement sound like, &#8220;You think you&#8217;re so pretty. We can fix that. Somebody should fix that&#8221;. It is the indirect nature of the threat that provides comfort to the person making it. They imagine that they cannot be prosecuted because they are not saying that they will do it; they are saying, &#8220;Somebody should rape you. Somebody should just eliminate you. Somebody should take that smile off your face; a bit of acid could do it&#8221;. That is how many of the threats presented by witnesses to the inquiry&#8212;we saw them on their phones and computers&#8212;were made; they were of an indirect nature.<\/p><p pid=\"a1331.0\/3\">One woman in my own chambers is acting for Jimmy Lai, the Hong Kong publisher who is currently in custody awaiting trial under the national security law. She has received death threats, threats against her children and threats of rape. I do not imagine that we can inhibit what is done by people under the auspices of the Chinese Government with this legislation; all I can say is that these sorts of threats are experienced by many women and are not always of a direct nature so the law often does not encapsulate them. I am seeking to introduce some way in which we could, through careful drafting, cover the possibilities.<\/p><p pid=\"a1331.0\/4\">Take someone such as Andrew Tate: he is a good example of someone with a massive following who clearly puts out to boys and young men horrible ideas about how women should be treated, much of which involve detriments to women. As has been described by others in this House, a pile-on happens in relation to this. Women do not just receive a message saying, &#8220;Somebody should rape you&#8221;; they receive thousands of messages from the followers of the contributor and communicator.<\/p><p pid=\"a1331.0\/5\">I have had the benefit of meeting the ministerial team. I am grateful to the Minister and his team, including the lawyers who advise him. We sought a way of dealing with this issue. I particularly wanted to include specific mention of &#8220;rape, disfigurement or other&#8221; in terms of threats because, in the language of statutes, they are sometimes missed by young junior prosecutors or young policemen. When they see messaging and women come forward with complaints, they do  not automatically think that the threat is covered because of the rather oblique nature of statutory language. I wanted it really spelled out, with rape and disfigurement specifically included in my amendment. However, I am persuaded that this issue was in the minds of those who drafted this Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"a1331.0\/6\">I am pleased that it has been recognised that this specific issue is of a different nature when it is applied to women and girls. It is happening in schools and universities. Young women put their heads above the parapet&#8212;they express a view about feminism or describe the fact that they are a lesbian&#8212;then, suddenly, they receive a whole range of horrible insults, abuse and threats on social media. I am mindful of the contribution made by the noble Baroness, Lady Fox, in Committee. She was concerned, in essence, about people being rather wet about this and how this measure would inhibit free speech; really, it was about protecting rather gentle feelings. However, that is not what this is about. It is about threats of serious behaviour and serious conduct towards women. The indirect nature of it is not something that should put us off attempting to have law to deal with it.<\/p><p pid=\"a1331.0\/7\">As I said, I have had an opportunity to meet the ministerial team. We came to the conclusion that we might be able to insert something covering the fact that the carrying out of the threat could be done by persons other than the person who is sending the message. That is the important thing: women receiving these messages saying, &#8220;Somebody should rape you&#8221;, know that the message is carefully drafted in that way by the Andrew Tates of this world because they imagine that the police cannot then do anything about it, but they also know that these people have followers who may well decide to carry out the suggestion. It is really important that we find a way to deal with this.<\/p><p pid=\"a1331.0\/8\">As a result of our discussions, I hope that the House will see that this issue is something that we must deal with in this Bill because the opportunity will not come again. This is happening day in, day out to girls and women. If we are going to send a message about what is unacceptable, it is important that the law declares what is unacceptable. These threats are serious, as is the way in which women then have to change their lives. They stop staying out late. They worry about being in places where they might be subjected to some of these threats. They start limiting their behaviour.<\/p><p pid=\"a1331.0\/9\">Just earlier this morning, someone told me that his niece was a member of a football team&#8217;s fan club and had been elected to the board. She suddenly received a whole range of threats from men who felt that no woman should be in that position. She received a pile-on of a horrible kind, and said to her uncle that she wanted to step down and did not want to be on the board if she was going to receive that kind of messaging.<\/p><p pid=\"a1331.0\/10\">Women start changing the opportunities in their lives and stop doing things that they might want to do: they stop deciding to be Members of Parliament or to stand for election in any capacity, or, if they are lawyers, to take cases that will be inflammatory. They start inhibiting and limiting their own potential because of this kind of threat coming from men who resent the idea that women should be aspiring to hold positions  and be equal to men. Some of it is of a very unpleasant and nasty nature, and law has its place in sending out clear messages of what is acceptable and unacceptable. It is then up to us&#8212;in schools, other educational settings and everywhere else&#8212;to spread the word among our young men and young women about what is acceptable and what they must not accept, and about the right way to behave decently towards other human beings.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1247.1\/1\">My Lords, I again note my interests as laid out in the register. I will speak to Amendment 162. In Committee, I explained the well-intentioned nature of this amendment and hoped it would have afforded the Minister the opportunity to clarify that any cap placed on safe and legal routes would exclude current named schemes already in operation. I appreciate the Minister&#8217;s comments. He said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1247.1\/2\">&#8220;The cap will not automatically apply to all current and new safe and legal routes that we offer or will introduce in the future.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 4\/6\/23; col. 1980.]<\/p><p pid=\"a1247.1\/3\">But, with respect, how can local authorities reflect on accommodation provision for new routes without excluding their current commitments from this assessment?<\/p><p pid=\"a1247.1\/4\">&#8220;Safe and legal routes&#8221; is not a term that is tightly defined in the Bill, so we are left, as is now unfortunately commonplace, with regulations in this area. Arguably, however, it is not unreasonable for Members to presume that &#8220;safe and legal routes&#8221; would be for those seeking protection outside existing visa schemes who would be granted refugee status. Therefore, why are the Government leaving the possibility that those who are not granted refugee status could be included within the cap? This applies to schemes such as Homes for Ukraine, which requires a visa&#8212;the people in question are not refugees&#8212;Hong Kong BNO visas, which are actually for overseas citizens, and the Afghan relocations and assistance policy, which is in recognition of all that happened in  Afghanistan. As my noble friend Lady Brinton put it to the Minister in Committee, those from Hong Kong are actually British citizens. I thank the Minister for the meeting that he held with me and her on that specific question.<\/p><p pid=\"a1247.1\/5\">We still have no credible evidence on the deterrence impacts of this Bill, but we know that offering accessible and safe routes will help prevent people having to make the agonising decision to travel irregularly to reach sanctuary. However, by including current schemes in the proposed cap, we will severely restrict our ability to implement any such safe routes, as there would be limited room, if any, for additional routes. Over the first quarter of this year, 22,000 Ukrainians and British nationals from Hong Kong were resettled here. If we had a cap of 20,000 and those 22,000 were included, we would have a problem. It is to the Government&#8217;s credit that these 22,000 have come, but it cannot be used as a justification to abdicate our responsibility to do more across a wider global cohort.<\/p><p pid=\"a1247.1\/6\">If we do not provide safe routes to those who have had no choice but to uproot their lives to seek safety, we are choosing to require them to rely on dangerous journeys. Perversely, this will create a market for those smugglers determined to capitalise on others&#8217; suffering.<\/p><p pid=\"a1247.1\/7\">The child&#8217;s rights impact assessment states:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1247.1\/8\">&#8220;Anybody arriving in the UK through the methods specified in the bill presents a risk to the public due to the very nature of their arrival&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a1247.1\/9\">I put it to the Minister that the vast majority do not pose a risk to our country; what is at risk is their lives. That is why they have fled. I therefore welcome that the Prime Minister has promised that the Government will create more safe and legal routes. This amendment will enable the Government to do only what they have set out to do. Without it, I fear this vital and necessary work will stop before it has even started and the world&#8217;s most vulnerable will pay the price.<\/p><p pid=\"a1247.1\/10\">I wonder whether using the word &#8220;person&#8221; in Clause 59(1) is unhelpful here and whether it should say &#8220;asylum seeker and refugee&#8221; instead. Would the Minister consider bringing that back at Third Reading? Beyond Amendment 162, I support the other safe and legal routes proposed here, in particular that in Amendment 164 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Stroud.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b618.0\/1\">I rise with a heavy heart to agree with many comments from across the House on the nature of this defective Bill. I agree with Richard Hermer KC, who in a very compelling interview published in today&#8217;s Jewish News talks about the problems that this Bill presents not just for the UK as a whole but for British Jewry in general.<\/p><p pid=\"b618.0\/2\">Taking things in order, my primary concern is the safety of that community. As somebody who has worked very closely with the Jewish community, particularly in the capital over the years, and who has a strong affection for the Haredi community in north London, whom I know well both in policing and crime terms and having dealt with their housing issues as Housing Minister, I am afraid that I agree with <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Margaret Hodge\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10281\">the right hon. Member for  Barking (Dame Margaret Hodge)<\/phrase> that this Bill, should it go through in its current form, is likely to damage and worsen their safety rather than improve it. In that I am with Jonathan Freedland, who wrote in the Jewish Chronicle just last week:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b618.0\/3\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;What is the favourite refrain of the antisemites? That Israel is the one country you&#8217;re not &#8216;allowed&#8217; to criticise. This bill takes a canard and, in the case of boycotts, turns it into the law of the land.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b618.0\/4\">The inclusions of clause 3(7) and, indeed, parts of clause 4 send a chill through that sense of debate, and will feed some of the disgusting conspiracy theories about the status of Israel and the influence that that country has around the globe. I have to say that I fear for the safety of the Jewish community should the measures be passed in that form. There are those who would do its members harm&#8212;we all know that in this House, and I have seen it for myself&#8212;and we cannot give them succour by falling into that trap.<\/p><p pid=\"b618.0\/5\">My second concern is the practical impact of the Bill on many organisations across the country. As we heard from <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Julie Elliott\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24710\">the hon. Member for Sunderland Central (Julie Elliott)<\/phrase>, this is a lawyers&#8217; charter. There will be challenges to and fro, involving universities, pension funds and councils. Every decision that is taken will be scrutinised, and, moreover, councillors who have strong convictions in either direction will seek to find ways that are oblique to fulfil their own sense of moral or ethical obligation. There are groups out there who represent other countries, such as China and Myanmar, who will seek constantly to push councils in their direction, and not just in terms of Israel or Palestine. As a result, a huge amount of money and effort, and KCs at dawn, will be expended in pursuit of this legislation, and the impact will be enormous.<\/p><p pid=\"b618.0\/6\">Thirdly, two key fundamental issues that are intrinsic to the way we live in the United Kingdom are challenged by the Bill. The first is, obviously, the free-speech challenge to which a number of Members have already referred, and which is represented in clause 4(2). It appears that I cannot even criticise this law, whether I am a council leader, a university vice-chancellor, or the chief executive of a company that is performing public services. I have never before seen legislation that outlaws disagreement with the law, and I think that breaching that right to free speech is a very problematic step.<\/p><p pid=\"b618.0\/7\">The second of these issues was mentioned by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Lisa Nandy\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24831\">the hon. Member for Wigan (Lisa Nandy)<\/phrase>. A law granting powers greater than those granted to the police to the investigatory or enforcement authorities identified in the Bill&#8212;the Secretary of State, the Office for Students, and one or two others&#8212;and allowing them, in particular, to breach legal privilege so that organisations can effectively go on a fishing trip looking at the legal advice that individuals have taken as they contemplate investment decisions is a Rubicon that I believe it would be wrong to cross.<\/p><p pid=\"b618.0\/8\">The fourth area that concerns me relates to our tradition of pluralism in this country. There is no doubt that the Bill will send a chill through debate about a series of conflicts across the world. Whether we are talking about the Uyghur Muslims in China, the fate of Hong Kong Chinese or, indeed, those in Israel and Palestine, the fact is that everyone who is engaged in democracy, locally or on a devolved-nation basis, will have to be extremely careful about what they say. They will   have to think twice and three times before they discuss these issues, lest that should prejudice, or be seen to prejudice, an investment or other decision that they may make in the future.<\/p><p pid=\"b618.0\/9\">This is especially problematic in the context of academic freedom. As we heard from the Chair of the Select Committee, my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Alicia Kearns\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25906\">the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alicia Kearns)<\/phrase>, we have just passed a law to guarantee academic freedom: freedom on campus. For that freedom now to be restricted. particularly for those in leadership positions in universities, strikes me as perverse. It should come as no surprise that the Union of Jewish Students is flatly opposed to the Bill, which is apposite given that its members are often the people most exposed to antisemitism in this form.<\/p><p pid=\"b618.0\/10\">Finally, I want to raise the issue of timing. The right hon. Member for Barking said that this was the worst Bill at the worst time; I think that it is a defective Bill at a dreadful time. Given what is unfolding in Israel and Palestine today, given the toll of deaths that we have seen so far this year on all sides and given the international concern about the escalating violence in that part of the world, the introduction of this Bill at a time when many countries in that region are extremely concerned about what is going on will be seen by Arab countries in particular&#8212;although Members may not feel this themselves&#8212;as being partial, and as privileging one country over the others. I think that that will be detrimental not just to our interests in the United Kingdom, which are a primary concern. but to the interests of Israel, Palestine and the wider region.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a952.0\/1\">My Lords, in associating myself with all the preceding speeches, I too pay tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, for her admirable leadership of the International Relations and Defence Committee, on which I was privileged to serve under her chairmanship. I draw attention to my non-financial interests.<\/p><p pid=\"a952.0\/2\">Writ large across the committee&#8217;s report is the age-old Latin adage that, if you want peace, you should prepare for war. Part of that preparation must be to minimise dependency and strengthen national resilience, and solidarity in strong alliances&#8212;most notably NATO and AUKUS.<\/p><p pid=\"a952.0\/3\">Although I will concentrate on the threat posed to the free world by the People&#8217;s Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party especially, in parentheses I ask the Minister for an update on one of the findings in the report referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay&#8212;that the &#163;5.5 billion Ajax project, now 10 years late, has left a yawning gap in our defence capability. A recent report blames concealment and in-fighting between factions in the ministry. A leading article in the Times this week was headed, &#8220;Government complacency about defence resembles that of the 1930s&#8221;. General Sir Patrick Sanders described our capability as<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a952.0\/4\">&#8220;rotary dial telephones in the iPhone age&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a952.0\/5\">In the context of reports that, in a hot war, the army would run out of ammunition in days, how do the Government respond to those charges and the urgent need to address manufacturing capacity, referred to in my noble and gallant friend&#8217;s really important speech, and the issue of replenishment, referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay?<\/p><p pid=\"a952.0\/6\">In the light of last weekend&#8217;s mutiny and the appalling possibility that a convict turned mercenary warlord could take control of Russia&#8217;s nuclear and biological arsenal, including nerve agents, what can the Minister tell us about Wagner&#8217;s continuing threat in Europe and Africa, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Boateng, with whose comments I associate myself, particularly on Sudan? Why have we still failed to proscribe Wagner?<\/p><p pid=\"a952.0\/7\">In reflecting on the weakening of Putin and the law of unintended consequences in Ukraine, the Chinese Communist Party needs to understand that, when you trigger a war, the outcome may never be certain. While there is much to admire about China&#8217;s rich culture and heritage, the entrepreneurship of its peoples and the contribution it has made to the world, Xi Jinping&#8217;s Chinese Communist Party regime poses a threat to us all. This is an important distinction.<\/p><p pid=\"a952.0\/8\">In two reports, the International Relations and Defence Committee makes it clear that the UK&#8217;s response to that threat represents what the committee calls &#8220;a strategic void&#8221; and what the noble Lord, Lord Patten of Barnes, calls &#8220;cakeism&#8221;&#8212;trying to have your cake and eat it. One slice of the Government&#8217;s cake is iced with the following: that the CCP regime represents the<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a952.0\/9\">&#8220;most significant geopolitical factor in the world today&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a952.0\/10\">But another slice is iced with &#8220;business as usual&#8221;, as exemplified by the recent ministerial meeting with Liu Jianchao, a CCP operative responsible for the shocking operations Fox Hunt and Sky Net, and another Minister going to Hong Kong to deepen business links while 1,200 lawmakers and pro-democracy activists, such as the British citizen Jimmy Lai, are incarcerated by a regime accused by the House of Commons of genocide against the Uighur Muslims.<\/p><p pid=\"a952.0\/11\">This week I met Peter Humphrey, a British national and former Reuters foreign correspondent, who became a due diligence investigator with 48 years of experience in China. He and his wife were locked up in outrageous conditions in a Chinese prison, experiencing detention and psychological torture and witnessing prison labour being used in the supply chains of global multinational brands. Why are we so silent about cases like this? In addressing the strategic void, can the Minister tell us when the Prime Minister will respond to the Intelligence and Security Committee&#8217;s China report? What has caused the delay?<\/p><p pid=\"a952.0\/12\">Threats come from spy balloons; in cyberspace and space technology; from surveillance cameras trained on government buildings, including army barracks, Sandringham and even MI6; from intimidation, threats and violence directed towards critics of the regime abroad, including Hong Kongers now resident in the UK who have escaped, and towards parliamentarians&#8212;I declare an interest as one of seven who has been sanctioned; and on the battlefields of illegally invaded Ukraine, the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.<\/p><p pid=\"a952.0\/13\">On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">6 June<\/phrase>, China and Russia conducted a joint aerial patrol over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea, the third such joint air patrol since Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine. They have confirmed that they will hold further joint military drills this year. The CCP is not a neutral bystander, but a clear ally and accomplice to Putin&#8217;s war in Ukraine.<\/p><p pid=\"a952.0\/14\">As part of the committee&#8217;s inquiry, the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, and I were briefed on a joint military exercise in the Gulf involving China, Russia and Iran&#8212;something of an unholy trinity. While AUKUS is a significant step in strengthening our ability to defend our allies and interests in the Asia-Pacific region, I ask the Minister for the Government&#8217;s current assessment of the threats to Taiwan, and what steps the UK and its allies are taking both to prevent an escalation and to prepare for the possibility of one. A military invasion of Taiwan by China would have truly catastrophic consequences, not only for the region but for the world. Taiwan is a vibrant democracy that shares our values of human rights and the rule of law. It has never been part of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, something I would have liked to hear the Defence Secretary say to the committee.<\/p><p pid=\"a952.0\/15\">Taiwan is of vital economic and geopolitical importance. The Taiwan Strait is the main shipping route from China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to Europe and the US. According to Bloomberg, almost half the world&#8217;s container ships and 88% of larger container ships transited the Taiwan Strait in 2022. Taiwan holds a crucial position in the global supply chain due to its manufacturing capabilities. It produces over 60% of the world&#8217;s semiconductors and over 90% of the most advanced semiconductors, the chips that power our electric gadgets. Any attempt by the CCP to seize Taiwan by force would plunge the world into an economic, and perhaps literal, dark age.<\/p><p pid=\"a952.0\/16\">It is therefore in our national interest to do everything possible to prevent such a catastrophe. That surely means doing two things: strengthening our relations with Taiwan and being clear to the CCP what would happen if it did invade. When will we act on Sir Iain Duncan Smith&#8217;s call for an economic impact analysis of a potential blockade or invasion of Taiwan? It was clear from an Answer to a Parliamentary Question from him that none has been done so far. Why not?<\/p><p pid=\"a952.0\/17\">I have one other question. Next month we will sign the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership&#8212;good. Will we encourage the accession of Taiwan to the CPTPP, as well as its acceptance&#8212;even if only with observer status&#8212;to the World Health Organization and World Health Assembly? What is the Government&#8217;s response to yesterday&#8217;s call by the New Zealand Prime Minister that China should be allowed to join the CPTPP?<\/p><p pid=\"a952.0\/18\">Finally, on Monday the BBC&#8217;s &#8220;Panorama&#8221; broadcast a powerful film detailing the extent of China&#8217;s espionage and infiltration activities. These range from Hikvision cameras to infiltration of university programmes involving national defence. There is a threat from without and a threat from within. I ask the Minister to please tell us what we are going to do to counter that threat, to de-risk any business and trade with China, to diversify our supply chains, to reduce strategic dependency in everything from its dominance in lithium to electric cars, to deter an invasion of Taiwan and to strengthen our defences&#8212;militarily, economically and technologically&#8212;to confront the growing threats to come.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"d906.2\/1\">My Lords, I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place. The Statement is as follows:<\/p><p pid=\"d906.2\/2\">&#8220;With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement about the UK&#8217;s migration and economic development partnership with Rwanda.<\/p><p pid=\"d906.2\/3\">This Government fundamentally believe that it is only by removing the incentive for people to take dangerous and unnecessary journeys that we will stop the boats and end the vicious cycle of people smuggling on to UK shores. That is why my right honourable friend the Member for Witham signed our ground-breaking migration and economic development partnership with Rwanda in April last year. That agreement allows individuals who arrive in the UK through dangerous, unnecessary and illegal routes to be relocated to Rwanda for the consideration of their asylum claims and to build a new life there.<\/p><p pid=\"d906.2\/4\">I visited Kigali in March, meeting with Rwanda&#8217;s President and Foreign Minister and signing an update to our memorandum of understanding that would bring it in line with our Illegal Migration Bill. Rwanda has reiterated its commitment and capacity to receive thousands of individuals, process their claims and  provide them with excellent care before they are transitioned to longer-term accommodation, with all the necessary support and services.<\/p><p pid=\"d906.2\/5\">That is why, under the terms of that agreement, we attempted our first relocation flight to Rwanda&#8212;to demonstrate that if you come here illegally, you will be removed to a safe third country for your claim to be processed. We did so under a far-reaching and innovative agreement with Rwanda, a country where the UNHCR itself operates an emergency transit scheme for migrants from Libya and with which we have a robust agreement to protect asylum seekers from risk of harm. That first relocation flight was unfortunately frustrated by last-minute measures from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, which had the effect of pausing flights while our domestic legal proceedings are ongoing.<\/p><p pid=\"d906.2\/6\">In December, the High Court comprehensively upheld the lawfulness of the partnership, confirming that Rwanda was a safe country. That judgment was appealed to the Court of Appeal, which heard the appeal in April and handed down its judgment earlier today. I respect the court and welcome the fact that it unanimously found in the Government&#8217;s favour on the vast majority of the appeals brought against the policy.<\/p><p pid=\"d906.2\/7\">Unanimously, the Court of Appeal confirmed that removing asylum seekers to a safe country is entirely consistent with the refugee convention, including Article 31. Indeed, the court found that it is lawful in principle for the Government to relocate people who come to the UK illegally to a safe third country; that the Government can designate countries as safe; and that our processes for determining eligibility for relocation were fair.<\/p><p pid=\"d906.2\/8\">Unfortunately, two of the judges were of the view that there were deficiencies in the Rwandan asylum system that risked there being a breach of Article 3 of the ECHR. Importantly, their concerns were not that conditions for individuals while in Rwanda would be unsafe but that there was a possibility that they could be returned to other countries from Rwanda where they may suffer ill-treatment. It is therefore simply incorrect to say that the court has found that conditions in Rwanda make it unsafe for individuals there. The Court of Appeal has merely ruled that there is a risk of refoulement from Rwanda to other countries.<\/p><p pid=\"d906.2\/9\">The Lord Chief Justice took a different view. Agreeing with the High Court, he held that there was no real risk of individuals being sent to unsafe countries. He cited the strong assurances given by the Rwandan Government, the fact that Rwanda does not have returns agreements with those countries and the powerful protections provided by monitoring arrangements that would be in place.<\/p><p pid=\"d906.2\/10\">The result is that the High Court&#8217;s decision that Rwanda was a safe third country for the purposes of asylum relocation is reversed. We have a strong relationship with Rwanda and both sides remain committed to the policy. Rwanda is a signatory to the United Nations conventions and has a strong track record of supporting refugees&#8212;including for the UNHCR.<\/p><p pid=\"d906.2\/11\">This is a disappointing judgment, and we will seek permission to appeal it. We hope that the process can be swift. I am glad that the Court of Appeal has recognised, in paragraph 16 of its summary of the  judgment, that it is important that consideration of this should be timely. It is a disappointing judgment for the majority of the British public that has repeatedly voted for controlled migration; and for all those who want to see us deliver on our moral and democratic imperative to stop the boats.<\/p><p pid=\"d906.2\/12\">I am sure that all Members of this House would agree that the British public are compassionate, reasonable and fair minded. Since 2015, they have welcomed half a million people in need from all over the world via our global safe and legal routes, as well as via our country-specific routes encompassing Ukraine, Hong Kong, Afghanistan and Syria.<\/p><p pid=\"d906.2\/13\">But they are not naive. While our compassion to help people may be infinite, the public understand that our capacity to do so is finite and therefore precious. The British people will no longer indulge the polite fiction that we have a duty or infinite capacity to support everyone in the world who is fleeing persecution, nor anyone who would simply like to come here to improve their lot and succeeds in making it to our shores.<\/p><p pid=\"d906.2\/14\">That abuse is unfair on local communities forced to absorb thousands of illegal arrivals and the pressure on public services and social cohesion that this entails. It is unfair on taxpayers who foot the hotel bill currently running to &#163;6 million a day&#8212;that could rise to &#163;32 million a day by 2026&#8212;for people who have broken into this country. It is unfair on those who play by the rules and who want to see an asylum system that is fit for purpose that our current system is exploited and turned against us by those with no right to be in the UK to thwart their removal. It is unfair on those most in need of protection&#8212;in particular women, children and those without the money to pay people smugglers&#8212;that our asylum system is overwhelmed by fit young men who have paid criminals thousands of pounds to smuggle them into the UK. It is unfair on people and our partners in the developing world that we in the West continue to maintain an asylum system so open to abuse that it incentivises mass flows of economic migration into Europe, lining the pockets of people smugglers and turning our seas into graveyards, all in the name of a phony humanitarianism.<\/p><p pid=\"d906.2\/15\">This is madness. It must end. That is why we on this side of the House are committed to doing whatever it takes to stop the boats. The Government remain resolute that we will do exactly that, in partnership with Rwanda, and through changes to our law. That is the only way we will break the business model of the people smugglers, save lives and stop the boats. I commend this Statement to the House.&#8221;<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a721.0\/1\">My Lords, I will be brief because my timetable has not allowed me to take a significant part in the Bill hitherto. However, I have attended quite a lot of the debate, which I started attending in a very troubled state of mind, completely uncertain about what I would do about this startling proposal. I sat through quite a bit of the Committee debate, and have listened today to the debate on the two amendments we have had, and I think that the underlying problem is being missed. We all agree that there is a huge problem with illegal migration and that, if we cannot find a solution, people will die in the channel in considerable numbers&#8212;they go up each year&#8212;by taking risks as they come here. We all admit that it is a global problem, so, if we suddenly become an easier country than others, we are likely to find significant pressures.<\/p><p pid=\"a721.0\/2\">We all want to retain our excellent reputation&#8212;it is not unblemished, but better than those of most other European countries&#8212;for good race relations and an integrated community. During my lifetime, Britain has become a multicultural, multiracial society, and I am  glad to say that I think the majority of my fellow citizens feel that the contribution that has been made, and the improvements to our society, are quite substantial as a result. As my noble friend said a moment ago, concern about the dinghies and old fishing boats bobbing on the ocean will, if we are not careful, rearouse all the bad feelings that we used to know, which we remember only too well from 20 or 30 years ago. That is why more than 60% of our population wish to stop illegal immigration.<\/p><p pid=\"a721.0\/3\">I have tried to listen for a solution during the debates on the two groups of amendments but, sadly, the only solution being put forward is the rather extraordinary one by the Government that we simply cease to entertain illegal immigration and deport to safe places. I have not heard a single alternative policy put forward. I am not sure that it will work&#8212;I think I said that at an earlier stage&#8212;but I am still to hear anybody else offer anything but the possibility of litigation or huge numbers of people coming here as the practice of trying to get over the channel grows. We have to face up to our responsibilities. I am a lawyer and have a huge respect for law&#8212;abiding by the rule of law is one of the most important underlying principles of our constitution&#8212;but we cannot simply produce a lot of legalisms to shoot down the proposal without making any suggestion whatever of a practical kind that is likely to impact a great national problem, which we share as part of a global problem.<\/p><p pid=\"a721.0\/4\">Finally&#8212;I am sorry that I have spoken for longer than I intended&#8212;I give this Government credit, not for coming up with the extraordinary idea of Rwanda but for making our contribution. We have done well with Ukrainian and Hong Kong refugees and admitted a lot of people from Afghanistan, although we could have made a better job of that. We are making our contribution to the global problem and taking a huge net increase to our population each year; we are getting some benefit, as it is helping our workforce. We are not becoming a walled-in, closed country. That is a good British contribution to a tremendous problem for the whole of the western world.<\/p><p pid=\"a721.0\/5\">With no alternative policy in sight at all, this latest legal argument, which lies behind the key amendments here, is simply not a good enough reason for rejecting this policy. I do not know whether the policy will work, but we can no longer simply do nothing. To retreat into hours and hours of legalistic debate&#8212;which is very interesting, if you are interested in that kind of thing&#8212;is not rising to the occasion. Therefore, with a certain reluctance, I will yet again support the Government, which is not always my habit in this House.<\/p>",

Member for Canterbury (Rosie Duffield)<\/phrase> and her own personal testimony in terms of some of the, frankly, in this day and age, awful abuse that too many representatives in this House and members of the Jewish community have suffered. I say that as someone who had the greatest privilege when I was growing up: I grew up alongside the Jewish community. One of the most extraordinary things is that, when I used to go to school with my friends on our school coach every day, from Radlett to Watford, never did we think that 40 years later, antisemitism would be in the ascendancy in the way it so clearly is today, as Members have spoken about.<\/p><p pid=\"d347.0\/2\">It is in that context that I welcome the Bill, and I congratulate both Front Benchers, my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Michael Gove\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11858\">the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)<\/phrase> and <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Lisa Nandy\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24831\">the hon. Member for Wigan (Lisa Nandy)<\/phrase>, on their contributions. We need to bring this memorial forward&#8212;I have always felt that. For me, that is unequivocal, but it is astonishing that it was the former Prime Minister David Cameron, many years ago now, who made the commitment that we would have the memorial and cited the location that has already been subject to a great deal of debate today. While the decision is welcome, the commitment to bring the memorial forward&#8212;which is absolutely essential&#8212;clearly has to be done with a great deal of sympathy for its surroundings. Members have spoken today about the sensitivities of the location, but it is vital that we go ahead with the memorial, because it serves as such a powerful and sombre reminder. It is a monument that represents the loss suffered by the Jewish community and Jewish people through that most horrendous and horrific period in our history. It is living history, and we should always remember that.<\/p><p pid=\"d347.0\/3\">On that point, we should give some thought, consideration and support to many of the leaders within the Jewish community, including those from the Jewish Leadership Council. I have had the privilege of working with the CST and its leadership, both during my time as Home Secretary and as a Member of Parliament. It is so sobering that the reason why the CST exists today is still to protect the Jewish community while they live their lives, day in, day out. I still have parents who live with the Jewish community in a part of Hertfordshire and, when I visit them, we still see local private security firms outside the synagogue, driving up and down our roads to protect the community. We have incredible  Jewish schools that are protected, day in, day out&#8212;as we have heard today from testimony in this House&#8212;by private security firms. That is because of the rise of antisemitism, the level of intolerance and the hatred that wrongly exists across society, which is why education is so vital.<\/p><p pid=\"d347.0\/4\">Of course, the holocaust marked one of the darkest and most sinister moments in the history of humanity. None of us can forget that, and we do not want any future generations to forget it, either. This is how we improve ourselves as human beings; it is how we learn to respect one another, work with each other and live alongside each other, regardless of our backgrounds, our faith or anything of that nature. That cruelty, shown in the most systematic persecution and that awful, barbaric phrase, &#8220;the extermination of the Jewish people in Europe&#8221;&#8212;it is a horrible sentence to even utter&#8212;along with the persecution and murder of other minority groups, continues to shock. It shakes us to our core as human beings, but it did happen in that way, and we have a responsibility and a moral duty to remember the barbarism that took place back then. Six million people were the victims of genocide, motivated&#8212;let us just think about this&#8212;by hatred, prejudice, and an intolerable and evil ideology.<\/p><p pid=\"d347.0\/5\">I want in particular to pay tribute to the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust and the Holocaust Educational Trust for the work they do. I also pay tribute&#8212;I am going to say this now&#8212;to many colleagues in this House, such as those who represent communities and those on the APPGs, but also those who have given voice to some of the intolerance that we see, day in, day out, and who champion their communities across the country.<\/p><p pid=\"d347.0\/6\">I am afraid that, even in my time as Home Secretary, I witnessed the most abhorrent antisemitism. Representatives from the Jewish community came to see me frequently, I am sorry to say. We obviously worked with the police&#8212;we had to work with the police&#8212;to bring justice to members of the community. I recall&#8212;in fact, it was only two years ago&#8212;that we had those awful car rallies coming from certain parts of the country straight into north London, with the most vile abuse, hatred, intolerance and threats to harm and hurt members of the Jewish community taking place.<\/p><p pid=\"d347.0\/7\">These organisations work tirelessly to educate and inform in our schools and elsewhere about the horrors of the past, the holocaust and other genocides. We should also remember other genocides that have taken place, and frequently too. It is important to spread and communicate the &#8220;Never again&#8221; message and to dispel some of the appalling narratives that have existed and the language that is used against these communities.<\/p><p pid=\"d347.0\/8\">The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust and the Holocaust Educational Trust do incredible work&#8212;we have seen this&#8212;in organising visits to Auschwitz and in the run-up to Holocaust Memorial Day on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">27 January<\/phrase>. The Holocaust Educational Trust produces resources on the holocaust and other genocides for use in schools. I am sure many colleagues have been into their own local schools to see this work come together. I have been delighted to forward some of it to my own local schools. This year again, I joined many of my local schools as they held fitting commemorations, and recognised the work and learning of the Holocaust Educational Trust.<\/p><p pid=\"d347.0\/9\">The new memorial and learning centre will be an incredible facility for future generations and young people to come together, yes, to be educated and to learn about the horrors of the past, but also to make sure that such events actually change the way in which we think, for the betterment of humanity and society.<\/p><p pid=\"d347.0\/10\">Many of us have met holocaust survivors or heard them speak&#8212;I have had the incredible privilege of meeting many, and also of growing up alongside some of them when I lived in Radlett in Hertfordshire. We have been moved by the accounts of the suffering and the loss. If I may, I will just commend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jon Trickett\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10604\">the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett)<\/phrase> for the very strong way in which he spoke about his own family background and what took place in the 1950s in particular, which was absolutely shocking. That has gone on&#8212;we should recognise this&#8212;to shape many of these organisations. The CST exists for the very reason of what happened back then, and some of the leadership of the CST right now comes from some of those dreadful experiences.<\/p><p pid=\"d347.0\/11\">The stories of resilience, the inspirational tales and the fortitude have gone on to define the Jewish community&#8217;s successive generations. They have experienced and survived unimaginable suffering, and I pay tribute to them. I think frequently, given where I base myself now, in north London, about their own suffering, but also about the courage they still have to speak about their experiences and the campaigns they have led.<\/p><p pid=\"d347.0\/12\">It is 78 years since the concentration camps, which were the sites of such horrors, were liberated, and thank goodness they were liberated. As each year passes, the number of holocaust survivors, sadly, reduces. So we think of them on a day like today, and I think we are privileged in this House to even have this debate to reflect and to recognise the past and the horrors, but also to pay tribute to them. I say that again within the context of what we see in this modern day, with antisemitism on the rise, social media intolerance, and abuse and trolling, which the hon. Member for Canterbury has spoken about.<\/p><p pid=\"d347.0\/13\">That is why I think this Bill is so important. I would like to see it pass, but I also think that we have to demonstrate respect for many of the concerns that have been raised today; it is right that we do that in a very respectful way. I personally think that there can be no better place in our country to have a memorial located, at the heart of democracy, because it is a reminder of how fragile and precious our democracy is. We look around the world right now, and at how the flame of democracy can so easily be extinguished. Earlier today, there was a debate in Westminster Hall on Hong Kong, where people have been fleeing for their lives because of the national security laws.<\/p><p pid=\"d347.0\/14\">This is also about the importance of our country standing up against those who commit such atrocities in the world, and our commitment to defend freedom, liberty and human rights. The Bill reflects that in the right way, and I am confident that the centre can be built in a sympathetic and respectful way. I hope that colleagues will work to ensure that that happens. That is why I support the passage of the Bill. I know that all colleagues will work with mutual recognition and respect for many of the sensitivities that have been aired today.<\/p>",

I will try to cover the many questions that Members asked.<\/p><p pid=\"b154.0\/3\">Three years ago, following widespread protests, Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong, and the UK, along with international partners, immediately made clear our strong objection to it. We declared its imposition a further breach of the Sino-British joint declaration, which China willingly signed up to in 1984. The crackdown that accompanied the national security law has changed Hong Kong forever.<\/p><p pid=\"b154.0\/4\">Three years on, we have seen how that opaque and sweeping law has undermined the rights and freedoms enshrined in the joint declaration and Hong Kong&#8217;s  Basic Law. Hong Kong&#8217;s governance, rights and social system are now much closer to mainland norms, and the autonomy promised under &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; has been eroded. Hong Kong is less politically autonomous than at any time since the handover. Hong Kong authorities, under the direction of Beijing, have targeted critical voices across Hong Kong society. As Members highlighted, those facing prosecution include former political leaders, pro-democracy figures and members of Hong Kong&#8217;s civil society, trade unions and media outlets.<\/p><p pid=\"b154.0\/5\">Many of those arrested in 2019 and 2020 are only now going on trial. A panel of judges, hand-selected by Hong Kong&#8217;s Chief Executive, hears those cases, and as they progress through the court, new legal precedents will be established, shaping the future rule of law in Hong Kong, which is deeply worrying.<\/p><p pid=\"b154.0\/6\">One of the main figures is Jimmy Lai, whose case has been discussed extensively today. He was one of Hong Kong&#8217;s most successful businessmen, and was the former publisher of Apple Daily. He has been prosecuted on multiple fronts in an obvious attempt to silence and discredit him. He is a British dual national&#8212;he is a British passport holder. Of course, he has never rescinded his Chinese nationality, which has a bearing on this case.<\/p>",

Failure to disclose such assets is defined as a form of sanctions evasion, which is already criminalised under UK law and which could result in asset recovery under the Proceeds of Crime Act.<\/p><p pid=\"b655.0\/2\">The amendment is in line with the one debated in Grand Committee. One change has been made to reflect the Minister&#8217;s helpful view about proportionality&#8212;  I am particularly grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Garnier, and the noble Lord, Lord Faulks, for their helpful suggestion that the best way in which to ensure proportionality would be to incorporate the words &#8220;just and equitable&#8221;, as we have done in the revised amendment. In thanking the noble Lord and the noble and learned Lord, I thank also the co-sponsors, the noble Lords, Lord Leigh of Hurley, Lord Coaker and Lord Fox. Their input and wisdom have been invaluable. The Minister and his really excellent Bill team have engaged through meetings and in a flurry of emails and exchanges, which have been admirable, and I am grateful to them too. I hope that we can come to an amicable conclusion this evening.<\/p><p pid=\"b655.0\/3\">The topicality and urgency of this amendment was underlined by the Statement made in another place yesterday, and repeated here last night, on the Ukraine Recovery Conference. We have all been shocked by the sheer scale of the destruction unleashed by Putin&#8217;s illegal war&#8212;the massive loss of life and the ruination of cities, towns and villages, and the destruction of the country&#8217;s agricultural base. In this lamentable context, we are right to plan for the future. The European Union has set aside a &#8364;50 billion recovery fund, and the United Kingdom has said that we will provide loans worth $3 billion over the next three years. Globally, some 500 businesses from 42 countries have pledged more than $5.2 trillion to back Ukraine&#8217;s recovery. However, as the Prime Minister made clear to that  conference, Russia must pay for the destruction that it has inflicted. In that respect, the Foreign Secretary has said that the United Kingdom is working with allies to explore lawful routes to use frozen and immobilised Russian assets to fund Ukrainian reconstruction. It was to enable that to happen that the movers of this amendment raised this question in Grand Committee.<\/p><p pid=\"b655.0\/4\">To date, the Government have imposed sanctions on nearly 1,500 individuals, including 120 oligarchs, with a collective net worth exceeding &#163;140 billion. However, to put that in perspective, the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation reports that, in total, just &#163;18 billion-worth of assets associated with Russia&#8217;s regime have been frozen since the beginning of the war. Compare that with the net worth of &#163;140 billion. The reason behind such discrepancy is simple: it is concealment. Oligarchs have found increasingly sophisticated ways to hide their assets and weaken our sanctions response: moving assets just before sanctions hit, exploiting loopholes to put assets out of reach and concealing assets to hinder the enforcement of sanctions. I will not weary the House by repeating the examples I gave in Committee of Abramovich and Nigina Zairova, and the findings of Transparency International, but I commend that Hansard to the House.<\/p><p pid=\"b655.0\/5\">Our all-party amendment offers a two-pronged solution: first, preventing Russian oligarchs hiding their illicit wealth and evading sanctions; and secondly, enabling us to seize their assets when they attempt to evade sanctions, using the Proceeds of Crime Act. Many of our allies have already taken steps to move from freeze to seize. In May of this year, the US seized assets from a Russian oligarch and was able to send the proceeds to Ukraine. Similarly, in line with this amendment, it managed to seize Konstantin Malofeyev&#8217;s assets following findings that he had breached sanctions. Last year, the European Union introduced a similar duty to disclose sanctioned assets, and sanctions evasion has been standardised as a criminal offence right across all member states. The EU Commission has committed to working with international partners to seize more than &#8364;19 billion of Russian oligarchs&#8217; funds for the reconstruction of Ukraine.<\/p><p pid=\"b655.0\/6\">Let me also cite the use of Magnitsky sanctions and recognise the vital work of Bill Browder in promoting them. It has been one of the most significant avenues for justice and accountability introduced in recent years and I make the plea that I made in Committee to create a parliamentary mechanism for these sanctions to be examined, in camera if necessary. In welcoming this amendment before your Lordships this evening, Bill Browder said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b655.0\/7\">&#8220;Over the years, we have seen how some manage to evade such sanctions&#8212;including by moving their assets shortly before sanctions &#8230; The UK must do more to ensure that such sanction evasion is addressed as a matter of urgency.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b655.0\/8\">In urging your Lordships to support this amendment, he said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b655.0\/9\">&#8220;If we are serious about justice and accountability, we need to ensure that the very system that was designed to punish human rights violators is not made a mockery of by criminals.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b655.0\/10\">I remind the House that during our Committee proceedings, we were joined in the Public Gallery by Sebastien Lai, the son the imprisoned Hong Kong  founder of Apple Daily and leading pro-democracy advocate, Jimmy Lai, a British citizen who, as things stand, could well die in jail. I declare my interest as a patron of Hong Kong Watch. This amendment has particular relevance for those Hong Kong officials, judges, prosecutors and police officers who are currently complicit in ongoing human rights violations in the city. Many of these individuals and their families have assets in the UK and in some cases even hold UK passports. Hong Kong officials, like Russians officials before them, hide their assets through family members and obscure family trusts. Our amendment would ensure that when Ministers finally impose sanctions on those responsible for the deepening crackdown in Hong Kong, we will be able readily to identify and seize their assets across the UK by forcing them to disclose them.<\/p><p pid=\"b655.0\/11\">If the Government cannot accept this amendment tonight but can at least commit to introducing early secondary legislation to achieve its purpose, I and the other supporters of it will be more than happy to engage with them to make the regime as effective as humanly possible. I will listen this evening with great care to the Minister before deciding whether to press this amendment to a Division.<\/p><p pid=\"b655.0\/12\">Let me end where I began, with Ukraine, reminding the House how important it is that we support Ukraine in every possible way. Latest figures show that more than 9,000 civilians have died and more than 8.2 million people have fled the country. The cost of reconstruction efforts is estimated to be more than $400 billion, and the figure rises exponentially. Amendment 107 was tabled to assert the principle that those responsible for, or who have collaborated in, these depredations will be made to contribute to the gargantuan task of reconstruction. We in this House are making it clear, by speeches, by amendments of this kind and by our actions, that we will go on supporting the courageous people of Ukraine by every possible means. I beg to move.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a100.2\/1\">Thank you, Mr Paisley. I thank my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"John Hayes\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10265\">the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Sir John Hayes)<\/phrase> for securing the debate and for his kind words&#8212;flattery, of course, will get you everywhere.<\/p><p pid=\"a100.2\/2\">There are few more important decisions for this Parliament to make than who gets to come to our country, which is why the debate is so critical. My right hon. Friend is right to say that, over the decades, immigration has generally occurred in this country in an ad hoc manner, without the careful thought and planning that it warrants. Sometimes it has been successful, and sometimes less so, but it has rarely been planned in the way that it should be. As has been said, the levels of immigration that we are currently seeing, and have seen for most of my adult lifetime, are significantly higher than throughout the history of this country. The level of net migration that we have seen in the past 25 years is not normal by historical standards, and it is right that we consider the consequences of that and whether we should take action to change it.<\/p><p pid=\"a100.2\/3\">My right hon. Friend said that Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts proposed to create an organisation to consider more deeply the demographic changes that the country is experiencing. In fact, I met Lord Hodgson to discuss just that. I know him well, having grown up not far from Astley Abbotts, where his mother created the most northerly lavender farm in Europe in her 80s&#8212;that is by the by. His proposal is very important and worthy of consideration. The issue is something that the Migration Advisory Committee could play a greater part in considering when it advises the Government on changes to our immigration system, but, if not, I think there is a good argument for having a separate organisation. I committed to Lord Hodgson to give further thought to the topic.<\/p><p pid=\"a100.2\/4\">My right hon. Friend and a number of others raised the profound consequences that large quantities of migration have on the population of this country as regards housing, access to public services and integration, cohesion and unity. We should consider each of those points very seriously. I have paid particular interest to  housing throughout my time as a Minister. It is undoubtedly true that if 600,000 additional people come to this country every year, that has profound consequences for house prices and, in particular, for the poorest in society, who want either to get on to the housing ladder or to access social housing. We have to take that seriously.<\/p><p pid=\"a100.2\/5\">I made a speech recently at Policy Exchange about the impact of illegal migration. Although that is a different subject, many of the same arguments apply. We have to make sure we are representing our constituents&#8217; true opinions correctly, as my right hon. Friend said, and we must be cognisant of the consequences, including the pressure on public services, housing and integration.<\/p><p pid=\"a100.2\/6\">Secondly, my right hon. Friend argued&#8212;again, the Government would agree&#8212;that companies should not reach in the first instance for the easy lever of foreign labour. That is not the route to productivity enhancement and prosperity. If it was, this country would be even more prosperous than it is today, given the large amounts of legal migration that we have seen in the past 25 years. We have to encourage companies to embrace technology and automation, train their staff and invest in their skills.<\/p><p pid=\"a100.2\/7\">The Government are doing that in a number of ways through our skills reforms, such as those for apprenticeships. My right hon. Friend started that process when he was the apprentices Minister many years ago. The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has made it one of the central missions of his tenure to ensure we get more of the economically inactive in our country back into the workplace, and to ensure businesses support them in the first instance rather than reach for those overseas.<\/p><p pid=\"a100.2\/8\">The Government&#8217;s most crucial reform in this Parliament was taking back control. It is as a result of leaving the European Union that, for the first time in my lifetime, Governments of this country can control the levers that dictate the numbers of people coming into our country. That is an absolutely essential change. It is now in our hands, but there has been a lazy assumption that control alone was sufficient and that people were not concerned about numbers. I disagree with that, and the Government do too. We believe that net migration is far too high, and we need to take action to bring it down over the medium term.<\/p><p pid=\"a100.2\/9\">It is correct that, as others have said, the levels of net migration we have seen in the past two years have included some exceptional factors. The kaleidoscope was shaken as a result of covid, and we have subsequently seen very large numbers of people return to the UK, such as students. We have made important commitments, such as creating the Ukraine, Hong Kong and Afghanistan schemes&#8212;all of which we should be proud of and which should command high levels of public support. In fact, the UK, contrary to the view we sometimes hear expressed on the left, is one of the world&#8217;s leading countries for humanitarian protection schemes. Since 2015, under a Conservative Government, we have enabled half a million people to come into this country for humanitarian purposes. But we need to do more.<\/p><p pid=\"a100.2\/10\">We have recently taken a significant step, which my right hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings mentioned, to ensure that dependants of students cannot come with a student unless they are coming for longer research degrees, such as PhDs. That will  make a tangible difference to numbers in the years ahead. Most importantly, it reaffirms the principle that universities should be in the education business, not the migration business. No one should be coming to this country to study merely as a back door to a life in the UK. They are entirely separate things.<\/p><p pid=\"a100.2\/11\">If there are further steps we need to take, we can and should do so. My right hon. Friend raised a number of important points to which I will give further consideration. He knows that I have sympathy about the salary threshold. There is a question as to whether the immigration health surcharge is at a fair place or whether there is more that can be done. There is also a question about whether family visas and such are being issued appropriately. Those are all things that the Home Office keeps under review. If we need to take further action there, we obviously will do.<\/p><p pid=\"a100.2\/12\">I am conscious that my right hon. Friend is keen to speak at the end of the debate, so I will&#8212;<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a56.1\/1\">I beg to disagree with the hon. Gentleman. Of course there are safe routes. By international agreement, we take people from Syria, and we do fulfil our international obligations. [Interruption.] May I continue? Streamlined asylum processing for accompanied and unaccompanied asylum-seeking children will enable cases to be progressed more quickly, and enable us to clear the backlog of outstanding initial asylum decisions.<\/p><p pid=\"a56.1\/2\">We are also working hard to significantly increase the number of asylum decision makers above intake levels, so that we can reduce the time taken to reach decisions and the number of claimants awaiting decision. My hon. Friend the Member for Orpington who called for this debate, and I am grateful to him for doing so, was quite right to raise this issue: speed is of the essence, and we need to reduce the time taken to reach decision significantly. That is why finance and effort is being put into increasing the numbers of those who determine claims.<\/p><p pid=\"a56.1\/3\">We have recruitment strategies in place that will help to increase staffing, and to maintain it at the level required for better management of the asylum intake. As was mentioned, the sheer weight of numbers is significant; we will need to improve management of the system if we are to make the changes that my hon. Friend is desperate to see, not only for his constituent but for others in similar positions. We have already doubled the number of decision makers over the last two years, and we are continuing to increase them further. A large recruitment campaign is under way; it will take the expected headcount of decision makers to 2,500 by September this year, which will make a significant difference.<\/p><p pid=\"a56.1\/4\">Asylum Operations continues to mitigate the effects of the high attrition rates. That can hinder productivity, as experienced decision makers are used to upskill new colleagues. Although we are increasing the number of decision makers and expect the number of decisions to increase, it can take up to 12 months for a decision maker to become fully proficient in their work. We are putting a place a range of interventions&#8212;for example, we are looking at job design, reward and management capability&#8212;to reduce churn and increase the rate of productivity.<\/p><p pid=\"a56.1\/5\">We take the welfare of those in our care extremely seriously. At every stage in the process, our approach is to ensure that the needs and vulnerabilities of asylum seekers are identified and shared with health partners. To facilitate that, the Home Office and its contractors work closely with the NHS, local authorities and non-governmental organisations to ensure that people can access the healthcare and support that they need. Asylum seekers have access to health and social services from the point of their arrival in the UK. All asylum seekers, regardless of the type of accommodation that they are in, have the same access to free NHS services as British citizens and other permanent residents. The Home Office operates a safeguarding hub to support vulnerable individuals in quickly accessing the healthcare services.<\/p><p pid=\"a56.1\/6\">I am particularly interested in the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Orpington raised about the delays he has experienced, which are in no small part due to the dramatic rise in cases. We have the highest number of applications for two decades; that is why he is quite right to support the Government on reforming the system. I remind hon. Members that there were 75,492 asylum applications, relating in total to 91,047 people, in the UK in the year ending March 2023. That is a third more applications than in the year ending March 2022, and the highest number for 20 years or so. It is also higher than at the peak of the European migration crisis; the figure was 36,446 in the year ending June 2016.<\/p><p pid=\"a56.1\/7\">Many of the top nationalities applying for asylum in the UK in the year ending March 2023 are also the most common nationalities of those arriving in small boats. Those nationalities include Albanians, Afghans, Iranians, Iraqis and Syrians. The significant increase in dangerous journeys across the channel is placing unprecedented strain on our asylum system. Those in need of protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach, rather than risking their life and paying people smugglers to take them on the dangerous journey across the channel.<\/p><p pid=\"a56.1\/8\">As my hon. Friend mentioned, the UK has a proud history of supporting refugees. Since 2015, we have offered a place to just under half a million men, women and children seeking safety, including those from Hong Kong, Syria, Afghanistan and Ukraine, as well as family members of refugees. Our focus will remain on directly helping people who are from regions of conflict or instability. The best way to help the most vulnerable people, which of course includes Syrians, is to bring them into the country through safe and legal routes. That will bypass the evil criminal gangs and protect vulnerable people, including children.<\/p><p pid=\"a56.1\/9\">The Government are committed to reform. The Illegal Migration Bill is essential to ensure that we can better  marshal appropriate applications, and to ensure that people who should not be seeking asylum do not jump the queue by paying money to an illegal smuggler.<\/p><p pid=\"a56.1\/10\">Let me turn to the issue of wellbeing. My hon. Friend mentioned that his constituent, who was based in Orpington and is now based in the Dartford area, is suffering from ill health and mental illness, in part as a result, it is said, of his treatment abroad, but also of his living and waiting here. The Government take the safety and wellbeing of asylum seekers extremely seriously. We are working closely with health partners, accommodation providers in the UK and the UK Health Security Agency to ensure their safety and wellbeing. Asylum seekers have access to health and social care services, and those who deal with asylum seekers at any point of the process, including first responders, are under a duty to assist in ensuring that safety and wellbeing.<\/p><p pid=\"a56.1\/11\">Significant effort goes into ensuring that people have the appropriate health and wellbeing services. We provide funding, via a therapeutic support grant, to Barnardo&#8217;s, so that it can operate its Boloh helpline. That service provides mental health and wellbeing support to adult asylum seekers; it aims to prevent the escalation of any mental ill-health among those navigating the asylum system, and to facilitate joined-up working in the community, on mental health provision in general. My hon. Friend mentioned that he has concerns on this issue in relation to his case, and I am sure that he will continue to raise it. The service offers UK-wide virtual therapeutic support, practical support from helpline advisers and intensive one-to-one treatment where needed. There is extensive work with a team of psychotherapists who speak 15 languages, and extra help will be brought in where it is needed.<\/p><p pid=\"a56.1\/12\">In closing, I again thank my hon. Friend the Member for Orpington for securing the debate. He works extremely hard on this issue and will continue to do so, and I am sure that he will hold the Home Office to account. I reassure him&#8212;as much as I can; I am standing in for the Immigration Minister&#8212;that I will seek to secure a meeting for him with that Minister, so that he can assist him in representing an important former constituent. This is an important topic that we take seriously, and the Government are committed to ensuring that all asylum claims are considered without unnecessary delay. Where there has been historical delay, we are doing our best to reduce it. We are mindful of our responsibilities to those in our care, and are ensuring that their needs are met. That will remain an integral part of our approach.<\/p><p pid=\"a56.1\/13\">Question put and agreed to.<\/p><p pid=\"a56.1\/14\">Sitting suspended.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>Thank you very much. The Equality and Social Justice Committee considered the Welsh Government's legislative consent memorandum in May, and wrote jointly with the Children, Young People and Education Committee to stakeholders with an interest in or expertise in the issues covered by the Bill, as well as to the Minister for Social Justice. We asked stakeholders to comment on the provisions of the Bill that relate to devolved areas of competence, primarily social care issues. We received eight responses, and it's striking that the key messages expressed were so consistent. Most respondents were opposed to the Bill, and those who gave a view on consent recommended the Senedd withhold consent.<\/p><p>Three key issues were raised about the UK Government's Bill: (1) the lack of compatibility with human rights; (2) the potential implication for children's rights; and (3) the Bill's potential to undermine Welsh policy and the legislative context, and, in particular, the Social Care and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014. The Children's Commissioner for Wales described the implications for children's rights a a violation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.&#160;<\/p><p>The people at the centre of this issue are individual men, women and children who will each have their own desperate reasons or circumstances that lead them to, generally, attempt very perilous journeys. We share the desire to end dangerous channel crossings and the tragic loss of life that is happening in the English channel, but that is not going to happen unless we have alternative ways of applying for asylum into the UK. Unless you are a Ukrainian, you come from Hong Kong, and, possibly, if you're an Afghan translator, there are no alternative ways of applying before reaching the British isles.<\/p><p>Specifically, the purposes of clauses 19, 20, 55 and 56 relate to social care, which are all devolved matters. Furthermore, clause 3 would empower the Secretary of State to amend enactments within the Senedd's legislative competence without the Senedd's consent. So, this really would be a rolling back of devolution.<\/p><p>A majority of Members agreed that clauses 3, 19, 20, 55 and 56 require the Senedd's legislative consent, and one Member disagreed. The implications for devolved policy if the provisions of clause 15 to 18 were extended to Wales is that they are likely to undermine the role of local authorities in carrying out assessments of need under the Social Care and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014. In treating unaccompanied minors and asylum-seeking children differently to other children, these clauses may violate the UNCRC and the rights-based approach that is central to our approach in Wales. Other established policy approaches adopted in Wales, including children first, migrants second, and the Welsh Government's ambition for Wales to be a nation of sanctuary, would also be put in jeopardy as a result. A majority of the committee recommends that the Senedd should withhold legislative consent, with one Member disagreeing. Another Member objected to the principle of the UK Government Bill enacting legislation that will apply to Wales, but was in support of the rejection of this LCM.&#160;<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"e748.1\/1\">That is a very interesting point. I hope the Chair will not mind my saying so, but when I gave evidence last week, quite rightly I was challenged about how we measure success. This is incredibly complex, as my right hon. Friend will appreciate. For example, with the corporation tax rises, we have introduced the tapering because we have the policy intent of trying to help businesses that are small or perhaps finding their feet, and we do not want to be charging them 25% corporation tax if they have not reached the levels of profit set out in the Bill. The metrics we will use are very much being considered. I am not in a position to commit to those metrics at the moment, but I promise I will come back to her when we have a settled package that we think will address not only the concerns of the Committee but the wider concerns beyond simplification, such as fairness and encouraging growth.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/2\">HMRC also reports annually in its reports on its objective to make it easy to get tax right. As I have just set out, we are actively considering how to develop a suite of metrics to measure progress on that. Precisely because we recognise the concerns and the thoughtful considerations of the Treasury Committee and others across the House, I was very pleased at being able to intervene on my hon. Friend the Member for West Worcestershire to commit today to reporting annually&#8212;that is, in each tax year&#8212;to the Committee to provide an overarching summary of the Government&#8217;s progress on the simplification. To be very clear, I intend that to start this tax year, because I take this very seriously and I very much hope that Committee members and others in the House will share my intentions in so doing. I therefore hope that my hon. Friend and Committee members will not feel the need to press their amendments and new clauses.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/3\">I turn now to the subject of the global minimum tax legislation, which is again a complicated area. If I may, Madam Deputy Speaker, with your munificence, I will just spend a little bit of time on it, precisely because I understand the concerns that my hon. Friends have and, indeed, the level of scrutiny they have quite rightly given it as the Bill has made its journey through the House. First and foremost, if I may&#8212;I am very keen to get this on the record, because I know that my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Priti Patel\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24778\">the Member for Witham (Priti Patel)<\/phrase> will rightly expect such commitments on the record&#8212;before I make the commitments that the Chancellor has made in his letter, I will set out the background to pillar 2. Although my right hon. Friend the Member for Witham clearly has a great deal of knowledge about this area, it is fair to say that not everybody in Parliament will have the same understanding.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/4\">By way of an explainer, pillar 2 will ensure that large multinational groups with revenues of more than &#163;750 million pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15% in every jurisdiction they operate in. It is designed to protect against the risk of harmful tax planning by multinational groups and to promote fair and open competition on tax policy. It is really to prevent those large multinationals from shifting profit out of the UK to those parts of the world that charge far lower tax  rates than us. This will help to ensure that profits generated here in the UK are taxed in the UK, and it will strengthen the UK&#8217;s international competitiveness through placing a floor on the low tax rates that have been available in some countries.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/5\">A lot of questions have been asked about implementation, and I shall go into detail on them in a moment, but if we do not implement these rules, the tax will still be collected, but by another jurisdiction. That is because pillar 2 is designed as an interlocking set of rules ensuring that low-taxed profits will be taxed even if the UK or other countries do not move ahead. This is why we are determined to introduce or implement pillar 2 from <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">31 December<\/phrase> this year, along with other EU member states and with Australia, Canada, Japan and Switzerland, so that we are moving in lockstep with our international peers.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/6\">Before I answer some of the questions that my right hon. Friend the Member for Witham has rightly raised, let me put on record my sincere thanks to her, and to other colleagues and friends who signed her amendment&#8212;and to whom I have spoken over many months in the run-up to today&#8212;to scrutinise what this means for the United Kingdom and for businesses. I absolutely understand why they are asking the questions. As I said, this is Parliament at its best, and I am genuinely grateful to her for raising these questions. What is more, the Chancellor is grateful. My right hon. Friend wrote to the Chancellor, and I am pleased to inform the House that he replied to her in the following way, to ensure that we all understand and appreciate the levels of scrutiny that have taken place.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/7\">The Chancellor maintains that the Government are sadly not in a position to support the amendment, but we recognise the importance of these matters to hon. Friends and Members of the House. On that basis, the Chancellor and I are happy to provide an update on pillar 2 implementation as part of the forthcoming fiscal event in the autumn, and if necessary in the spring. That update will include the latest revenue forecast from the OBR&#8212;that is an important point&#8212;and a status update on international implementation, which is a point that hon. Members are focused on. It goes without saying&#8212;I hope my right hon. Friend and others know this&#8212;that the Chancellor and I stand ready and are happy to continue to discuss such issues with her and others, as we move towards implementation towards the end of the year.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/8\">Quite rightly, my right hon. Friend and others have posed questions, and I will try to answer some of them. I was asked about implementation, which I completely understand. The member states of the EU are committed to implementation, and the EU directive in place is legally binding. The directive allows small member states&#8212;defined as those with 12 or fewer parent entities, and, therefore, those that are much smaller than our economy&#8212;more time to introduce the rules. Those countries are very few, and are not in the same economic position as the United Kingdom. They will not get an advantage from delaying implementation, as the directive requires other EU member states to collect the tax instead.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/9\">I have also looked to countries such as Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong. The UK has a large and mixed economy, where it is appropriate for us to take action to combat aggressive tax planning and support  measures that support competition. Australia, Japan and Canada, which are our peers by size and shape of economy, are also implementing that rule. Indeed, Japan&#8217;s 2023 tax reform Bill was enacted after passing Japanese procedures in March. It will be introducing the income inclusion rule from <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">1 April<\/phrase>, four months after us next year.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/10\">On the States, I understand why the question is being posed, and my hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley set out some of the history behind where America has got to. In 2017, the US introduced a minimum tax on the foreign income of its multinationals, and it has recently introduced a minimum tax on the domestic income of large groups, including foreign headed multinationals. The US already has in place rules that operate on a similar basis to pillar 2, and it has been one of the strongest advocates for developing a global standard. It has maintained its commitment to align its rules with the agreed pillar 2 template, but until that happens, the OECD inclusive framework members, including the US, have agreed how the US rules and pillar 2 rules should interact, to ensure that US multinationals are subject to the same standard as groups in other countries. That is an important context.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/11\">If it is not implemented in the UK, what does that mean? Again, the question posed is a fair one. Generally, the international top-up tax is applied at the top of the business, and at the level of the ultimate parent entity. If that jurisdiction has not implemented the rule, the taxing right passes down the ownership chain of the business, until there is an entity in a jurisdiction that has implemented the rule. This is why without UK rules, this tax&#8212;chargeable in the UK, if it did apply&#8212;would be payable to another jurisdiction unless and until we implement the rules.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/12\">I very much understand the concerns raised about sovereignty. We retain the sovereignty to set our corporation tax rate. It is still the lowest in the G7, and we can use important tax levers to boost investment, including the UK&#8217;s world-leading R&amp;D credit and full expensing regimes announced in the Budget. We have also ensured that UK tax reliefs such as the refundable R&amp;D credit will not be treated as depressing the effective tax rates of claimants. We have been able to achieve that because we have been at the forefront of discussions and negotiations on these rules.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/13\">On the point about how these rules are agreed, implemented and who holds who to account, the model rules were agreed by consensus requiring the agreement of each country and jurisdiction. It is then up to each country and jurisdiction to implement the rules. There is not a higher body than jurisdictions here to do so. I very much understand the concern about innovation and growth. We will remain free to use the corporation tax system to support innovation, business investment and regional growth through R&amp;D tax credits, enhanced capital allowances and tax reliefs in investment zones. We must continue to work together with our partners to avoid a subsidy race that could distort trade or impact sectors.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/14\">In answering those questions, I hope I have addressed some of the issues that Members have raised in relation to pillar 2. I very much hope that my right hon. Friend the Member for Witham, having brought the scrutiny which would be expected from her, will feel able not to press her amendment to a vote.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/15\">On the lifetime allowance and the Opposition&#8217;s new clause 1 and amendments 1 and 6, the Opposition just do not seem to get it. This measure has been brought forward to help the NHS retain those doctors and consultants whom we are so desperate to have in our NHS looking after our constituents and helping to cut the backlogs, as the Prime Minister has set out as one of his five priorities. That is why we have introduced this policy. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"James Murray\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25801\">The hon. Member for Ealing North (James Murray)<\/phrase> seems to think&#8212;and we have had this conversation many times before&#8212;we could have dreamt up a proposal dealing just with doctors in the same amount of time it took us to bring in this policy&#8212;two weeks. The fact is that this measure started having an impact on our doctors, our consultants, our chief constables and others this tax year, as hon. and right hon. Friends have set out. We want to make that change precisely because we believe that our NHS and public services deserve it, and that is why we are bringing that lifetime allowance forward.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/16\">Moving to the non-doms point, this is again a conversation we have had repeatedly with those on the Opposition Front Bench. The hon. Member for Ealing North asked about the &#163;830 million and seemed to question it. I am sorry to break it to him, but that has been scorecarded by the Office for Budget Responsibility. It has certified it, costed it and said that it will bring in &#163;830 million over the scorecard period.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/17\">My right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Alun Cairns\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24740\">the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Alun Cairns)<\/phrase> raised important questions regarding alcohol duty. He welcomes the changes in the round, but as the chair of the all-party parliamentary beer group, it is understandable that he is asking whether the draught relief is designed to apply to off-trade pints as well as on-trade pints. I am afraid that it is not, because we want to support consumption of beer in pubs. It is one of many ways not only to support our local pubs, but also to secure opportunities arising out of our exit from the European Union. Only pints in pubs will be subject to this measure, not pints poured into takeaway containers. The industry body the Campaign for Real Ale has lobbied to ask that that could happen. We have looked at the idea carefully, as has the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Gareth Davies\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25858\">the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Gareth Davies)<\/phrase>, but we have serious concerns that it would overcomplicate the draught relief. I hope to reassure my right hon. Friend and CAMRA that takeaway services can continue so long as the beer comes from a full-duty barrel. I am reminded that takeaway off-trade beer accounts for 0.1% of beer sales, but, when the Bill passes its Third Reading today, I am sure that we will all be raising a pint in celebration.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/18\">We touched briefly on the electricity generator levy, which is payable only on the portion of revenues that exceeds the long-run average for electricity prices. We have done that carefully to try to ensure that we achieve the Government&#8217;s wanted net zero ends while looking after customers. New clause 12 perhaps misunderstands how the EGL operates, so we urge colleagues to reject it. In relation to the energy profits levy, it is important to note that the Government expect it to raise just under &#163;26 billion between 2022 and 2028, helping to fund the vital cost of living support that we have discussed.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/19\">In relation to air passenger duty and new clause 10, we have made changes to take advantage again of our post-EU freedoms and to support the United Kingdom.  We want friends and family to be able to fly to see each other across the United Kingdom. I am not quite clear whether Labour understands that or is now against helping friends and family across the UK to reunite. I am sure that all will become about as clear as its &#163;28 billion U-turn.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/20\">I turn to new clause 5. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Stewart Hosie\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11973\">The right hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)<\/phrase> asked why are we making this change on Report. It became apparent that a welcome clarification by the Home Office on how information is obtained for criminal investigations means that some data that is genuinely needed by His Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs to check a person&#8217;s tax position is deemed as communications data. The clarification aims to secure that into law. We are trying to do it as quickly as possible, which is why it is in the Finance Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/21\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Debbie Abrahams\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25034\">The hon. Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth (Debbie Abrahams)<\/phrase> raised the duty to report on public health and the poverty effects of the Bill. We already publish data on people in both relative and absolute low-income households each year through the &#8220;Households below average income&#8221; publication. The Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016 also requires us to publish statistics on the percentage of children in relative and absolute low income, combined low income and material deprivation and persistent low income. I very much hope that she will welcome the &#163;3,300 on average of help that we are securing for families across the United Kingdom in these difficult times.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/22\">To conclude&#8212;[Interruption.] I thought that the House might be interested in some of the details; apologies for that. The Bill contains a number of important measures that will support the UK economy, people and businesses. I therefore urge the House to reject the proposed non-Government amendments for the reasons that I detailed, and agree to the Government&#8217;s amendments and new clauses. In closing, I thank everybody involved for their contributions to our discussions not just today but in the months that have led up to this.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/23\">Question put and agreed to.<\/p><p pid=\"e748.1\/24\">New clause 4 accordingly read a Second time, and added to the Bill.<\/p>",

Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Tim Loughton\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10371\">the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham  (Tim Loughton)<\/phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Peter Bottomley\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10057\">the Member for Worthing West (Sir Peter Bottomley)<\/phrase>, the Father of the House, and <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Dan Carden\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25642\">the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Dan Carden)<\/phrase> for securing this general debate on migration. By the standards of immigration debates, it has been a thoughtful and reflective one. I plan to use the short time I have to answer directly as many of the questions raised by right hon. and hon. Members as possible.<\/p><p pid=\"a537.0\/2\">The hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton opened the debate with an understandable message that the UK should be a country in which those people genuinely seeking sanctuary can find safety and a new life, and we should be looking to continue to develop safe and legal routes. The Government share in that, and we believe that we have done that in recent years. Since 2015, almost 550,000 people have come to the United Kingdom on humanitarian grounds, which is more than in any comparable period in our modern history. They have come on individual country schemes, including those mentioned by many colleagues, from Ukraine, Syria and Hong Kong, and indeed on the global scheme operated on behalf of the United Kingdom by the United Nations. A small number have also come on the community sponsorship scheme, which enables any one of us, our communities or faith organisations to assist people directly in moving from places of danger to a new life in the UK. The Government strongly encourage others to take part in that if they care deeply about these issues.<\/p><p pid=\"a537.0\/3\">The hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton raised visa costs. I appreciate that, in particular for those people who have lived in the UK for many years and want now to settle here permanently, as well as for those who have settlement but want to obtain British citizenship. The Government believe that citizenship is important and something that everyone who lives here for a sustained period of time should aspire to. I appreciate that the costs of some of those routes are high, and we take that into account, but we have to balance that against the cost of managing the broader immigration system. It is right that the system should be as self-sustaining as possible, so that it places as low a burden as can be on the wider UK taxpayer. We have made concessions for certain types of visa. He mentioned the health and social care visa. Almost 100,000 were granted in the year ending March 2023. That visa carries a reduced fee and an expedited service for good reason.<\/p><p pid=\"a537.0\/4\">The hon. Gentleman asked about the UKVI and its service standards. As I have said in the House on recent occasions, the UKVI is well run. It is important, as a Home Office Minister, to give credit where it is due. Not all things work well, but where they do and where the leadership is performing a strong service, it is right we recognise that. The UKVI is meeting its service standards in all regards, according to the last data I saw. It does have service standards, whether published or internal, for every type of visa or application and it is meeting those requirements.<\/p><p pid=\"a537.0\/5\">On the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point about labour shortages, we take them very seriously. We have to be pragmatic as a Government to ensure that business has the workers necessary to drive forward the economy. We have to recognise that net migration last year of 606,000, which included about 300,000 work visas, is very high by historic standards. That means many, many people are coming into the country for work purposes, the system  is working and businesses can access that labour, but we have to balance their need for labour against shortages of housing, access to public services, in particular in the health service, and the ability of this country, like any, to integrate people successfully and to build a cohesive and united society. I am concerned that the current levels of net migration are too high and are not sustainable in the long term.<\/p><p pid=\"a537.0\/6\">I also do not believe that it is a way to drive long-term prosperity and productivity by allowing companies, in some instances, to reach for the easy lever of foreign labour. Instead, they should be reaching for technology and automation, and above all investing in local people in the British workforce to help them into the labour market in the first instance. Those are the principles underlying the points-based system that my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Priti Patel\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24778\">the Member for Witham (Priti Patel)<\/phrase>, the former Home Secretary, established, which allows for a degree of pragmatism through the shortage occupation list and other bespoke visa routes, such as the health and social care visa. They give us, for the first time in our modern history, the ability to make changes where necessary.<\/p><p pid=\"a537.0\/7\">One of those changes is the change to student visas, which we announced last month. That now enables us to take action against dependants coming with students who are here on short courses, such as one-year master&#8217;s. I think that is the right decision because universities, although undoubtedly an incredible force for good here in the UK and around the world, should be primarily in the education business and not the immigration business, enabling a back route to life in the UK for individuals and their families. That is what we want to refocus the system on.<\/p><p pid=\"a537.0\/8\">The hon. Gentleman raised, as did many others, the issue of the backlog. Let me be perfectly clear that one of the priorities for the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary and me, since we came into office last year, has been reducing the backlog. To develop an efficient system, it is important to reduce the reliance on hotels, which we all agree is inappropriate, and to enable people who will ultimately be granted status the ability to get on with their lives and contribute to society here in the UK. I am confident we will be able to eliminate the legacy backlog over the course of this year. We put in place a number of further measures recently, some of which have been referenced today. We have also brought into play more resources, drawing not just on caseworkers&#8212;a growing pool of individuals in the Home Office thanks to our recruitment efforts&#8212;but on skilled workers from within the UK visa service and within the Passport Office as well, to bolster those efforts and give us a greater prospect of achieving our ultimate aim of reducing the backlog.<\/p><p pid=\"a537.0\/9\">My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Tim Loughton\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10371\">the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)<\/phrase> rightly spoke of the international context underlying the present situation. It was for that reason that I have been to France, Italy, Tunisia and Algeria in the last few weeks&#8212;to work with partner countries together on our shared challenge and so that UK assets, such as the National Crime Agency, Border Force and the police, can work with those countries further upstream. They will help them stop migrants from leaving transit countries such as those in north Africa and getting anywhere near the UK. That is an incredibly important part of our broader plan.<\/p><p pid=\"a537.0\/10\">My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham was right to raise the question of France. It is a significant achievement in the past six months that the relationship with France has improved significantly. That has led to more interception rates and more arrests, but there is more work to be done there in our relationship with the French. We have signed other agreements with Albania and Georgia, and a memorandum with Italy. We are working with the EU to develop a partnership with respect to Frontex. I am sure that there will be other opportunities with partner countries both within Europe and beyond. That is something I personally want to take forward to deepen those relationships.<\/p><p pid=\"a537.0\/11\">Having spoken to my opposite numbers from a range of countries in the past two weeks, it is clear that we are all grappling with a very substantial challenge. The UK is not alone and is not considered an outlier. In fact, many of the steps that we are taking, including the Rwanda policy, are attracting great interest from other countries. If it is operationalised, it is likely that other countries will seek to pursue something similar. We want to work as closely as possible with other countries to tackle this challenge together.<\/p><p pid=\"a537.0\/12\">On the point that my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham and others made about our ODA budget, it is incredibly important that we tackle illegal migration precisely because it is a very poor use of our resources. We are spending a great deal of money on things such as hotels, primarily to assist young men who have been in a place of safety such as France to come to the United Kingdom to continue their lives here. Those resources could be used far better upstream to support people in and around conflict zones, whether through international organisations such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees or otherwise. By tackling illegal migration, such as through the Illegal Migration Bill, we can help the United Kingdom to be a greater force for good in the world.<\/p><p pid=\"a537.0\/13\">I am conscious that there is little time, but <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Patrick Grady\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25299\">the hon. Member for Glasgow North (Patrick Grady)<\/phrase> raised concerns about the performance of the Home Office and the manner in which we house asylum seekers. We want to work with the Scottish Government and Scottish local authorities so that they can play a greater part in appropriately housing asylum seekers and refugees. We are currently in one such live discussion at the moment, and I very much hope that they will encourage their colleagues in Scotland to assist with those negotiations. I apologise for overrunning my time, Madam Deputy Speaker.<\/p>",

My prophetic powers in saying &#8220;about two hours&#8221; were slightly wrong. The last two and a half hours will be memorable for a number of things&#8212;the noble Baroness, Lady Chakrabarti, quoting Ronald Reagan being one of them&#8212;and there were helpful reminders of no person being illegal. There were helpful alternatives to &#8220;safe and legal routes&#8221;, but I think that we will have to live with &#8220;safe and legal routes&#8221;. No one has implied that we will change the wording in the Bill. The Minister helpfully pointed out that there will be a definition in the regulations, so that helps us. I am not sure that the Minister answered the historical question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkhope, about why the change happened around 2011 concerning the use of embassies, but I am not going to ask him to stand up.<\/p><p pid=\"a1988.4\/2\">Your Lordships will not be surprised to hear me say that, overall, I am disappointed that my amendment, not just about Hong Kong but particularly about Hong Kong, has not been accepted. It does not damage the Bill in any way to accept that amendment. Likewise, the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Stroud, tries to clarify. That is the purpose, and the Minister&#8217;s response has not helped us move forward on that. I have no doubt that all of us involved will find ourselves in discussions about what we might bring back on Report. The desire is to take things forward on safe and legal routes.<\/p><p pid=\"a1988.4\/3\">At this stage, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.<\/p><p class=\"italic\" pid=\"a1988.4\/4\">Amendment 128B withdrawn.<\/p><p class=\"italic\" pid=\"a1988.4\/5\">Clause 58 agreed.<\/p><p class=\"italic\" pid=\"a1988.4\/6\">Amendment 128C not moved.<\/p><p class=\"italic\" pid=\"a1988.4\/7\">Clause 59 agreed.<\/p><p class=\"italic\" pid=\"a1988.4\/8\">Amendments 129 to 131 not moved.<\/p><p class=\"italic\" pid=\"a1988.4\/9\">House resumed.<\/p><p class=\"italic\" pid=\"a1988.4\/10\">Sitting suspended.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1758.1\/1\">I thank my noble friend for that contribution. The position, as he outlined in his speech, is that the deterrence effect takes its force from a number of sections in the Bill: the first, obviously, being the detention and removal, as he rightly identified; the second being the bans on the ability to settle or stay here, the idea being that that disincentivises people from entering illegally using dangerous routes. I do not accept that there are two Bills in the way that my noble friend identifies. The reality is that the question of registration of citizenship, which he raises, is unlikely to arise in as many cases as the naturalisation circumstance&#8212;I think we can agree on that&#8212;so it is natural that what we are talking about is probably an exceptional state of affairs, in any event. That is potentially why my noble friend perceives a dissonance between the deterrent effect and the two factors, but in fact there is no such distinction.<\/p><p pid=\"a1758.1\/2\">Amendments 98ZA and 98EA, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, seek to expand the circumstances in which the bans on settlement and citizenship are to be disapplied. The noble Baroness, Lady Lister, also touched on this issue. We consider that the circumstances in which a grant of settlement or citizenship would be an appropriate remedy are wholly covered by the ECHR, so our view is that the addition of other international agreements is unnecessary, hence the amendment, as we have already canvassed.<\/p><p pid=\"a1758.1\/3\">I turn now to Amendment 98I tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Brinton. This seeks to provide a broader protection for those holding British national (overseas) status. We do not believe this is necessary. The clauses which prevent people from obtaining various forms  of British nationality already do not mention British national (overseas) status. This is for the simple reason that no one has been able to obtain that status since 1997 and, consequently, there is no need to ban people from obtaining it should they arrive illegally.<\/p><p pid=\"a1758.1\/4\">We already have in place a dedicated migration route for people from Hong Kong and, as the noble Baroness knows, it has been a significant priority for the Government and the department to offer this route to British national (overseas) people from Hong Kong in response to the situation there. We have done a great deal for the citizens of Hong Kong and hope to continue to do so. As cited in my response to my noble friend, Lord Moylan, a route to citizenship exists under Section 4(2) of the British Nationality Act 1981. There should therefore be no reason for a person holding British national (overseas) status to arrive illegally in the manner which would mean they fall under this Bill&#8217;s provisions.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"f1355.0\/1\">My Lords, we do not support this group of amendments. We strongly support the inclusion in this Bill of the new secondary objective for the regulators on international competitiveness and economic growth. Its position as secondary in the hierarchy of regulators&#8217; objectives is of course key. As a secondary objective, economic growth and international competitiveness will remain subordinate to the regulators&#8217; primary objectives of preserving financial stability and protecting consumers. The UK&#8217;s reputation and success as a leading international financial centre depend on high standards of regulation, and a stable and independent regulatory regime. These high regulatory standards are a key strength of the UK system and its global competitiveness, so we would not support any moves towards a regulatory race to the bottom. That would negatively impact international confidence in the UK, making the UK less attractive to international businesses and investment.<\/p><p pid=\"f1355.0\/2\">The UK&#8217;s financial services industry plays a vital role in boosting economic growth and delivering skilled jobs in every part of the UK. Almost 2.5 million people are employed in financial services, with two-thirds of those jobs based outside London, and the sector contributes more than &#163;170 billion a year to GDP&#8212;8.3% of all economic output.<\/p><p pid=\"f1355.0\/3\">The City of London is one of only two global financial capitals and is at the very heart of the international monetary system. This is an enviable position, and it is vital that we support the sector across the UK to retain this competitiveness on the world stage post Brexit so that the UK can continue to be one of the world&#8217;s premier global financial centres. It is therefore crucial that the UK&#8217;s regulatory framework plays its part in supporting this positive contribution to the UK economy and society. To do this, it must enhance competitiveness and support the industry in trading with the world, including in new markets. It must attract investment into the UK and promote innovation and consumer choice.<\/p><p pid=\"f1355.0\/4\">A secondary growth and international competitiveness objective is a simple and internationally proven way to achieve this, helping to ensure that the UK remains a leading global financial centre by empowering regulators to make the UK a better place to do business and ensuring a more attractive market for international providers and consumers of financial services. The UK is, of course, in competition with other international financial centres, and many of them, including Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, the United States and the European Union, have introduced a similar objective, which they balance against financial stability and consumer protection.<\/p><p pid=\"f1355.0\/5\">In future groups we will come to topics such as investment in high-growth firms, but it is precisely by having this secondary objective on competitiveness and growth that we will create an ecosystem that supports investment in new technologies, provides much-needed economic growth and secures new jobs.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b297.0\/1\">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship yet again, Sir Christopher. The subject of the debate is of enormous importance, and I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Alexander Stafford\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25864\">the Member for Rother Valley (Alexander Stafford)<\/phrase> for securing it, for the way in which he introduced it, and for his work as an active champion for literacy in his constituency.<\/p><p pid=\"b297.0\/2\">I totally agree with the hon. Members for Strangford (Jim Shannon) and for North Ayrshire and Arran (Patricia Gibson) about the importance of children of all ages being read to, instilling in them a love of reading and improving their vocabularies. I look forward to visiting the constituency of my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Priti Patel\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24778\">the Member for Witham (Priti Patel)<\/phrase> later this year to see &#8220;Get Witham Reading&#8221;. I pay tribute to her passion in ensuring that children in her constituency read well and have access to books. I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Justin Tomlinson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24870\">the Member for North Swindon (Justin Tomlinson)<\/phrase> for his commitment to high-quality education in his constituency, about which we talk regularly&#8212;not just general education, but reading in particular.<\/p><p pid=\"b297.0\/3\">My hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley says that we should improve children&#8217;s access to books. I wholeheartedly agree. That is why we have strengthened  the national curriculum to focus on developing reading, and putting phonics at its heart, to ensure that children can read. Reading is the principal way to acquire knowledge, and the national curriculum encourages pupils to develop the habit of reading widely and often, both for pleasure and for information, and to develop a love of reading.<\/p><p pid=\"b297.0\/4\">The texts that young people read play a significant part in their wider development, broadening their horizons and introducing new ideas and perspectives. As a child, I loved C.S. Lewis, C.S. Forester, E. Nesbit and L.P. Hartley, and today, I am ploughing my way through the 97 books that have won a Pulitzer since the introduction of the fiction prize in 1919. Charities such as World Book Day and the National Literacy Trust work tirelessly to raise the profile of reading for pleasure in our country, and for that I thank them and recognise their enormous contribution.<\/p><p pid=\"b297.0\/5\">The Government are committed to continue raising reading standards. We place great focus on ensuring that early reading is taught well from the very beginning of a child&#8217;s time at school. Following that focus, and the commitment of hundreds of thousands of teachers up and down the country, England came fourth of 43 countries that tested children of the same age in the 2021 progress in international reading literacy study. The results were published only last month, and I am grateful to all the primary schoolteachers and teaching assistants whose commitment to reading and embracing the phonics approach introduced by the Government made that possible. Indeed, the strongest predictor of PIRLS performance was the year 1 phonics screening checkmark, with higher marks predicting higher scores. England&#8217;s average PIRLS score of 558 was significantly above the international median of 520 and the European median of 524, and significantly higher than all other participants testing at the same age, with the exception of Singapore, Hong Kong and Russia. There were very high PIRLS scores in Northern Ireland, and I pay tribute to teachers there for their achievement in the study.<\/p><p pid=\"b297.0\/6\">That success in PIRLS follows the Government&#8217;s greater focus on reading in the primary curriculum, with a particular focus on phonics. It also follows reforms such as the English Hubs programme, the introduction of a phonics screening check in 2012, the reading framework, and the leading literacy national professional qualifications for teachers. My hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley mentioned the importance of children having books at home, and the correlation between book ownership and educational success. In the 2021 PIRLS, overall performance was strongly associated with the number of books that pupils had in their homes. The average score of pupils in England with fewer than 10 books in their home was 507 points, compared with an average score of 591 points&#8212;down from 598 in 2016&#8212;for those with more than 200 books at home.<\/p><p pid=\"b297.0\/7\">The English hubs programme is designed to spread best practice in how schools teach their pupils to read. So far, it has supported 1,600 schools intensively, with a focus on supporting children who are making the slowest progress in reading, many of whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds. That includes schools in Rother Valley, which are supported by two of our English hubs: Learners First and St Wilfrid&#8217;s. Between them, those two hubs have supported more than 100 other schools in the area. Schools supported intensively as partner schools by English hubs outperform non-partner  schools by about seven percentage points when comparing the change in the year 1 phonics screening check. We have also introduced the reading framework, which is guidance for schools that was first published in 2021. Over 90% of schools have read the framework, which provides guidance to schools about how to improve the teaching of reading.<\/p><p pid=\"b297.0\/8\">My hon. Friend also raised his concerns about provision for children with special educational needs and disabilities, particularly children who have chronic fatigue syndrome or Addison&#8217;s disease and who suffer from migraines. The next reading framework will include guidance on supporting children who are struggling to read, including those with special educational needs, and we regularly speak to experts, including SEND specialists, specialist schools and English hubs, about the way in which the Department can support teachers to ensure that children with dyslexia and other learning difficulties can progress well in their reading and meet the expectations by the time they leave primary school.<\/p>",

Even without an impact assessment, we know that Clause 2 and subsequent clauses will ensure that anyone coming to this country not through one of the incredibly limited safe routes faces likely detention and removal. Irrespective of the persecution, torture or whatever they have been through in the past, this is what they will face coming to this country under the Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"a1146.2\/2\">We formulated these two amendments originally in relation to unaccompanied children, but it seemed wrong on reflection that these protections should be limited in that way. Therefore, Amendment 14 now aims to ensure that the Secretary of State will not have the duty to arrange for the removal at the age of 18 of any person who arrived in the UK as a child. Amendment 15 would ensure that if, under Clause 3(2), the Secretary of State made arrangements for the removal of a person from the UK and the person came to the UK as a child, then such removal could take place only if it was in the best interests of the child. Amendment 17 would achieve the same protection for unaccompanied children, and I very much support it.<\/p><p pid=\"a1146.2\/3\">These amendments and others are vital in addressing the profound concerns of the Refugee and Migrant Children&#8217;s Consortium. It points out that the Bill, and in particular Clause 3, are an affront to the refugee convention, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Children Act 1989. If unamended, the measures in the Bill will have severe consequences for the welfare and physical and mental health of extremely vulnerable children who have fled conflict, persecution and other unimaginable harms. We do not have an impact assessment, the detail or the numbers, but the Bill will affect every child arriving in the UK who has not come by one of the very limited safe routes. These apply to Ukraine and Hong Kong&#8212;to put things simply. If one comes from Afghanistan, Sudan or one of those other very high-risk places, there are simply no safe routes for one to take.<\/p><p pid=\"a1146.2\/4\">As the Bill stands, trafficked children will be locked out of refugee protection. Instead, they will be detained by the Home Office outside the care system in entirely unsuitable, unacceptable accommodation without proper medical or mental health care, and removed at the age of 18. Those children will include a substantial number who are brought here as modern slaves. They have not chosen to come here. They have not come here voluntarily but have been brought against their will. I beg to move.<\/p>",

The Answer is as follows:<\/p><p pid=\"a1065.1\/2\">&#8220;Net migration to the UK is far too high. That was already clear from the previous set of official data. The ONS has today amended its previous published estimate of net migration for the year ending June 2022 to 606,000. The statistics published today show that net migration has flatlined since then. In the year ending December 2022, they show that net migration remains at an estimated 606,000. These particularly high figures are partly due to temporary and exceptional factors, such as the UK&#8217;s Ukraine and Hong Kong BNO schemes. Last year, 200,000 Ukrainians and 150,000 Hong Kong British overseas nationals made use of routes to life or time in the United Kingdom. Those schemes command broad support from the British public, and we were right to introduce them.<\/p><p pid=\"a1065.1\/3\">This Government remain committed to reducing overall net migration to sustainable levels. That is a solemn promise we made to the British public in our manifesto, and we are unwavering in our determination to deliver it. This week, we announced steps to tackle the substantial rise in the number of student dependants coming to the UK. The package of measures will ensure that we can reduce migration while continuing to benefit from the skills and resources our economy needs, because universities should be in the education business, not the immigration business. We expect this package to have a tangible impact on net migration. Taken together with the easing of temporary factors, such as our exceptional humanitarian offers, we expect net migration to fall to pre-pandemic levels in the medium term.<\/p><p pid=\"a1065.1\/4\">The public rightly expect us to control our borders, whether that is stopping the boats and addressing illegal migration or ensuring that levels of legal migration do not place undue pressure on public services, housing supply or integration. The Government are taking decisive action on both counts. Under the points-based system that we introduced post Brexit, we can control immigration; we must and we will.&#8221;<\/p>",

The most recent official statistics estimated net migration in the year to June 2022 at 504,000. This is partly due to temporary and exceptional factors such as the UK&#8217;s Ukraine and Hong Kong schemes. Last year, more than 200,000 Ukrainians and 150,000 Hong Kong British national overseas citizens made use of the routes to life or time in the United Kingdom. Those schemes command broad support from the British public, and we were right to introduce them.<\/p><p pid=\"a1061.1\/2\">The Government introduced a points-based system in 2020 to regain control of our borders post Brexit. We now need to decide who comes to the UK and to operate a system that can flex to the changing needs of the labour market, such as the skills needs of the NHS. However, immigration is dynamic, and we must adapt to take account of changing behaviours and if there is evidence of abuse. The number of dependants arriving alongside international students has risen more than eightfold since 2019, from 16,000 in the year to December 2019 to 136,000 in the year ending December 2022. Dependants of students make a more limited contribution to the economy than students or those coming under the skilled worker route but, more fundamentally, our system was not designed for such large numbers of people coming here in this manner.<\/p><p pid=\"a1061.1\/3\">Yesterday, we introduced a package of measures to help deliver our goal of reducing net migration. The package includes removing the right for international students to bring dependants unless they are on research postgraduate courses and removing the ability of international students to switch out of the student route into work routes before their studies have been completed. This is the right and fair thing to do. It ensures that we protect our public services and housing supply against undue pressure and deliver on the promises we have made to the public to reduce net migration.<\/p><p pid=\"a1061.1\/4\">Our education institutions are world-renowned, and for good reason, and the Government remain committed to the commitments in the international education strategy, including the goal of 600,000 international students coming to the United Kingdom each year. But universities should be in the education business, not the immigration business. We are taking concerted action to deliver a fair and effective immigration system that benefits our citizens, our businesses and our economy. We are determined to get this right because it is demonstrably in the national interest.&#8221;<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a915.0\/1\">My Lords, it is a privilege to wind up for His Majesty&#8217;s Opposition. I start by declaring my interest as a trustee of the Human Trafficking Foundation and my work with the University of Nottingham&#8217;s Rights Lab. I thank the Minister for arranging for my noble friend Lord Ponsonby and I to visit Western Jet Foil in Dover yesterday and the Manston reception centre to see the work that they do there. I know the Minister will join us in saying to noble Lords that, whatever our debates about policy, the work, commitment, professionalism and dedication of those people who are saving lives at sea and helping people when they come ashore are second to none, and they deserve our praise and tribute.<\/p><p pid=\"a915.0\/2\">Having said that, nobody is saying, as we debate the Bill, that there is not an issue about the boats and those coming across the channel in that way. Nobody is disputing that. Nobody is saying that there is no need to control our borders. Nobody is saying there is no need for any of the sorts of policies that we have been debating. What is before us is the way that it is done. What is the policy objective? What is the way of doing it? What is the way of controlling it? From the contributions that have been made, the debate that we have had here is saying that the Government have got it wrong and that not only will it not work&#8212;and I will come to the other points in a minute&#8212;but that it is not consistent with the principles we hold. That is a perfectly acceptable view to have. It does not mean that you are in favour of as many boats as possible coming across without any reflection on what we might do about it or that we do not care about that; it is saying that it is not the right way of going about it.<\/p><p pid=\"a915.0\/3\">Many noble Lords have been Members of the other place, as I have. Nobody is seeking in the slightest sense, as a couple of noble Lords have suggested, to block the will of the House of Commons as it has been expressed. That was defeated by a heavy majority in the vote last week, or whenever it was. That majority included me as I did not think it was right thing to do, but I will not be intimidated by the other place into not saying that this House has the perfect right to stand up, to change the Bill if we think it is wrong, to take out of it things we think are wrong and to say to the other place that it should think again because what it is seeking to do is not right. That is a perfectly reasonable thing to do and is the constitutional position of this House.<\/p><p pid=\"a915.0\/4\">My noble friend Lord Dubs is right: sometimes people will pray in aid public opinion one way or another and it changes. I could quote the local election results and some results where one would think that if the &#8220;stop the boats&#8221; message was working, there would have been different results from those that happened, but I will not make a political point. The point that I am trying to make is that public opinion changes, it moves and sometimes, as my noble friend Lord Dubs reminded us, it is incumbent upon people to say, without being arrogant or out of touch, that in this respect we think this is the right way to go forward, this is the right thing to do.<\/p><p pid=\"a915.0\/5\">The other point I want to make is that we are not a direct democracy; we are a representative democracy. That is an important point to make.<\/p><p pid=\"a915.0\/6\">Although I signed Amendment 2, which is important, Amendment 4 goes to the heart of this group. The noble Baroness, Lady Chakrabarti, the noble Lords, Lord Paddick and Lord Kirkhope, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Etherton, deserve a lot of praise for tabling it because it goes to the heart of the Bill. I think that in many ways&#8212;I disagree with noble Lords who say that this is not the case&#8212;it is unbelievable that we are having to discuss an amendment to a Bill which says that this Bill, which a Government of this country are bringing forward, has to be consistent with the international conventions that we have signed. I would have thought that was a given.<\/p><p pid=\"a915.0\/7\">I know there has been a great legal debate about what law means and whether we are a dualist country. I had never heard the word &#8220;dualist&#8221; until about a week ago. My simple understanding was, and the noble Lords, Lord Hannay and Lord Patten, and others made this point, that whether we are a dualist country or not, when a country signs an international convention, when it agrees with other countries that these are the rules that it is going to abide by, I think they probably think that means that it is going to abide by it whether you are a dualist country, a monist country or whatever country it is, because they believe that the Government of the country that they have negotiated an agreement with have made a binding commitment in terms of how they will proceed. That is the point. The noble Lord, Lord Patten, knows what happened in Hong Kong with the agreement. That is the whole point. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, has done more of those negotiations. What are we doing with Russia? We are saying to Russia in Ukraine that we are not going to stand by and watch it drive a coach and horses through international agreements and international conventions. We are not going to stand by and watch that happen. I am proud our country is doing that.<\/p><p pid=\"a915.0\/8\">That is why Amendment 4 is so important, but it is, frankly, unbelievable, as I said at the beginning, that it has had to be tabled. Is it really the case that our Government are telling the United Nations commissioner, the Council of Europe commissioner and all the other people who have said that this Bill breaks those conventions and things that we have signed, &#8220;You are wrong and we are right&#8221;? Is that really what we have come to? Is that really the situation that we are in? Are we not concerned about our reputation? The Government will say that it is not the case. I am sure the Minister will get up and say that we are abiding by these  conventions and that the Government do not understand why the commissioner has written and that he or she is wrong in writing to us and saying that we do not abide by this convention or that convention. I am sure that the Minister will say that, but why are they writing to us? They cannot both be right. Either they are right or the Government are right, and yet they are saying to the Government that many of the conventions they have signed are being broken by the Illegal Migration Bill. What is our Government saying? Has it really come down to our Government just dismissing it, just a shrug of the shoulders, it does not matter, who cares, we are not bothered? That is no way for a Government to run their affairs. The consequences of doing that are enormous.<\/p><p pid=\"a915.0\/9\">I finish by returning to the point about Amendment 4. I think it does us a favour; there might be one or two other conventions, but the amendment lays it out. These are fundamental ways in which countries have come together to say that, when dealing with some of the most difficult situations that we face, including the mass movement of people across borders, no country can do it alone. There must be co-operation, agreement and understanding&#8212;and those agreements and that understanding are based on countries believing that what they are told by another country will be adhered to and promises will be kept.<\/p><p pid=\"a915.0\/10\">If that is not the case, all this will fall apart and we will have international anarchy. Our country cannot solve the problem of refugees and migration alone; it needs to work with others. That was the basis of the conventions that we signed and of the agreements that we made; our international reputation stands on it and we should keep it.<\/p>",

The most recent official statistics estimated that net migration in the year to June 2022 was at 504,000. This is partly due to temporary and exceptional factors such as the UK&#8217;s Ukraine and Hong Kong schemes. Last year, more than 200,000 Ukrainians and 150,000 Hong Kong British nationals overseas made use of the routes to life or time in the United Kingdom. Those schemes command broad support from the British public, and we were right to introduce them.<\/p><p pid=\"c293.2\/2\">The Government introduced a points-based system in 2020 to regain control of our borders post Brexit. We now need to decide who comes to the UK and operate a system that can flex to the changing needs of the labour market, such as the skills needs of the NHS. However, immigration is dynamic, and we must adapt to take account of changing behaviours and if there is evidence of abuse. The number of dependants arriving alongside international students has risen more than eightfold since 2019, from 16,000 in the year to December 2019 to 136,000 in the year ending December 2022. Dependants of students make a more limited contribution to the economy than students or those coming under the skilled worker route, but more fundamentally, our system was not designed for such large numbers of people coming here in this manner.<\/p><p pid=\"c293.2\/3\">Yesterday, we introduced a package of measures to help deliver our goal of reducing net migration. The package includes removing the right for international students to bring dependants unless they are on research postgraduate courses and removing the ability for international students to switch out of the student route into work routes before their studies have been completed. This is the right and fair thing to do. It ensures we protect our public services and housing supply against undue pressure and we deliver on the promises we have made to the public to reduce net migration.<\/p><p pid=\"c293.2\/4\">Our education institutions are world-renowned, and for good reason, and the Government remain committed to the commitments in the international education strategy, including the goal of 600,000 international students coming to the United Kingdom each year. But universities should be in the education business, not the immigration business. We are taking concerted action to deliver a fair and effective immigration system that benefits our citizens, our businesses and our economy. We are determined to get this right because it is demonstrably in the national interest.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>The Government committed to bringing net migration down in the 2019 manifesto and remains committed to doing so. In December 2020, we ended decades of uncontrolled migration from the European Union and put in place a new points-based immigration system to give ministers full control of our borders. For the first time since we joined the EU, we gained complete control of who comes to the UK and the ability to operate an immigration system that we can flex to the changing needs of the economy and labour market, as well as tailor to the skills and talent needed by UK businesses and our NHS.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>But immigration is dynamic, and we must constantly iterate our approach to take account of changing migrant flows and respond to evidence of abuse or unintended consequences. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) published data in November 2022 which estimated that net migration in the year June 2021 to June 2022 was at 504,000 - up significantly on the previous year, and higher than pre-Brexit volumes. They partly attributed this rise to temporary factors &#8211; such as a post-Covid surge and safe and legal routes, like the UK&#8217;s Ukraine and Hong Kong schemes.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The immigration statistics also highlighted an unexpected rise in the number of dependants coming to the UK alongside international students. Around 136,000 visas were granted to dependants of sponsored students in the year ending December 2022, a more than eight-fold increase from 16,000 in 2019, when the Government&#8217;s commitment to lower net migration was made. This does not detract from the considerable success that the Government and the higher education sector have had in achieving the goals from our International Education Strategy, meeting our target to host 600,000 international students studying in the UK per year by 2030, for two years running, and earlier than planned &#8211; a success story in terms of economic value and exports.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The International Education Strategy plays an important part in supporting the economy through the economic contribution students can bring to the UK, but this should not be at the expense of our commitment to the public to lower overall migration and ensure that migration to the UK is highly skilled and therefore provides the most benefit. The proposals we are announcing today will ensure that we can continue to meet our International Education Strategy commitments, while making a tangible contribution to reducing net migration to sustainable levels. The terms of the graduate route remain unchanged.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Following close working with the Department for Education and HM Treasury, I am pleased to announce a package of measures to help deliver our goal of falling net migration, while supporting the Government&#8217;s priority of growing the economy.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>This package includes:<\/p><p> <\/p><ol><li>Removing the right for international students to bring dependants unless they are on postgraduate courses currently designated as research programmes.<\/li><li>Removing the ability for international students to switch out of the student route into work routes before their studies have been completed.<\/li><li>Reviewing the maintenance requirements for students and dependants.<\/li><li>Steps to clamp down on unscrupulous education agents who may be supporting inappropriate applications to sell immigration not education.<\/li><li>Better communicating immigration rules to the higher education sector and to international students.<\/li><li>Improved and more targeted enforcement activity.<\/li><\/ol><p> <\/p><p>We are committed to attracting the brightest and the best to the UK. Therefore, our intention is to work with universities over the course of the next year to design an alternative approach that ensures that the best and the brightest students can bring dependants to our world leading universities, while continuing to reduce net migration. We will bring in this system as soon as possible, after thorough consultation with the sector and key stakeholders.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>This package strikes the right balance between acting decisively on tackling net migration and protecting the economic benefits that students can bring to the UK. Now is the time for us to make these changes to ensure an impact on net migration as soon as possible. We expect this package to have a tangible impact on net migration. Taken together with the easing of temporary factors, we expect net migration to fall to pre-pandemic levels in the medium term.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We recognise that no one single measure will control immigration. As the impacts of temporary pressures becomes clearer, we will keep matters under review. The Government will seek to continue to strike the balance between reducing overall net migration with ensuring that businesses have the skills they need and we continue to support economic growth. Those affected by this package will predominantly be dependants of students who make a more limited contribution to the economy than students or those coming under the Skilled Worker route, minimising the impact on UK growth.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c58.0\/1\">I shall start off where I left off in the Bill&#8217;s Second Reading debate. By way of background, the Bill is to be welcomed, although it is important that it is viewed as the start of the process of fundamentally reforming business rates and not the endgame. It probably would have been preferable to have heeded the advice of the Chartered Institute of Taxation and for the Government to have brought forward a new consolidated business rates Bill, rather than to amend the Local Government Finance Act 1988. That would have sent the message to businesses both large and small that real change was on the way. However, we are where we are and we must ensure that, ultimately, this Bill paves the way to reducing business rates to an affordable level, putting the business rates system on a long-term, more easily understood footing and removing those barriers to regional growth.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/2\">We must have in mind the ultimate end goal, which should be to get the uniform business rate multiplier back down from in excess of 50p in the pound to the more affordable 30p in the pound, which is where we started when the system came in in the early &#8217;90s. To get to that, we need annual valuations, the abolition of the multitude of complicated reliefs and to digitalise the Valuation Office Agency. The Bill moves us in that direction&#8212;although perhaps a little too tentatively. Moreover, the duty to notify, which takes up much of the Bill, adds a bureaucratic burden on businesses and there are some unintended consequences that we should avoid. We must have in mind the need at all times for increased transparency. The amendments that I tabled have those considerations in mind.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/3\">Any adjustments to the business rates system should be guided by two principles: reducing the regulatory burden on businesses and, as I said, reducing the uniform business rate multiplier. We should look at the Bill with those considerations in mind and aim to move towards a sustainable system that provides a long-term revenue stream that businesses can find bearable, which has not been the case so often in recent years.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/4\">A properly functioning property tax system is critical to achieving a vibrant and sustainable economy. For most of this century, an outdated and unresponsive business rates system has placed enormous strain on many businesses, particularly those in the retail and hospitality sectors. Moreover, that strain has not been shared equally across the country. That illustrates how the current system is a hindrance&#8212;a logjam&#8212;to levelling up. We need non-domestic rates to be more responsive to changes in the economy so as to ensure that the system does not place an undue and unfair strain on businesses. If we can achieve that, we shall be more able to attract long-term investment into our towns and cities, and we shall be better placed to meet other vital policy objectives such as revitalising our high streets and achieving our net zero aims and goals.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/5\">Clause 5 relates to the frequency at which revaluations take place.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/6\">As I have mentioned, we need to move to the end goal of annual valuations, so that business rates are more in line with the economic outlook. I have tabled amendments 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 with that objective in mind. To achieve a responsive business rates system, valuations should be carried out as regularly as possible. The Bill is a good first step, and increases valuations from every five to every three years, but it should provide the flexibility for a future Government to require more frequent valuations &#8212;ultimately, every year. Annual revaluation could bring bills more in line with commercial property values, rather than lagging many years behind. Even with a three-year list and a two-year antecedent valuation date, occupiers will be paying business rates bills in early 2026 that are based on valuations from nearly five years beforehand.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/7\">Annual revaluations are essential if the Government are serious about modernising the business rates system. They take place in countries as diverse as Hong Kong and the Netherlands, and thus there is no reason why they should not take place in England and Wales. To conclude on this issue, the enormous administrative burden placed on ratepayers by the new duty to notify  would certainly not be worth the distress and inconvenience it will cause if it does not ultimately result in the introduction of annual revaluations. In that context, I urge the Government to give full consideration to these amendments.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/8\">Clause 13 sets out the requirement for ratepayers to provide information&#8212;this is the new duty to notify, which, as drafted, places an unnecessary burden on businesses. Amendments 13, 14 and 15 have the objective of reducing that burden and imposing penalties on the Valuation Office Agency.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/9\">Amendments 18 and 19 relate to clause 19, and would ensure that guidance is made available to business ratepayers before the duty to notify comes into effect. The new duty to notify will place an onus on all ratepayers to provide the Valuation Office Agency with any information that they reasonably believe could impact on the business rates valuation. This is an enormous additional ask, not least for the 700,000 businesses which, up to now, have not been subject to business rates and might be completely unaware of what is proposed. The duty requires ratepayers to notify the VOA of changes to their properties within a 60-day window, and carries the risk of financial sanctions and even imprisonment if they fail to comply.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/10\">As a former chartered surveyor, I cannot see how such a burdensome duty on all commercial property occupiers&#8212;including, as I have said, current non-ratepayers&#8212;can be justified as necessary to administer a move to three-yearly revaluations. This duty might be bearable for businesses if it assisted the VOA in administering the move to annual revaluations. For small businesses, it will cause more pain than the gain that will be derived from moving to three-yearly valuations.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/11\">The new duty will leave many ratepayers wondering what might qualify as a notifiable change. The VOA is yet to publish any guidance; thus many businesses will take no chances and will notify the VOA of any changes to their properties. The VOA will hence be hoist with its own petard, as it will be flooded with paperwork.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/12\">As I mentioned on Second Reading, many businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises without any rating expertise, will turn to rogue rating advisers for help. Business rates advisers do not require a licence to practise, and many unscrupulous operators will see the new duty to notify as an opportunity to take advantage of small businesses.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/13\">While the ratepayer has a short period in which to notify the VOA of any changes to the property, as the Bill stands, the VOA has no such obligation. It can, in effect, respond to notifications at its leisure. I therefore propose a reciprocal provision that places on the VOA a 60-day timeframe in which to respond to notifications, with rebates to the ratepayer equivalent to the fines set out in clause 13 that accompany a failure to comply.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/14\">Clause 6 is a short and simple but nevertheless extremely important clause, which gives effect to the removal of downwards transitional phasing, as announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">17 November<\/phrase> last year in his autumn statement. That was a positive step, but clause 6 as drafted does not permanently remove the threat of downwards phasing, which is a punitive tax that unfairly penalises occupiers whose rateable values have fallen. It is wrong to force those whose property values have fallen to subsidise those whose property values have risen.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/15\">The clause as it stands simply removes the requirement for transitional phasing mechanisms to be revenue-neutral. That means that the Government no longer need to fund any upwards transitional mechanism with a corresponding downwards transitional mechanism. However, that means that a downwards mechanism can be easily introduced by a future Government without any parliamentary scrutiny. Amendments 11 and 12 would plug that loophole and permanently abolish downwards transitional phasing. If any future Government want to reintroduce it, they should come to Parliament and make the case for it, rather than bringing it in through the back door.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/16\">Amendment 16 would delete clause 14, which, from my perspective, is inequitable and unfair to businesses. As it stands, clause 14 exempts Government legislation from qualifying for the pursuit of a material change of circumstances. That would remove a vital check on Government and would allow future Governments to legislate with impunity at the expense of businesses right across the country, leaving them no recourse to challenge legislation that interferes with their ability to do business.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/17\">A material change in circumstances gives ratepayers recourse to pursue relief on their business rates when circumstances outside their control hinder their ability to do business. Clause 14 exempts Government legislation from being a qualifying reason for a material change in circumstances. I anticipate that the Government have included this clause because they want business rates to be a predictable source of revenue, even if their own legislation or action undermines the very rateable value of the properties occupied by businesses.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/18\">During the covid lockdown, to prevent the spread of the virus, the Government forced a number of businesses to cease trading. However, instead of accepting that there had been a material change of circumstances for those occupiers and allowing appeals to be launched, the Government introduced a locally administered compensation scheme. With clause 14, the Government are seeking the freedom to introduce any legislation at any time that might alter the rateable value of a property. That is both unprecedented and wrong.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/19\">Clause 14 can be viewed as a power grab that sets a dangerous precedent and tells occupiers that they will have to accept the detrimental impact of legislation on their ability to do business, with no legal recourse. Amendment 16 would delete clause 14, restoring the ability of ratepayers to claim a material change of circumstances, regardless of how the change in circumstances arose.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/20\">Amendments 4, 5, 17 and 25 would amend and add to clauses 1 and 14 and part 1 of the schedule. They address a niche issue, albeit an extremely important one. The out-of-home advertising industry includes adverts on billboards, walls, digital posters, street furniture, bus shelters, buses and railway stations, which we see every day as we go about our lives and probably take for granted. The industry provides an important form of income for local authorities, and it is estimated that almost half the revenue generated goes back into local communities. These amendments would abolish the liability to non-domestic rating in respect of advertising rights.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/21\">The removal of business rates on advertising rights from the rating lists would have three advantages. First, it would increase the value and level of services provided   by local authorities. Secondly, it would remove a competitive disadvantage to growth that impacts the out-of-home advertising industry, but that does not apply to its rivals&#8212;broadcast, print and online media. Thirdly, it would reduce the high level of inefficiencies relating to advertising rights applied through the Valuation Office Agency, local authorities and the out-of-home advertising industry.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/22\">As drafted, the Bill will directly and adversely impact the industry&#8217;s ability to invest in local communities. That runs contrary to the Bill&#8217;s objective of reducing barriers to business investment. In 2023, business rates charged on advertising rights are an antiquated, out-of-date and ineffective tax. Advertising rights are the only remaining right attracting liability for non-domestic rating. The liability to non-domestic rating in respect of sporting rights was abolished by the Local Government and Rating Act 1997. Amendments 4, 5, 17 and 25 would remove that anomaly.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/23\">In conclusion, I have enormous respect for the Minister and for his co-sponsor of the Bill, my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury. Although Treasury Ministers are not currently present on the Front Bench, I am mindful that the Bill has been drafted from a Treasury perspective, gathering in all that money. That is incredibly important&#8212;don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8212;but I suggest we also need to look at the issue through the prism of business.<\/p><p pid=\"c58.0\/24\">Whether large, medium-sized or small, businesses need confidence, certainty and a fully reformed business rates system that takes on board some of the amendments I have put forward. A fully reformed system will mean that businesses will know where they stand, and business rates will not be the elephant in the room. People will be able to invest in, build on and expand their businesses with a degree of confidence, leading to increased profits. What that will do&#8212;joy to the Treasury&#8212;is increase taxation. The Bill makes a start and provides an opportunity for us to turn the vicious circle of business rates into a virtuous circle.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a425.0\/1\">My Lords, I shall speak to the proposition in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Lansley that Clause 127 should not stand part of the Bill. My noble friend and I are job-sharing for much of this section of the Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"a425.0\/2\">This clause deals with pilots for community land auctions, which aim to give local authorities the ability to benefit far more greatly from new development than they do under the current system, even as proposed in the Bill. Basically, it takes the principle behind Section 106, the new homes bonus, CIL and the infrastructure levy a stage further, but in doing so it risks compromising the integrity of the planning system by moving more towards the sale of planning consents.<\/p><p pid=\"a425.0\/3\">The Explanatory Notes to the Bill are normally quite helpful, but the 10 lines on the background to CLAs, on page 126, do not explain what is going to happen. As I understand the proposal, a landowner can name the price at which he is willing to sell his land to the council&#8212;it would probably be agricultural land, but it could be industrial land&#8212;which then has an option to purchase the land at that price. The price will be somewhere between the current value and the hope value with planning consent. The local authority then develops its plan, and if that land is deemed suitable for housing development, it buys it at the option price and resells it to the developer, pocketing the difference. I assume the Government hope that many landowners will take advantage of the scheme so that the local authority has a choice and the ability to choose best value. I think it clear from that scenario that the local authority has a financial incentive to designate land for development over which it has an option, in preference to land over which it has no option but which may be more appropriate for development. I will return to that in a moment.<\/p><p pid=\"a425.0\/4\">As the noble Baroness, Lady Taylor, said, this clause was not in the original Bill; it was shoehorned in at a relatively late stage in November, along with street votes. Noble Lords who were in the Chamber at the time may recall that I was less than enthusiastic about street votes, and indeed they received a sceptical response from the House. So, we now have two policies that seem to have gone straight from a think tank into primary legislation without the normal careful scrutiny that one associates with planning reform, overtaking on the way many oven-ready policies on leasehold and rental reform or repeal of the Vagrancy Act, which was originally in the Bill but now dropped.<\/p><p pid=\"a425.0\/5\">It is actually quite difficult to get information about community land auctions. I googled it and discovered that apparently the only place that has them is Hong Kong, but all land there is in public ownership so it is not really a good comparator. They have been championed by Tim Leunig, a respected economist, when he was at the CentreForum think tank in 2011-12; he is now a senior policy adviser to the Secretary of State at DLUHC. Tim Leunig gives an illustration of his proposal that will strike terror into the heart of my noble friend Lord Lansley. He says that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a425.0\/6\">&#8220;were Cambridge to allow a million new houses near the city&#8212;like America&#8217;s Silicon Valley&#8212;it could give current adult residents around &#163;700,000 each. Again, that should be a vote winner&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a425.0\/7\">I see my noble friend wondering what he is going to do with all that money. One of the articles that Tim Leunig wrote making the case said that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a425.0\/8\">&#8220;it will kick start the economy. Every extra house we build creates at least three jobs. Building an extra 300,000 would boost employment by around a million jobs &#8230; The government says that it will pilot this scheme; we should hold it to its word&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a425.0\/9\">The date of that article was <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">4 January 2012<\/phrase>, and indeed in his 2011 Budget George Osborne announced that he would pilot a land auction model. However, as far as I can see, no progress has been made, perhaps because the proposition did not withstand critical scrutiny.<\/p><p pid=\"a425.0\/10\">The only other reference that I have been able to find in this country is from 2017. The Government announced a task force to investigate a new way of paying for infrastructure projects, such as new public transport. It asked the task force on funding infrastructure to look at the so-called development rights auction model of land value capture. I have not been able to find its conclusions so perhaps my noble friend can shed some light on what happened to that task force.<\/p><p pid=\"a425.0\/11\">I am reluctant to condemn out of hand proposals to capture more effectively the windfall gains made from planning consents, but I think this House has a responsibility to scrutinise with particular care policies such as this that simply have not undergone the normal critical scrutiny. We need to look at the risks and ask why it appears that no one else has adopted this policy.<\/p><p pid=\"a425.0\/12\">An obvious risk is that it could distort the planning system. Local authorities, which are under enormous financial pressure, could stand to make large windfall gains from land that is less suitable for development. They will be announcing the winner of a race when they have backed a particular horse. The policy risks contaminating the integrity of the planning system and producing suboptimal sites for development, and I suspect that my learned friends will be considering the possibility of judicial review.<\/p><p pid=\"a425.0\/13\">I can illustrate the risks from my former constituency, North West Hants. In 1996, Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council and Hampshire County Council bought 2,000 acres of agricultural land just outside Basingstoke. Now, 3,500 new homes are being built on that site, begging the question of whether ownership may have influenced the planning decision.<\/p><p pid=\"a425.0\/14\">I wonder how many landowners will be tempted by the scheme. It works only if there is a proper market. Will they go through the hassle of submitting options? What inquiries have the Government made of landowners to see whether they will play? If a landowner thinks the land is suitable for development, why should they not wait and pocket all the money instead of sharing the windfall with the local authority? Most of them are able to take a long-term view of their interests. What happens in an area where there is only one major landowner, or there are not very many and they can easily collude on the option price or decide not to play?<\/p><p pid=\"a425.0\/15\">Then there are some technical questions. How does this interact with Section 106 or the infrastructure levy? Does the developer have to pay that as well, or has the planning authority already secured its share through the auction? What has been the response of the LGA or the TCPA to this proposal?<\/p><p pid=\"a425.0\/16\">Another issue was raised by my noble friend Lord Lansley and the noble Baroness, Lady Taylor, in responding to the last debate. When I first became a local councillor in 1968, there were few sources of revenue for the council. We had the rents and the charges as revenue that we generated locally; there were the business rates and domestic rates; and there was the central government grant. We are now moving progressively towards a different system of funding local government with Section 106, the infrastructure levy and, potentially, community land auctions. In the old days, we had something called rate equalisation,  which recognised that some local authorities had fewer resources than others. Given that factor, which is central to levelling up, I wonder to what extent central government is going to have to inject some sort of equalisation into this new scenario of the infrastructure levy and community land auctions.<\/p><p pid=\"a425.0\/17\">To take the Cambridge example that I mentioned a few moments ago, would central government really stand back and allow one local authority to make such a huge gain, or would it say, &#8220;We need to share this benefit more generally&#8221;? Can my noble friend say, in winding up, in addition to addressing the consequences of moving down the CLA route, what the Government&#8217;s proposal is to make sure that this is a levelling-up Bill? My noble friend said in winding up the earlier debate on the infrastructure levy that it will capture more in high-value areas. Yes, of course it will&#8212;and so will this. How are we going to make sure that the whole thing does not go against the grain of levelling up?<\/p><p pid=\"a425.0\/18\">I hope I have not been too unfair on the proposal. We need fresh thinking, but the job of this House is to scrutinise legislation. That is what we need to do with Clause 127.<\/p>",

I thank Members from all parts of the House for their contributions and the tone and thoughtful nature of this discussion. As my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Bob Blackman\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24945\">the Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman)<\/phrase> noted, as a former Local Government Secretary I have been interested in this issue for some time and in fact took the decision not only to create the Everyone In programme but to ensure that, as the name suggested, it included those who had no recourse to public funds. I appreciate the difficulties some of those individuals have found themselves in, particularly during the unique circumstances of the pandemic, which put huge pressure  on both them and, as the right hon. Member for East Ham reminded me before the debate, their families back home in their countries of origin, some of whom might have been sending them help in times of straitened circumstances but were not able to do so during that particularly difficult period.<\/p><p pid=\"a546.0\/2\">The right hon. Gentleman and others across the House are clearly aware of the context of NRPF policy, which has evolved over decades, but it might be helpful to set that out again. It is a well-established principle that migrants coming to the UK should be able to maintain and support themselves and their families without posing a burden on the welfare system. Successive Governments have taken the view that access to benefits and other publicly funded services should in general reflect the strength of a migrant&#8217;s connections to the UK and, in the main, only become available to migrants when they have become settled here with indefinite leave to remain.<\/p><p pid=\"a546.0\/3\">We operate a comparatively permissive legal migration system in this country, enabling people to come here particularly for work and study purposes, and with respect to work at a relatively low salary threshold of approximately &#163;26,000 per year plus other conditions. In order to maintain a relatively permissive legal migration system, it is important that we have regard for the taxpayer and encourage people to come who are able to look after themselves and their families. The alternative would be to tighten the legal migration system, and, for example, as some argue, to increase the salary threshold considerably. There are pros and cons to either approach, but I think there is broad consensus across the House that NRPF is required although we must manage it carefully to ensure that people who are in this country, particularly for a sustained period of time, can live appropriately and decently and we look after those in the most challenging situations. The position the Government therefore take is to ensure that those seeking to establish a life in the UK must do so on a basis that prevents burden on the taxpayer and promotes integration, and the vast majority of temporary migrants coming to visit, study or work here are subject to NRPF as a result.<\/p><p pid=\"a546.0\/4\">It is recognised that some migrants will find themselves at risk of destitution, as I have said, and a response to that would be to say they can return home to their own country, but I appreciate that that is challenging in some circumstances and we do not want people to be in periods of sustained destitution in the United Kingdom. Appropriate safeguards have been introduced for circumstances whereby an individual is destitute or at risk of imminent destitution. Migrants with permission under the family or private life routes, permission outside the rules on the basis of article 8 of the European convention on human rights or the Hong Kong British national overseas route, can apply for free to have the NRPF condition lifted by making a &#8220;change of conditions&#8221; application. The latest data published in February, for quarter 4 of 2022, shows that 68% of the decisions taken on &#8220;change of conditions&#8221; applications were granted and that the Home Office and its associated organisations have now restored that process to pre-pandemic levels, which is the right thing to do. We have provided flexibility around the immediate impact on immigration status for accessing public funds. Families are no longer automatically moved from the five-year to the 10-year route to settlement  when their NRPF condition is lifted; their circumstances are reassessed when they next apply for permission to stay, and they can remain on the five-year route only if they continue to meet all the requirements.<\/p><p pid=\"a546.0\/5\">To give proper effect to the Government&#8217;s schemes in response to the cost of living crisis, the Home Office ensured that those with NRPF could access the measures as intended: for example, the energy bills support scheme, which has delivered &#163;400 non-repayable Government discounts on electricity bills to help households in Great Britain, as well as the council tax rebate for those living in certain council tax bands. Subject to the relevant income thresholds, those with NRPF can access free school meals and early years education for two-year-olds. I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman both for welcoming that and for having played a part in encouraging the Government to do so.<\/p><p pid=\"a546.0\/6\">Statutory benefits including statutory sick pay, statutory maternity pay and contribution-based jobseeker&#8217;s allowance are accessible to all those who have made sufficient tax contributions, including those with NRPF. Local authorities can provide basic safety-net support regardless of immigration status. I take the points made by a number of hon. Members about the variable application of that by local authorities and the guidance that the Home Office provides. We have a responsibility to improve those things.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1920.0\/1\">I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken. It is a measure of the importance of the issue before us that there have been some 80 speakers in this debate. As we have heard from noble Lords across the House, as well as from my right honourable friends the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary, it is clear that we must stop the boats. That much, at least, is common ground.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/2\">Our approach is driven by a desire to do right by the people of this country and guided by that most British of principles&#8212;fairness. The present situation is anything but fair. The case for decisive action could not be clearer. I say again: ours is a generous and compassionate country. We will continue offering sanctuary and refuge to those fleeing persecution, conflict and tyranny, but we will not accept mass illegal migration to our shores. That is why we need this Bill: to stop the boats and address this challenge once and for all.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/3\">I turn to the matters raised in the debate, including the points addressed in the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Paddick. First, the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury and other noble Lords were right to place the Bill in its moral context. Proceeding with this Bill is the moral course. We must put a stop to the dangerous channel crossings putting lives at risk and splitting families. We must end the callous exploitation of vulnerable people by the people smugglers, uphold the law and ensure fair play for those who abide by our Immigration Rules.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/4\">A number of noble Lords commented on the fact that, on the introduction of this Bill in your Lordships&#8217; House, I made a statement under Section 19(1)(b) of the Human Rights Act. I think it is fair to say that there has been a misunderstanding of the effect of such a statement. We have designed a scheme that is novel and ambitious; as a result, we have made a Section 19(1)(b) statement under that Act. This simply makes it clear that we cannot say definitively that we will win a challenge in Strasbourg. However, we are confident that Strasbourg will respect the will of Parliament and our domestic court processes. We make no apologies for taking this approach. This is what the situation demands and what the British public expect.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/5\">Section 19(1)(b) statements have been made by Governments of all stripes. One was made by the then Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, when bringing forward the House of Lords Reform Bill in 2012. Similarly, Tessa Jowell made a Section 19(1)(b) statement in what became the Communications Act 2003. It is noteworthy that, when that Act was later challenged in the European Court of Human Rights, it found in the Animal Defenders case that there was no violation of the convention.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/6\">A number of noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Cashman, and the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, argued that this Bill breaches our international obligations. There were some equally forthright contributions making the contrary and, in my view, very persuasive case from my noble friends Lord Howard of Lympne, Lord Lamont, Lord Wolfson KC and Lord Sandhurst KC, some of them drawing on the work of Professor Ekins KC and others at Policy Exchange, which has written extensively on this topic. The Government take their international obligations, including under the ECHR, very seriously. There is nothing in the Bill, including in Clause 53, that requires the UK to breach its international obligations.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/7\">In any event, it is not correct that a failure to comply with interim measures invariably involves a breach of international law. There are exceptional circumstances where non-compliance with an interim measure is not a breach of international law.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/8\">The noble Baroness, Lady Lister, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham, and the noble Lord, Lord Alton, among others, argued that the Bill breaches the refugee convention. I can assure the House that we are satisfied that the provisions in the Bill comply with the refugee convention.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/9\">It is a long-standing principle that those in need of protection should claim asylum at the earliest opportunity in the first safe country they reach. This is an established part of international asylum procedures and applied across the EU, such as through the Common European Asylum System. This concept seeks to ensure that migration from safe countries does not undermine concerted efforts to help those most in need. Plainly, all illegal arrivals across the channel come from a safe country, mostly France; as my noble friend Lord Dobbs, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, rightly pointed out, their lives are not in danger in France, and they are taking the place of those in genuine need.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/10\">In December, the High Court upheld the lawfulness of this principle&#8212;that those in need of protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach &#8212;concluding that the Government can relocate asylum seekers to Rwanda, for their claims to be determined by Rwanda rather than by the United Kingdom. We look forward to the Court of Appeal&#8217;s judgment on this question in the near future.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/11\">This addresses the concerns in this regard expressed by various noble Lords, including the noble Lords, Lord Browne of Ladyton, Lord Howarth of Newport, and the noble Baroness, Lady Jones. We have always made it clear that no one will be returned or removed to a country where they may be persecuted, and this will not change.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/12\">The noble Lord, Lord German, argued that, in disapplying Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998, the Bill was transferring powers from Parliament and the courts to the Secretary of State. However, the opposite is the case. The Human Rights Act, especially Section 3, has in some cases shifted the balance away from Parliament towards the courts. We are already proposing to repeal Section 3 of the Human Rights Act in the Bill of Rights Bill, so our courts will no longer be required by that Act to rewrite legislation passed by this Parliament. Ahead of wider reforms to our human rights framework, we are implementing this disapplication to the provisions of this Bill to avoid courts adopting an interpretation which is inconsistent with Parliament&#8217;s intentions.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/13\">A number of noble Lords, including my noble friend Lady Helic, have been labouring under a misapprehension that the Bill removes judicial oversight. I would gently invite those who think this carefully to read the relevant clauses of the Bill. In all cases, individuals will have the opportunity to make suspensive claims with judicial oversight in the Upper Tribunal&#8212;these claims are suspensive of removal.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/14\">In all cases, individuals can institute other legal challenges, including judicial reviews on human rights grounds, in the normal way. However, these claims are non-suspensive of removal. These claims can continue remotely, as they have done historically for other immigration claims, for example in the case of the  refusal of a spousal entry clearance application. Additionally, the Bill provides for continued judicial oversight of detention as it will be open to any detainee at any time to apply to the High Court for a writ of habeas corpus or its equivalent in Scotland.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/15\">Many noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, questioned whether there is evidence of the misuse of our modern slavery protections. The modern slavery clauses are fundamentally about preventing dangerous and illegal crossings that pose a threat to public order. However, it is clear that the national referral mechanism offers world-leading protections to victims of modern slavery, and we must be alert to the risk that these protections will be used to frustrate removal action. Last year, 17,000 referrals took on average 543 days to reach a conclusive-grounds decision, making modern slavery protections susceptible to misuse.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/16\">Modern slavery referrals from detention and prison have also increased. In 2020, 27%&#8212;that is, 1,005&#8212;of the people detained within the UK following immigration offences were referred as potential victims of modern slavery, and only 1% of individuals detained within the UK following an immigration offence who made a modern slavery claim&#8212;I repeat, only 1%&#8212;were returned. The NRM referral rate for people arriving in the UK on small boats and being detained for return has risen from 6% of detentions ending in 2019&#8212;that is, 50 people &#8212;to 73% in 2021. The referral rate has since fallen slightly to 65% between January and September 2022. In contrast, where people were not detained for return, less than 3% of people who arrived in the UK on small boats in 2021 were referred to the NRM within three months of entering the UK. Modern slavery laws are, therefore, an inextricable part of an immigration system that is open to being misused in order to block removals.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/17\">My noble friends Lady Mobarik and Lady Stroud, as well as other noble Lords, including the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Gloucester, expressed concerns about the impact of the Bill on victims of modern slavery. The Government are committed to tackling the heinous crime of modern slavery and supporting victims. The Bill ensures that individuals who arrive in the UK illegally will no longer have the potential to misuse modern slavery protections to thwart their removal from the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/18\">The measures are not a blanket approach. If a person needs to stay in the UK to help support an investigation into and the prosecution of their people traffickers, they will be exempt. If someone is identified as a potential victim of modern slavery, the Government will ensure that they are safely returned to their home country where possible, or to another safe third country, such as Rwanda. This will mean that trafficking victims are given modern slavery support and that traffickers can be brought to justice, while preventing people from abusing our modern slavery laws. These provisions are consistent with our international obligations. Indeed, under Article 13 of ECAT, the UK has a right to disqualify individuals who pose a threat to public order. However, we recognise that this is a significant step, and that is why the modern slavery provisions in the Bill are time-limited; unless renewed, they will cease to apply after two years.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/19\">A good many noble Lords, including my noble friend Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth, argued that the solution to the small boats problem is to open up more safe and legal routes. I am sorry to say that this is of itself no answer. The UK has a long and proud history of supporting refugees, and we are committed to maintaining clear, well-defined, global safe and legal routes for people in need of protection. The UK, working with the UNHCR, currently operates a number of safe and legal routes which support people directly from regions of conflict and instability. In addition, we operate country-specific schemes for those who are eligible from Afghanistan, Ukraine and Hong Kong. But with worldwide refugee displacement now standing at around 100 million people, as observed during the debate, the United Kingdom cannot help everyone. I think there is agreement on that point around much of the House.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/20\">It is important to add that those seeking protection should claim asylum in the first safe country. This is the fastest route to safety. The Prime Minister has committed to introduce a cap on the number of people coming via safe and legal routes, which will be based on the capacity of our local authorities, agreed by Parliament and amendable in the event of humanitarian crises.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/21\">The Bill delivers this, and I welcome the support from the Front Bench opposite for the principle of a cap. I too well remember the most reverend Primate proposing such a cap during his debate in December. The cap is necessary if we are to ensure that the number of individuals we welcome through safe and legal routes does not exceed the capacity of the UK to integrate and accommodate them effectively&#8212;a point well made by my noble friend Lord Farmer in respect of stretched children&#8217;s services. This is the right way to ensure that we can continue to provide sanctuary to those in need of international protection as part of a well-managed and sustainable migration system.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/22\">As now provided for in the Bill, the Government will publish a report within six months of Royal Assent on current and any proposed additional safe and legal routes. I repeat: we will implement those new routes by the end of next year.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/23\">A number of noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Scriven, and the noble Baroness, Lady Brinton, argued for the exclusion of children from the duty to remove or the detention powers in the Bill. We also heard calls to exclude pregnant women from the detention powers. I am glad to tell the House that, to date, there have been very few pregnant women in the small boats. Let me say to the House that such a move would only serve to incentivise the people smugglers to target particular groups or those with certain characteristics. The result could well be that more children and pregnant women were put into flimsy boats, putting more young lives at risk, splitting up families and encouraging adults to make false claims that they are a child.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/24\">I can assure your Lordships&#8217; House that families will be kept together wherever possible and that children will be detained for as short a period as possible in age-appropriate accommodation. Moreover, as we have already made clear, our policy is not to arrange to remove unaccompanied children before they turn 18, save in  very limited circumstances, as now set out on the face of the Bill&#8212;for example, for the purpose of reunion with a parent or where removal is to a safe country of origin; and they may only be detained in specific circumstances, to be prescribed in regulations.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/25\">On the issue of detention more broadly, contrary to what a number of noble Lords opposite have said, the Bill does not provide for indefinite detention. It does enable detention for the purposes of removal, and in doing so codifies in part the long-standing common-law principles governing immigration detention, including that a person may be detained only for a period that is reasonable in all the circumstances. They will not be, as the noble Baroness, Lady Chakrabarti, put it, interned in legal limbo indefinitely.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/26\">The noble Baroness, Lady Lister, expressed concerns regarding the provisions strengthening scientific age-assessment methods. It is critical that the Government take action to disincentivise individuals who are deliberately mispresenting their age in order to cheat the system, as well as to protect genuine children. Determining the age of a young person is an inherently difficult task, and we are aware that no single age-assessment method, scientific or not, can determine an individual&#8217;s age with precision. However, we believe that considering a wider range of evidence will enable more informed and robust decisions. I can assure the House that regulations under Clause 56 will not be made to introduce an automatic assumption of adulthood until the science is sufficiently accurate to support such a finding. Moreover, the assumption will only be applied in the circumstances set out in regulations if an individual refuses to undergo scientific age-assessment without good reason.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/27\">It is important to note that negative consequences such as automatic assumptions are applied, with variations, by ECHR signatories, including the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. So it is the UK which is the outlier, as one of very few European countries that does not currently employ scientific methods such as X-rays as part of age assessments.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/28\">The noble Lord, Lord Coaker, and others asked about the detention capacity required to give effect to the Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to deter people from coming to the UK illegally, as they know they will be swiftly returned to their home country if it is safe to do so, or to a safe third country. When the Bill is implemented, this will mean that numbers will start to come down, and that will reduce pressure on accommodation and services in the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/29\">We are absolutely committed to making this legislation work and to find further solutions to scale up our detention capacity, but the first step is this change in the law, which is why we are focused on getting the Bill through the House.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/30\">Various noble Lords challenged the deterrent effect of the Bill. We have always said that there is no one solution to the global migration crisis, and certainly no overnight fix, but doing nothing is not an option. The Bill will remove the incentive to pay criminal gangs and attempt dangerous channel crossings in the hope of settling in the UK. Its provisions are designed to deter such dangerous and illegal activity.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/31\">My noble friend Lord Horam reminded us of the instructive Australian experience of what happens when illegal routes are rendered unviable, and as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, correctly warned, every amendment to soften the Bill will weaken its objectives. My noble friend Lady Lawlor put it well: this Bill is stringent but necessary and proportionate, but it is not the only step we are taking. It comes alongside our partnership with Rwanda, bolstered enforcement action to bear down on the criminal gangs and the co-operation with France, as my noble friend Lord Howard of Lympne rightly pointed out.<\/p><p pid=\"a1920.0\/32\">This Government will always act in the interests of the law-abiding majority. That means securing our borders, delivering a fair and effective immigration and asylum system, and stopping the boats. Enough is enough. The British people want this problem dealt with. The Bill will enable us to do exactly that, and I commend it to the House and invite noble Lords to reject the amendment standing in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Paddick.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1864.0\/1\">My Lords, these are unprecedented times. Last year, we had more than 40,000 illegal immigrants arriving in small boats. This year, the numbers will undoubtedly be greater. We cannot stand by and do nothing. It is not fair on those who seek to come here lawfully; it is not fair on the local authorities which have to accommodate people  who have no homes to which to go. If we do not adopt some form of firm deterrence, the numbers will magnify. Those coming pay money to smugglers which is then recycled in organised crime. That chain has to be broken.<\/p><p pid=\"a1864.0\/2\">We all have sympathy for the circumstances which many leave, but that does not justify jumping the queue or pushing this country beyond its practical limits, especially when, in many cases, they come from safe countries. We owe duties of care to those who come here lawfully and to our own citizens.<\/p><p pid=\"a1864.0\/3\">First, I suggest that the Government accelerate forcefully the rate at which they process asylum claims. The rate at which it is done is lamentable and painfully slow. That is a practical step which has nothing to do with the Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"a1864.0\/4\">The Government are none the less right to act. Let me address just a few of the concerns raised. First, there is the question of treaty obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. I refer, of course, to Rule 39 interim orders. It cannot be that the Strasbourg court should grant an interim order of indefinite duration without hearing from the British Government either first or at least soon after as to why such an order is inappropriate. That is contrary to how we do things in our jurisdiction under common law, contrary to our traditions and contrary to fairness. An affected party should be heard either before an order is made or, in a case of urgency, at least as soon as practicable thereafter, and that is a lamentable gap. Importantly, following on from that, the Bill does not oblige the Minister to ignore the interim order, but it will give him or her the option. Nor, as we have heard from my noble friend Lord Wolfson of Tredegar, will that make the Minister in breach of international law. Fortunately, we have also heard that the Government are engaged in constructive dialogue with the Strasbourg court on reforms to the process, so I hope this will be resolved, but we should not be afraid of that provision in the Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"a1864.0\/5\">Next, I turn to modern slavery. I ask the Government to look again at the amendment advanced in another place by the right honourable Members for Maidenhead and for Chingford and Woodford Green. In particular, those who are already here must not be trapped in true slavery; they must not be trapped underground and abused by criminals and others.<\/p><p pid=\"a1864.0\/6\">Lastly, I address safe and legal routes. Global safe and legal routes are available for people from any country, and some 50,000 people have come here via those safe routes since 2015. Country-specific safe and legal routes&#8212;the schemes for Afghanistan, Ukraine, Hong Kong and Syria&#8212;have together provided for some 430,000 people in the same period. The Government must work to expand that network. Only when numbers moderate, however&#8212;and I am talking here of the asylum seekers whom the Bill addresses&#8212;can we treat new arrivals with the welcome which we would wish. We just have too many to cope with.<\/p><p pid=\"a1864.0\/7\">To conclude, the Bill addresses complex and difficult problems. This House must not run away from working to solve them, and I am afraid that too many speeches I have heard today point to the difficulties which we face and some of the legal problems which the Bill raises but do not provide constructive solutions. This Bill is the way forward, but no doubt it can be improved.  While we examine it carefully, we must not wreck it. The problems are too great and too important to be left untouched. We cannot go on as we are; this Bill must go forward.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1805.0\/1\">My Lords, few situations are so bad that they cannot get worse, and certainly the current world migration crisis will inevitably get worse. Whether the UNHCR figure for those currently needing resettlement is 100 million or just tens of millions, future floods, fires, famines and human conflicts will inevitably drive it up. Obviously, it is insoluble by any single country, so&#8212;and this is the easy point to make&#8212;there must be international agreement as to what share of the burden we must all take. Of course, we must make the effort, but let us not pretend that it will succeed. It will not.<\/p><p pid=\"a1805.0\/2\">Each country, like the UK, must find its own solution, including sensibly&#8212;surely few would dispute&#8212;deciding on a cap for admissions and the best way for administering it. Plainly, this is by arranging safe and legal routes for the number decided on and, as under the several schemes currently operating&#8212;Ukraine, Hong Kong, Syria, Afghanistan, family members and so forth, some  directly involving the UNHCR, others not&#8212;giving proper consideration in advance of arrival to who should come.<\/p><p pid=\"a1805.0\/3\">Now that we have absorbed so many Ukrainians and Hong Kongers, surely the time is ripe for a wider new scheme, ideally in co-operation with the UNHCR, to admit more. Indeed, this now seems essential. Unless a generous, fresh resettlement scheme is decided on, there is little hope of persuading people to sign up to these obviously severe measures. Happily, most of this country is still hugely sympathetic to refugees.<\/p><p pid=\"a1805.0\/4\">How infinitely preferable would this be to the present chaotic situation of having to process those arriving after perilous boat and lorry crossings? As to these, one is entitled to ask: why should they steal a march and gain an advantage over those we will have agreed to take under the capped schemes? Surely it cannot be suggested that we should reduce the number we agree to take lawfully under these schemes to accommodate those coming by boat. Although I do not accept that those arriving from a safe third country, such as France or Belgium, are on that ground alone disqualified from refugee status&#8212;indeed, having myself in decades past judicially decided the contrary&#8212;there is no reason to ignore the fact that their lives were not in immediate danger when they took to the boats. They had the money to pay the smugglers and, in a number of cases, had already been refused asylum in France or plainly had no legitimate claim to asylum, as with most of the Albanians.<\/p><p pid=\"a1805.0\/5\">At the core of this Bill, therefore, necessarily lie the twin aims of introducing and enforcing a cap for the numbers we take in future and deterring all others from arriving illegally by ensuring that, with only the narrowest exceptions, they gain absolutely nothing from doing so. The need and basic justification for that is all that I have time for. Plainly, the Bill raises many different and difficult questions&#8212;on children, accompanied and unaccompanied; about whether, where and for how long to detain those coming illegally; about Rwanda; about modern slavery; about Article 39 interim orders; about the existing backlog, et cetera&#8212;but there is no time to discuss those today. No doubt the Bill can be improved in various ways, but we must recognise that almost every amendment we make to soften it can tend only to weaken its essential objectives: stopping the boats and&#8212;the real desire of many, sometimes perhaps masked by an avowed concern about deaths in the channel&#8212;limiting the overall numbers admitted.<\/p><p pid=\"a1805.0\/6\">We really must now harden our hearts and give the Government the opportunity by this Bill finally to confront this most intractable of problems. I hope not to lose too many of my friends by saying so.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1781.2\/1\">My Lords, the British people are generous and welcoming to those in need fleeing persecution, war and humanitarian crisis abroad. They also know that uncontrolled illegal migration makes us less safe, is unfair on taxpayers, puts lives into the hands of people smugglers and is unfair on would-be immigrants who play by the rules.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/2\">More than 45,000 people came here by small boat last year. The overwhelming majority of arrivals were adult males under the age of 40. These journeys are extremely dangerous; people have lost their lives attempting to cross one of the world&#8217;s busiest shipping lanes in flimsy boats. These journeys are also unnecessary. Those making the crossings are coming from safe countries, such as France, where they could have claimed asylum.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/3\">Our broken asylum system is costing the country some &#163;3 billion a year, and taxpayers are now spending more than &#163;6 million a day on hotels alone. We cannot continue, year on year, with this relentless rise in the number of illegal arrivals adding unacceptable pressures not just on our capacity to house new arrivals but on our ability to provide health, educational, children&#8217;s and welfare services.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/4\">My right honourable friend the Prime Minister is right: we have to stop the boats. I welcome the fact that this objective is shared across the political spectrum. The issue before your Lordships&#8217; House today is how best to achieve this shared objective.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/5\">There is no one single solution. We need to address this complex issue across a broad front, and the Bill needs to be seen in its wider context. The Government have already delivered: the largest-ever small boats deal with France; a new agreement with Albania; a new, unified small boats operational command; tougher immigration enforcement; new, more robust measures for identifying potential victims of modern slavery; and a plan to clear the legacy initial decision asylum backlog by the end of the year and move migrants out of expensive hotels.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/6\">But we also need new legislation to make it unambiguously clear that if you enter the UK illegally, you will not be allowed to stay here. Instead, you will be liable to be detained and will be swiftly returned, either back to your home country or to a safe third country. It is only by removing the incentive to come to the United Kingdom that we will stop people taking  these dangerous journeys and deter the people smugglers from profiting off people&#8217;s suffering. This is what the Bill seeks to deliver.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/7\">Crucially, the Bill places a legal duty on the Home Secretary to make arrangements for the removal of illegal entrants who meet the four conditions set out in Clause 2. This is critical to the operation of the scheme. It will send a clear message about Parliament&#8217;s intent in enacting this legislation. Save in the very limited circumstances provided for in the Bill, it will be crystal clear to illegal migrants, the courts and the British people that the Home Secretary is legally bound to remove all those who meet the conditions set out in Clause 2 as soon as it is reasonably practical to do so.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/8\">As I have indicated, the exceptions to this duty will be limited and, in most cases, only temporary. In particular, we recognise the sensitivities in relation to unaccompanied children. That is why the Bill provides that the duty to make arrangements for removal does not apply until they reach adulthood, which in some 70% of cases is within two years of their arrival. Reflecting our current policy, the Bill confers a discretionary power to remove unaccompanied children in limited circumstances. The Bill now expressly sets out those limited circumstances in which the power to remove unaccompanied children may be exercised; that is, for the purpose of reuniting a child with a parent, where the child is to be returned to a safe country of origin or where the child has made no protection claim.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/9\">The Bill also suspends the duty to make arrangements for removal, again on a temporary basis, in the case of those persons who make a factual suspensive claim or a serious harm suspensive claim. It is vital to the effective operation of the scheme provided for in the Bill that we address head-on the cycle of repeated and late legal challenges by those seeking to frustrate the Home Secretary&#8217;s existing removal powers. The suspensive claims provided for in the Bill will be the only claims that will be heard in country and will therefore be the only route by which someone can challenge removal. Legal challenges by way of judicial review are, of course, still available, but they will not suspend removal, and Clause 4 makes this clear. These claims can continue remotely. It follows from this that the courts are not able to grant any form of interim relief that would have the effect of holding up removal pending consideration of the substantive judicial review. Clause 52 now makes this clear in the Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/10\">As I have indicated, the Bill itself makes provision for two kinds of suspensive claims that provide sufficient legal remedies to those seeking to challenge their removal. Where a person seeks to challenge their removal on the basis that the Home Secretary has made a mistake of fact in deciding that they met the removal conditions, they can lodge a factual suspensive claim. Where such a claim is successful, the duty to make arrangements for removal would no longer apply, although the claimant may be subject to enforcement action under existing law if they have no legal basis to remain in the United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/11\">The second type of suspensive claim is a serious harm suspensive claim. Under the provisions of the Bill, a person who has made a protection or rights-based claim in respect of their home country will not be returned to that country unless it is one of the safe  countries listed in new Section 80AA of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and only if there are no exceptional circumstances militating against their return. But such a person can and will be removed to a safe third country.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/12\">Serious harm suspensive claims recognise that, exceptionally, there may be a well-founded reason why a person cannot be removed to the third country specified in the removal notice. Such a claim must be based on the fact that the person would face a real, imminent and foreseeable risk of serious and irreversible harm if they were removed. This is purposefully a high bar that reflects the terms on which the European Court of Human Rights may decide to indicate interim measures under rule 39 of its rules of court. Where a serious harm suspensive claim is upheld, it would be open to the Home Secretary to remove the person to another country or to revisit their removal to the original third country following a change of circumstances&#8212;for example, should the medical condition that previously prevented removal subsequently improve.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/13\">I have already alluded to the fact that the test for serious harm suspensive claims reflects the approach taken by the Strasbourg court when deciding the grant of interim measures. I have also explained the provisions in the Bill placing limitations on the grant of interim remedies by our domestic courts. In this context, it is entirely right that we address the impact of any interim measures indicated by the Strasbourg court.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/14\">Clause 53 of the Bill provides a discretion for a Minister of the Crown to suspend the duty to remove a person where an interim measure has been indicated. That discretion must be exercised personally by a Minister. This means that the Minister may suspend removal in response to a rule 39 interim measure but is not required to as a matter of UK law. The clause provides a broad discretion for the Minister to have regard to any factors when considering whether to disapply the duty and provides a non-exhaustive list of considerations that the Minister may have regard to when considering the exercise of that discretion. As my right honourable friend the Immigration Minister indicated in the House of Commons, this Government take our international treaty obligations incredibly seriously, and I can assure noble Lords that this discretion would be exercised judiciously and on the basis of the facts of an individual case.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/15\">The Bill provides for bespoke powers of detention for the purpose of the scheme. It is vital that we have the power to detain to establish whether a person falls within the scheme, and pending their removal, if the Bill is to be effective both as a deterrent and as a means of ensuring that the Home Secretary can comply with the duty on her to make arrangements for removal. That said, I again acknowledge the particular vulnerability of unaccompanied children. That is why the Government have brought forward amendments to provide that unaccompanied children may be detained only in circumstances prescribed in regulations. In addition, in line with the commitment given by the Immigration Minister, later in the Bill&#8217;s passage through this House we will set out the new timescale under which children may be detained for the purposes of removal without judicial oversight.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/16\">It is a central tenet of the Bill that a person who satisfies the conditions in Clause 2 will not have their asylum, human rights or modern slavery claims considered in the United Kingdom. It is a sad but incontrovertible fact that our modern slavery protections are susceptible to abuse by illegal migrants seeking to frustrate their removal from the United Kingdom. Whereas in 2019 just 6% of people arriving in the UK on a small boat and detained for return involved a modern slavery referral, the figure in 2021 was 73%.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/17\">The Bill therefore applies the public order disqualification, as provided for in the Council of Europe convention against trafficking, to those who meet the conditions in Clause 2. This means that they will not benefit from the protections otherwise afforded to potential victims of modern slavery. The Bill provides for an exception where a person&#8217;s presence in the UK is necessary for the purposes of their co-operation with a law enforcement agency in the investigation of an offence linked to their exploitation.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/18\">We recognise that the application of the public order disqualification to this cohort is a significant step and justified only during such time as the exceptional circumstances relating to the illegal entry into the UK, including arising from the channel crossings in small boats, continue to apply. For this reason, the modern slavery provisions are subject to a sunsetting clause such that, unless renewed by affirmative regulations agreed by both Houses, they will cease to apply after two years.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/19\">As I have set out, the whole point of the Bill is deterrence. As well as being clear that illegal entry into the UK may simply result in your detention and swift removal, the Bill underlines that you will have no ability to build a life in the UK. Save in very limited circumstances, Clauses 29 to 36 provide that a person will have no right to secure settlement, acquire British citizenship or, once removed, lawfully re-enter the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/20\">Finally, I return to the theme I began with. Ours is a welcoming, compassionate and generous nation. We have offered our homes and communities to nearly half a million people seeking protection since 2015. We have safe and legal routes available to people from any country in the world, such as the refugee family reunion scheme and the UK resettlement scheme, as well as in recent years country-specific routes for people from Syria, Hong Kong, Afghanistan and Ukraine. We stand ready to do more. But our ability to do more must be directly linked to our capacity to house and support new arrivals.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/21\">We recognise the calls for early progress on this front, so within three months of Royal Assent we will begin the consultation with local authorities and communities themselves to understand their capacity to accommodate and support persons to be admitted to the UK each year through safe and legal routes. Within six months of Royal Assent we will set out, in a report to be laid before Parliament, the existing and proposed additional safe and legal routes. We will seek to open the proposed new routes as soon as practicable and, in any event, by the end of 2024.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/22\">We simply cannot continue with a situation whereby, year on year, tens of thousands of people make the dangerous, illegal and unnecessary journey across the channel in circumvention of our immigration controls.  Illegal migration is not fair and not right. It is not fair on the British communities whose public services and housing are under pressure. It is not fair on those who work hard and obey the law to come to the UK through established routes. It is also not fair on the people travelling in the small boats themselves, who are placed in peril at the hands of people smugglers.<\/p><p pid=\"a1781.2\/23\">We must stop the boats. The Bill, in conjunction with the other steps the Government are taking, is a necessary, urgent and indeed compassionate response to the daily challenge posed to the integrity of our immigration system. We must act now and, on that basis, I beg to move.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c126.1\/1\">We on the Labour Benches are in no doubt about the importance of the Bill. Transnational repression and interference from hostile state actors and their proxies are testing the UK&#8217;s defences as never before. As the global landscape continues to change at a staggering pace, interference from countries that do not share our values is nothing new. However, the breadth and enduring nature of the threats we are now facing is a contemporary challenge, combined with the technology and methods used by those seeking to undermine us, which are new and enhanced.<\/p><p pid=\"c126.1\/2\">Today is World Press Freedom Day, giving us a chance to recommit ourselves to defending press freedom, but also to acknowledge that many of the threats to which our security services and counter-terrorism police are responding here in the UK relate to the protection of journalists, from the&#8212;thankfully disrupted&#8212;assassination and kidnap plots against UK residents who are perceived as enemies of Iran owing to their coverage of the protests and the regime&#8217;s brutal crackdown, to the unacceptable harassment reported by Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC and her colleagues acting on behalf of the British national Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy newspaper owner currently detained in Hong Kong. We must challenge that overseas and refuse to tolerate it here.<\/p><p pid=\"c126.1\/3\">We have always understood that we need the new provisions in the Bill, but the Minister will understand where I am coming from when I say that this has been far from a shining example of best practice in passing legislation. The churn in the Government since the Bill was tabled in May last year, coupled with the late and lengthy additions to it, has meant that scrutiny has been truncated on occasion, but it is all the more crucial as a result. It is unusual for a Bill to come back from the other place with&#8212;if I am not mistaken&#8212;no fewer than 117 Government amendments, but that is why I, like the Minister, am particularly grateful to our colleagues at the other end of the building, where operational expertise in particular has had a positive impact in shaping and sharpening these measures to ensure that they deliver the protections we need and the safeguards we can all trust.<\/p><p pid=\"c126.1\/4\">Let me begin by discussing the Government amendments, secured in the House of Lords, that amend the foreign influence registration scheme, which is a case in point. It constitutes a comprehensive section of the Bill, but provisions on it were not tabled until the final stages of the Bill Committee in the House of Commons. It was a recommendation in the Intelligence and Security Committee&#8217;s Russia report, and it is something that we have consistently supported in principle. As the Minister knows, however, it will require a degree of fine tuning to get the balance right. We are broadly supportive of the plethora of Government amendments, given that scrutiny in the House of Lords has brought about some of that fine tuning. We look forward to further guidance on this, and will work with the Government to ensure that we capture what we need to capture without impeding genuine activity and interactions that are benign to national security.<\/p><p pid=\"c126.1\/5\">I welcome the fact that the Government have listened to journalists&#8217; concerns by clarifying the scope of offences in part 1, and the fact that part 1 will be subject to oversight as a consequence of Lords amendments 33 and 34, which was an ongoing ask from the Labour party throughout the Bill&#8217;s passage in the House of Commons.<\/p><p pid=\"c126.1\/6\">As the Minister knows, we also had serious concerns about the Bill&#8217;s changes to the Serious Crime Act 2015, outlining our reasons in detail at this Dispatch Box and in Committee and voting to remove that clause on Report having been unable to shift the Government&#8217;s position. I am therefore pleased that Lords amendment 26 means that clause 28 has been significantly reshaped with, I understand, some assistance from the Intelligence and Security Committee. We pleaded with the Government to engage in that dialogue, and I thank all those, in this place and outside, who helped to bring clause 28 to a much better place. However, I understand the points raised by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Alistair Carmichael\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10785\">the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)<\/phrase> in his amendments. I therefore invite the Minister to put on record once more the Government&#8217;s commitment to the Fulford principles, and to stress that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c126.1\/7\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;The UK Government does not participate in, solicit, encourage or condone unlawful killing, the use of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment...or extraordinary rendition. In no circumstance will UK personnel ever take action amounting to torture, unlawful killing, extraordinary rendition, or CIDT.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c126.1\/8\">Lords amendment 122, tabled by Lord Coaker, will introduce a duty to update the Intelligence and Security Committee&#8217;s memorandum of understanding to reflect the provisions in the Bill. This follows a recommendation made by the ISC in its 2021-22 annual report. As noted in the report, during the passage of what became the Justice and Security Act 2013, the then Security Minister told Parliament that it was<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c126.1\/9\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;the intention of the Government that the ISC should have oversight of substantively all of central Government&#8217;s intelligence and security activities to be realised now and in the future.&#8221;&#8211;&#8211;[Official Report, Justice and Security Public Bill Committee, <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">31 March 2013<\/phrase>; c. 98.]<\/p><p pid=\"c126.1\/10\">Ten years on, intelligence and security activities have continued to fall under the remit of different policy Departments, yet those Departments have not been added to the ISC&#8217;s memorandum of understanding. I think it fair to say that as a result, the ISC is not functioning as originally intended. Indeed, one of the  starkest revelations from the report is that although, in the 20 years following the ISC&#8217;s establishment in 1994, the ISC met the Prime Minister annually to discuss its work, the ISC has not been able to secure a meeting with a Prime Minister since December 2014. There have been five Prime Ministers in the intervening time.<\/p>",

China is not the only authoritarian state which attempts to catch up with and influence its nationals here. We all recall the occasion when a member of the royal family of one of the Gulf states was taken off the streets in Cambridge and taken back to the Gulf states. Can the Minister assure us that other states and their behaviour in Britain&#8212;including some with whom we are relatively closely allied, such as the Gulf states&#8212;are also in scope and that the Government are concerned about that?<\/p><p pid=\"a777.1\/2\">Secondly, universities have a particularly sensitive role here&#8212;I speak as a former academic. Last year, one vice-chancellor told me that his biggest single problem in maintaining free speech in his university was keeping the peace between his Hong Kong students and his Chinese mainland students. I put that down as a marker for further discussion. The Defending Democracy Taskforce was mentioned several times in discussion in the other place yesterday. I tried to find out exactly what it is covering, how far it is intended to have some cross-party representation and what its plans are. It is very difficult to find out whether it really exists, how often it meets, what it is doing and what its strategy is. At a later stage, could the Minister&#8217;s department communicate to some of us what the Defending Democracy Taskforce&#8217;s intentions are?<\/p>",

Where Chinese nationals are students at universities, they should be free from harassment and intimidation&#8212;the same applies, of course, to other groups of people, Jewish students being another obvious example.

            "body": "<p pid=\"c180.2\/1\">I rise to speak to the topic at hand, but I want to begin by thanking the Minister for the way in which she has tackled this Committee sitting and her familiarisation with the points made on Second Reading.<\/p><p pid=\"c180.2\/2\">I am on the record as having concerns about not just the implementation but the purpose of all this. No one would disagree that multinational companies need to pay their fair share of tax, but I question the way we are going about achieving that. I put it on the record that I was semi-humoured by the comments of the Opposition spokesperson just now. Even when the Labour party is taking a break from its efforts to heap extra burdens on businesses, which is obviously what it stands for, it is raising concerns about implementation timetables.<\/p><p pid=\"c180.2\/3\">Labour has missed the opportunity to speak up for British businesses, so it falls to those on the Conservative side of the House to do that. We believe in competition, business growth and business investment. My right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Vicky Ford\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25614\">the Member for Chelmsford (Vicky Ford)<\/phrase> is not in her place right now, but sectors such as insurance employ my constituents, probably the constituents of <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"James Murray\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25801\">the hon. Member for Ealing North (James Murray)<\/phrase> and hundreds of thousands of constituents up and down the country. Those are the types of jobs we should try to safeguard in the United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"c180.2\/4\">The hon. Gentleman was partisan, so I will make a point now as well: the response of the Labour party is always to build up even more red tape, regulations and reporting. I think we all know how we adopt regulations in this country. My own personal view, which I attested to on Second Reading, is that I would like to have a delay to implementation until we see a critical mass of other countries, including very significant competitors, moving some way towards implementing the tax, as has been said by colleagues this afternoon.<\/p><p pid=\"c180.2\/5\">As my hon. Friend the Minister already knows from interventions today and from Second Reading, I feel that this new tax risks placing significant compliance costs on British businesses, which are already paying well above the minimum 15% tax rate. We must recognise that there are current pressures and that these inevitable costs will be fed on to consumers. I have touched on the insurance sector, but at the end of the day it is consumers who will end up picking up the costs through higher premiums and other impacts on them. On top of consumer prices, which bear the brunt of that and are also inflationary, there is no way, given the delays that we are seeing elsewhere, that implementing this tax will not have an impact on our competitiveness. By pressing ahead, we risk capital flight and jeopardising future investment income.<\/p><p pid=\"c180.2\/6\">I have a range of questions to put the Minister shortly. I understand the reassurances that she has shared with the House today about other jurisdictions, but we have to be honest with people and say that we are not seeing a mass move towards co-ordinated implementation. That is not happening. We understand that that is down to electoral cycles and all sorts of pressures within other jurisdictions, and I also acknowledge that she pointed to Germany, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands as having published draft legislation. However, only three EU member states are reaching the stage that we were at last July, and that does not mean they are meeting the parallel process on the timetable for implementation. She also pointed to Japan and Canada; Japan is interesting, because its legislation delays implementation until several months after the UK&#8217;s, while Canada is yet to pass its legislation for a whole range of reasons.<\/p><p pid=\"c180.2\/7\">We should level with everyone, particularly because we as Conservatives believe in British businesses and the risks they take and know that they look to the Government of the day to give them certainty and support&#8212;I will come on to the support side in a moment. We must be clear with businesses about the environment in which we will be bringing in this measure, what it will be like and what it will mean for them. That is even before we come to the problem of the United States, which, as my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Richard Fuller\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24787\">the Member for North East Bedfordshire (Richard Fuller)<\/phrase> touched on, is not implementing pillar two at all, and Singapore and Hong Kong, which are also important jurisdictions for financial institutions and which will be delaying implementation until 2025.<\/p><p pid=\"c180.2\/8\">I entirely understand the Minister&#8217;s point about the revenue-raising nature of this measure, but, given the delays in key and significant jurisdictions, those revenue  projections are fluid&#8212;and I am being polite in using the word &#8220;fluid&#8221;; we could say they are uncertain, as they already were, but I think we could even go further and say they are probably in jeopardy. We need greater scrutiny of some of the revenue figures.<\/p><p pid=\"c180.2\/9\">The Minister has seen the research by the Chartered Institute of Taxation, which has already said it is in doubt whether pillar two will raise the &#163;2 billion annually that the Government are predicting. Perhaps it would be useful for the Committee to get a greater understanding of the projections, the calculations and the insights used in considering this matter, because that institute and others have raised concerns around the figures.<\/p><p pid=\"c180.2\/10\">Those institutions also raise concerns about the implementation timelines, which have been the subject of discussion. I would rather see no implementation or see implementation delayed until others look at it. However, since we are using the tool of primary legislation to bring this measure forward, at a time when the matter is still under live international discussion, which could change in months&#8212;that is the nature of the world and the markets&#8212;we need to understand what it means for British businesses and the complexities that it will bring to them.<\/p><p pid=\"c180.2\/11\">On the point of complexity, the Institute for Fiscal Studies recently released its own report expressing significant concerns about that, and many of us made the point on Second Reading about what that means for businesses. No doubt they have an army of tax lawyers, but will this be a perverse incentive? Will it have unintended consequences?<\/p><p pid=\"c180.2\/12\">On Second Reading I also touched on significant questions about international dispute resolution, which have still not been answered and which raise considerable concerns. We still have wider concerns about implementation, other jurisdictions, the ways of working and how we will resolve some of those unanswered questions. I urge Ministers to come back on Report with solutions to the points that I have made and others will no doubt make. We really do need to see what this means not just for businesses but for the whole principle of accountability, fairness and transparency internationally.<\/p><p pid=\"c180.2\/13\">We have spoken about the European Union and the United States, but the impact on British jobs and businesses is our predominant concern. I raised the whole issue of tax sovereignty. The wider implications of the policy measure for our tax sovereignty have not been unpacked. I have previously touched on the threats to competitiveness, but I genuinely feel right now that, for a country and a Government who believe in free market fundamentals, in having a dynamic economy that embraces free enterprise, and in low and simple taxation, these measures could be regressive&#8212;we could actually be going backwards. My right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Kit Malthouse\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25346\">the Member for North West Hampshire (Kit Malthouse)<\/phrase> mentioned the infamous tax guide for accountants. When accountants have to follow tomes of guidance, that goes against the grain of tax simplification. I am concerned that part of the Bill really fails to address those issues.<\/p><p pid=\"c180.2\/14\">I have one plea for the Minister. She understands that this Finance Bill has such a significant section dedicated to international taxation&#8212;the OECD rate of taxation&#8212;so I urge her to reflect on the comments that I and many others have made, which very much come from industry. I and many colleagues wrote to the Chancellor before the Budget back in March with a range of concerns. We  have not yet even had a response to that letter. I think it is important that we see proper, considered responses to all the concerns that we have raised&#8212;that is absolutely appropriate. Before jumping headlong into implementation without proper timescales, without thinking through the consequences of what the provisions mean and with other jurisdictions acting independently and changing their own legislative parameters, will the Minister come back to this House with significant answers to my questions?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a375.1\/1\">I thank the hon. Member for that intervention. It is always important to note where we share values&#8212;and that always plays to our strengths.<\/p><p pid=\"a375.1\/2\">My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Matt Rodda\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25691\">the Member for Reading East (Matt Rodda)<\/phrase> made a powerful point about the vital support that churches and charities provide on a non-judgmental basis not just to Christians, but to their wider communities and everybody who needs support. Churches and Christian organisations have been stepping forward where the state has largely stepped back for over a decade, and I see examples of that in my constituency. When we had fires in tower blocks, St Luke&#8217;s in Leagrave provided warm banks, despite the fact that its bills are going through the roof. Christchurch Bushmead, which is at the centre of our community, has provided support for those in need. We all know about the food banks in our constituencies that are run from churches by Christian charities. As food prices climb, energy costs soar and wages fall, we cannot expect the need for food banks to diminish any time soon.<\/p><p pid=\"a375.1\/3\">There are also the night shelters. They are less typical at this time of year, but every winter Christian organisations go above and beyond to provide warmth and shelter for homeless people. They do so not because they have an abundance of money, space or resources, but because their faith compels them to do and give what they can. I note that hon. Members have mentioned and recommended books throughout the debate, and I would love to take the opportunity to recommend a book co-written by my dear friend and the chief executive of the Christian charity Jubilee+, Natalie Williams, entitled &#8220;The Myth of the Undeserving Poor&#8221;. We can add that to our reading list for the Easter recess.<\/p><p pid=\"a375.1\/4\">Vital support, including the debt services provided by organisations such as Christians Against Poverty, is long standing but has never been so needed as it is now. CAP partners with churches of all denominations around the UK to offer personal budgeting courses and employment support, helping people to break free from the paralysing chains of debt. I will never forget the personal testimony that I heard from CAP when it came to Parliament to speak to parliamentarians about the vital work it does.<\/p><p pid=\"a375.1\/5\">That is just a brief selection of Christian charities working domestically. Globally, there are organisations fighting bravely for religious freedoms and human rights, and tackling poverty and famine. Colleagues will be aware of the fearless work of Open Doors, which works in some of the most dangerous regions of the world to serve persecuted Christians. Over Easter, we must keep in mind worshippers and believers in places such as North Korea, Nigeria, China, Hong Kong, Afghanistan and many more, who will risk their lives to worship God at this time.<\/p><p pid=\"a375.1\/6\">I pay tribute to International Justice Mission, which works internationally to end modern slavery; Tearfund, which has been providing disaster relief for over 50 years; and Christian Aid, which continues to lead progressive and powerful campaigns on the climate emergency. Despite how needed and important their campaigns are, such organisations are struggling. The cost of living crisis has meant that, while demand is higher than ever for food, shelter and financial support, the public&#8217;s capacity to donate has declined. The fact that wages are falling far beneath inflation is forcing ordinary working people to cut back where they can. For many, that means reducing or ending charitable giving. This is where we need Government action.<\/p><p pid=\"a375.1\/7\">I ask the Minister to go back to her team and other Government Departments, and look at what more can be done to protect our churches and charities from further financial struggle. Stronger interventions on energy costs and business rates would be a very good place to start. After 13 years of Conservative Government, where does the Minister think our country would be without the safety net provided by Christians and other faith groups? If families, children, and those out of work or struggling with addiction had only the Government to rely on, what state would our economic and social health be in? She should ask herself, honestly, whether the Government have allowed themselves to become complacent in presuming that faith groups will always be able to step forward and make up for state neglect and failure. On the contributions of Christians to fighting global issues of injustice, will the Minister update us on efforts to return the level of overseas aid to 0.7%?<\/p><p pid=\"a375.1\/8\">This Easter, I will be celebrating the inspiring Christians around me in Luton North; the church leaders, their congregations and communities across the UK; and the charities working here and abroad to serve humanity. We can all be inspired and grateful for the hugely powerful impact that Christians have in our society, but we must never be ignorant of what they need from Government or overconfident that they will always be able to clean up our mistakes.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c1078.2\/1\">Every time my late father&#8212;bless him&#8212;heard me speak, all he said was, &#8220;Too long, Richard,&#8221; so on that basis I shall be brief. It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Stephen Timms\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10596\">the right hon. Member for East Ham (Sir Stephen Timms)<\/phrase>. I refer to my entry in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests. I will speak, probably for no more than five minutes, about the corporation tax rise and the international minimum level of 15%.<\/p><p pid=\"c1078.2\/2\">I turn first to the corporation tax rise. I have huge respect for the Chancellor, as I do for the Ministers on the Front Bench, so I do not want this point to be taken incorrectly, but during his 2019 leadership campaign, he proposed reducing corporation tax to 12.5%&#8212;the rate that, I believe, the Republic of Ireland has now. Corporation tax in the UK will now rise from 19% to 25%, which may look like a 6% rise, but is actually a 31% rise. I totally accept that smaller companies will not be affected, and I accept that there are various capital allowances that larger companies can go for, but as many colleagues have said, why complicate an already complicated tax system? Why not just keep it simple? As a former soldier, I remember the acronym KISS: keep it simple, stupid. I wish sometimes that politicians would do that.<\/p><p pid=\"c1078.2\/3\">I am very surprised that the international agreement on the minimum level of tax&#8212;the OECD scheme&#8212;is being pushed through in the Bill. I find that quite extraordinary, because the two do not sit comfortably together. Many Conservative Members and some Opposition Members fought very hard to get control of our country back by leaving the EU, so that we could have our own laws, our own taxes, our own money and so on. I am therefore completely bamboozled by this, and have yet to hear a very good reason why we are signing up to the very thing we were trying to escape: something that enables an unelected multinational organisation to affect how we set our own taxes. As my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Nigel Mills\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24965\">the Member for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills)<\/phrase> said so well, why can we not set and control our taxes? Surely we could have dealt with this on our own.<\/p><p pid=\"c1078.2\/4\">I find this move, which will subject us to a tax rate set outside our country, to be really extraordinary, and I will have great difficulty in supporting the measure on Third Reading. The Government have said that the effectiveness of the policy<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1078.2\/5\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;depends on a high degree of consistency in the implementation in different jurisdictions&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"c1078.2\/6\">The Financial Secretary listed a whole mass of countries in answer to a question I asked earlier, but as I understand it, countries including Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand have announced that they will be delaying implementation until 2025. I also understand&#8212;I hope I am correct&#8212;that the EU has broken a commitment that was agreed internationally by giving smaller member states a six-year delay before they, too, will have to implement the measure. That will disadvantage the competitiveness of UK-based multinationals against their EU rivals.<\/p><p pid=\"c1078.2\/7\">I remember campaigning for Brexit: it was a great thing. We were going to become an offshore, Singapore, low-tax, let&#8217;s go, gung-ho place, and create business, create jobs and create wealth. That is what the Conservative policy is, so what on earth are we doing? We are signing ourselves up to a package that could once again see British courts overruled by foreign ones. The industry&#8212;I have read much about it in the press&#8212;has also called for the policy to be delayed, because UK growth will be stunted by unnecessarily burdensome administrative costs for business.<\/p><p pid=\"c1078.2\/8\">All this is being put forward in a rush. There was no mention of these plans either in the Chancellor&#8217;s Budget statement, unless I missed something, or in the accompanying Red Book and costings document. HM Treasury documents confirm that the Government still intend to implement pillar two this year. Why are we having such minimal scrutiny of something with so huge a potential effect on the ability to attract business to this country? I thought that that was exactly what we wanted to do.<\/p><p pid=\"c1078.2\/9\">The role of a Government, particularly a Conservative one, is to create an infrastructure in which business can thrive. One of the key levers for that is low taxes&#8212;the lower, the better. On the whole, as the Exchequer Secretary well knows, the lower the taxes, the more money comes rolling into the Treasury.<\/p><p pid=\"c1078.2\/10\">The size of all this has already been mentioned. I have in front of me two massive documents. Pillar two takes up 169 pages of the Bill, across 156 clauses and five schedules. The Finance Act 2022 ran to only 222 pages, including schedules, and had 104 sections in total.<\/p><p pid=\"c1078.2\/11\">I really do ask the Government to rethink. I know that Opposition Members have already commented with glee that people like me are leaping up to oppose this measure. Yes, of course we are, because we are Conservatives. I have been here for 13 years; on three or four occasions during that time the whole House has agreed to a proposal, and every single time it has been wrong, so for me that is the clearest guide that something has gone seriously wrong here.<\/p><p pid=\"c1078.2\/12\">Let me say to the Ministers on the Front Bench that it is in the best interests of the United Kingdom to delay implementation of pillar two until 2025, or, even better, to bin it altogether.<\/p>",

The Elections Act did indeed toughen up verification for domestic voters but it made no such arrangement for overseas voters. The local electoral registration officers I have spoken to say they will find verification extremely difficult for people who have not lived here for 20 years or more. Furthermore, the FCDO has said that it will play no role through embassies and consulates in verifying overseas voters&#8217; identities. How can we be sure that those who register, vote and above all give donations from Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore or the British Virgin Islands are who they say they are, that the money comes from them and that they are not acting on behalf of a hostile third party?<\/p>",

There is a danger that those of us who follow the evidence and actually care about what will happen if this dreadful piece of legislation is ever implemented disappear down the rabbit hole of trying to improve, amend and mitigate it. We have all tabled dozens&#8212;hundreds, some of us&#8212;of amendments, but this piece of the Bill has simply to be excised. I will be seeking to divide the House on clause 11 stand apart, because, frankly, there is no mitigation and no polishing of this&#8212;I avoid the vulgarity, but everyone knows what I am talking about. There is no way we can polish and improve on something that is so fundamentally removed from the way we would tolerate our own children being treated.<\/p><p pid=\"d904.3\/2\">Earlier, we were talking about returning people. I was privileged yesterday to meet a group of Hongkongers, who are among that privileged group of people who came here by a safe and legal route. They still have their problems, of course: their journey did not end when they arrived at Heathrow, and they still have to deal with the trauma of leaving friends, family and others behind in circumstances where they would ordinarily have chosen not to do so. However, I heard a quite remarkable story from one person who did not come through the safe and legal route because her arrival predated that visa scheme being opened up. She told me that her twin sister had been here, but had left the  country, and now she was being told that she would need to leave because the Home Office had confused her biometrics with those of her twin sister. That is the sort of ruthless efficiency of which the Home Office is capable. Are we seriously hearing now that we are going to start sending people back to Hong Kong because they happen to have come here before the start of the British national overseas visa scheme?<\/p><p pid=\"d904.3\/3\">Dame Rosie, I feel that I have detained the House for long enough&#8212;that is probably a matter of consensus among Members&#8212;but when it comes to Divisions, we on the Liberal Democrat Benches will do everything that we can to improve the Bill.

            "body": "<p pid=\"c729.3\/1\">I will not give way again, sorry. I have taken loads of interventions and I am testing everyone&#8217;s patience; my speech is now 11 minutes in.<\/p><p pid=\"c729.3\/2\">France could say the same to Italy or Spain, and then Italy or Spain could say, &#8220;Stay in the sea.&#8221; What we are seeing now is an attempt to undermine Britain&#8217;s part in the globe. We were told by some Conservative Members that we were leaving the European Union but not Europe, and that we would now be &#8220;global Britain.&#8221; Ignoring for a moment the moral obligations we have to people seeking sanctuary, let us remember what message it will send to our neighbours, friends and allies around Europe and elsewhere if we unilaterally decide that we are not going to play the game. This undermines our soft power and our sovereignty. This is why we support new clause 3, which deals with setting a target and gives a clear sense of Britain stepping up to the plate and being part of a global operation.<\/p><p pid=\"c729.3\/3\">The Government talk about deterrence, but the Bill fails to understand the horrors that people have been through. People who have left Sudan or Eritrea often go through Libya, and I would ask Conservative Members to spend a moment to research what it is like for a refugee passing from the horn of Africa, for example, through to Libya and then crossing the Mediterranean. What are their experiences? We tell those people that it will be scary and that we are not going to treat them very nicely when they cross the channel, but that is nothing compared with their experience of crossing Libya. I ask Members to inform themselves about that in particular.<\/p><p pid=\"c729.3\/4\">The Bill is clearly not aimed at tackling the criminal gangs. The simple fact is that the criminal gangs&#8217; business model will remain alive and well. Why? Because people will arrive on these shores and then not claim asylum. They will go under the radar, which fuels modern slavery and criminality. More people will be exploited, especially women and girls. There is no question whatsoever that this Bill will do anything to tackle the business model of those gangs&#8212;it is clearly not intended to, which is another outrage. It is indeed a traffickers&#8217; charter. It will therefore lead to more deaths in the channel. It is a recipe for uncontrollable borders, because there will be nobody applying for asylum. They will just slip under the radar. If the Government had done an impact assessment, they would know that. Maybe they did, but they have not shared it with us.<\/p><p pid=\"c729.3\/5\">The simple fact is that we need safe and legal routes. People from Ukraine, Afghanistan, Syria or Hong Kong stand a chance, one way or another, of having a safe route to the United Kingdom. But if you are a young Christian man seeking to avoid being conscripted in Eritrea, a woman seeking sanctuary from Iran or a person from a religious minority in Sudan, you have no chance whatsoever of getting here. That is morally outrageous. We are turning our back on our long-held principles and obligations. That is why new clause 6 is so important and why, with your permission, Dame Eleanor, we will push it to a vote tonight.<\/p><p pid=\"c729.3\/6\">New clause 6 would ringfence asylum seekers from those countries that already have an 80%-plus grant rate&#8212;places such as Sudan, Eritrea and Iran. It proposes a pilot scheme for 12 months&#8212;this is measured, small and not all that ambitious&#8212;just to give the Government an opportunity not to be duplicitous about this and to show that we are at least providing an experimental and evidence-based safe route. I urge the Government to accept the new clause; otherwise, we will seek to divide the House. New clause 4 talks about a humanitarian travel permit, and new clause 7 deals with refugee family reunion.<\/p><p pid=\"c729.3\/7\">If the Government seriously want to make the case that the Bill is going to undermine the business case of the people traffickers, evil as they are, they will fail to do so unless they provide meaningful, tangible, credible safe and legal routes. Those routes do not currently exist, and these new clauses allow the Government the opportunity to create them. If they will not accept them, this will prove that they do not have a plan to stop the boats and that they are just getting into the gutter to grub for votes.<\/p><p pid=\"c729.3\/8\">To be fair, I think the Government have misjudged those who seek sanctuary here. I have met many of them. I have been to Calais and other places, and I have had to interrogate why people would choose to come to the United Kingdom. The hon. Member for Devizes set out many of those reasons, but I have never discovered among those people any who have heard of the national health service or our benefit system. The lie that they are somehow coming over here to sponge off or threaten us is just that: it is simply untrue.<\/p><p pid=\"c729.3\/9\">But those people have heard of something: they have heard of a Britain that is safe, where they can raise their children, where they can be who they are and have whatever faith they may be and whatever political views they may hold&#8212;a place where they can raise and feed their family in safety. I cannot imagine anything making me more proud than that being the reputation of this country. No amount of small-minded attempts to change  the law by this &#8220;here today, gone tomorrow&#8221; Tory Government will dent that reputation. I think the Government have misjudged not only the asylum seekers, but Britain too.<\/p><p pid=\"c729.3\/10\">Let me tell the House a story about my constituency, and then I will shut up. Let us be honest, the Lake District is not the most diverse part of the United Kingdom, yet in August 1945 half the children who survived the death camps, including Auschwitz, came to Windermere to be rehabilitated and to start their lives afresh, because that is who we really are. That is who Britain really is and we should be proud of that. Let us absolutely stop the boats, but let us do so in a way that makes sense and that is neither dozy nor dangerous.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1997.0\/1\">My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lady Jones of Whitchurch for introducing the Bill and Christina Rees MP for bringing it through the other place. I start, as the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, did, by saying how strongly we support the Bill and are pleased to see it in front of us today. As others have done, I pay tribute to the conservation organisations which have been pressing for this, particularly the Shark Trust, which sent a very helpful briefing.<\/p><p pid=\"a1997.0\/2\">As noble Lords have said, the Bill is so important because of the needless cruelty. In fact, I would say that the practice is just disgusting; I cannot believe it actually happens. Again, it is important to see the Bill in front of us today. Assuming that it goes through&#8212;I know it has government support&#8212;it then needs to be very promptly adopted, and it needs to reinforce the UK&#8217;s position as a global leader in shark conservation and sustainable fishing, as other noble Lords have said.<\/p><p pid=\"a1997.0\/3\">We have also heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, and others that the biggest threat to sharks is overfishing driven by demand for many different products, including meat, cartilage and liver oil as well as the fins. Shark finning has of course been banned in many major fishing nations. I remind the noble Lord, Lord Hannan, that it was banned by the EU in 2003, so the EU also has an interest in ending this practice. The other thing we need to think about is that shark-fins are not the only driver of shark fisheries. Banning the trade alone will not curtail the demand for sharks. Having said that, if the Bill is enshrined in law, it will demonstrate the UK&#8217;s commitment to shark conservation and sustainable fishing, and we will then have a platform through which we as a nation can encourage other nations to follow suit and also ban these appalling practices.<\/p><p pid=\"a1997.0\/4\">We have heard that the global trade is significant but that the largest importers are Hong Kong, Malaysia, China and Singapore, which account for 90%. As the noble Lord, Lord Hannan, said, UK imports are historically negligible. However, as my noble friend and others pointed out, it is important that we are able to hold other nations to the high standard that we would expect. By being a global leader on this, we can encourage the nations that are trading in this way to look at doing it in a more sustainable way, as the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Moulsecoomb, said&#8212;like her, I do not quite understand what that means, but it is clearly better than the current practice that is still allowed. She also talked particularly about conservation and marine life, and this is an important step in taking that forward.<\/p><p pid=\"a1997.0\/5\">I think it was all the way back in May 2022 that the Government reiterated that they were committed to banning the import and export of detached shark-fins and shark-fin products, originally through the animals abroad Bill, along with other items that were going to be banned through that Bill. We now have some Private Members&#8217; Bills that will arrive in your Lordships&#8217; House at some point that look at other aspects from that Bill, but unfortunately, some seem to have disappeared in their entirety, including the bans on imports of fur and foie gras. Can the Minister say what has happened to the outstanding parts of the animals abroad Bill that we were all promised would be banned by a Conservative Government?<\/p><p pid=\"a1997.0\/6\">On that note, I will finish by totally supporting the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, about other government promises through the kept animals Bill, which finished Committee in the Commons some time ago now. We are still sitting and waiting for Report on that and to hear what will happen to the pieces of legislation in that which are so important. Are they going to come through piecemeal by PMB? Is that the plan, so that the Government can pick and choose which bits of that Bill they want? If the Government are making all these promises on animal welfare, we need action.<\/p><p pid=\"a1997.0\/7\">I am very pleased that the Bill is in front of us. It has our strong support, and my noble friend Lady Jones of Whitchurch gave an absolutely excellent introduction to it. However, I am concerned about not just this but everything else that was promised as well.<\/p>",

In the face of the current human rights position in Xinjiang and the situation in Hong Kong, however, this should not change any time soon.<\/p><p pid=\"a1663.2\/2\">On these Benches, we are in strong agreement with those who consider that the Government could and should have been a great deal more strategic about relationships with sensitive Chinese suppliers&#8212;whether internet or data based, hardware or software related&#8212;in the run-up to this Statement. This is a one-off Statement about TikTok, a social media company. It would be good to see the assessment and the evidence of potential cybersecurity issues which the Government have not yet&#8212;as far as I know&#8212;produced.<\/p><p pid=\"a1663.2\/3\">However, when it comes to makers of surveillance cameras, as the noble Lord, Lord Collins, said, the Government appear far more reluctant to act. The Surveillance Camera Commissioner, Professor Fraser Sampson, has been very clear in his warnings, in particular about Hikvision and Dahua cameras, which, as far as we know, are used extensively in Xinjiang for surveillance purposes and pose security risks here, even when live facial recognition is not enabled.<\/p><p pid=\"a1663.2\/4\">Just last week, we saw Tesco lead the way in the private sector and order the removal of these cameras from its stores. The Government have simply ceased to install them. Why are they not directing their removal, particularly in police forces? Have they mapped exactly where on the government estate and in other spaces these cameras remain?<\/p><p pid=\"a1663.2\/5\">Regarding TikTok, why act so late when the EU and US, as the noble Lord, Lord Collins, mentioned, acted earlier? Presumably they have the same security information. When did the evidence emerge that has led to this ban? Will the Government publish the review by cybersecurity experts which assesses the risks posed by these third-party apps on government devices?<\/p><p pid=\"a1663.2\/6\">As the noble Lord, Lord Collins, also mentioned, why are private devices used by government Ministers not covered? I note that Oliver Dowden repeated that position last week. After all, we know there has been extensive use of private devices by Ministers, particularly &#8212;dare I say&#8212;among former Health Ministers. What assessment of this aspect has been made? Which government departments and public bodies are actually covered? What is the process for drawing up the promised approved list of apps? What criteria will be used?<\/p><p pid=\"a1663.2\/7\">As many said in the Commons, this looks like whack-a-mole; the Statement is no substitute for a coherent cross-government strategy. Why do the Government not now move, for instance, to include the capture of biometric data in the definition of &#8220;critical national infrastructure&#8221;? Questions have been raised recently about Chinese cellular internet of things modules&#8212;CIMs&#8212;which are imbedded in many devices. What is the Government&#8217;s approach to this? Are they even aware of what CIMs are?<\/p><p pid=\"a1663.2\/8\">Finally, if the Government are concerned about information being harvested by social media and other apps, why is the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill, now before the Commons, widening the circumstances in which research data can be used for commercial purposes? Is this not a typical example of this Government&#8217;s incoherence and lack of co-ordination on issues such as this?<\/p>",

I give special thanks to <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Iain Duncan Smith\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10180\">the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith)<\/phrase>. Whenever he gets up to speak, I sit down to listen. Many others in the Chamber do the same: we recognise that he speaks words of wisdom. He clearly underlined the question of when the UK Government will demand the release of Jimmy Lai, a British citizen. When will he be released? That is not too much to ask.<\/p><p pid=\"a398.0\/2\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Tim Loughton\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10371\">The hon.

One of the first Westminster Hall debates that I attended&#8212;about 10 years ago now; that is hard to believe&#8212;was led by the hon. Gentleman. He referred to the authoritarian lifetime President of China. He made a comparison with the Nazis of the 1930s and discussed China&#8217;s attempt to change the world order by strengthening its navy, air force and army. As always, he spoke up for the Uyghurs, those in Tibet and the Dalai Lama. He also mentioned the Confucius Institutes, which we are all concerned about.<\/p><p pid=\"a398.0\/3\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Alistair Carmichael\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10785\">The right hon.

He said that it had to be part of the critical structure of the United Kingdom. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Tommy Sheppard\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25341\">The hon. Member for Edinburgh East (Tommy Sheppard)<\/phrase> also referred to the Confucius Institutes and growing Chinese influence.

Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Catherine West)<\/phrase> spoke of the genocide against the Uyghurs and the UK&#8217;s need to show strength against China. She gave examples of where the independent review does not challenge China as we would like it to have. At the end, the Minister spoke of what the United Kingdom is doing. We would probably like to see a bit more courage, strength and determination; I say that with respect.

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1398.0\/1\">My Lords, first, I am grateful to the Lord Speaker, the Clerk of the Parliaments, Black Rod, the doorkeepers and all the staff of the House for making me so welcome. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Judge, the Convenor of the Cross-Bench Peers, has been particularly welcoming. I am so sorry to hear of his incapacity and I wish him a speedy recovery.<\/p><p pid=\"a1398.0\/2\">I also thank my noble kinsman Lord Hendy and the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, for supporting my introduction. I was not in the least surprised to see my elder brother elevated here, but never in my career in public transport, particularly when I conducted and later drove my number 11 bus around Parliament Square, would I have believed that I might one day be here too. I think we are one of only two pairs of siblings in your Lordships&#8217; House.<\/p><p pid=\"a1398.0\/3\">I have managed bus operations in both the public and private sectors in London, elsewhere in England and in Hong Kong. I led a successful management-employee buyout when London Transport privatised the company I ran, and later returned to the public sector when the mayoralty and Transport for London were created in 2000. I managed London&#8217;s buses, major roads, Thames piers, and taxi and private hire licensing, including during and after the terrible terrorist bombings of July 2005. Then, in 2006, for nearly 10 years I became commissioner of transport, serving two mayors, Livingstone and Johnson, and I had the privilege of leading through the Olympic and Paralympic Games of 2012. For the avoidance of doubt, the credit for all the things that went well through all that time is to the staff, the management and contractors rather than simply to me.<\/p><p pid=\"a1398.0\/4\">In any event, I would never have equalled the achievements, nor the length of service, of my illustrious predecessor, the late Lord Ashfield, who ran London&#8217;s transport for nearly 30 years. The noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, is a more recent and worthy successor in that role, but he had the misfortune to be at the inception of the ill-fated Tube public\/private partnership. I do not blame him at all for the results of that, but I did take great pleasure in dismantling those flawed and expensive arrangements.<\/p><p pid=\"a1398.0\/5\">In July 2015, the then Secretary of State for Transport, now the noble Lord, Lord McLoughlin, abruptly summoned me to be appointed chair of Network Rail, then recently brought back into the public sector from the pretence of being outside it, despite government guaranteeing all its very substantial debts. I think I am grateful to him for that, although I still miss the comprehensive structure of TfL, its long-term planning horizon, its focus on passengers and its contribution to London&#8217;s economy.<\/p><p pid=\"a1398.0\/6\">I still chair Network Rail today and, subject always to the decision of the Secretary of State for Transport, I hope to continue for some while longer. I say that because our railway has great challenges to confront, and passengers, freight, the economy and the nation deserve better than we currently achieve. We have less demand and significantly less revenue than we did before Covid, and we must reduce costs.<\/p><p pid=\"a1398.0\/7\">The structures used to run the railway are not aligned to customers and are convoluted and excessively contractual. Cost is accounted for in a different place from revenue, track and train are divided, and innovation is supressed. Investment plans are seldom entirely fulfilled in practice, and, despite enthusiasm from all political parties for more investment, we do not have a prioritised, costed and long-term plan. Nor do we have as many private sector contributions to those investments as we should or, indeed, as we did at TfL.<\/p><p pid=\"a1398.0\/8\">This is all because the railway is not managed as a whole system. Passengers, freight, and regional and local stakeholders are all dissatisfied with a network which, when it goes wrong, can be the responsibility only of the Secretary of State for Transport. TfL was different: as the commissioner, quite properly, the failures were mine and the successes belonged to the mayor. I am able to say all that because the Government have the same view, as do, I think, many on all sides of this House. The reform of our railway is essential, because the connectivity it delivers is a major driver of economic growth, jobs, housing, social cohesion and sustainability, and with the right structure, we will do better. Thus, I am looking forward to primary legislation to create Great British Railways. In due course, with my brilliant chief executive at Network Rail, Andrew Haines, we hope to play the most active part we can in implementing the reforms proposed in the recent White Paper. They cannot come too quickly.<\/p><p pid=\"a1398.0\/9\">Your Lordships may also know that I am the author of a recent report on the connectivity of the United Kingdom, which has featured in recent Oral and Written Questions. I am looking forward to the Government&#8217;s response to my recommendations, which I know is in preparation. One of my conclusions in the Union Connectivity Review was that HS2 could make a better contribution than currently planned to transforming journeys to and from England and north Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It is therefore strange that, as a consequence of spending on HS2, Scotland and Northern Ireland received additional funds as part of the block grant but Wales did not. That suggests that something is amiss with the way the Barnett formula is applied.<\/p><p pid=\"a1398.0\/10\">I also chair the London Legacy Development Corporation, which is building out the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford. It is the most successful Olympic and Paralympic regeneration anywhere in the world, and possible only because of better access by public transport. Connectivity, urban regeneration and economic growth are intimately connected.<\/p><p pid=\"a1398.0\/11\">Finally, I have an active interest in transport heritage. I own and drive vintage London buses, similar to the ones I drove and conducted over 40 years ago. I suspect that I am the only Member of this House holding a passenger carrying vehicle driving licence. I am a trustee of the Science Museum Group, where I chair  the National Railway Museum&#8217;s advisory board, and I chair the Heritage Railway Association, all of which is particularly relevant to my aim to ensure a successful celebration in 2025 of the 200th anniversary of the first public passenger railway in the world, the Stockton and Darlington Railway. That started the railway revolution which drove transformational economic growth and urbanisation both here and around the world. That seems to be a British achievement worth celebrating nationwide.<\/p><p pid=\"a1398.0\/12\">I referred earlier to my illustrious predecessor, the late Lord Ashfield. His record at London Transport is never likely to be equalled, and certainly not by me. However, he made but one speech in this House in the 28 years he was a Member. Despite my present, virtually full-time role as the chair of Network Rail, I hope to do better than that, and I look forward to contributing to your Lordships&#8217; debates in the future.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1201.0\/1\">My Lords, I thank the Government for Motion C&#8212;yes, I did say that. In very turbulent and polarised times in our country, it is a  real pleasure to be able to welcome it. Noble Lords will notice that there is a fairly minor tweak to the original amendment passed by your Lordships&#8217; House. We said that a constable should not exercise powers for the principal purpose of preventing someone reporting, and the Government have replaced &#8220;principal purpose&#8221; with &#8220;sole purpose&#8221;. I for one am convinced that the precious and vital protection for journalists and others reporting on protests, rather than participating in them, is provided. The Minister wrote and said that they do not think that this is necessary but are doing it anyway. That is not ungracious. It is gracious, because I happen to think that this protection is vital. The Government disagree but they are doing it, so I am happy to thank them.<\/p><p pid=\"a1201.0\/2\">I remind noble Lords, as the Minister did, that the provision is in response to real cases: real journalists were arrested and detained last November, some for many hours, just for doing their job. The offence used when it was suggested that journalists were giving the oxygen of publicity to protesters was the fairly vague conspiracy to cause a public nuisance. While the Government have been consistent in their position that additional protection is unnecessary, no one at any stage of proceedings on the Bill could point to a single legislative provision on the current statute book that gives this protection. Therefore, I am grateful to the Minister for the way in which he has engaged with this and responded, not least to what I think was the largest defeat that the Government suffered on the Bill last time.<\/p><p pid=\"a1201.0\/3\">I am particularly grateful to Charlotte Lynch, the LBC reporter who visited us last time, having experienced the really quite traumatic incident of being arrested, handcuffed, put in a police van and detained for seven hours. This causes her some anxiety even to this day. She carried on and reported on that experience, and that has been very important for future journalists in this country, I hope that noble Lords will agree.<\/p><p pid=\"a1201.0\/4\">I am grateful to the all-party group, Justice, and Tyrone Steele, who worked with us on this amendment. I am especially grateful to the five distinguished Conservative Members of your Lordships&#8217; House, including the former governor of Hong Kong and a former leader of the Conservative Party, who did the very difficult thing of coming through the lobbies with Her Majesty&#8217;s Opposition. I give my absolute respect to them.<\/p><p pid=\"a1201.0\/5\">I am, of course, grateful to my noble friends, the Liberal Democrats and many Cross-Benchers who supported this vital protection. I give especial thanks to the co-signatories of the original journalists&#8217; protection amendment, including the noble Baroness, Lady Boycott. It was a great comfort and support to have such a distinguished journalist and former newspaper editor on my side in this.<\/p><p pid=\"a1201.0\/6\">My enormous thanks also go to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead. We disagree about some things, but not about this. In particular, I thank my co-signatory, the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, not only for co-signing this amendment and bringing his noble friends with him, but for a lifetime of public service in policing and in your Lordships&#8217; House. He is the most diligent and distinguished face of the police  service in this country. When we reform that service, it will better reflect his values. That career of public service could not be better demonstrated than by him being here today, after suffering such unspeakable loss in recent weeks.<\/p><p pid=\"a1201.0\/7\">I do not want to take your Lordships&#8217; time on the next group, so will say now that I support the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, and my noble friend Lord Coaker in the remarks that they will make about suspicionless stop and search. Stop and search is always difficult and challenging for police community relations, but suspicionless stop and search is positively toxic and not something that we should be increasing in these troubled times in our country.<\/p><p pid=\"a1201.0\/8\">Finally, I come to the difficult question of the meaning of &#8220;serious disruption&#8221;, not for the purposes of some offences, but for the whole Bill. We have the narrow policy question of what the threshold should be before a number of criminal offences and intrusive police powers impugned what would otherwise be totally peaceful and innocent dissent. That is the narrow question.<\/p><p pid=\"a1201.0\/9\">We also have a rather deeper and broader&#8212;almost philosophical&#8212;question of common sense and the English language. Is &#8220;serious&#8221; significant, as I believe, or simply more than minor? Is it a simple binary, like a child&#8217;s 18th birthday that turns them from a minor into someone who has majority; or is there a whole range of disruption that one can face in one&#8217;s life from something that is minor to something that is really quite a lot more than minor&#8212;that is significant?<\/p><p pid=\"a1201.0\/10\">This is a serious question and the threshold should be high. I am reminded of George Orwell&#8217;s famous essay &#8220;Politics and the English Language&#8221;&#8212;my favourite writing of his&#8212;in which he reminded us that distortion of language can quickly lead to abuses of power. This is a Public Order Bill and this ought to be a very serious threshold. However, if noble Lords prefer their literature to be accompanied by music, I will invoke not George Orwell but Cole Porter:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1201.0\/11\">&#8220;There&#8217;s no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to minor&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a1201.0\/12\">I urge all noble Lords who care about these things, who take a bipartisan approach to fundamental rights and freedoms in our country, as those distinguished five Conservatives did last time, to support Motion A1 in the name of my noble friend Lord Coaker.<\/p>",

That is on top of the hotels that have been costing us up to &#163;6 million per day, putting our public services and our NHS under great strain.<\/p><p pid=\"b638.0\/2\">Today&#8217;s debate is actually about fairness. We are a fair country and a welcoming country, as we have shown with Ukraine, with Syria, with Afghanistan and with Hong Kong&#8212;with the 89,000 people from Ukraine and 18,900 from Afghanistan. This is a humane policy, tackling the people smuggling gangs responsible for the deaths in the channel, which cannot continue. We must make processing times shorter and we must clear the backlog for the genuine refugees. That is what today&#8217;s Bill is about, so I welcome the plans to tackle it and I welcome the wider package of measures&#8212;not just the Bill, but everything else we are introducing.<\/p><p pid=\"b638.0\/3\">Some people want to make this about the ECHR and whether we stay or leave. That is a debate for another time, but I think all hon. Members will agree that that is a better reason to make this legislation work. Show that we can control our borders&#8212;that is my challenge to the Opposition. Vote with us today and show that it can be done. But this is an Opposition who have shown patronising views of countries such as Rwanda, who have campaigned to drag murderers off flights and who want open borders, blanket approvals and amnesties for those who are cheating our system. I support this legislation 100%.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1006.0\/1\">My Lords, it is a tremendous honour to speak in this debate today, and I am most grateful to the Minister for the way she introduced it. I had the privilege of working with the late Lady Boothroyd on the memorial to the women of World War II on Whitehall, on which there are the coats and hats of the women whose names were not known, although they all served this country&#8212;many of them lost their lives. If they were still alive, they were deeply traumatised by what they saw and what happened, but they hung up their coats at the end of the war and just got on with things.<\/p><p pid=\"a1006.0\/2\">I am also grateful for the words about the noble Baroness, Lady Gale, who welcomed me and so many others into this House with enormous kindness and generosity of spirit, which was really overwhelming. We look forward to the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Lampard.<\/p><p pid=\"a1006.0\/3\">I will talk about a woman who inspired enormous change in medicine: Cicely Saunders. She was born in Barnet in 1918, shy, intelligent, six feet tall and somewhat gawky, but she went to Oxford to study PPE. The war intervened and she became, among other things, a hospital almoner at St Thomas&#8217; and a nurse. But she realised that, to change things really, she had to change the attitudes in medicine&#8212;so she studied medicine. It was a time when dying was seen as a failure and patients were ignored on wards if they were dying, because they had not responded to the amazing cure that some of these doctors purported to have tried on them. The wards were cold and heartless, and people walked past the end of the bed. She wanted to create a home-like environment to give hope and comfort to the dying, with the best medical care and symptom control.<\/p><p pid=\"a1006.0\/4\">In 1967, she managed to open St Christopher&#8217;s Hospice in Sydenham. At that time, only 11% of entrants to medical school were women. Now, of course, it is more than 50% in this country, but, in many parts of the world, almost no women are able to study medicine at all. The foundation behind what she did was that education and research must be behind  everything we do, and that move for education and research was very important in changing the way that dying people are looked after, with tenacity, intellect and compassion. Her unwavering belief was in her phrase:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1006.0\/5\">&#8220;You matter because you are you, and you matter to the last moment of your life.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1006.0\/6\">How we die in this country has in large part been revolutionised, as it has in many parts of the world&#8212;but, sadly, not everywhere yet. Her vision shaped the way things are, and that has moved on to the Cicely Saunders Institute, an international institute of education and research based in King&#8217;s College. I had the privilege of being involved in setting it up and in its international advisory group. Its input during Covid and its management of breathlessness won an award in the last year for the contribution it made.<\/p><p pid=\"a1006.0\/7\">Different hospices around the UK and the globe have opened, and that has been inspired, but I am afraid that, in other parts of the world, women have a really poor deal in the way they are treated. In war-torn areas, grandmothers are bringing up orphaned children who are dependent on them for some love and security. The future of peace around the world lies in these women&#8217;s hands.<\/p><p pid=\"a1006.0\/8\">As the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said, HIV and AIDS are a big problem, and women are disproportionately affected because of gender inequality, discrimination, violence and sexual exploitation and abuse. In sub-Saharan Africa, six out of seven new infections are in young women and girls, and they have limited access to education. Cervical cancer is also a major killer&#8212;yet, with the HPV vaccine, we could almost eradicate it, but it is not being rolled out as it should be.<\/p><p pid=\"a1006.0\/9\">If you ask girls in many parts of the world what they want to be, they will say they want to be doctors. They want to improve the lives of the people around them in their communities and populations, and they want to make the world we live in a better place for all. We have had another role model, Averil Mansfield, who was a professor of vascular surgery, recently featured on &#8220;Desert Island Discs&#8221; and produced a book about how she broke moulds in medicine.<\/p><p pid=\"a1006.0\/10\">I will move back to Cicely and what she did, because it is estimated that 75% of the world would benefit from palliative care. Some 77% of the consultant workforce in the UK are now women. We were inspired in Cardiff and set up a distance learning course, and people from that have changed the world: we have educated over 3,000 leaders around the world, in every continent apart from Antarctica. Liz Gwyther led developments in South Africa, and Mary Bunn worked in Sierra Leone with the Cardiff link on cancer and end-of-life care. Cynthia Goh, who sadly died, led Singapore and the whole of that region, highlighting the importance of morphine availability. I also note Sushma Bhatnagar in India, Yvonne Mak in Hong Kong, and Bee Wee, also initially from Hong Kong, who became the national clinical director here in England and was the first to get a distinction on our course. They all changed what has been done through education and research, and we need to support every woman everywhere to achieve her potential.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b845.1\/1\">My Lords, I shall now repeat a Statement made yesterday in another place by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary:<\/p><p pid=\"b845.1\/2\">&#8220;With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement about the Government&#8217;s Illegal Migration Bill. Two months ago, the Prime Minister made a promise to the British people that anyone entering this country illegally will be detained and swiftly removed&#8212;no ifs, no buts. The Illegal Migration Bill will fulfil that promise. It will allow us to stop the boats that are bringing tens of thousands to our shores, in flagrant breach of both our laws and the will of the British people.<\/p><p pid=\"b845.1\/3\">The United Kingdom must always support the world&#8217;s most vulnerable. Since 2015, we have given sanctuary to nearly half a million people through family resettlement and global safe and legal routes. These include 150,000 people from Hong Kong escaping autocracy, 160,000 Ukrainians fleeing Putin&#8217;s war and 25,000 Afghans escaping the Taliban. Crucially, these  are decisions supported by the British people precisely because they were decisions made by British people through their elected representatives, not by the people smugglers and other criminals looking to break into Britain daily. For a Government not to respond to waves of illegal arrivals breaching our borders would be to betray the will of the British people whom we are elected to serve.<\/p><p pid=\"b845.1\/4\">The small boats problem is part of a larger global migration crisis. In the coming years, developed countries will face unprecedented pressures from ever greater numbers of people leaving the developing world for places such as the United Kingdom. Unless we act today, the problem will be worse tomorrow, and the problem is already unsustainable.<\/p><p pid=\"b845.1\/5\">The volume of illegal arrivals has overwhelmed our asylum system. The backlog has ballooned to over 160,000. The asylum system now costs the British taxpayer &#163;3 billion a year. Since 2018, some 85,000 people have illegally entered the United Kingdom by small boat&#8212;45,000 of them in 2022 alone. All travelled through multiple safe countries in which they could and should have claimed asylum. Many came from safe countries, such as Albania. The vast majority&#8212;74% in 2021&#8212;were adult males under the age of 40, rich enough to pay criminal gangs thousands of pounds for passage.<\/p><p pid=\"b845.1\/6\">Upon arrival, most are accommodated in hotels across the country, costing the British taxpayer around &#163;6 million a day. The risk remains that these individuals just disappear. And when we try to remove them, they turn our generous asylum laws against us to prevent removal. The need for reform is obvious and urgent.<\/p><p pid=\"b845.1\/7\">This Government have not sat on their hands. Since the Prime Minister took office, recognising the necessity of joint solutions with France, we have signed a new deal providing more technology and embedding British officers with French patrols. I hope Friday&#8217;s Anglo-French summit will further deepen co-operation.<\/p><p pid=\"b845.1\/8\">We have created a new small boats operational command, with over 700 new staff; doubled NCA funding to tackle smuggling gangs; increased enforcement raids by 50%; signed a deal with Albania, which has already enabled the return of hundreds of illegal arrivals; and we are procuring accommodation, including on military land, to end the farce of accommodating migrants in hotels.<\/p><p pid=\"b845.1\/9\">But let us be honest: it is not enough. In the face of today&#8217;s global migration crisis, yesterday&#8217;s laws are simply not fit for purpose. So to anyone proposing de facto open borders through unlimited safe and legal routes as the alternative, let us be honest: by some counts there are 100 million people around the world who could qualify for protection under our current laws. Let us be clear: they are coming here. We have seen a 500% increase in small boat crossings in two years. This is the crucial point of this Bill. They will not stop coming here until the world knows that if you enter Britain illegally, you will be detained and swiftly removed&#8212;back to your home country if it is safe, or to a safe third country, such as Rwanda.<\/p><p pid=\"b845.1\/10\">That is precisely what this Bill will do. That is how we will stop the boats. This Bill enables detention of illegal arrivals, without bail or judicial review within the first 28 days of detention, until they can be removed.  It puts a duty on the Home Secretary to remove illegal entrants and will radically narrow the number of challenges and appeals that can suspend removal. Only those under 18, medically unfit to fly or at real risk of serious and irreversible harm&#8212;an exceedingly high bar&#8212;in the country we are removing them to will be able to delay their removal. Any other claims will be heard remotely, after removal.<\/p><p pid=\"b845.1\/11\">When our Modern Slavery Act passed, the impact assessment envisaged 3,500 referrals a year. Last year, 17,000 referrals took on average 543 days to consider. Modern slavery laws are being abused to block removals. That is why we granted more than 50% of asylum requests from citizens of a safe European country and NATO ally, Albania. That is why this Bill disqualifies illegal entrants from using modern slavery rules to prevent removal.<\/p><p pid=\"b845.1\/12\">I will not address the Bill&#8217;s full legal complexities today. Some of the nation&#8217;s finest legal minds have been and continue to be involved in its development. But I must say this: the rule 39 process that enabled the Strasbourg court to block, at the last minute, flights to Rwanda, after our courts had refused injunctions, was deeply flawed. Our ability to control our borders cannot be held back by an opaque process conducted late at night, with no chance to make our case or even appeal decisions. That is why we have initiated discussions in Strasbourg to ensure that its blocking orders meet a basic natural justice standard, one that prevents abuse of rule 39 to thwart removal. That is why the Bill will set out the conditions for the UK&#8217;s future compliance with such orders. Other countries share our dilemma and will understand the justice of our position.<\/p><p pid=\"b845.1\/13\">Our approach is robust and novel, which is why we cannot make a definitive statement of compatibility under Section 19(1)(a) of the Human Rights Act 1998. Of course, the UK will always seek to uphold international law, and I am confident that this Bill is compatible with international law. When we have stopped the boats, the Bill will introduce an annual cap, to be determined by Parliament, on the number of refugees the UK will resettle via safe and legal routes. This will ensure an orderly system, considering local authority capacity for housing, public services and support.<\/p><p pid=\"b845.1\/14\">The British people are famously a fair and patient people. But their sense of fair play has been tested beyond its limits as they have seen the country taken for a ride. Their patience has run out. The law-abiding patriotic majority have said, &#8216;Enough is enough.&#8217; This cannot and will not continue. Their Government&#8212;this Government&#8212;must act decisively, must act with determination, must act with compassion, and must act with proportion. Make no mistake: this Conservative Government will act now to stop the boats. I commend this Statement to the House.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b845.1\/15\">My Lords, that concludes the Statement.<\/p>",

We are all concerned about the integrity of our elections. We are conscious that foreign donations are part of what can undermine that integrity.<\/p><p pid=\"b296.0\/6\">The Minister may have had drawn to his attention a letter in yesterday&#8217;s Financial Times which points out that the new proposals for a football regulator include among its duties the need to ensure stronger due diligence and checks on the sources of wealth of those who wish to buy or own football clubs. It is anomalous, to say the least, that we should have stronger checks on people who wish to buy British football clubs than on people who wish to give sometimes very large sums of money to British political parties. I remind the Minister that the question of Arron Banks&#8217;s very large donation to the Vote Leave campaign is still being litigated in the British courts. We still have no assurance as to the origins of that donation, since he has refused to give one.<\/p><p pid=\"b296.0\/7\">I support what the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, has said, by reminding the Minister that there are now 100,000 British citizens living in the United Arab  Emirates&#8212;some of whom already donate to British political parties. It would be quite easy for some of those to become intermediaries for the sovereign powers concerned. Other wealthy British expatriates live in Thailand, Singapore or Hong Kong. Their business depends heavily on the Chinese economy and state.<\/p><p pid=\"b296.0\/8\">It is entirely desirable, reasonable and appropriate to ensure that British political parties play their part in mitigating the risks of foreign interference in British elections by being required to show that they are conducting careful risk management in accepting donations from overseas. There have been a number of instances in recent years of which we are all aware. Some of them were touched on in the ISC report on Russia. It is clear that such management has not been in place. It ought to be. I hope that the Government will accept this amendment as a means of filling this loophole.<\/p>",

I congratulate <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Wendy Morton\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25342\">the right hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Wendy Morton)<\/phrase> on her thorough introduction to this debate in which she highlighted the real challenges with some feeling. I also thank my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jessica Morden\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11732\">the Member for Newport East (Jessica Morden)<\/phrase>, who described so well, but so sadly, the reality of life for someone who has been through these devastating circumstances. I will pick up in particular her point about family reunion.<\/p><p pid=\"b179.0\/2\">I am very proud to represent a borough in Hackney where just over 3% of the population&#8212;about 7,000 people &#8212;have Turkish and Kurdish backgrounds. I and my north-east London colleagues, whom I am glad to see here, represent what we might describe as a little Turkey. We have a huge engagement with our Turkish-speaking and Kurdish-speaking communities, who contribute an awful lot to our society.<\/p><p pid=\"b179.0\/3\">I will talk a bit about family reunion. I appreciate that the Minister has to defer to the Home Office on these issues, but the point must be made very firmly that we have examples in very recent times of reunion schemes to bring people from areas of devastation into the UK. The Public Accounts Committee, which I have the privilege of chairing, looked at the Syria scheme, which was actually well worked out. Obviously that mostly involved people without family here, but 20,000 of them were settled, so there is a precedent. There is also a precedent in the Afghan scheme, although that was not about family reunion, of course, but resettlement routes for people to whom the UK owes a duty of care.<\/p><p pid=\"b179.0\/4\">In addition, there is the example of Ukraine. There were rocky moments, but the family reunion and Homes for Ukraine schemes are worked-up schemes that are there to pick up anew. There was also Hong Kong, and back in 1996, when I was a young councillor, we welcomed people from Montserrat. Although that was from an overseas territory, we nevertheless had the capability, the capacity and the mechanisms to ensure that we could get people into this country.<\/p><p pid=\"b179.0\/5\">I represent, as I say, around 7,000 Turkish and Kurdish people&#8212;well, I do not represent them all; I share that with my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Diane Abbott\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10001\">the Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)<\/phrase>. There are many thousands of others across north-east London, and, as we have heard, in Newport and across the country. There are families here who have jobs and housing, who could quickly scoop up family members caught up in the devastation.<\/p><p pid=\"b179.0\/6\">Many years ago, when I was the Minister responsible for dealing with issues such as resettlement, we would take a number of people from United Nations camps, but we now know that there are aid agencies there who can identify families or individuals who are very vulnerable, such as lone children, and who could be quickly routed through the existing compassionate route that we operate and support as the United Kingdom. The communities here&#8212;not just the individuals, with their housing, jobs and money that could support those people, but the communities in Hackney and around north-east London&#8212;could do a great deal to support people. We have groups such as the Alevis and very many Turkish community groups and organisations that would be very welcoming. My own mosque, Suleymaniye mosque, is a Turkish foundation mosque as well.<\/p><p pid=\"b179.0\/7\">We know it takes time to get these schemes right, so there is no time for delay. It is important that we have child protection and other protection routes in place, so that we are not just accepting people for wrong reasons. Those such as the 15-year-old orphan girl my hon. Friend the Member for Newport East described need to come somewhere safe, and there is no safe place for them in the region at the moment because of the challenges.<\/p><p pid=\"b179.0\/8\">I urge the Minister to give us an answer today on the Government thinking on this. I have already written to the Home Secretary, and I will continue to work with colleagues to press this issue. We are not necessarily talking about great numbers of people&#8212;sadly, with so many deaths, there will be very few people in this position &#8212;but at the very least we must reach out to those vulnerable lone children and other vulnerable people. I look forward hopefully to the creation of a wider scheme to support people, but could we please get moving on supporting vulnerable lone children and vulnerable family members of those currently in the UK as a starting point?<\/p>",

There is even evidence to suggest that people working for TikTok in China have hacked into European data to track down journalists&#8217; sources. That is deeply worrying, and should perhaps prompt us all to consider whether the continued use of TikTok is prudent. That is just the tip of the iceberg.<\/p><p>Hikvision is a Chinese state-owned manufacturer that supplies video surveillance equipment for civilian and military purposes. Last year, Liberal Democrat research revealed that at least 11 local authorities in Scotland are using Hikvision cameras. Those cameras, which are used in the detention centres holding Uyghur Muslims against their will in Xinjiang, are also used by Police Scotland.<\/p><p>Just last week, the UK Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner, Fraser Sampson, spoke of our having created a network of dependencies on Chinese surveillance technology without sufficient regard to risk. He also likened Hikvision in particular to &#8220;digital asbestos&#8221;.<\/p><p>Not only are those cameras a threat to our privacy and security, their continued use across Scotland flies in the face of the liberal principles and human rights that we as a nation claim to champion. I have raised the alarm on this numerous times, but little action has been taken. Indeed, Scottish Liberal Democrats have led the way in identifying the threat that those devices pose. Liberal Democrat councillors in Edinburgh in particular have been successful in their calls to have Hikvision removed from the capital&#8217;s local government estate.<\/p><p>It is time that the Scottish Government showed some leadership, too. It should echo the warnings of experts and issue an alert advising local authorities and public bodies against the use of such surveillance equipment, particularly equipment that is manufactured by companies linked to the Chinese state and in the orbit of its intelligence legislation. That would be a positive step forward, but Chinese state surveillance runs worryingly deeper than that.<\/p><p>The United Kingdom shares a proud history with the people of Hong Kong, and I led the first debate in this Parliament on the plight of the people of Hong Kong. It is why the former leader of my party, Paddy Ashdown, was the first politician to seek and secure British passports for the Hong Kong Chinese. International solidarity with people who we may never meet is the core liberal principle, and we have offered the people of Hong Kong, who are threatened by the ever-increasing authoritarianism of the Chinese state, safe harbour on our shores.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b912.1\/1\">Before I start, I put on record my thanks to Mr Speaker for hosting President Zelensky just now in Parliament; I am sure we all agree that his address was both moving and powerful. Having visited Ukraine last year as Attorney General, I know that this Government are as committed as ever to fighting with our friends in Ukraine.<\/p><p pid=\"b912.1\/2\">With permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the independent review of Prevent. The United Kingdom is an extraordinary place to live. Our history, our culture, our institutions, our liberties and, crucially, our values make it so: democracy, the rule of law, sexual equality, freedom of religion, freedom of expression and freedom of inquiry.<\/p><p pid=\"b912.1\/3\">Those freedoms are not enjoyed universally. We are reminded of that every day in Russia&#8217;s barbaric invasion of Ukraine, in Iran&#8217;s brutal repression of protest, and in China&#8217;s horrific treatment of the Uyghur people and its draconian laws limiting free expression in Hong Kong. The United Kingdom is extraordinary because of the rights and freedoms our citizens enjoy. That is why so many people want to follow in my parents&#8217; footsteps and leave their home to make a new life here.<\/p><p pid=\"b912.1\/4\">Those rights and freedoms are underpinned by our shared values. We cannot be timid when it comes to those values. If we do not argue for them, if we do not defend them, there is no guarantee that they will endure, because there are those who seek to undermine them through extremist and even terrorist activity.<\/p><p pid=\"b912.1\/5\">Recent attacks provide a tragic and sobering reminder of that threat. The 2017 Westminster attack, the Manchester Arena bombing, London Bridge, Finsbury Park, Fishmongers&#8217; Hall, Forbury Gardens and the murders of Jo Cox MP and Sir David Amess MP have all taken lives from us in the name of extremist ideology.<\/p><p pid=\"b912.1\/6\">Terrorist attacks are not random acts of violence. They are inherently and necessarily ideological. The very freedoms and values we cherish are the things terrorists want to destroy. Terrorists come from a much wider pool of extremists. That is why we must ensure we address the whole problem, not just the sharpest, most violent end of the extremist-terrorist spectrum.<\/p><p pid=\"b912.1\/7\">My first duty as Home Secretary is to keep the British public safe. The UK&#8217;s counter-terrorism strategy, Contest, is centred around four Ps: prevent, pursue, protect and prepare. Each of those four pillars is vital, but I am here to talk about how we can better prevent people from becoming radicalised into ideologies that inspire terrorism. I am here to talk about Prevent.<\/p><p pid=\"b912.1\/8\">Prevent is an early intervention programme. Its mission is to stop people becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism. It relies on frontline sectors across society, including healthcare, education, local authorities and the police. William Shawcross has led a superb independent review of Prevent, for which I am very grateful. The review is unflinching: Prevent needs major reform. It needs to better understand the threats that we face and the ideology underpinning them.<\/p><p pid=\"b912.1\/9\">Eighty per cent. of the counter-terrorism police network&#8217;s live investigations are on Islamist terrorism. MI5 is clear that that remains our predominant threat, accounting  for 75% of its caseload. Yet only 16% of Prevent referrals in 2021-22 were Islamist. Prevent has shown cultural timidity and an institutional hesitancy to tackle Islamism for fear of charges of Islamophobia. Those are false charges that spread fear and misinformation in communities.<\/p><p pid=\"b912.1\/10\">As the former Prime Minister David Cameron said in 2015:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b912.1\/11\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Islam is a religion observed peacefully and devoutly by over a billion people. Islamist extremism is a political ideology supported by a minority. At the furthest end are those who back terrorism to promote their ultimate goal: an entire Islamist realm, governed by an interpretation of Sharia. Move along the spectrum, and you find people who may reject violence, but who accept various parts of the extremist worldview, including real hostility towards Western democracy and liberal values.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b912.1\/12\">I thank Mr Cameron for his leadership on this issue, and I stand by his words.<\/p><p pid=\"b912.1\/13\">The truth is that there is nothing anti-Muslim about tackling Islamism, and we must continue to work closely with Muslim communities if we are to do so effectively. In fact, William Shawcross rightly commended the excellent, brave work to challenge Islamism in local communities. I share his outrage that those working to do so&#8212;many of whom are Muslim&#8212;often face intimidation, including death threats, from extremists. Prevent must do more to support them.<\/p><p pid=\"b912.1\/14\">While obscuring the Islamist threat, Prevent has defined the extreme right wing too broadly, encompassing the respectable right and centre-right. The threat from the extreme right wing must not be minimised. It is serious and it is growing; it must be robustly addressed. But it is not the same, either in nature or in scale, as the threat from Islamism.<\/p><p pid=\"b912.1\/15\">Prevent is a security service, not a social service. Too often, the role of ideology in terrorism is minimised, with violence attributed instead to vulnerabilities such as mental health or poverty. &#8220;Protective factors&#8221; do not absolve ideological fervour or individual responsibility. We must be more nuanced in our approach.<\/p><p pid=\"b912.1\/16\">I will swiftly implement all the review&#8217;s recommendations, and will report on my progress a year from now. Prevent&#8217;s focus must be solely on security, not on political correctness. Prevent&#8217;s first objective will be to tackle the ideological causes of terrorism. It must counteract the narratives of extremists, undermine their propaganda, and take on their warped ideologies. Prevent staff, and others under the Prevent duty, will have better training and guidance, improving their understanding of the ideological nature of terrorism. There will be a proportionate and consistent threshold for defining all ideological threats. A new security threat check process will ensure that Prevent decision making always considers the present terrorist threat.<\/p><p pid=\"b912.1\/17\">The review establishes that Prevent has funded&#8212;using taxpayer money in the name of counter-extremism&#8212;those legitimising extremism. That ends on my watch. I will strengthen the oversight of our work with civil society organisations, and ensure that Prevent funding goes only towards Prevent&#8217;s objectives.<\/p><p pid=\"b912.1\/18\">In too many aspects of British life, hatred directed at Jewish people has been tolerated, normalised, and accepted. Racism that would rightly be called out and enforced against were it directed at another minority group is too often ignored when directed at Jews. The review makes  clear that that double standard must change, so Prevent will do more to recognise and combat the prevalence of antisemitism in extremist ideology and narratives.<\/p><p pid=\"b912.1\/19\">Finally, I will look to the Commission for Countering Extremism, led by Robin Simcox, for independent scrutiny and expertise as we deliver on the review&#8217;s recommendations.<\/p><p pid=\"b912.1\/20\">Britain has succeeded because we are a pluralist, open society, enhanced by our differences and bound together by our values. This country can be proud of who we are&#8212;proud of our freedoms and proud of our values. We should say so, loudly and often. I am deeply grateful to all those who work hard to counter extremism and keep us safe. A reformed Prevent is critical to that goal. That is why I commend this statement to the House.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c886.2\/1\">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Conor Burns\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24780\">the Member for Bournemouth West (Conor Burns)<\/phrase> for securing the debate and for speaking so powerfully on behalf of his constituents. First and foremost, I want to pay tribute to Thomas Roberts, a young man with a bright future ahead of him whose life was cut short, and to extend my sympathies and those of the Government to his family and friends for their profound loss. This was an horrific crime which has robbed a young man of his future and caused intolerable suffering to his loved ones.<\/p><p pid=\"c886.2\/2\">In any such case, justice must be delivered and the perpetrator punished. I welcome the life sentence that has been handed down by the Crown court, and I can assure my right hon. Friend that Mr Abdulrahimzai will be considered for deportation so that removal coincides with the end of his custodial sentence. As my right hon. Friend said, that individual abused the generosity of our country, and exploited our asylum and immigration system with terrible consequences. However, when a crime as abhorrent as this occurs, we must also confront the difficult questions posed by the case and ensure that our systems and processes are as effective and robust as they can be. That is what my right hon. Friend and his constituents would expect and what the broader British public would expect, and I can also assure my right hon. Friend, and indeed all Members, that the Government recognise the need for this case to be comprehensively examined. I have already asked the Home Office to conduct an investigation of the circumstances surrounding it.<\/p><p pid=\"c886.2\/3\">While I completely understand the desire for immediate answers, I hope that my right hon. Friend will understand if I refrain from going too far into the detail while that investigation is ongoing, but I can provide some immediate reflections on the circumstances surrounding the case. All asylum claimants should be subject to robust mandatory security checks against their claimed identity, including criminality checks on UK databases. This happens when we intercept individuals such as those who arrive on small boats at Western Jet Foil in Kent and are subject to checks at the Manston centre. However, we need to strengthen ties with international partners to make vital intelligence- sharing more seamless, for instance through the sharing of criminal conviction data. Individuals attempting to cheat our immigration system using multiple names&#8212;or aliases&#8212;and ages must face decisive action. It is unacceptable that we place foster carers, schools and others who support individuals in intolerable and dangerous positions because we do not have access to sufficient data.<\/p><p pid=\"c886.2\/4\">Another issue on which we should reflect, which my right hon. Friend rightly raised, is the need for robust age assessment measures. The age of a person arriving in the UK is normally established from the documents with which they have travelled, but that has proved challenging because so many arrivals who claim to be children do not have any definitive documentary evidence to support their age claims. Under the current process, when an individual claims to be a child without documentary evidence, and when there is reason to doubt their claimed age, immigration officers are required to make an initial age assessment to determine whether the individual should be treated as a child or an adult. If doubt remains about whether the claimant is an adult or a child, they are referred to a local authority, such as that of my right hon. Friend, for further consideration of their age and treated as a child for immigration purposes until that further assessment has been completed. Clearly this case illustrates why we need a more consistent and robust approach.<\/p><p pid=\"c886.2\/5\">Given the difficult task of accurately assessing someone&#8217;s age and the serious risks when we fail to do so, the Home Secretary and I are considering introducing scientific age assessment methods at the earliest opportunity.  This is being done in fellow western democracies such as Norway, Denmark and Sweden. It is essential to widen the evidence available to decision makers and improve the accuracy of their decisions. It will also act as a deterrent to those who flagrantly abuse the system and put others at risk by posing as children. The report from the Age Estimation Science Advisory Committee was published by the Home Office on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2023-01-10\">10 January<\/phrase>, and we will now consider the recommendations. We will bring forward proposals at the earliest opportunity.<\/p><p pid=\"c886.2\/6\">Turning to the wider issue of hotel accommodation in my right hon. Friend&#8217;s constituency, we currently accommodate around 650 supported asylum seekers in Bournemouth, mostly in temporary hotel accommodation. There are 10 supported asylum seekers in longer-term dispersal accommodation, and there are no bridging hotels currently housing unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. Let me perfectly clear that I share my right hon. Friend&#8217;s deep frustration, and I acknowledge the impact that this is having on his local community and on the business community in his constituency. It is a vibrant and beautiful tourist destination that wants to make use of its hotels for better purposes.<\/p><p pid=\"c886.2\/7\">By national standards, those numbers are low. There are more than 150 local authorities that support larger populations of dispersed asylum seekers and 50 local authorities with larger overall total supported asylum seekers. Taking account of the overall population in Bournemouth, supported asylum seekers account for 0.16% of the local population. There are more than 110 local authorities that have a higher concentration of supported asylum seekers. This is not to diminish the burdens; it is merely to contextualise them and to show the scale of the challenge that now confronts us, to which we as a Government must find answers.<\/p><p pid=\"c886.2\/8\">We need to ensure that there is proper engagement with the local community when we stand up this new accommodation, and I have made that point on numerous occasions. We must ensure that the Home Office now implements better procedures to let local authorities, and indeed Members of Parliament, know in good time that we intend to take up this form of accommodation. My officials are now running regular engagement sessions with local authorities to try to improve this process. We take steps to try to minimise the impact of any hotels on the local community. Our service providers have a model to ensure that many on-site facilities and amenities, such as recreation, food and laundry, are provided and that specialist support and security guards are provided 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<\/p><p pid=\"c886.2\/9\">None the less, it is absolutely right that my right hon. Friend has raised this on behalf of his constituents. I hope he has seen, in the statement that the Prime Minister set out in December and in subsequent ones that the Home Secretary and I have made, that we are absolutely clear that the mission of this Government in this respect is to end the use of these hotels and to return them to local communities and businesses for their rightful purpose. They are not right for local communities. They are expensive and a waste of money for the taxpayer.<\/p><p pid=\"c886.2\/10\">We have committed to clear the backlog of legacy outstanding initial decisions in the asylum system by the end of 2023. To this end, we are doubling the number of asylum caseworkers this year and streamlining and modernising the end-to-end decision-making process.  This should ensure that claims can be dealt with quickly, whether because the individual has a high chance of being granted asylum or because they have a very low chance of it, including those from safe countries such as Albania who can be removed forthwith. We will reduce the number of asylum seekers in contingency accommodation as a result. I am pleased to say that that work is not only under way but is already bearing fruit. The legacy backlog is falling as a result of the work now undertaken.<\/p><p pid=\"c886.2\/11\">We are also trying to increase the supply of dispersal accommodation, which is a cheaper, less visible and more appropriate way to house these individuals, by working with local authorities across the country to ensure a fair and equitable spread. We are also looking at a small number of larger accommodation sites, the purpose of which will be to ensure that there is decent, but never luxurious, and good value-for-money accommodation, of the kind the public would expect. I hope we will be able to set out more on that in due course.<\/p><p pid=\"c886.2\/12\">In the long term, as my right hon. Friend rightly said, the enduring solution to this problem is not procuring more hotels or more sites such as dispersal accommodation but stopping the illegal small boat crossings. It is for that reason that the Prime Minister has made this one of the five priorities by which he wishes this Government to be judged, and it is why the Home Secretary and I are firmly focused on implementing the reforms needed to grip this problem once and for all.<\/p><p pid=\"c886.2\/13\">In the coming weeks, we will bring forward new legislation to restore deterrence and to stop the small boats crossing the channel, which I know will have the support of my right hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth West. It will be based on the simple principle that people who come here illegally should  have no right to remain here, and that we will fulfil our historic duty as a country to support those genuinely fleeing persecution and human rights abuses around the world, not by enabling people to abuse our system and jump the queue but by working with those in greatest need to pursue targeted resettlement schemes of the kind we have recently done so well as a country with respect to Ukraine, Afghanistan, Syria and Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"c886.2\/14\">We have presented a comprehensive plan for tackling illegal migration and stopping the boats, with deterrence suffused throughout our approach. A critical element of that is the Rwanda plan, which my right hon. Friend has always supported and which we hope to implement at the earliest opportunity. Putting that plan into action is a first-order priority for this Government.<\/p><p pid=\"c886.2\/15\">I finish by repeating my thanks to my right hon. Friend for securing this debate. He is right to raise these issues, and I hope I have given some reassurance about how seriously the Government take them. On the case he highlighted, of a life tragically cut short, my thoughts are with the victim&#8217;s loved ones. Protecting the public is the Home Office&#8217;s No. 1 priority, and this Government will do all we can to deliver it.<\/p><p pid=\"c886.2\/16\">We are, as my right hon. Friend said, a big-hearted country that seeks to protect genuine asylum seekers and offer them a new life in this country, but we will clamp down with the full force of the law on those who choose to abuse our generosity. We will build a new asylum and immigration system that secures our borders and delivers our obligations in a way that the British public would expect.<\/p><p pid=\"c886.2\/17\">Question put and agreed to.<\/p><p pid=\"c886.2\/18\">House adjourned.<\/p>",

I will indeed congratulate the Holocaust Educational Trust later in my speech.<\/p><p pid=\"b1237.3\/2\">It is vital that we teach even the youngest children about the importance of not discriminating against others on account of their beliefs, just as they understand so well the importance of not discriminating against others on account of disability.<\/p><p pid=\"b1237.3\/3\">I have the privilege of chairing the International Religious Freedom or Belief Alliance, a growing group of 42 countries whose Governments, like ours, have formally committed to protecting and promoting freedom  of religion or belief around the world. It is our aspiration to see the toolkit that I mentioned, when it is developed, used in schools across our 42 countries. I am proud that the toolkit is currently being piloted in the UK, including in a school in my constituency.<\/p><p pid=\"b1237.3\/4\">As the years go by and our brave, inspirational holocaust survivors, with their testimonies, diminish in number, we must ensure that their voice is sustained, not least with young ambassadors. I pay tribute to the Holocaust Educational Trust for the excellent work that it does in that regard.<\/p><p pid=\"b1237.3\/5\">The alliance I chair is promoting the connection of young freedom of religion or belief ambassadors around the world. We are working towards a 2023 virtual global conference engaging young FORB ambassadors, and we want to involve three groups of young people: first, young people from democratic societies like our own who have not personally experienced persecution but care about the issue and want to do more; secondly, young people in the diaspora here in the UK with ties in countries such as Nigeria and direct concerns to relay; and, thirdly and critically, young people who live in countries where there is persecution and are experiencing it themselves&#8212;places such as Myanmar, where there is already strong interest from young people, and Hong Kong, where oppression on account of religion is an increasing concern.<\/p><p pid=\"b1237.3\/6\">As we plan this virtual global conference, I would welcome contacts from colleagues, all-party parliamentary group country chairs and others with young people from across the world who may be interested in engaging with the event late in 2023. This is a way in which we here can act. Indeed, we can all do something to make &#8220;never again&#8221; a reality for the next generation, and it is so heartening that, in this Parliament, elected Members right across the political spectrum are determined to do so.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1083.1\/1\">I thank the hon. Lady for her point, which is well made. The thing is that the Government were curious, and they did this review, which is sitting there. That is clear&#8212;the one thing that the written statement confirmed was that a review had been done and recommendations had come from it, but all we got was a summary of the recommendations. What I take from that is that they were curious and they found out, but now they do not want to tell us. What on earth happened? It is not a good look.<\/p><p pid=\"b1083.1\/2\">To move on from golden visas, we desperately need to see more action in a number of other areas to ensure that we properly tackle economic crime, particularly by kleptocrats. It is right that we focus on Russians, but it is worth saying that the Bill will apply to many other flavours of kleptocrats and bad people. As other hon. Members have said, this could be our last chance for many years to get this right, so we should consider how else it might apply. Last year, for example, Hong Kong Watch highlighted concerns about the dirty money that Hong Kong officials had gained through corruption and that has now been spent by the families of officials in the UK, including on property. I raised those concerns at the time and I will continue to press Ministers on them.<\/p><p pid=\"b1083.1\/3\">I tabled new clause 30, about Iran, to show how important it is to focus not on a single country, but anywhere there are human rights abuses. Anoosheh Ashoori made the point that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1083.1\/4\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;there are a large number of children and relatives of the regime that, like the Russian oligarchs, like living the high life here and have assets here.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b1083.1\/5\">Why are we not pursuing them? The new clause asks the Government to use existing legislation to do an audit and report back to Parliament. We should apply the Bill to as many places as it can be effective.<\/p><p pid=\"b1083.1\/6\">All that takes resourcing&#8212;a familiar refrain in the House&#8212;which is addressed by new clause 31. Frankly, resourcing is a lacuna in this Bill and its predecessor. I was encouraged by the number of amendments on establishing an economic crime fighting fund, which shows that it is clearly the shared will of hon. Members on both sides of the House that we put the resourcing and money behind this legislation to ensure that it is done properly. The Liberal Democrats wholeheartedly share that commitment. I say to the Minister that that money would not be frittered away; it would be an investment, because if we fund the agencies properly, they will start to bring the money back in. We know the exorbitant amount that we think we are losing to economic crime, so any investment in getting some of that money back would surely be good.<\/p><p pid=\"b1083.1\/7\">In conclusion, I urge Ministers to take note of the willingness of hon. Members on both sides of the House to act, and to take heart from it. There is much more to be done. I hope that the Bill is the next chapter, but not the last, in the House&#8217;s fight against economic  crime in this country. I sincerely hope that Ministers will continue to work with us in our common aim of bringing about transparency and light to tackle this once and for all, so that we are never again left in this embarrassing position.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1390.0\/1\">My Lords, I begin by paying tribute to my noble friend Lord Lawson. As his researcher in my spare time before I entered Parliament, then his PPS for four years, then his Economic Secretary to the Treasury for two more, I learned my politics at his feet. I also learned to admire his immense intellect, his sound judgment, and&#8212;what may be less well known to others&#8212;his incredible, uncanny insight into human psychology, enabling him to forecast in advance the reactions of individuals and the public to events long before they occurred. When I saw him in the summer, his intellect, judgment and insight were undimmed. They will be sorely missed in this House.<\/p><p pid=\"b1390.0\/2\">I want to make five simple points. First, the four major global financial centres, London, New York, Hong Kong and Singapore, are all based on common law, as are the three newest players, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Astana. By contrast, the largest European financial centre, based on civil law code, is Frankfurt, which clocks in at number 18 as the most significant globally. That is not a coincidence; it is because common law is uniquely suited to financial markets. In recent decades, layers of civil law code have been added to Britain&#8217;s financial system, so the objective of this Bill, to return rule-making to a more common-law-based approach, is very welcome.<\/p><p pid=\"b1390.0\/3\">Secondly, it is not clear whether the Bill will achieve that objective. Historically, the common-law approach involves laws and regulations made by Parliament and explicated by the courts by the accumulation of precedents. The Bill at present will effectively hand over rule-making to independent regulators, with minimal accountability to Parliament or involvement of the courts.<\/p><p pid=\"b1390.0\/4\">Thirdly, the economic analysis of regulation is a comparatively new discipline, but its seminal conclusion is clear: we cannot rely on the beneficence of regulators. Left to their own devices&#8212;and I stress this&#8212;regulators regulate in the interests of regulators, without accountability. That is why, in practice, they mind their own backs by taking a bureaucratic, box-ticking approach to every decision, rather than focusing their resources on areas of genuine concern. As a result, bona fide businesses face pointless delays to obtain the least contentious decisions; regulators refuse to offer advice on how they will apply specific rules in specific cases, leaving businesses to face uncertainty and risk; and regulators refuse to publish reasons for their decisions, with the result that there is no coherent body of case law for firms to follow. Finally, regulators tend remorselessly to extend their remit, increasing their own importance.<\/p><p pid=\"b1390.0\/5\">I understand that amendments are likely to be proposed to make regulators more accountable to Parliament, or at least to a powerful Joint Committee of both Houses. Having chaired the Joint Committee scrutinising legislation following the great financial crisis, I can vouch for how much value the Members of this House give to such committees, as well as those of the other House, to which I then belonged. It is also important that there are amendments to require regulators to apply common law disciplines and to enable tribunals to ensure that a body of publicly available case law develops to give practitioners greater legal certainty. I am predisposed to support such amendments, as I hope will the Government.<\/p><p pid=\"b1390.0\/6\">Fourthly, I understand that the regulators have been arguing that their independence is sacrosanct. To quote Mandy Rice-Davies, &#8220;They would say that, wouldn&#8217;t they?&#8221; Of course politicians should not meddle in how regulators apply rules to specific practitioners, but the Bank of England was given independence to set interest rates for a very specific reason: because the timing of interest rate changes is electorally sensitive. There is no equivalent reason to allow the financial regulators to be immune to influence and oversight from Parliament or the courts.<\/p><p pid=\"b1390.0\/7\">Fifthly, finally and rather differently, there is no reason to extend the regulators&#8217; competence to include climate change. The sensible path to net zero, which we have adopted in this country, is to reduce demand for fossil fuels, not to reduce their supply. If businesses overinvest in producing fossil fuels ahead of declining demand, they will lose money. That is their problem, not the regulators&#8217;. If the UK unilaterally bans investment in fossil fuels, which would be a bizarre thing to do given that we do not ban their import, other people will supply them, both here and abroad. If the world collectively restricts the supply of fossil fuels faster than we phase out demand, there will be shortages, prices will shoot up and fossil-fuel producers will make enormous profits; we will have done to ourselves  what Putin has just done to the world. Giving regulators a climate objective would be either pointless or disastrous. In all other respects, I support the Bill.<\/p>",

Between 2015 and September of last year, we offered a place to almost 450,000 men, women and children who sought safety via safe and legal entry routes. They include people from Hong Kong, Syria, Afghanistan and Ukraine, as well as the family members of refugees. Last year, we offered more entry route opportunities than in any single year since the end of the second world war. Over the same period, the UK offered protection in the form of refugee status, humanitarian protection and alternative forms of leave via asylum applications to over 90,000 people, including dependants.<\/p><p pid=\"a204.5\/3\">It is important to recognise the wider background to these matters. The Home Secretary and I have been very clear, repeatedly, about the challenges that we face as a country, some of which have been referenced by my hon. Friend the Member for Clacton. We should be under no illusion about the fact that the UK&#8217;s asylum system has been under immense strain and mounting pressure for several years, owing to the very large numbers of people crossing the channel illegally&#8212;principally, but not solely, in small boats. Last year, over 45,000 people arrived in clandestine boats. The journeys are facilitated by ruthless criminal gangs who are interested only in profiting from human misery. The tragic loss of life in the channel last month, to which the hon. Member for Lanark and Hamilton East referred, was the worst possible reminder of the dangers of the crossings, and underlines once more why it is so critical that we destroy the business model of the people smugglers.<\/p><p pid=\"a204.5\/4\">That is why deterrence will be suffused through everything that we do as a Government, and why I disagree with the hon. Lady&#8217;s characterisation of our policy with regard to Rwanda. There is nothing compassionate about perpetuating a trade in people that risks the lives of thousands of individuals, including children, every year. That evil trade must be stopped, and we are taking concerted action to do so on a number of fronts, as my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister set out at the end of last year. That action includes deeper co-operation with our key partners, such as the French, as my hon. Friend the Member for Clacton set out.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a203.0\/1\">It is a pleasure to follow so many speakers who have talked of successes and of subjects that are of interest to us all, such as artificial intelligence. However, these Christmas Adjournment debates also give us a chance to appreciate some of those who would not normally be mentioned, and there is no better way for me to start than by thanking those in the Gloucestershire health and care trusts whose staff serve so many of my constituents and those of my Gloucestershire colleagues so well, often at home and sometimes giving palliative care at the end of life. I have been honoured to see them in action from time to time when volunteering with the NHS each summer, but this year I feel more deeply than ever about this, because Alice Roberts and her team were helping my younger brother, who died of cancer three weeks ago. My sister-in-law Sophie described Alice and her colleagues as &#8220;amazing, kind and empathetic&#8221;, and I know what a difference their approach made in the last few days of his life. I am incredibly grateful to all the district nurses in Gloucestershire, many of whom I know will carry on helping patients like my brother at the end of their lives through this difficult winter.<\/p><p pid=\"a203.0\/2\">Let me just add that I find it hard to say much about Royal College of Nursing or ambulance strikes, or to make judgments, when emotions, respect, responsibility for public finances and the politics of union strikes clash so uncomfortably for me at the moment. I have chaired regular meetings between our county&#8217;s MPs, our NHS trusts, public health and our county council for almost three years now, and with huge respect to all the health professionals involved, the question that I ask myself is: if nurses are stressed by volumes of work and lack of resources, as they are, what will happen to the backlogs? They will only increase. That is why I can only encourage all those responsible to think of creative solutions to capacity in our A&amp;E hospitals. Is it right, for example, that alcoholics return regularly to these hospitals, including the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, both for their detox treatment and for a 10-day monitored recovery? Is that really what an A&amp;E hospital should do when beds are needed for real accidents, not recurring addiction? This is not to downplay the importance of such help, but just to ask whether it could be done elsewhere than in our A&amp;E hospitals.<\/p><p pid=\"a203.0\/3\">Let me now move on and appreciate those who serve us abroad: not only our armed forces, who have been mentioned several times today, but our diplomatic service, our international trade officers and others, including the British Council and the Westminster Foundation for Democracy. Some work in countries where there may be more sun but also, until recently, many more covid restrictions. Many of those people did not see family back here for well over two years, and I want to thank them all.<\/p><p pid=\"a203.0\/4\">Official trade statistics may not show great growth in trade with Asia, but Opposition Members such as <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Chris Bryant\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10761\">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)<\/phrase> should be careful about rubbishing what is being done on behalf of our country. The trans-Pacific partnership, the free trade agreement talks with India and the joint economic trade committees with Thailand and Indonesia will achieve much, although not overnight, and I commend  to the hon. Gentleman and other Eeyores here today the thought of the day in Pimlico underground station this morning:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a203.0\/5\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;The secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old but on building the new.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a203.0\/6\">Having just celebrated 10 years as the Prime Minister&#8217;s trade envoy for parts of south-east Asia, I will go on building the new: the satellites, cyber, education, life sciences and green energy partnerships and links that are good for our partners in south-east Asia&#8212;indeed, all of Asia&#8212;and for us.<\/p><p pid=\"a203.0\/7\">That leads me to the sensitive bilateral relationship that we have with China. This House has had no shortage of urgent questions on human rights in, and sometimes outside, China. We have had more debates on abuses of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang in the past two years than on human rights everywhere else in the world put together. No one here imagines that what has happened in Xinjiang or in other minority ethnic parts of China&#8212;I have seen many of these myself at first hand&#8212;would be remotely acceptable here, but what we have almost completely missed is the real human rights success in China this year, which is the near-complete reversal of the zero covid policy, and to a lesser extent in Hong Kong, where it is modestly disguised as flexible zero covid.<\/p><p pid=\"a203.0\/8\">The people of China, seeing random restrictions harshly imposed on them in the name of an impossible goal, made their feelings clear across the nation, unconsciously echoing the remark by Dr Li Wenliang, the famous Wuhan doctor, that there must be more than one voice. There are three interesting aspects to the speed of the policy U-turn: first, it shows that the Communist party of China can listen; secondly, it is good for global supply chains and growth; and thirdly, it was domestic, not international, pressure that achieved such important change.<\/p><p pid=\"a203.0\/9\">The latter aspect is the subject of a new book by Jamie Gruffydd-Jones called &#8220;Hostile Forces: How the Chinese Communist Party Resists International Pressure on Human Rights&#8221;. Jamie notes that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a203.0\/10\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;foreign pressure may raise citizens&#8217; awareness of human rights violations&#8230;or it may spark nationalist sentiments, lead to a backlash against the international community and drive support for their government&#8217;s actions.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a203.0\/11\">He highlights how, for example, changes to the death penalty in China came from the domestic outcry over the execution of Mr Nie Shubin for a rape and murder that another man subsequently admitted to. Jamie goes on to say that the CCP has, so far, been successful in ensuring a tight link between party and nation in opposing criticism on human rights from the west and, indeed, has been able to<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a203.0\/12\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;weaponise such international pressure for its own propaganda purposes&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a203.0\/13\">The reinforcement of the CCP&#8217;s depiction of US and UK pressure on human rights may be the unintended achievement of those in this House who are relentlessly focused on China&#8217;s domestic human rights abuses. This approach has not been very successful in Tibet and I wonder whether it is achieving much in Xinjiang&#8212;not because calling out human rights issues in China is wrong, but because it may be counterproductive, while missing the dramatic success for the wider human rights of the Chinese people over zero covid that was achieved without our help. This matters because in an uncertain  world we should, as western leaders rightly concluded at the Bali G20, de-escalate tensions and engage, even when engagement is difficult with major nations with very different systems, values and histories.<\/p><p pid=\"a203.0\/14\">On that note, let me come back to my Gloucester constituency. There is lots that some of my constituents may disagree with me on, but as a small city we are much more successful when we pull together for the common good. We have the country&#8217;s first ever conversion of a department store into a university teaching campus. Debenhams has been converted into a University of Gloucestershire campus, with all its health courses as well as a wellbeing centre and a relocated library. That is us at our best. That work is complemented by the work of Reef plc 100 yards away at the Forum, where a Roman statue of Venus was found under the old bus station and a huge new tech hub will sit beside Gloucester&#8217;s first four-star hotel before long.<\/p><p pid=\"a203.0\/15\">Both projects are funded by the Government&#8217;s levelling-up fund. We know levelling up when we see it because it brings pride to our city&#8212;or to different parts of the country&#8212;as will rectifying the underpass that connects these areas, under our railway station and lines, to Great Western Road and our Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. This key route for many will be improved, straightened and stripped of steps to make it much more user friendly. That work starts in the new year. There are many strands of good things being done locally and nationally that we should never forget when we criticise ourselves for not being perfect.<\/p><p pid=\"a203.0\/16\">I want to finish by thanking all those who work in the House of Commons for their great help to me, not least Mr Anam Uddin, who on two separate occasions has recovered my backpack when it has been lost&#8212;once at almost midnight. I wish him and everybody else here&#8212;all the servants of us fortunate MPs&#8212;a very happy Christmas.<\/p>",

In the face of an increasingly complex operational context, the Home Office continues to make a significant positive impact. We have faced substantial external pressures which have continued over the last three months, including the ongoing arrival of small boats and war in Ukraine. The department remains committed to delivering better outcomes for the public and continues to work to deliver a safer, fairer and more prosperous United Kingdom.<\/p><p>Following the sad death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the Home Office successfully delivered departmental responsibilities and assurance of police and security plans for Operation London Bridge from 8th-19th September 2022. Keeping the capital safe during an event on this scale - the equivalent of 160 state visits within three days &#8211; was a major achievement. This was the largest no-notice policing operation of a generation which included over 12,000 police officers deployed on the day of the state funeral.<\/p><p><strong><em>Reducing Crime<br\/> <br\/> <\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>The first job of any government is to keep its people safe, which is why we have put more police on our streets, are cutting crime and protecting the public. Over the last three months, the Home Office has worked hard to achieve these priorities. Overall crime has fallen by 10% since December 2019, equivalent to 1m fewer crimes.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Neighbourhood Crime<\/p><p>Neighbourhood crime is down 20% since December 2019, and burglary has fallen by 30% over the same time period. Since the Safer Streets Fund was established, we have awarded &#163;120 million to local projects in high-crime areas across England and Wales through four rounds of funding, supporting over 250 projects. I am pleased that the NPCC has announced that all Police chiefs in England and Wales committed in September to attend all home burglaries. An example of this in action is Operation Tenacity, which saw the Metropolitan Police attend most burglaries, resulting in 1,700 arrests in just 6 weeks during October and November this year.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Serious Violence<\/p><p>Hospital admissions for assault with a sharp object among under 25s &#8211; our primary metric for measuring serious violence - have fallen by 22% since December 2019. Our Violence Reduction Unit programme alongside targeted police enforcement activity has prevented over 49,000 violent offences since funding for the programmes began in March 2019. In addition, 260,000 vulnerable young people have been supported through Violence Reduction Units in their second year alone, and 90,000 weapons have been taken off our streets since 2019.<\/p><p>The &#8216;Grip&#8217; police enforcement programme is supporting the police to take targeted action in parts of England and Wales most affected by serious violence. Grip is helping to drive down violence by using a highly data-driven process to identify violence hotspots &#8211; often to individual street level &#8211; to target operational activity in those areas.<\/p><p>We are seeing impact in areas we are funding: for instance, hospital admissions for assault with a sharp object amongst under 25s in the Metropolitan Police Force area fell from 465 in 2020\/21 to 410 in 2021\/22.<\/p><p><strong>Drugs<br\/> <\/strong>We know that the drugs trade is at the heart of much of the homicide, serious violence and neighbourhood crime that blight our communities. Our 10-year cross-Government Drug Strategy published in December 2021 includes &#163;300 million of dedicated investment over the next three years, to drive work on tackling drug supply. <strong><br\/> <\/strong><br\/> We are breaking drug supply chains: our work to tackle the supply of drugs through county lines is already making an impact. Through the County Lines Programme since launching in 2019, Police have closed down more than 2,900 deal lines (including over 500 lines since April 2022) and made over 8,000 arrests. Dedicated specialist services are supporting children and young people and their families to escape county lines exploitation and rebuild their lives. <strong><br\/> <\/strong><br\/> Drug data from Project ADDER (Addiction, Disruption, Diversion, Enforcement and Recovery), a programme trailblazing a whole system response to combatting drug misuse, shows positive early signs. Between January 2021 and September 2022, the ADDER programme has supported over 1,600 Organised Crime Group disruptions, over 20,500 arrests, and over &#163;7m cash seized. We are also diverting people into treatment and wider support. For example, 12,400 Out of Court Disposals have been offered and over 8,000 naloxone kits distributed in the community.<\/p><p><strong><br\/> Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls<br\/> <\/strong>Between January 2021 and August 2022, a team of academics conducted sequential deep dives on the police response to rape in 5 police forces: Avon and Somerset Police, the Metropolitan Police Service, Durham Constabulary, West Midlands Police and South Wales Police. A wide range of data and information was gathered and examined during the deep dives - including reviews of case files, observations of investigations and training, focus groups with support services and victims. Following the deep dives, the forces have developed tailored improvement plans to address the findings; which has led to the roll out of Operation Soteria.<\/p><p>We continue to implement the Rape Review Action Plan, investing &#163;6.65 million in Operation Soteria to deliver the national operating model for the investigation of rape for all forces to adopt from June 2023; introducing new powers to stop unnecessary and intrusive requests for victims&#8217; phones; and continuing to work with police forces to ensure they have the capability to return victims&#8217; devices within 24 hours. In the year-ending June 2022, the police recorded 196,889 sexual offences, the highest level recorded within a 12-month period. This is a 21% increase compared to year ending March 2020.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>On 15 December, the Government published its third six monthly Rape Review Progress Update, which showed that &#8211; although there is still more to do - the Government is on track to meet its Rape Review ambition to more than double the number of adult rape cases reaching court by the end of this parliament. In the most recent data for 2022, the number of cases referred by the police to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was up 95 percent; the volume of cases charged was up by two-thirds; and the number of cases reaching the Crown Court was up 91 percent compared to 2019 averages.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We have continued to implement the Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) Strategy, the Tackling Domestic Abuse Plan, and have enshrined into law the Domestic Abuse Act 2021. We have introduced new offences relating to non-fatal strangulation, hymenoplasty and virginity testing. We have strengthened protections and support for victims of domestic abuse and the response to perpetrators through the provisions in the Domestic Abuse Act 2021. We have made the regime for managing sex offenders and those that pose a risk of sexual harm more robust through provisions in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts (PCSC) Act 2022.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In January 2020 we introduced Stalking Protection Orders to protect victims of stalking at the earliest possible opportunity; 456 orders were issued in their first year. Extensive work is also under way to launch the pilot for the new Domestic Abuse Protection Notices and Domestic Abuse Protection Orders early next year.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>On 25th October, we launched the second phase of our multimedia &#8216;Enough&#8217; national campaign which promotes safe ways for bystanders to intervene if they witness VAWG. The campaign has reached millions of individuals across England and Wales, with thousands of clicks through to organisations offering support for victims of VAWG.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation <\/strong><\/p><p>We received the final report of the independent inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse after seven years of investigation into institutional failings to properly safeguard children from this most horrific abuse. I commend the bravery of the thousands of victims and survivors for sharing their testimonies and perspectives with the inquiry. We will continue doing everything we can to combat this crime, pursue these vile offenders, bring them to justice, and ensure supports are in place for all victims and survivors to help them build their lives.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Public Order<\/strong><\/p><p>The Public Order Bill will further enhance the police&#8217;s ability to deal with disruptive protests that prevent ordinary people going about their daily lives and divert police resources from communities where they are needed most to prevent serious violence and neighbourhood crime. So far disruptive protests in London alone have taken up over 12,500 police officer shifts. The Metropolitan Police Service have made over 750 arrests since the beginning of October.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Fraud <\/strong><\/p><p>My department is launching a new fraud strategy including stepping up our response to pursuing and disrupting fraudsters, working with industry to stop frauds, and empower and support victims.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>This Government is delivering the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill which will deliver the largest reform to Companies House in recent history. It will give law enforcement and industry the tools to bear down on the use of UK companies as vehicles for economic crime, including fraud. It will also better protect personal information and addresses provided to Companies House.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We have seen the success of the National Crime Agency&#8217;s Operation AGADE where we have recovered &#163;54 million of criminal proceeds using a first of its kind Civil Recovery Order.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We have seen Operation Elaborate, the largest anti-fraud operation in the UK to date dismantling a website which was responsible for 3.5 million fraudulent calls in 2022. Involving many agencies and forces, and led by the Metropolitan Police there have been over 100 arrests made across the country so far.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong><em>Policing<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Police Uplift<br\/> <\/strong>The Police Uplift Programme continues to support forces with additional police officers, and we remain on-track to recruit 20,000 additional officers by March 2023. Data published on 30th September 2022 shows that 15,343 additional officers have already been recruited, accounting for 77% of our target. There are now 11 forces with the highest number of officers they have ever had &#8211; Cheshire, Dyfed-Powys, Essex, Kent, City of London, the Metropolitan, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, South Wales, Suffolk and Thames Valley.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The police workforce is more representative than ever before. For the first time ever, there are over 50,000 female officers (50,364), as at 30th September 2022, 34.9% of all officers in post. There were 11,477 ethnic minority officers, as at 30th September 2022, 8.2% of all officers in post the highest figures on record.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Police Performance<\/strong><\/p><p>His Majesty&#8217;s Inspectorate for Constabulary, Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) continues to shine a light on force performance. Humberside received an excellent report from their latest inspection, with six &#8220;outstanding&#8221; grades. Humberside was awarded the &#8220;outstanding&#8221; grade for preventing crime, treatment of the public, protecting vulnerable people, managing offenders, developing a positive workplace and good use of resources. It received a further two &#8220;good&#8221; grades and one &#8220;adequate&#8221; grade.<\/p><p>Greater Manchester Police (GMP) has made great strides in getting the basics right. Under strong leadership they are responding faster to emergency calls and halved the number of open investigations since 2021. HMICFRS removed GMP from their &#8220;engage&#8221; phase in October 2022. I am pleased to see GMP working so constructively with HMICFRS and others to act on their inspection findings. I encourage others to learn from their experience.<\/p><p>Six police forces remain &#8216;engaged&#8217; by HMICFRS and I expect all forces to make the necessary improvements and work towards restoring public trust and confidence in the police.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Police Culture<br\/> <\/strong>We recognise that police culture and standards need to improve to rebuild public trust and confidence. We are bringing forward part two of the Angiolini Inquiry to focus on these issues and are reviewing the process of dismissals to ensure that policing can swiftly remove officers who fall well short of the standards expected of them.<\/p><p>We have commissioned the National Police Chiefs&#8217; Council (NPCC) to conduct a review of operational productivity in policing, led by Sir Stephen House. This will address issues which may affect the anticipated outcomes from our investment in policing.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We believe that a policing career must be open to talented and committed people from across our communities, including those who do not have a degree or want one. That is why I have commissioned the College of Policing to develop options for a new non-degree entry route. The current transitional non-degree entry route will be kept open in the meantime.<\/p><p><strong><em>Reducing the risk to homeland security <\/em><\/strong><\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Home Office has continued to focus relentlessly on reducing risk across the full range of threats to our homeland security. In October, counter-terrorism police responded swiftly to an attack on a migration facility in Dover that was declared as terrorism.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>On 30th October we announced a refresh of the UK&#8217;s counter-terrorism strategy, CONTEST. This will ensure we are able to best protect the public from the enduring threat of terrorism. The refresh will maintain clarity and consistency of purpose, and ensure the necessary tools are in place to tackle terrorist hatred and violence.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Our counter-terrorism system never stops learning. Volume 2 of the Manchester Arena Inquiry was published on 3rd November 2022. This covered the emergency services&#8217; response on the night of the attack. The Government will respond fully when all three volumes have been published. However, we are already enhancing our response using the learning from the attacks &#8211; for example, in improving joint working between the emergency services - which will feed the refreshment of CONTEST. We have also received the Independent Review of Prevent, which we will look to publish next year alongside the HMG response. We will reflect the lessons and learning from the Shawcross Review, along with those from the numerous inquests, Inquiries and other reviews from recent years through the CONTEST refresh.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>I have today issued a further written ministerial statement updating on our progress developing Martyn&#8217;s Law, also known as the Protect Duty. This is a significant milestone in the development of this first of its kind piece of legislation, which will keep people safe by scaling up preparedness for, and protection from, terrorist attacks. This legislation will be introduced as soon as parliamentary time allows. This is a recommendation in Volume One of the Manchester Arena Inquiry. this duty has been tirelessly campaigned for by Figen Murray who tragically lost her son, Martyn, in the Manchester Arena attack. I would like to pay tribute to her alongside all other victims, survivors and those affected by these heinous events.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Access to data is fundamental to the investigation and prosecution of serious crimes. The UK-US Data Access Agreement entered into force on 5th October 2022. This world-first capability will fundamentally change the way we are able to fight serious crime across the UK, including terrorism, organised immigration crime, and child abuse. The Agreement permits certain UK public authorities to obtain data directly from US-based communications service providers. This will allow us to access vital data more quickly than ever before. Operational benefits are already being derived from the Agreement.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Earlier in the year, in response to Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, the Home Office delivered a transformative package of work through emergency legislation to strengthen financial sanctions legislation, creating new Register of Overseas Entities and reforming Unexplained Wealth Orders.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We are building on that work through the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill that was introduced in Parliament on 22nd September 2022. This cracks down even further on kleptocrats, criminals, and terrorists who abuse our open economy and ensures we drive out dirty money from the UK. It strengthens the UK&#8217;s reputation as a place where legitimate businesses can thrive and enhances our ability to tackle new and emerging threats like the use of crypto-assets, ransomware and the growth of cyber-enabled fraud.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The National Crime Agency&#8217;s Combatting Kleptocracy Cell is also delivering significant success, with nearly 100 disruptions against Putin-linked elites and their enablers. It has frozen over &#163;18 billion worth of assets in the UK. On 1st December 2022 it conducted a major operation to arrest a wealthy Russian businessman on suspicion of offences including money laundering, conspiracy to defraud the Home Office and conspiracy to commit perjury.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The National Security Bill, which is now at its Committee Stage in the House of Lords, represents a fundamental reform of our framework for tackling state threats. It includes a suite of new measures to tackle the full range of modern-day state threats, from sabotage and spying to foreign interference and economic espionage. It will ensure our world-class law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the modern tools, powers, and protections they need to counter those who seek to do the UK harm.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The first meeting of the new Defending Democracy Taskforce took place on 28th November 2022. The Taskforce&#8217;s primary focus will be to protect the democratic integrity of the UK from threats of foreign interference. The Taskforce will work across government and with Parliament, the UK Intelligence Community, the devolved administrations, local authorities, and the private sector on the full range of threats facing our democratic institutions.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong><em>Tackling illegal migration, removing those with no right to be here, and protecting the vulnerable <\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>This year has been challenging for our efforts to tackle illegal migration due to pressures on the system, particularly due to consistently high numbers of arrivals by small boats and pressures on available accommodation, which have been exacerbated by responding to the war in Ukraine and continued instability in Afghanistan. I will continue to protect the public and keep our borders secure and the British people safe from harm.<\/p><p>The Prime Minister recently set out a range of significant new steps the Government is taking to tackle the challenge of illegal migration including:<\/p><ul><li>A new deal with Albania and changes to our approach to speed up the removal of Albanians with no right to be here. This includes assurance from Albania that they can offer the required protection, in line with our international obligations, to genuine victims of modern slavery, embedding Border Force officers in Tirana Airport, increasing the threshold for people referred to the modern slavery system, establishing a unit to expedite Albanian claims with 400 specialist staff and new country guidance for our caseworkers making it clear that Albania is a safe country.<\/li><li>Establishing a new, permanent unified Small Boats Operational Command with 700 additional dedicated staff to deliver a more coordinated response to tackling crossings, bringing together military, civilian and NCA expertise to coordinate our intelligence, interception, processing, and enforcement.<\/li><li>Clearing the initial asylum decision backlog of legacy cases by the end of next year. We will make an initial decision in all cases that have been outstanding since before 28th June 2022<\/li><li>Plans to bring forward legislation next year to prevent abuse of our legal framework which will make it unambiguously clear that people entering illegally should have no right to stay here, and will be returned to their home country or a safe country for their asylum claim to be considered<\/li><li>Due to the unprecedented number of small boat arrivals and the pressure from COVID-19 on the asylum system it has been necessary to use hotels to accommodate some asylum seekers. This is only ever a short-term solution and we are working with our accommodation providers to find appropriate dispersed accommodation across the UK.<\/li><\/ul><p>The new UK-French agreement I agreed with my counterpart lays the foundations for deeper co-operation to tackle illegal migration and marks the next step for the close operational partnership between the two countries which has prevented over 31,500 crossings, nearly 50% more than to this point in 2021.<\/p><p>The arrangement means, for the first time, specialist UK officers will also be embedded with their French counterparts, which will increase information-sharing, improve understanding of the threat, and ensure UK expertise is at the heart of efforts to disrupt crossings and clamp down on people-smugglers. This more integrated approach will also include strengthened operational co-operation, including joint UK-France analysis teams supporting the co-ordination and exchange of information by French-command HQ. We have signed the biggest small boats joint bilateral deal with France, we have put the Calais group on a permanent footing showing the importance of this issue to our European partners and we have agreed new levels of intelligence co-operation with our European neighbours.<\/p><p>These measures build on the progress we have made through the year. We have introduced Part 5 of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022, which provides legislative clarity to victims and decision-makers on victims&#8217; rights, including the entitlement to a recovery period and the circumstances in which it may be withheld.<\/p><p>We continue to return foreign national offenders (FNOs) by scheduled and charter flights. From January 2019 to March 2022, we have removed 11,532 FNOs. Since April 2020, we have chartered 156 flights to Europe and around the World. In the year ending June 2022, there were 3,250 enforced returns, of which 1,600 were to EU countries.<\/p><p><strong>Safe and Legal Routes<\/strong><\/p><p>We have continued to support those fleeing conflicts abroad, granting Indefinite Leave to Remain to over 11,300 individuals from Afghanistan under ARAP or ACRS Pathway 1.<\/p><p>As of 24th November, 202,710 visas have been granted and 146,222 have arrived in the UK from Ukraine. 59,480 have been granted and 41,093 people have arrived under the Ukraine Family Scheme. 143,230 visas have been granted and 105,129 arrived under the Homes for Ukraine scheme<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Through the Hong Kong British National Overseas route, there have been a total of 150,600 applications since its introduction on 31st January 2021 up to the end of September 2022 of which there were 144,576 grants (96%).<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong><em>Enabling the legitimate movement of people and goods <\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>Passports are about to enter the busy period in January, and plans are well advanced in preparation for that and for a high level of demand forecast across 2023. There was record demand for passport applications this year &#8211; with approximately 7.4 million applications processed by the end of October. Service standards have remained high since November and 99.9% of UK standard applications were completed within the 10-week service standard in the week ending 20th November. Every effort is being made to return to the three-week service standard.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The visa service has faced significant demands post-pandemic and following Ukraine and higher than forecast levels of demand. Considering this, it is performing well under pressure, and through supportive contingency measures, standard applications have returned to service standards and we are on track for complex applications to also return to service standards in December.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Despite these challenges staff productivity has remained high, and we continue to manage staff flexibly across services to reduce work in progress to minimal levels for passport and deliver the visa recovery by the year end.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Border Force have seen passenger numbers increase to near pre-pandemic levels by the end of summer and also managed the introduction of post EU exit goods checks and the first full year of EU citizens requiring passports and additional checks. eGates have performed well and IT resilience has been strong enabling over 90% of passengers to cross borders within tolerance levels.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Border Force also reached its annual Target for Cigarette and Tobacco seizures within 7 months of 2022-23\/ In October, &#163;35 million in cigarettes and tobacco were seized bringing the YTD total to &#163;255 million (101%) of the annual target of &#163;252 million. On alcohol, Border Force seized &#163;4.3 million, bringing the YTD total to &#163;25.1 million (63%) of the annual target of &#163;40 million.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The FBIS programme has built-up the expertise and capability to reduce significantly the time taken to launch a brand-new visa route or to amend criteria for existing visa applications.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We have made significant progress in digitising the immigration system. We are increasingly replacing physical and paper-based products and services with accessible, easy to use online and digital services. This has provided applicants with an easy online application process, including providing biometrics and establishing or verifying identity using their smartphones. A fully digital application process has been delivered for the BN(O) route and some points-based system routes and now for Ukraine schemes.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>All these achievements have been delivered against a challenging background and represent a significant effort across the Home Office in continuing to deliver on the people&#8217;s priorities.

            "body": "<p pid=\"a699.0\/1\">My Lords, I thank the noble Lord and the noble Baroness opposite for their comments. Amid all the criticisms and expressions of disappointment at things that have happened so far, there was a sort of implied acceptance, perhaps with a mild element of doubt from the noble Lord, Lord Newby, of the Government and, mostly notably, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, who, I can say from the closest possible quarters, from the moment he became Prime Minister has personally gripped this issue and gripped it in a way that is in line with his characteristic, compassionate, competent and clear-headed approach. I can say from the closest possible quarters.<\/p><p pid=\"a699.0\/2\">It is easy to throw criticisms. I could say, perhaps, that the other parties have not been as supportive of some of the measures that Governments have tried to take in the past. However, what we need to do now&#8212;and, frankly, I think that the public expects this&#8212;is to address the abuses that are going on. The noble Baroness was quite right to stress the bestial nature of the organised crime involved in this. I am grateful for what she said about the terrible events in the channel last night, when, at three o&#8217;clock in the morning, authorities were alerted to an incident concerning a small boat in distress. After a co-ordinated search and rescue operation, as many noble Lords will know, led by HM Coastguard, it is a great regret that there have been four confirmed deaths so far. Investigations are ongoing, and we will provide further information in due course. I agree with the noble Baroness that this was a truly tragic incident, and our thoughts are with the friends and families of all those who have lost their lives. I join the noble Baroness in expressing our utmost sadness and heartfelt sympathy to them, as well as paying tribute to the agencies dedicated to saving lives at sea. Day in and day out, Coastguard, RNLI, Border Force&#8212;all those involved&#8212;work with unsung dedication, seeking to save the lives of people put in peril not by this Government or any other Government but by ruthless, organised criminality.<\/p><p pid=\"a699.0\/3\">I was asked a large number of questions; I do not think I will be able to answer all of them in the time allowed, but clearly we will seek to respond in detail to anything that was not answered.<\/p><p pid=\"a699.0\/4\">The noble Baroness was a bit disparaging about the Rwanda partnership, as was the noble Lord, Lord Newby. The Government&#8217;s intention is to make our migration and economic development partnership with Rwanda work, so that, yes, we can send people who make dangerous, illegal and unnecessary journeys to the UK to a safe third country. That will allow us to remove many people who travel to the UK illegally. We are continuing to plan for this policy, but of course there is pending ongoing litigation in the courts. We are expecting a judgment from the High Court shortly, and fully believe that the courts will find the policies legal, and that claimants can be removed to Rwanda without breaching our international treaties.<\/p><p pid=\"a699.0\/5\">On numbers and clearing the backlog, I do not believe it right to say, as the noble Baroness did, that there was a sudden change in policy. It was perhaps not fully understood. It was made very clear in the briefing I have that, with regard to the pledge and intention to clear the backlog of those who came into the process before <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-06-28\">28 June<\/phrase> 2022, there was an absolute commitment to get it completed by the end of next year. That date is chosen because that is the point where we change the system through the Nationality and Borders Act to reform how we process cases. Obviously, work will continue on the continuing flow to see that it is cleared. It is true that, as of September, there were 117,000 outstanding initial asylum decisions.<\/p><p pid=\"a699.0\/6\">I welcome the support for extra staff. I have the Home Office Minister sitting alongside me, and I am sure he will have heard what has been said about the need to provide proper and full training. The new small boats organisation will bring together military and civilian institutions in a single operation. We believe that will provide greater coherence, and work towards that is under way. I shall have to write to the noble Baroness about the particular issue on safeguarding children, although, again, my noble friend from the Home Office will have heard that.<\/p><p pid=\"a699.0\/7\">On legislation, which the noble Baroness also asked about, as the Prime Minister said, the intention is to introduce legislation next year. The Prime Minister indicated some of the core objectives of that legislation, which would mean that those who entered this country illegally could not expect to remain. However, these matters are still under consideration and proposals will be laid before your Lordships, I hope at an early date. I am not giving any commitment as to when it will be, but there will be legislation, as the Prime Minister said yesterday.<\/p><p pid=\"a699.0\/8\">I was asked about modern slavery by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, who were both kind enough to refer to the fact that my right honourable friend Theresa May pioneered the action in this area. Modern slavery is a problem; it remains an issue, and the Government are determined to tackle it and deal with it. As for gold-plating, there are aspects of the decisions made in relation to modern slavery that will be considered, such as the evidential basis and points where there has been clear evidence of modern slavery. I may not be using the correct words, but the core process or structure of the legislation is not affected.<\/p><p pid=\"a699.0\/9\">On safe routes, I agree profoundly with what the noble Baroness and the noble Lord said. The Prime Minister made it very clear that, while being firm on illegal immigration, we wish to maintain safe and legal routes. That is a matter of ongoing consideration. In fact, by cracking down on illegal immigration, we will be able to be more generous with those who really need our help, and we will introduce new safe and legal routes for those at risk of war and persecution to come and seek refuge and protection in the United Kingdom. We will consult on the cap or quota, which has been referred to, for those coming through our safe and legal routes, and on how the cap will be decided, incorporating lessons from what we have done in great community partnership through Homes for Ukraine.<\/p><p pid=\"a699.0\/10\">We should not forget that the United Kingdom has been extraordinarily generous&#8212;the most generous in recent political history. We have a proud history of supporting those fleeing persecution. Since 2015, we have resettled 450,000 vulnerable people here, including 144,000 from Hong Kong, 20,000 from Syria, approximately 20,000 from Afghanistan and around 150,000 Ukrainians. We will continue that compassionate stance towards others.<\/p><p pid=\"a699.0\/11\">I was asked about accommodation. This is obviously the subject of ongoing discussion. The Prime Minister gave some indication, and it was referred to, that we will look for different approaches and different methods of doing it. We are spending &#163;5.6 million a day&#8212; &#163;6.5 million if you include Afghan refugees&#8212;on accommodation. We are accommodating 112,000 people at the moment, and I think it reasonable that consideration be given to alternative sites, particularly for those under discussion in this Statement. That is what we will do and as we consult and decide, further information will be given to your Lordships.<\/p><p pid=\"a699.0\/12\">Against the background of the generosity I have described, I do not think the hostile environment mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Newby, is correct. It is true that we have learned lessons from the Windrush scheme and what happened in relation to Windrush, but we believe it to be reasonable that bank data and other data should be used and considered to identify illegals.<\/p><p pid=\"a699.0\/13\">I was obviously asked specifically about Albania, which has been the centre of discussion; indeed, it is very well known that large numbers of Albanians are coming in. I would like to say how grateful we are to the Government of Albania for their support; I think that is the fruit of our good diplomatic outreach on these matters. The deal gives us assurances that we will be able to return alleged victims of modern slavery safely to Albania. They will be provided with protection and support in accordance with obligations under ECAT.<\/p><p pid=\"a699.0\/14\">There is a dedicated processing task force. We believe Albania is a safe country, and 100% of Albanian applications are rejected by those vicious nations Germany and Sweden. Germany and Sweden are liberal nations and reject 100%; we reject only 44.6%. I think it perfectly reasonable that, with the co-operation of the Albanian Government, we take action to address this problem, which, like many others involved, has grown, changed and morphed, and the Government are responding to it.<\/p>",

The reality is, as it has always been, that while safe and legal routes do not exist, and while people wait years for applications for family reunions, desperate people will continue to take life-threatening journeys, because they feel that they have no choice. The Nationality and Borders Act 2022, despite the rhetoric, has not proven to be the deterrent that the Home Secretary expected. Will she finally recognise that safe and legal routes are essential to allow people to get here safely, and that they should be expanded now, beyond the limited Afghan, Syrian, Hong Kong and Ukraine routes, not at some vague point in the future?<\/p><p pid=\"c1119.1\/4\">If the Home Secretary truly wants to break the lucrative model of organised crime behind this, she should bring in Dubs and Dublin-style routes and allow people to apply from abroad and get on a plane rather than forcing them to get in a flimsy dinghy in the depths of winter. It is cruel to ignore the reality, and dangerous to keep repeating the same mistakes. People are paying not only with money, but with their lives. Will she listen to the evidence, and, instead of just talking tough, act to bring in safe and legal routes for everybody now, because sympathy is one thing, effective action another.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a596.2\/1\">I am delighted to move Amendment 117 and very grateful to be standing alongside the noble Baronesses, Lady Chakrabarti and Lady Jones of Moulsecoomb, and the noble Lord, Lord Paddick. I will also speak to the revised Amendment 127A in my name and that of the noble Baroness, Lady Chakrabarti. I thank the lawyers at Justice for their technical help with this speech, particularly Tyrone Steele.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/2\">These amendments seek to grant fuller protections to all those covering protests and reporting on the exercise of police powers in that context. I am completely confident that all noble Lords recognise the vital importance of journalists, legal observers and indeed the general public in being able to observe, report on and scrutinise what happens at protests and the actions of not only the protesters but, possibly, the police.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/3\">As many noble Lords will know, I have deep and vested interests in these amendments. I became a journalist more or less by accident at the age of 19. My first piece was on the left-handed shop in Beak Street for Time Out and was all of 189 words long. It was hardly earth shattering, but it did tell left-handed people where to buy a pair of scissors.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/4\">Trying to report stories and find out things that many people do not want known has been the whole obsession of my life. My second and third jobs were on an alternative newspaper and then on Spare Rib. Indeed, my second-ever piece was a report on an anti-Vietnam demonstration in the capital. I can confess quite freely that I was totally terrified to be in the middle of that demonstration, but I was not displeased to be part of it and I was very pleased to be able to go back and write about it. On Spare Rib we both marched and wrote about marching. We protested for equal pay, rights to abortion and rights to childcare, but we reported it; we were allowed to be there and to write about it.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/5\">In my long journalistic career, I have edited many magazines and written for more. I have edited three national newspapers and, again, written for many more. I have publicised protests, including many that I vehemently do not agree with, because they are not only important events; they are about people doing something that matters a great deal to them and worth taking to the streets for&#8212;or even trying to climb Nelson&#8217;s Column. People are on the streets because they do not know what else to do to make their voice heard and they have exhausted such routes as writing letters to MPs, Members of the House of Lords or, indeed, newspapers such as mine.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/6\">I have also sent reporters to countries where repressive regimes lock up journalists who are covering protests&#8212;think of the Arab spring, Myanmar and Hong Kong. As my friend and mentor, the late war reporter Martha Gellhorn, said, journalism is about bearing witness. We go to bring back the news, whether it is happening on the streets of Cairo or on the M25, to tell all of us, through words, images and sounds, what we have seen, what people are doing and what they care about. Journalists risk life and limb to do so. But, over my half-century in this profession, I have always believed that, at least in this country, we were able to go to a demonstration and then go back to our office and write about it. I also knew that, if a protest got too out of hand, plenty of laws were in place to deal with this&#8212;but never was a journalist told that they could not report on a story.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/7\">The arrest of Charlotte Lynch, the woman from LBC held for five hours for reporting on a Just Stop Oil protest &#8212;more about her later&#8212;has been referred to many times in this debate, but her story is extremely important. For me, it was as though one of the pillars of our democratic society had been kicked out from under my feet. She was held in a cell for five hours for reporting on a protest. It was peaceful, however bloody annoying people might find Just Stop Oil. Quite frankly, if a protest does not annoy someone, what is the point of it?<\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/8\">Sadly, I was wrong: this was not the first, and there had been previous attempts to curtail the reporting of protests. At 3.40 am on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-11-30\">30 November<\/phrase> 1983, during strikes at the Messenger printers in Warrington, the police demanded that the television crews covering the dispute turned off the lights. After they complied, the police proceeded to charge at the picketers under the cover of darkness. In the words of Colin Bourne, the NUJ&#8217;s northern organiser,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a596.2\/9\">&#8220;police were running up to them and kicking them and hitting them with their batons&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/10\">It was reported that two police Range Rovers drove into the pickets. Today, with the vast majority of the public possessing smartphones equipped with high-quality cameras, it is thankfully much harder for abuse like that to go uncovered.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/11\">Last year, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport held a call for evidence on journalists&#8217; safety, and there were masses of respondents. One said that the police themselves contributed to threats or abuse towards journalists, which included physically restricting access to spaces and arresting journalists. As I said, many noble Lords have referred to Charlotte Lynch, who was arrested while reporting on Just Stop Oil.  But, that very same day, two others, Rich Felgate and Tom Bowles, were also detained. Again, they peacefully asserted their status as journalists&#8212;they had press cards&#8212;but they were held for 13 hours.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/12\">Back in August, another journalist, Peter Macdiarmid, was also arrested and taken in a police van to Redhill police station. He has notably covered several historic, monumental events, such as the Arab spring, refugees fleeing Iraq during the first Gulf War, Black Lives Matter and the London riots. The award-winning reporter told the Evening Standard:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a596.2\/13\">&#8220;It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve been in cuffs in the 35 years I have covered protests.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/14\">Something is fundamentally wrong with our justice system if police feel so empowered, under the vast array of existing legislation, to arrest and detain journalists first and ask the questions&#8212;or worse&#8212;later, ignoring the fact that they are from the press. Last week, the Minister said that the issue lies with the training of the police. I am afraid that that is an inadequate solution for the current situation, and it is no remedy for what the Government propose, in terms of expanding the powers in the Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/15\">The Bill contains a vast array of measures that could severely and detrimentally impact journalists just doing their jobs. The offence of being &#8220;equipped for locking on&#8221; is so broad in its ingredients that an individual would only have to be carrying an object with the intention that it may be used. Taking a photo of someone who is locking on could inadvertently fall foul of this because the camera could feasibly constitute such an object.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/16\">Journalists are no safer with respect to offences covering the obstruction of &#8220;key national infrastructure&#8221; and &#8220;transport works&#8221; or<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a596.2\/17\">&#8220;causing serious disruption by being present in a tunnel&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/18\">On the latter, the BBC has reported from the tunnelling sites and even filmed the equipment and protesters inside the tunnels dug to disrupt the construction of HS2. The offence is engaged if you are &#8220;reckless&#8221; as to whether your presence will have the consequence of causing serious disruption.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/19\">Moreover, there is no explicit exemption for journalists. The only protection is the reasonable excuse. But as the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, said in Committee, since a defence is available only after arrest, journalists<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a596.2\/20\">&#8220;are still faced with the possibility of being arrested and detained for five hours by the police &#8230; It seems an onerous experience for a completely innocent person to go through&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class=\"offrep\" id=\", 16\/11\/22; col. 948.]\"><i>Official Report<\/i>, 16\/11\/22; col. 948.]<\/phrase><\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/21\">The proposed, highly expansive stop and search powers would also offer journalists no relief from obstruction in performing their work. An officer who reasonably believes that an individual is carrying a prohibited object can conduct a suspicionless search. What worries me is the number of things&#8212;cameras, clipboards, microphones &#8212;that could conceivably constitute a prohibited object for use in connection with a protest. This would stifle the legitimate work of journalists and observers who monitor police powers.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/22\">Finally, I should mention the most invidious new tool that the Bill proposes&#8212;that of serious disruption prevention orders, which many have dubbed the protest  banning orders. Under Clause 20, the police could apply to a magistrates&#8217; court to impose one of these orders on an individual without a conviction, including journalists, where they have, on two occasions in the past, I hear, merely<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a596.2\/23\">&#8220;contributed to the carrying out by any other person of activities related to a protest that resulted in, or were likely to result in, serious disruption to two or more individuals&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/24\">A court could use the civil standard of proof, and if a journalist has been to cover a protest, they will inevitably have racked up more than two events in five years. They might rack up two events in a week at the moment. If a journalist covers a protest, it is foreseeable that this coverage itself could contribute to protest-related activities. If imposed, a protest banning order could last for up to two years, be renewed and result in journalists being banned from attending protests, restrictions on their internet usage, potential ankle-tagging and, of course, if in breach, imprisonment.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/25\">We have established two important truths. First, the existing legal framework does not adequately protect journalists and others observing protests from spurious or speculative arrest. Secondly, the Bill&#8217;s new offences and powers would make the situation all the more perilous. So I urge the Government to support this amendment, which would protect journalists, legal observers, academics and bystanders. Without this clause, this Bill could lead to a further increase in the arrests of those who cover or happen upon live protest sites. The enormous chilling effect on reporters and observers as a whole, who may consequently be afraid to continue their work, cannot be discounted. This is because there is no explicit provision in the Bill where existing legislation protects them prior to arrest. A reasonable excuse defence, absent from protest banning orders and available with respect to the other offences only once the individual has been arrested and detained and charged, simply does not cut it.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.2\/26\">I strongly urge the Government to accept this amendment, which provides holistic protections to ensure that journalists, observers and bystanders continue to have access to protest sites in order to report on what happens and to monitor police powers. It is an essential part of our democracy. I beg to move.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a421.0\/1\">My Lords, I am grateful to the most reverend Primate for this debate, which follows neatly from last year&#8217;s debate, which was on  freedom of speech. We had a terrible period in the last decade of repression of free speech on this issue. You could not talk about immigration or asylum, as it was synonymous with being racist. For the overwhelming majority, of course, it was not&#8212;it was more to do with pressure on school places, GP appointments pre pandemic, housing and depressed wages affecting ordinary working folk at that time, who are and were then affected much more so by these issues than the middle classes. I wholeheartedly welcome the recognition of this by the most reverend Primate, which is a change of position in the leadership of the Church of England. Sadly, in the run-up to the 2016 referendum, it did not champion those communities, barring of course some comments from the Bishop of Burnley.<\/p><p pid=\"a421.0\/2\">I count myself in the only-blessed-by-migration category. I glanced at my Christmas gift spreadsheet, which includes British Nigerians, British Trinidadians, British Singapore Chinese and Hong Kong Chinese, British Eritreans and Syrians. The latter two families have educated me on the issues of asylum, and I am very grateful&#8212;but I hope briefly just to make some ordinary people points. It is unclear to the ordinary person, why thousands of Albanians are claiming asylum in the UK. Despite the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, what are they fleeing? It may just be a communication issue, but it needs addressing, as do the fears that the landmark modern slavery legislation is being misused.<\/p><p pid=\"a421.0\/3\">As His Majesty&#8217;s loyal Opposition have, as of yesterday, joined His Majesty&#8217;s Government in saying that we should fast-track claims where a claim is manifestly unfounded, could my noble friend the Minister please confirm that the only matter therefore left in dispute is whether you can designate a whole country for such consideration and still comply with the 1951 convention? I hope that the most reverend Primate is right that we can introduce something akin to striking out a claim, as happens in the civil courts when there is no reasonable prospect of a claim, but I would be interested to know whether the most reverend Primate and my noble friend have any view on what appeal rights would or would not be appropriate. Laudable aims could be strangled by necessary judicial procedures.<\/p><p pid=\"a421.0\/4\">As a lawyer, I enjoyed reading the UNHCR document Legal considerations regarding claims for international protection made in the context of the adverse effects of climate change and disasters. It is hard to understand why, if your territory disappears&#8212;literally as could happen to the Maldives or the Pacific island states&#8212;you are not automatically a refugee. Then there are convoluted arguments like this one: you are a victim of a flood caused by climate change, but you are also part of a religious group that was not given aid by your Government, so you had to flee your borders and you needed refuge. Arguments such as this will take up valuable time and money when these kinds of claims reach our tribunals. Is it not time for a separate convention, in addition to the refugee convention, on the issue of refugees due to climate change, rather than straining the interpretation of the 1951 treaty? I am interested in my noble friend the Minister&#8217;s view on this, but I also caution the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown, and the most reverend Primate on reopening  the treaty itself, unless there is a guarantee of the same post-Second World War consensus on this, which I very much doubt.<\/p><p pid=\"a421.0\/5\">To turn to Ukraine, we are rightly proud of our response to this crisis. I think there are over 125,000 people here, but they are not refugees&#8212;it is that fudged legal distinction again, as with Hong Kong migration. Under the Ukraine family scheme there was a very broad definition of family members who could join you if you were already in the UK: a niece, nephew, cousin, mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and even a grandparent-in-law.<\/p><p pid=\"a421.0\/6\">On this issue, I would like my noble friend&#8217;s assurance that the Home Office is proactive and meets with the FCDO about areas of geographical instability. I think I am correct in saying that, mercifully, there have been only sporadic conflicts in nations where British citizens have heritage, such as the recent conflict in Ethiopia and Eritrea. But that might change in February of next year. We all hope and pray&#8212;I am sure the most reverend Primate is praying&#8212;for successful Nigerian elections and that the nation holds together, but there are serious concerns. The Yoruba tribe in the west has already petitioned the United Nations to supervise a referendum to split, and it is said that the Igbo of the 1960s Biafran separatist war look to do the same. Rarely are such matters settled peacefully. This is a nation of&#8212;in conservative estimates&#8212;250 million people, many with family in the UK. Those British citizens with Nigerian heritage might rightly expect the same generous definition of family ties under the Ukrainian scheme to apply to Nigeria. Can my noble friend assure me that the Home Office is considering policy for this kind of eventuality, and is thinking through all the eventualities to ensure that our policy&#8212;should the worst happen&#8212;is racially just?<\/p><p pid=\"a421.0\/7\">Finally, on reading many reports for this debate, I am concerned that we are repeating the mistakes of the past&#8212;I note the comments made by my noble friend Lady Stowell. While residents in the UK, especially ordinary working people, are not fleeing for their lives, they are deeply affected by these issues&#8212;more than most of us here in your Lordships&#8217; House. If we forget ordinary working folk again, I fear that we will not build a home together, as the late Lord Sacks so wisely advised us to do, and we may not have a referendum on the issue as a necessary release valve.<\/p>",

We heard about the case of Hong Kong human rights lawyer and activist Chow Hang-tung, who is serving 22 months in prison for daring to encourage people on social media to light candles to commemorate those who lost their lives in the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989. We heard about the case of Dorgelesse Nguessan, a hairdresser from Cameroon who was arrested on her first ever protest in September 2020 for voicing her concerns about the Cameroonian Government&#8217;s handling of the economy. Her peaceful protest resulted in her arrest and charges of insurrection, assembly, meetings and public demonstration, which resulted in a five-year sentence. My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Chris Bryant\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10761\">the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)<\/phrase> highlighted the other two cases: that of the Russian artist Sasha Skochilenko, who was arrested and is being held without charge for protesting Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, and that of the Cuban artist Luis Manuel Otero Alc&#225;ntara, who was arrested for posting that he wanted to attend a big demonstration in Cuba.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>Around the world there are, sadly, still so many examples of human rights abuses and violations happening every single day. Today, I will speak about just three places where we know human rights are under threat.<\/p><p>Just last week, we heard of the illegal arrest and assault in China of a BBC journalist who was in Shanghai to cover a protest. That is a shocking example of what can happen in China, but unfortunately it is nowhere near the worst of what has happened in recent years, as the country has slid further towards disgraceful restrictions on fundamental rights and freedoms.<\/p><p>The suppression of democratic protests in Hong Kong was atrocious. The state was determined to exert a depressing show of force against normal people who bravely took to the streets to speak up for their own rights. The treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang has been despicable. We still cannot know the full extent of the evil acts that have taken place, but from what we know, there is more and more evidence of genocide.<\/p><p>I hope that every member in the chamber can support the Prime Minister&#8217;s recent statement in which he said:<\/p><p>&#8220;China poses a systemic challenge to our values and interests, a challenge that grows more acute as it moves towards even greater authoritarianism.&#8221;<\/p><p>We are also seeing, in what is happening in Ukraine, the tragic reality of a country that is controlled by a dictatorship. Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine has brought the horror of war back to Europe for the first time in years. We have seen that Vladimir Putin&#8217;s army has, in town after town, committed horrendous acts against local civilian populations. No matter how much Russia tries to deny it and deflect from it, the reality is a litany of appalling human rights abuses.<\/p><p>I turn to Iran. I commend the immense bravery of the people there, especially the women who have decided that enough is enough and that they will no longer tolerate the systemic discrimination that they have faced. Violence against women and girls is a problem everywhere, but in Iran it has been state sponsored for decades. It is inspiring and upsetting in equal measure to see so many women risk their lives in the name of freedom.<\/p><p>Today&#8217;s debate is supposed to be on all human rights abuses and the people who strive to defend human rights globally. It is supposed to be a debate in which the Scottish Parliament unites as one to reaffirm our commitment to the universal and inalienable rights and freedoms in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is supposed to be a debate about international human rights days.<\/p><p>However, the SNP Government has decided that making a political attack at home is more important. It has decided that provoking grievance on these shores is better use of our time. It opted to use its motion for the debate to criticise the UK Government without foundation. Its playing constitutional politics with an issue such as this shows what the Government is about. For this Government, everything is a reason to increase division and provoke grievance&#8212;even international human rights day.<\/p><p>If the SNP wants to make the debate about issues that are closer to home, I suggest that it makes it about the vital issues right here in Scotland.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"d444.0\/1\">I thank Members from all parts of the House who have spoken today for their valued and often very informative and sometimes passionate contributions. I sense a tone of disappointment in <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Tulip Siddiq\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25344\">the hon. Member for Hampstead and Kilburn (Tulip Siddiq)<\/phrase>, my shadow on the Opposition Front Bench. I will try to endeavour not to disappoint her in return for her party&#8217;s support for this important and landmark Bill. I spoke at length in my opening remarks. I hope I was generous in taking interventions, and perhaps colleagues will indulge me if I try to get through this as quickly as possible.<\/p><p pid=\"d444.0\/2\">We heard from my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Vicky Ford\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25614\">the Member for Chelmsford (Vicky Ford)<\/phrase>, my predecessor, who contributed so much to this Bill. We also heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Richard Fuller\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24787\">the Member for North East Bedfordshire (Richard Fuller)<\/phrase> and from my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Craig Tracey\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25290\">the Member for North Warwickshire (Craig Tracey)<\/phrase>, who served on the Bill Committee. They all spoke to a greater or lesser degree in support of new clause 17 and about how we can make that better and better hold the regulators to account.<\/p><p pid=\"d444.0\/3\">We heard about the specific metrics suggested in new clauses 12, 13, 14 and 15&#8212;my hon. and right hon. Friends are very productive. I can say that I will consider things very carefully. In those amendments, they gave specific examples of how we could potentially deploy the powers in new clause 17, and I undertake to consider carefully whether those are the right way forward. We heard from my right hon. Friend the Member for Chelmsford about that sense of urgency, and we got that again in new clause 11. Again, it is potentially a good way forward that I would like to consider.<\/p><p pid=\"d444.0\/4\">We all understand that it comes down to financial inclusion, for which <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Emma Hardy\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25646\">the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Emma Hardy)<\/phrase> rightly never fails to agitate. If, however, the consequences of our financial regulation exclude, as I think we heard, 92% of people from getting basic guidance on the sorts of products that are right for them, that is a problem for inclusion and for the industry. It is something that I was asked to take away with due urgency, and I commit that once we have the Bill on the statute book that is absolutely what I will do. Technology can be our friend there as well. We heard that from my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Harriett Baldwin\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24785\">the Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin)<\/phrase>, the Chair of the Treasury Committee.<\/p><p pid=\"d444.0\/5\">Hon. Members on both sides of the House are wrestling with what to give to the financial regulators, in a sector that touches the lives of so many individuals and so many facets of human behaviour, and how to manage the process of repatriating those rules from the unaccountable European Commission, which my friend, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Peter Grant\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25273\">the hon. Member for Glenrothes (Peter Grant)<\/phrase>, the spokesman for the SNP, is so anxious that we do not diverge or derogate from, so as to ease our passage immediately back into that unaccountable world.<\/p><p pid=\"d444.0\/6\">We heard contributions from my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Geoffrey Clifton-Brown\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10119\">the Member for The Cotswolds (Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown)<\/phrase> and <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Nick Smith\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24728\">the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Nick Smith)<\/phrase> on the work, and frankly the challenges, that hon. Members have faced in the case of the British Steel pension fund, trying to get redress and to speak up for their constituents in the face of regulators that&#8212;whether this was real or imagined&#8212;they certainly felt were unaccountable to this place. They had to use the mechanisms of the Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office. I have taken away how we can improve the parliamentary scrutiny in the way that both hon. Members sought. We heard about that big issue again from <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Sarah Olney\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25596\">the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Sarah Olney)<\/phrase>. It would be cheap to suggest that going back into the EU would remove the parliamentary accountability that she seeks, but nevertheless we are all pushing, in many ways, at the same thing.<\/p><p pid=\"d444.0\/7\">We rightly spent a lot of time talking about access to cash. We heard significant contributions from <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Siobhain McDonagh\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10381\">the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh)<\/phrase>. I still look forward to visiting her new LINK ATM cash machine as part of the industry-led initiative. I am now as keen to see it as she and her constituents no doubt are&#8212;I hope that can be an early 2023 commitment. My right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"David Mundell\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11970\">the Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell)<\/phrase> also talked with great passion, and his knowledge from campaigning on the issue. He spoke about 8 million households. It is absolutely the position of the Government that this is a problem, and there is a firm expectation on the industry to help us address it.<\/p><p pid=\"d444.0\/8\">We must not underestimate the significance of the legislative action that we are taking in the Bill, putting an access to cash obligation on the regulators for the first time. I have made very clear my expectation of what that will look like, as well as the consequences if the regulators, together with the industry voluntary sector, do not solve the issue for us. The Government will achieve that by means of the statement that will set out our position on matters such as cost and location.<\/p><p pid=\"d444.0\/9\">Although I understand the desire behind new clause 7, and its superficial attractiveness to many in this House, we need to be wary of unintended consequences. It is not as simple as just inserting the word &#8220;free&#8221;. There are a number of initiatives in this space already, and I do not want them to be prejudiced by artificially rushing to statute. The Government will therefore not support new clause 7, but we will continue to work to ensure that we protect our constituents on this issue.<\/p><p pid=\"d444.0\/10\">We are protecting our planet as well. My right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Chris Grayling\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10920\">the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)<\/phrase> talked, on this day of the biodiversity summit in Montreal, about the deforestation crisis and the need for financial providers to do due diligence on where their money is going. That is of course absolutely right. It is what we  expect from good stewardship. He was kind enough also to talk about some of the challenges, in that financial providers do not always know directly or indirectly where their capital ends up. I will continue to work with him.<\/p><p pid=\"d444.0\/11\">The Government have supported the taskforce on nature-related financial disclosures. We are a big backer of that taskforce, which we have given &#163;3 million of funding, and its work continues in the first half of 2023. In parallel with that, we will consider bringing those standards into the disclosure framework as they develop; I hope to continue to work with my right hon. Friend on that.<\/p><p pid=\"d444.0\/12\">I was clear in my opening speech about the importance of freedom of speech and expression. We heard passionate contributions from my hon. Friends the Members for Hastings and Rye (Sally-Ann Hart), who has done so much work on the issue, and for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Miriam Cates), who first brought the Free Speech Union and the issue to my attention. I am disturbed to learn of other cases. As I said, we commit to consult on that, to look at whether there is a more systemic problem and to consider what the right legislative solutions could be.<\/p><p pid=\"d444.0\/13\">The hon. Member for Hampstead and Kilburn talked about the climate and our position on green and sustainable finance&#8212;I do not fully accept what she said about us not being a leader. That is our objective and I will do everything I can to continue what I regard as London&#8217;s lead on that. We have exchanged various documents about it and she does not quite agree with my interpretation, but we are pushing in exactly the same direction.<\/p><p pid=\"d444.0\/14\">We will introduce new sustainability disclosure requirements, on which the FCA is consulting. We are introducing transition planning requirements to move to the clean, green future that we all seek as we move into the clean, low-carbon economy. Last September we launched the green financing programme with a record-breaking debut sovereign green bond, and I hope the Opposition support that initiative. Subsequently, that programme has raised &#163;22 billion of green finance to finance the green transition. London is a leading hub, with issuances totalling more than &#163;10 billion from worldwide issuers, including Chile, Egypt, Mexico, Hong Kong and Fiji.<\/p><p pid=\"d444.0\/15\">We have heard a lot about fraud, on which the hon. Lady has tabled an amendment. I reassure hon. Members that the Government take that important issue extremely seriously. We are dedicated to protecting the public from that devastating and sadly growing crime. Tackling fraud requires a unified and co-ordinated approach across Government, law enforcement and the private sector to better protect the public and businesses from fraud. We want to reduce the impact of fraud as well as its prevalence, and increase the disruption and prosecution of fraudsters. We will put the right resources into frontline policing to ensure that they can do that.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b159.0\/1\">Thank you, Mrs Cummins, for calling me to speak. I also thank my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Daniel Kawczynski\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11817\">the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)<\/phrase> for securing this debate. He said he was going to focus on self-determination in particular, which is important. As other hon. Members have said, what happened originally when the base was set up and what happened to the Chagossian people was outrageous and wrong, and we apologise for that. However, I am not going to focus on that. There are bigger issues than self-determination and sovereignty&#8212;global security and defence.<\/p><p pid=\"b159.0\/2\">The base was set up in the 1960s for very good reason: to mitigate against the Soviet and Chinese threat. Those threats are greater and more complex now than they were in the &#8217;60s and throughout the period of the cold war. It is unfeasible for the islands to be repopulated. I visited some of the outer islands, where there were lots of graves of small children, as people died very young. The business related to palms that sustained the islands was reducing even before the atrocity of the removal of the individuals.<\/p><p pid=\"b159.0\/3\">On the main island, the base is absolutely essential. It is home to an airport from which multiple aircraft, including spacecraft, can be flown. There is hardstanding from which tens of thousands of troops can be deployed around the world. In a protected area, there are a large number of ships storing military equipment. It is perhaps wrong to call them ships. They are seven or eight-storey car parks. On each level, there is bulletproof machinery, diggers, tanks, and armoured personnel vehicles that drive off the seventh floor into the water and can then invade land. There are 350 places around the world from which to deploy and sustain that level of troop commitment. It is a massive facility for global security and the defence of the world. We need to consider that alongside legitimate sovereignty and self-determination issues.<\/p><p pid=\"b159.0\/4\">There was originally a 50-year lease that was rolled over to a 20-year lease, and there is now talk of an offer from Mauritius of a 99-year lease. I urge the Government to think about Hong Kong. A 99-year lease seems a long time, yet we have seen what happened in Hong Kong with China. Whatever we do, the global community, which to be honest relies heavily on the Americans, needs that facility to protect global citizens. That should be at the forefront of the Government&#8217;s mind, while trying to protect and improve the lives of Chagossians here, in the Seychelles and Mauritius. I have met with all of them and there is a pragmatic understanding. There is a desire to move back, but there is a practical understanding that that would be very difficult, even without the American base and British sovereignty issues.<\/p>",

When we opened the Welsh platform, we anticipated 1,000 people coming to Wales as a result of it. We now have 3,000 people who've been welcomed to Wales by that route. The Member is right&#8212;that puts stresses and strains into the system. We believe that, in this last 12 months, we've also been able to absorb 1,000 people from Hong Kong here into Wales as well. We have 700 people from Afghanistan who've been welcomed to Wales. All of these things undoubtedly put pressure into the system.<\/p><p>The specific question the Member asked me, Llywydd, was why do some people choose not to take up offers of permanent accommodation that are made to them, and I think the answer is that there's complexity in that. Some people will have settled in their temporary accommodation in the sense they've already found jobs and work. The place that they're offered to live permanently may be in a different part of Wales and they may be reluctant to pick themselves up and start again somewhere where they don't have the things that they've built up while they've been in temporary accommodation. In temporary accommodation, you will be surrounded by other people who've been through the same experience as you. We shouldn't be surprised, should we, that people draw some comfort from that and, faced with moving into independent accommodation where you're necessarily more likely to be on your own, that can be a difficult move for some people to make.<\/p><p>I've no doubt that Joel James is right that, for some people, the contrast between the service that is provided to them in a welcome centre, where they are very well looked after, and being asked to go and make your own future in a flat somewhere in a part of the world you don't know, that's another difficult thing that gets in the way of some people moving on. But, move-on is an essential part of the arrangement. Because the numbers of people coming from Ukraine have declined since August, the system is much closer to being in balance than it was at the height of the flow of people in. So, now the number of people leaving welcome centres compared to people arriving is much closer to being in balance. But, we do have to have that outflow in order to be able to welcome more people into Wales. Challenging as that can be for people, the system is designed to encourage them to make that decision.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1893.0\/1\">My Lords, throughout the autumn of 2022, the BBC has been celebrating its 100-year anniversary, but drastic cuts to the BBC World Service&#8212;and the loss of 382 jobs and of radio services&#8212;have dampened the celebrations and left many dismayed and angry. I am grateful to my Cross-Bench colleagues for choosing this Motion, to all noble Lords who will speak, to the Minister who will reply and to the Library for its background note. We especially look forward to the maiden speech of my noble friend Lord Hampton.<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/2\">When the BBC World Service started life in 1932 as the BBC Empire Service, Sir John Reith&#8212;later Lord Reith&#8212;played down expectations:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1893.0\/3\">&#8220;Don&#8217;t expect too much in the early days &#8230; The programmes will neither be very interesting nor very good&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/4\">Seven years later, in the context of a world war, Lord Reith&#8217;s doubts had been dispelled. I wonder what he would have made of BBC World Service audiences in 2022 of 365 million people&#8212;up 13 million on the previous year&#8212;and news in over 40 languages. He would certainly have approved of Allan Little&#8217;s story of how, in Paris, an elderly Jewish man had agreed to give him an interview because, as a boy in hiding in wartime Poland, the BBC was the only way he kept hope alive.<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/5\">Penelope Fitzgerald, who worked for the BBC during the Second World War, wrote a funny and touching novel called Human Voices set in the broadcasting studios of the BBC during the London Blitz. It captured the spirit of the wartime BBC in what was described as:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1893.0\/6\">&#8220;A tribute to the unsung and quintessentially English heroism of imperfect people&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/7\">Fitzgerald said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1893.0\/8\">&#8220;Broadcasting House was in fact dedicated to the strangest project of the war, or of any war, that is, telling the truth. Without prompting, the BBC had decided that truth was more important than consolation, and, in the long run, would be more effective. And yet there was no guarantee of this. Truth ensures trust, but not victory, or even happiness.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/9\">Truth and trust: so true today in the era of fake news and, especially, Putin&#8217;s propaganda.<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/10\">Whether in struggles today between democracy and dictatorship&#8212;as in Ukraine, Iran, North Korea, Burma, China and elsewhere&#8212;or during the dark days of Nazi-occupied Europe, the BBC World Service has always been trusted to provide dispassionate, fact-based and truthful reporting. Even the late Mikhail Gorbachev once said that he had relied on the BBC to learn what was really going on in the world. I once met a young Ukrainian woman who told me that the proudest moment of her life was when she told her parents that she was going to work for the BBC World Service. They had listened to it clandestinely throughout the whole Soviet era.<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/11\">Last May, the Minister told me that 5 million Ukrainians were listening to the BBC via its digital platform and that 17 million Russians&#8212;triple the usual number&#8212;had listened to it during the previous week. Can he tell us what the current audience estimates are? Are we happy that ceasing our radio broadcasts to Russia a decade ago has been a bonus for Putin&#8217;s state-controlled media? Was this a wise decision?<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/12\">I co-chair the all-party parliamentary groups on Eritrea and North Korea. Seven years ago, at the conclusion of a long campaign, I was able to thank the FCO and the BBC for agreeing to begin broadcasts to the Korean peninsula. A United Nations report on North Korea showed a country in which there was<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1893.0\/13\">&#8220;an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of thought &#8230; as well as of the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, information and association.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/14\">Breaking such information blockades and our commitment to Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights&#8212;upholding the right to unimpeded free access to information and news&#8212;are central to the ethos of the BBC World Service.<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/15\">Eight years ago in a previous Cross-Bench debate, many of us spoke about its role in promoting our belief in human rights, democracy and the rule of law&#8212;what Joseph Nye described as the exercise of soft power, or smart power as I prefer to call it. That debate followed a House of Lords Select Committee report which insisted that the World Service represented<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1893.0\/16\">&#8220;the ability to affect others to obtain the outcomes one wants through attraction rather than coercion&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/17\">This is essential to UK diplomacy and prosperity, but the ability to do these things depends entirely on resources. The Select Committee pleaded that the budget<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1893.0\/18\">&#8220;is not reduced any further in real terms&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/19\">You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow&#8217;s ear. That central question of funding will dominate today&#8217;s debate. I know that my noble friend Lord Hannay will also speak to this.<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/20\">Traditionally, the funding came from the Government and therefore taxation, based on the ability to pay. By comparison, the licence fee is regressive and not determined by income. In a battle for tight resources, the World Service is bound to suffer if it must compete with &#8220;Doctor Who&#8221;, &#8220;Strictly Come Dancing&#8221; or even domestic news services. Why should we expect a listener in Liverpool to pay via their licence fee for services in a language they do not understand which the BBC broadcasts to the listener in Lahore, or a viewer in Bradford for BBC services in Beijing, or a pensioner in Yeovil for services in Yangon? This should not come from the licence fee but be seen as a legitimate public expenditure via taxation. As Tim Davie said at Chatham House last week:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1893.0\/21\">&#8220;there is only so much we can ask the licence fee payer in Penrith to pay for the language services &#8230; This is a strategic decision for the UK&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/22\">In 2014 the World Service budget, given as FCO grant in aid, was &#163;245 million. If grant had continued and matched inflation, it would have led to an increase of &#163;62 million and a total budget of &#163;307 million in 2022. The actual figure, now rendered from the licence fee, is &#163;95 million. That is a cut of &#163;213 million. How much clearer and better it would be if the World Service was funded once again from the FCDO, as part of a ring-fenced allocation within a restored ODA budget, as the Minister referred to in answer to the Question that preceded this debate.<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/23\">When I drew another Minister&#8217;s attention earlier this year to a report by the National Union of Journalists which highlighted the damage being done to the World Service by the uncertainty of funding, he said<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1893.0\/24\">&#8220;the value this Government place on the service that is being provided internationally is absolute and there is no question of it being cut back.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class=\"offrep\" id=\", 10\/3\/22; col. 1553.]\"><i>Official Report<\/i>, 10\/3\/22; col. 1553.]<\/phrase><\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/25\">In January, the noble Lord, Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, told me that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1893.0\/26\">&#8220;We strongly value the work of the BBC World Service in promoting our values globally through its independent and impartial broadcasting&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/27\">and that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1893.0\/28\">&#8220;The FCDO is committed to providing grant-in-aid funding for the BBC World Service through to 2025.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/29\">However, like the curate&#8217;s egg, it is there only in parts.<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/30\">The BBC says that grave and deep cuts of &#163;285 million a year, necessitated by the Government&#8217;s freezing of the licence fee for two years, is leading to hundreds of key posts closing. This is happening as dictators and autocrats are more than willing to fill the void as the free world retreats from the global dissemination of news and at a moment when, in places such as Ukraine, Iran and Taiwan, the need for objective news has never been greater. The numbers are stark: 225 jobs in the United Kingdom, 156 in bureaux and 381 total job cuts from global languages, which could amount to a fifth of staff. Although no language services will close, the BBC says that some TV and radio programmes will stop. BBC Arabic radio and BBC Persian radio will cease, all aimed at saving &#163;28.5 million. I know that my noble friend Lady Coussins will say more on this.<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/31\">What of the Bengali service? What of the 40% of the world, 2 to 3 billion people, who still have no access to reliable or affordable internet services? Places such as northern Nigeria are a breeding ground for the likes of Boko Haram and ISIS West Africa, about which I know my noble friend Lady Cox will speak. How will the cuts impact our reach throughout Africa? What is the future of the radio transmitting station in Kranji, Singapore, which can reach four countries that represent half the world&#8217;s population&#8212;India, China, Pakistan and Indonesia? What about the BBC broadcasts to the Korean peninsula, for which I and the all-party group campaigned successfully? I have sent the Minister details on this and hope he can say more about the future of that service.<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/32\">Deep cuts to the World Service language services follow separate &#8220;savings&#8221; to be made from the closure of the domestic BBC News channel and BBC World News, with a single BBC News channel. In London, there will be 70 fewer television journalists following and reporting on news, which will be aimed at a global audience led by international stories but shown at times in the UK. This is like Dr Dolittle&#8217;s fictional pushmi-pullyu; the joint channel will be a two-headed news beast, neither one thing nor the other. Stories about domestic matters will continually fight against a global news agenda and bumping important issues around the world off the air.<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/33\">Early Day Motion 504, tabled in the House of Commons on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-10-26\">26 October<\/phrase>, draws attention to the cuts in services and jobs, underlines the role of radio when<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1893.0\/34\">&#8220;digital-only services are lost owing to the blocking of internet access&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/35\">and expresses concern about the impact of the closure of the BBC Persian radio service and BBC Arabic radio&#8212;with 10 million listeners&#8212;while an uprising is taking place in Iran. Let me spell it out: for the past three months, BBC Persian has played a key role in covering the widespread women-led, anti-regime protests across Iran, and the brutal, violent crackdown that has followed. Heavy censorship limits local media in its broadcasts, but BBC Persian has an average weekly audience of 18.9 million people, with radio reaching a weekly audience of 1.6 million people and producing material for the BBC Persian website and social media. Closing the radio means that from midnight to 5 pm the next day&#8212;for 17 hours&#8212;the BBC Persian service has no scheduled live broadcast. Of course, we are now told that this space may be filled by a Saudi-funded channel. Closing it while the regime tries to block digital and online platforms is extraordinarily short-sighted. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Collins, feels deeply and strongly about this and will no doubt refer to it.<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/36\">While dozens of Persian service journalists were spending day and night informing people of the protests, the BBC announced its plans to cut BBC Persian radio, resulting in the loss of nine journalistic jobs and a meagre saving of around &#163;1 million. We should note that this journalistic work has come at a huge personal cost for brave BBC journalists and their families back in Iran. They have faced harassment and intimidation, interrogation, arrest, asset seizing and freezing, and despicable pressure to force them to leave the BBC. They face a barrage of daily abuse and threats online, simply because they are doing their professional job as independent, impartial journalists. The Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently labelled BBC Persian as terrorist, which could have even more catastrophic consequences for journalists&#8217; families. Cutting BBC Persian at a time of widespread protests across Iran will be celebrated by those who rule there. I have been told about prisoners held in Middle Eastern prisons whose only contact with the outside world is this BBC radio service. For millions of others, trapped in the &#8220;prisons&#8221; of autocratic regimes which prohibit impartial local media, these services are hugely valued as a rare place to hear the truth rather than unremitting propaganda. Radio still matters.<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/37\">As the free world retreats, step up Putin&#8217;s RT and the CCP&#8217;s China media&#8212;trusted sources of news? You must be joking, but it is not funny. Has no one noticed that, in the face of genocide against Uighur Muslims, exiled Tibetans, threatened Taiwanese, beleaguered Hong Kongers, and brave dissenting voices throughout China, retaining a strong BBC presence is crucially important? Welcome though resources for a new China unit with a team in London will be, it should be as well as, not instead of. I declare my interests as a patron of Hong Kong Watch and my work with all-party groups.<\/p><p pid=\"a1893.0\/38\">To conclude, BBC World has given people hope in times of oppression, despair and crisis, and despite many competitors, it is primus inter pares. It is our best-known cultural export; the most trusted news brand; and crucial to diplomacy, culture and commerce. I hope the message from today&#8217;s debate during these 100 years celebrations will be to insist that the BBC&#8217;s  global reach is enhanced and not savagely cut; that it remains first among equals; that we will not accept the emasculation and irreparable degradation of British influence overseas; and that we will look again at a funding model that is wholly unsuited to ensuring that, in the battle of ideas between dictatorship and democracy, our voice in the UK is not silenced. I beg to move.<\/p>",

He is an ever-present ray of sunshine in Parliament, and we love him for it.<\/p><p pid=\"a1888.5\/2\">As the Foreign Secretary made clear yesterday, the arrest of a BBC journalist while covering the recent protests in Shanghai is a deeply disturbing and wholly unacceptable situation. Journalists must be able to do their job without fear of arrest of intimidation. The BBC has stated that the journalist was beaten and kicked by the police during his arrest, and was held for several hours before being released. In response, we are calling in the Chinese ambassador to make clear  the unacceptable and unwarranted nature of those actions and the importance of freedom of speech, and to demand a full explanation. We have also been in close touch with the journalist and the BBC throughout to gather the facts and provide consular support.<\/p><p pid=\"a1888.5\/3\">We recognise that the covid-related restrictions in China are challenging for the Chinese people. We urge the Chinese authorities to respect the rights of those who decide to express their views about the situation. Moreover, as the Prime Minister made clear yesterday in his Mansion House speech, the media&#8212;and, for that matter, our parliamentarians&#8212;must be able to highlight issues without fear of sanction or intimidation, whether in calling out human rights violations in Xinjiang and the curtailment of freedom in Hong Kong, or in reporting on the recent protests.<\/p><p pid=\"a1888.5\/4\">This, of course, follows the recent incident in Manchester. As we have previously made clear to the House, the apparent behaviour of staff at the Chinese consulate general was wholly unacceptable. In view of the gravity of that incident, we summoned the Chinese charg&#233; d&#8217;affaires on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-10-18\">18 October<\/phrase> and delivered a clear message through our ambassador in Beijing. There is now an ongoing investigation and it would be wrong to pre-empt the findings.<\/p><p pid=\"a1888.5\/5\">More broadly, we recognise that China poses a systemic challenge to our values and interests, which, again, the Prime Minister highlighted yesterday. That challenge grows more acute as China moves towards greater authoritarianism. That is why we are taking robust action to protect our interests and stand up for our values. That includes imposing sanctions, leading action at the UN and strengthening our supply chain resilience. Let me assure Members that, as part of our frank relationship with China, we will continue to raise our human rights concerns at the highest levels.&#8221;<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1813.4\/1\">My Lords, in moving Amendment 91 I will support all the other amendments in this group.<\/p><p pid=\"a1813.4\/2\">In the Prime Minister&#8217;s speech to the Lord Mayor&#8217;s Banquet two days ago, he said that China posed a<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1813.4\/3\">&#8220;systemic challenge to our values and interests &#8230; a challenge that grows more acute as it moves towards even greater authoritarianism.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1813.4\/4\">I want briefly to draw the House&#8217;s attention to one aspect of that country&#8217;s behaviour in relation to the appalling forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience and to ask the Government to accept my very modest amendment as a small but important measure towards, I hope, ending this practice. This would give a discretionary power to exclude suppliers from being awarded a public contract who have participated in forced organ harvesting or unethical activities relating to human tissue, including where they are involved in providing a service or goods relating to such activities.<\/p><p pid=\"a1813.4\/5\">Forced organ harvesting in China is the removal of organs from a living prisoner of conscience for the purpose of transplantation, killing the victim in the process. It is state-sanctioned and widespread throughout China, with the Chinese Communist Party targeting individuals because of their religion, spiritual beliefs or ethnicity. The victims are known to be primarily Falun Gong practitioners and Uighur Muslims. There are also several lines of evidence to show that Tibetans and house Christians are likely victims of forced organ harvesting.<\/p><p pid=\"a1813.4\/6\">With regard to the Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights published its report into Xinjiang in August this year, which stated:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1813.4\/7\">&#8220;Allegations of patterns of torture or ill-treatment, including forced medical treatment and adverse conditions of detention, are credible, as are allegations of individual incidents of sexual and gender-based violence.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1813.4\/8\">Both Uighurs and Falun Gong practitioners are arbitrarily arrested, detained in camps, tortured, face sexual violence, disappear while in detention and are murdered on a vast scale for their organs.<\/p><p pid=\"a1813.4\/9\">The evidence is now explicit. In April this year, a paper by Matthew Robertson and Dr Jacob Lavee was published in the American Journal of Transplantation titled &#8220;Execution by Organ Procurement: Breaching the Dead Donor Rule in China&#8221;, which was cited in the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China Annual Report 2022. Their paper found that, in 71 different Chinese medical studies published between 1980 and 2015 and sourced to 56 hospitals in 33 cities, brain death could not have properly been declared, and therefore the removal of the heart during organ procurement must have been the cause of the donor&#8217;s death. The authors state in a recent article in the Tablet that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1813.4\/10\">&#8220;the act of execution was joined with the act of heart removal, and was carried out by surgeons on the operating table.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1813.4\/11\">In Committee, the Minister resisted my amendment, although she appreciated the seriousness of the issue that I raised. She said that the Bill is clear that any serious breach of ethical or professional standards applicable to the supplier would meet the discretionary exclusion ground for professional misconduct. But she also argued that while the exclusion ground of professional misconduct is intended precisely to cover all the ethical issues arising in different industries and sectors, the grounds for exclusion cannot and should not list every issue within a particular industry.<\/p><p pid=\"a1813.4\/12\">I understand the argument about lists in legislation, but sometimes there is a strong reason to list a particular practice. This practice is so appalling that there is a  strong case for listing it. It is a discretionary ground. It is not mandatory. I have made my amendment as mild as possible, to encourage the Government to accept it. If the Minister continues to say that it is not necessary to list organ harvesting, I would point her to Schedule 7, which specifies a number of grounds for discretionary exclusion, including labour market conduct and environmental misconduct. The organ harvesting that I am talking about fits that strength of criteria.<\/p><p pid=\"a1813.4\/13\">I return to the Prime Minister&#8217;s very important speech on Monday night about our relationship with China. It was nuanced, of course, and it recognised some of the economic realities of that relationship, of which the Minister will be well aware. However, he affirmed that the media and parliamentarians must be able to highlight issues in China without sanction, including calling out abuses in Xinjiang and the curtailment of freedom in Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"a1813.4\/14\">Last year, the House agreed an amendment to the Medicines and Medical Devices Bill to include consent provisions for imported human tissue for use in medicines. Earlier this year, we amended the Health and Care Bill to prohibit the commercialism of organ tourism. They may be small steps, but internationally they were regarded as a visible sign of this country&#8217;s concern and as significant. I hope that tonight the House will go one step further. A discretionary power is a modest ask of the Minister. I really hope that we can take one small step towards ending these abhorrent practices. I beg to move.<\/p>",

He is an ever present ray of sunshine in Parliament, and we love him for it.<\/p><p pid=\"a779.3\/2\">As the Foreign Secretary made clear yesterday, the arrest of a BBC journalist while covering the recent protests in Shanghai is a deeply disturbing and wholly unacceptable situation. Journalists must be able to do their job without fear of arrest of intimidation. The BBC has stated that the journalist was beaten and kicked by the police during his arrest, and was held for several hours before being released. In response, we are calling in the Chinese ambassador to make clear the unacceptable and unwarranted nature of those actions and the importance of freedom of speech, and to demand a full explanation. We have also been in close touch with the journalist and the BBC throughout to gather the facts and provide consular support.<\/p><p pid=\"a779.3\/3\">We recognise that the covid-related restrictions in China are challenging for the Chinese people. We urge the Chinese authorities to respect the rights of those who decide to express their views about the situation. Moreover, as the Prime Minister made clear yesterday in his Mansion House speech, the media&#8212;and, for that matter, our parliamentarians&#8212;must be able to highlight issues without fear of sanction or intimidation, whether in calling out human rights violations in Xinjiang and the curtailment of freedom in Hong Kong, or in reporting on the recent protests.<\/p><p pid=\"a779.3\/4\">This, of course, follows the recent incident in Manchester. As we have previously made clear to the House, the apparent behaviour of staff at the Chinese consulate general was wholly unacceptable. In view of the gravity of that incident, we summoned the Chinese charg&#233; d&#8217;affaires on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-10-18\">18 October<\/phrase> and delivered a clear message through our ambassador in Beijing. There is now an ongoing investigation and it would be wrong to pre-empt the findings.<\/p><p pid=\"a779.3\/5\">More broadly, we recognise that China poses a systemic challenge to our values and interests, which, again, the Prime Minister highlighted yesterday. That challenge grows more acute as China moves towards greater authoritarianism. That is why we are taking robust action to protect our interests and stand up for our values. That includes imposing sanctions, leading action at the UN and strengthening our supply chain resilience. Let me assure Members that, as  part of our frank relationship with China, we will continue to raise our human rights concerns at the highest levels.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c73.0\/1\">I would like to start by talking about wealth. Being a Conservative means that we have a strong and principled belief in equality of opportunity, which does not exclude the need for public money to be spent levelling up the playing field to help those who work just as hard as their peers, but are held back by factors not under their own control. To achieve that important and just mission, we need wealth. That means money, funding, investment, support, education, healthcare, lifelong learning grants to small businesses and scientists, and much more. We Conservatives must relentlessly back the wealth creators. That is why I welcome the Budget while still being ambitious and restless for a greater push for growth, low taxation and wealth creation once the immediate issues of stability and inflation have been rightly addressed.<\/p><p pid=\"c73.0\/2\">We must keep the focus on incentives, rewards for additional effort, self-reliance and hard work. We are the only political party that understands that wealth is  created by individuals, not the state&#8212;by entrepreneurs and hard workers taking risks and enduring huge sacrifices and setbacks. Before I came into politics, I worked for 30 years in my own business&#8212;one that I helped to start&#8212;so I know what I am talking about.<\/p><p pid=\"c73.0\/3\">Our opponents will cynically criticise this. The media and the commentariat will twist these words beyond all recognition into a hostile characterisation of what the vast majority of the British people know and believe in their bones, which is that we do not help the weak by pulling down the strong. We help the disadvantaged more by enabling the talented, privileged and successful to thrive, start more businesses, pay more salaries to their employees, put more tax into the Exchequer and earn more profit. The Government ask for a share of that, which we willingly give to help the vulnerable and level up our great country. I believe that this Budget was, on balance, one for business and wealth creators, providing a degree of stability and a strategy to face the global economic headwinds.<\/p><p pid=\"c73.0\/4\">I will focus my remarks on a couple of key priorities for my constituents. The engine room of our economy is the industrial midlands, one part of which&#8212;Redditch in north Worcestershire&#8212;I am privileged to represent. The war in Ukraine, through sky-high energy costs for energy-intensive industries, threatens the success of our cluster. I hear concerning reports from some manufacturers that, even after the welcome support of the energy bill relief scheme, energy companies are cynically profiteering from their UK customers while providing much lower, subsidised costs to their German customers. There is a real risk, therefore, that businesses are left with no alternative but to consider offshoring manufacturing to Germany or China, with hugely detrimental impacts. I ask the Chancellor, through those on the Treasury Bench, whether he has looked at the impact of that across our manufacturing base. Will he consider further legal or regulatory steps to prevent those suppliers from charging excessively in this country?<\/p><p pid=\"c73.0\/5\">I turn now to the NHS. Naturally, I welcome the increased spending of &#163;3.3 billion committed by the Chancellor, but it must be well spent. I have a number of questions to ask Health and Social Care Ministers, as well as the Minister on the Front Bench. Alex Hospital in Redditch is my top priority, and I have never stopped fighting for it since I became the local MP. The Conservative Government are devoting record amounts of funding to the broader NHS and to the Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust. I am afraid, however, that the trust is still not responding to the healthcare needs of our population, despite stating numerous times that services for children and maternity have not been removed because of funding cuts. The Garden Suite chemotherapy unit was moved to Kidderminster, 40 minutes away, at the start of the pandemic. I was assured that that was a temporary decision, but the trust is yet to bring it back, even though the pandemic is over. I pay tribute to Kirsty Southwell, Adele Jackson and the other members of the group campaigning to bring back services, who have worked tirelessly and persistently, and there have been some welcome commitments to improving local health services.<\/p><p pid=\"c73.0\/6\">My previous discussions with the trust have come back time and again to workforce problems, yet across the country the Government have supported funding for greater workforce recruitment across the NHS and  our trust, and there are more staff in our trust than there were under the last Labour Government. The Chancellor spoke about the importance of a long-term workforce strategy and committed to publishing one. When will the strategy be published, when will our local trust be consulted on it, and what impact will it have on the capacity of the trust to provide vital services such as the Garden Suite and enhanced support for women and children at the Alex site?<\/p><p pid=\"c73.0\/7\">Finally, I will address illegal migration. We are a generous, open and tolerant nation, blessed with a keen sense of fairness. We welcome refugees&#8212;just look at how we have opened our homes to those fleeing war in Ukraine and Syria, as well as to those from Hong Kong&#8212;but our asylum system is being undermined by mass economic migration from safe countries such as Albania. I would like to have seen more in the Budget on resources and the plan to help the Home Office, the National Crime Agency, law enforcement, Border Force and intelligence services join together in tackling the issue. There is no single solution. The work that the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary are doing to reach agreements with France and Albania in particular can only be helpful. However, as a former Home Office Minister who led on violence against women and girls, I met the genuine victims of modern slavery, sex trafficking, and child and forced labour, whose stories are appalling and heartbreaking, and I am disgusted that our taxpayer-funded support systems are being hijacked by cynical smuggling gangs and an army of legal aid lawyers to allow Albanian men to seek a better life in our country by claiming to be modern slaves. By any measure, that is a grotesque abuse of our compassion and our scarce and finite public resources.<\/p><p pid=\"c73.0\/8\">The figures are astronomical: there are currently more than 37,000 asylum seekers in hotels, costing the UK taxpayer &#163;5.6 million a day. That dwarfs the entire budget of Worcestershire County Council, the acute trust and Redditch Borough Council. Surely we should be diverting that funding to the frontline public services that my constituents rely on daily.<\/p><p pid=\"c73.0\/9\">I welcome the Budget, which gives additional certainty to businesses and enterprise. The Chancellor stated that the measures he has introduced mean that the forthcoming downturn will not be as severe as it otherwise would have been. As a country, we must continue to give our wealth creators every support to continue doing what they do best. It is their creativity and determination that will keep businesses and jobs going for everyone, protecting the vulnerable and giving us the best possible chance to have a competitive, growing economy as we emerge from these difficult economic times with more hope for the future.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a378.0\/1\">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairship, Dame Maria. I should tell you that in the 35 years I have been in this House and in my three stints in Government, this is only the second time I have responded to a debate in this Chamber&#8212;but it is the second time in two days. It is a bit like buses: I wait for 35 years and then two come along almost immediately.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/2\">I am in effect standing in for Lord Ahmad&#8212;it is obvious why&#8212;who, as a number of people said, is the Minister who has considerable knowledge of this issue and worked extremely hard on it. He will read our debate with the greatest possible interest.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/3\">I thank <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jim Shannon\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/13864\">the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)<\/phrase> for securing the debate and I commend him for his long-standing commitment to freedom of religion or belief for all. His speech today was littered with the wisdom and authority that he commands in the House. He is much respected across the House for what he has to say. He ended his remarks by looking at the Gospel according to St Matthew, and our debate was enriched by that contribution.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/4\">I also thank the all-party parliamentary group on international freedom of religion or belief, which continues to raise awareness of this human right among parliamentarians and the public alike. The shared passion across the House to protect freedom of religion or belief is clear, warranted and to be warmly welcomed. I will try to respond to the various points that have been made during the debate and to highlight the UK action in respect of that.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/5\">I will come to the comments of <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Fabian Hamilton\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10256\">the hon. Member for Leeds North East (Fabian Hamilton)<\/phrase> later in my remarks, but I thought he spoke for the entire House today. He praised my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Fiona Bruce\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24857\">the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce)<\/phrase>&#8212;he did not quite offer her a job, but he nearly did&#8212;and saluted her ecumenical approach politically. The whole House will agree with that. He urged us to use our diplomatic influence to stop persecution&#8212;we most certainly are, and will&#8212;and on his point about Colombia, one of the other Foreign Office Ministers will shortly be there to amplify and emphasise the cross-party approach that we are taking.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/6\">It is fitting that this debate falls just ahead of Red Wednesday, a day to stand in solidarity with persecuted Christians. The Foreign Office will demonstrate our support by lighting our building in red. We have noted the report from Aid to the Church in Need, released yesterday, and we will study its findings closely.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/7\">I pay particular tribute to Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, for his work standing up for persecuted minorities and on development. He speaks with unique authority about our moral duty to the poorest and least well-off. In the same spirit as the hon. Member for Leeds North East, I express my admiration and praise for the faith communities across Birmingham who work so impressively together and to great effect and success. The royal town of Sutton Coldfield makes an enormously constructive contribution to such important issues. In the royal town, we have the Bishop of Aston, who makes a great contribution and resides in my constituency.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/8\">Like this House, the Government believe that violence against any person because of their religion or belief is wholly unacceptable. Although this debate particularly  highlights the plight of persecuted Christians, we do not forget or in any way diminish the experience of those persecuted for holding other religions, beliefs or no religious beliefs at all. The Government are committed to championing freedom of religion or belief for everyone&#8212;something enshrined in the universal declaration of human rights and in our own organisational values. My noble Friend Lord Ahmad, the Minister responsible for human rights, continues to work closely with the Prime Minister&#8217;s special envoy for freedom of religion or belief, my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton, to deliver precisely on that commitment.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/9\">We demonstrated the depth of our commitment this summer by hosting an international ministerial conference that brought together more than 800 faith and belief leaders and human rights actors and 100 Government delegations to agree action to promote and protect these fundamental rights. As a result of the conference, 47 Governments, international organisations and other entities made pledges to take action in support of freedom of religion or belief.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/10\">In addition, we are pursuing three broad strands to advance freedom of religion or belief and tackle the associated human rights concerns: first, working through multilateral bodies; secondly, working with states directly to encourage and support them to uphold their human rights obligations; and thirdly, through our continuing work to implement the recommendations of the Bishop of Truro&#8217;s 2019 review.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/11\">On multilateral action&#8212;the first strand&#8212;we work with organisations such as the United Nations, Council of Europe, G7 and the International Religious Freedom or Belief Alliance to promote and protect freedom of religion or belief. Again, I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton for her dedicated work as the UK representative and chair of the alliance. Under her leadership, participation has grown to 42 countries. I welcome the joint statements recently issued by the alliance on concerns related to Ahmadi Muslims, Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, Baha&#8217;is, Ukraine, Nicaragua and Nigeria&#8212;on which I will say more in a minute, if time permits.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/12\">In September, my noble Friend Lord Ahmad spoke at the United Nations and urged the international community to call out Iran for systematically targeting members of minority communities, to press Afghanistan to protect minorities targeted for their beliefs, to challenge the discriminatory provisions in Myanmar&#8217;s citizenship laws and to hold China to account for its egregious human rights violations in Xinjiang.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/13\">In our bilateral work, we regularly raise specific issues with other Governments, both in public and in private, where that may result in better outcomes. My noble Friend Lord Ahmad met Pakistan&#8217;s Minister for Human Rights in October to raise the persecution of minorities, including the forced conversion of young Christian and Hindu girls. In Iraq, religious and ethnic minority populations have significantly declined since 2003 due to exclusion, sectarianism and conflict. Many of these minority communities continue to face extreme challenges in 2022. We regularly raise the need to protect ethnic and religious minorities with the Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government&#8212;most recently in July 2022, again, by my noble Friend Lord Ahmad with the Kurdistan Regional Government Minister for Religious Affairs.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/14\">I am also grateful to those who have raised the issue of Nigeria, where both Christians and Muslims have suffered devastating harm at the hands of violent extremist groups, and separately as a result of intercommunal violence and criminality. We remain committed to supporting peacebuilding initiatives across Nigeria to address the root causes of violence, protect human rights and promote dialogue and respect between different ethnic and religious communities.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/15\">Finally, the Bishop of Truro&#8217;s review set out the gravity of the issue of Christian persecution, along with practical recommendations for an enhanced Government response to the plight of persecuted Christians and people persecuted for holding other religions, beliefs or no religious belief at all. We welcome the findings of the independent review of our work to take forward the recommendations. That assessment earlier this year concluded that the majority of the recommendations are either at an advanced stage of delivery or in the process of being delivered, while noting that more can always be done.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/16\">We will continue to ensure that the changes we have made are embedded, and we will look for opportunities to ensure that freedom of religion or belief is central to wider human rights work. To provide a few examples, we have sent a clear message through our global human rights sanctions regime that the international community will not turn a blind eye to serious and systematic violations of human rights. In December 2021, we sanctioned Furqan Bangalzai for his role in orchestrating the 2017 bombing of a Sufi shrine in Pakistan, which killed over 70 people. In March 2021, Lord Ahmad hosted a meeting at the UN Security Council to raise awareness of persecution of religious minorities in conflict zones. Religion for international engagement training is now available to all civil servants to enhance their understanding of the role of religion and belief in a wide variety of contexts, in order to deliver the UK&#8217;s international objectives more effectively.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/17\">I now turn to some of the specific contributions, starting with my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton. She does so much good work and speaks so eloquently, as she demonstrated so well today. Across our country, many people in the faith communities will be grateful to her for her leadership. She is going to send information on Nigeria and share it with Lord Ahmad. Of course, it will be a pleasure to have the meeting that she requested. I will look carefully and write if I miss any of her other points. In particular, she raised the issue of the attack on St Francis Xavier Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo state. I want her to know that we condemn that horrific attack and we extend our sympathies to all those affected. We condemn attacks on places of worship. Everybody should be free to practise their religion or belief without fear.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/18\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Patrick Grady\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25299\">The hon. Member for Glasgow North (Patrick Grady)<\/phrase> spoke about a number of organisations that do so much to help. I want to echo his thanks to them. He also raised Iran, whose human rights record continues to be of serious concern to the UK; the Foreign Office has designated it as one of its human rights priority countries. The continued use of the death penalty, weak rule of law and restrictions on freedom of expression and religion or belief are deeply worrying.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/19\">My right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Edward Leigh\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10352\">the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh)<\/phrase> spoke with his great experience, but lugubriously. He asked us to use our influence to greater  effect in Nigeria. I will be going there before long, and I will raise directly the points that he made. He also raised the issue of Nicaragua, as did the hon. Member for Leeds North East. Reports of harassment and detention of members of the Catholic Church in Nicaragua are of enormous concern. Freedom of religion or belief is a universal human right, and we have made it clear there that they must be protected.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/20\">My right hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough also raised the Aid to the Church in Need petition to grant Maira Shahbaz asylum. I am very conscious of that case. I know my right hon. Friend will accept that I must be careful when commenting in public on individual cases where individuals&#8217; or their families&#8217; lives could be put at risk, but I want him to know that I am deeply conscious of his point.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/21\">My right hon. Friend also raised a point about Cardinal Zen. We will certainly continue to make representations. We are closely following the cases of pro-democracy figures who face charges in Hong Kong, including Cardinal Zen. Officials from the British consulate general  in Hong Kong attend local court hearings related to a number of rights and freedoms issues and will continue to do so. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Patricia Gibson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25300\">The hon. Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Patricia Gibson)<\/phrase> addressed in forthright terms the evil of persecution and the various ways in which that evil is pursued and delivered. She spoke about Open Doors, for which we are extremely grateful.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/22\">To conclude, as a long-standing champion of human rights and freedoms, the United Kingdom has not only a duty but a deep desire to promote and defend our values of equality, inclusion and respect at home and abroad. I assure Members here today that the Government will do just that. We will continue to raise awareness of all persecution and we will defend the right to freedom of religion or belief for everyone, everywhere.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/23\">Question put and agreed to.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/24\">Resolved,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a378.0\/25\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">That this House has considered persecution of Christians and freedom of religion or belief.<\/p><p pid=\"a378.0\/26\">Sitting adjourned.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a337.1\/1\">I thank the hon. Member for his very sensible point. There is absolutely a wider issue. As well as shell companies, there are vast developments on the south side of the river, around the US embassy, where entire blocks are being bought up as investment options rather than being used to provide housing for Londoners. That is shocking, especially because we have a housing shortage. There is a wider argument on reform of our housing in the UK for giving options first to allow ordinary folks to be buying it, rather than&#8212;as much as we love them&#8212;Hong Kong, Chinese or Indonesian investors to block buy endless numbers of flat and rent them out or never have them occupied.<\/p><p pid=\"a337.1\/2\">I was going to talk a bit about the Azerbaijani laundromat. Between 2012 and 2014, about &#163;3 billion went through UK shell companies as part of the so-called Azerbaijani laundromat; funding was dispersed from Azerbaijani officials to various outlets in this country. As well as that, London&#8217;s open economic environment has been a key centre for raising finance for companies or individuals over whom there are now very considerable question marks.<\/p><p pid=\"a337.1\/3\">In 2017, En+ was floated on the London stock exchange, raising &#163;1.5 billion from international investors in an initial public offering. We now know&#8212;well, we knew at the time&#8212;that En+ was very closely associated with Oleg Deripaska, despite his ownership of companies linked to supplying Russian military materials and sanctioned Russian shareholders. He himself is now sanctioned, I believe. En+ and Oleg Deripaska were part of a considerable lobbying effort by a former Member of the House of Lords&#8212;a former Conservative Minister, as much as it shames me to say it&#8212;to separate Deripaska from En+ in frankly pretty questionable circumstances.<\/p><p pid=\"a337.1\/4\">Shortly after the Skripal poisoning, Russia continued to sell Russian sovereign debt in London, facilitated by the sanctioned Russian bank VTB. While our financial services provide anonymity to those who wish to invest, many UK legal firms have sought to further silence those who question the origin of investments.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"d826.0\/1\">I thank the Prime Minister for an advance copy of his statement.<\/p><p pid=\"d826.0\/2\">What should have been a summit focused on global economic recovery and delivering clear commitments on climate change was sadly overshadowed by the unjustifiable actions of Russia and its illegal war in Ukraine. Civilian infrastructure was targeted across Ukraine and a war of aggression rumbled on as world leaders tried to reach agreement.<\/p><p pid=\"d826.0\/3\">Whatever the outcome of the investigation into the missile incident in Poland, it is a stark reminder of the danger that Russia&#8217;s unjustifiable war has brought to the border of our NATO allies. We must remain vigilant and united in our opposition to this pointless and brutal conflict. As I have said many times from this Dispatch Box and to the Prime Minister personally, whatever other differences we may have across the House&#8212;and there are many&#8212;when it comes to the defence of Ukraine, we stand as one.<\/p><p pid=\"d826.0\/4\">On behalf of Members across the House, I send our condolences to those killed in Poland. Poland&#8217;s measured reaction to the incident and the calm heads that have prevailed over the past two days are welcome. I listened carefully to what the Prime Minister said about that and I agree with him that no country can be blamed for defending itself. We need to get to the bottom of this. Obviously, the investigation is ongoing, but when does the Prime Minister expect those investigations to be finalised?<\/p><p pid=\"d826.0\/5\">Russia is losing this war, so I welcome the G20&#8217;s communiqu&#233;, which set out:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"d826.0\/6\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"d826.0\/7\">Has further support for Ukraine been discussed among western allies? What efforts are taking place to open a diplomatic road map to rid Ukraine of Russian troops and bring an end to the conflict?<\/p><p pid=\"d826.0\/8\">It is crucial that we work to find international unity to further isolate Putin. That will include working with China. We do not underestimate the challenges that China poses to global security and we must defend the human rights of the Uyghur and democracy in Hong Kong, but our approach must be measured, and it is in our interest to work with China on the climate crisis, trade and, most importantly, isolating Putin. I was glad to see constructive dialogue on those issues between President Biden and President Xi. Does the Prime Minister believe that the summit marks a change in west and China relations, and are his Government now taking a different approach from his predecessor to British-China relations?<\/p><p pid=\"d826.0\/9\">After a decade of low growth in this country, it is crucial that we open new trade opportunities. The Prime Minister said that he had met Prime Minister Modi, when a future UK-India trade deal was discussed. That deal has previously been put in doubt by his Home Secretary, who indicated that she would not support it. Labour does support a trade deal with India, which we believe can bring new opportunities to promote and create new jobs here in Britain. Will the Prime Minister tell us when he now expects the deal to be completed, and whether measures on visas will be included in the overall deal? If so, can he guarantee that his whole Cabinet will actually support it? Will he also tell us whether in his meeting with President Biden, the UK-US trade deal was discussed&#8212;or can we assume that this deal now has no prospect of being delivered any time soon?<\/p><p pid=\"d826.0\/10\">Lastly, may I ask the Prime Minister whether the Northern Ireland protocol was raised by either US or EU colleagues? Failure to make progress is hurting British research, development and trade, all at a time when we need to remove barriers for British business. Fixing this issue could lead to a better relationship with our biggest trading partners, an opportunity for our scientists and exporters, and an end to the past two years of unnecessary fights and division; so when is the Prime Minister going to deliver?<\/p><p pid=\"d826.0\/11\">Our international alliances have never been so crucial, for global stability and our own stability. We on the Opposition side of the House know that standing up to Russia's aggression will require further sacrifices, but we must make those sacrifices because taking no action is not an option. The message from all of us must be clear: Ukraine will win and Putin will lose. Democracy and liberty will defeat imperialism again.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>As a Member for North Wales, of course, my first trip racing, as a new convert to the sport, was to where else but Bangor-on-Dee racecourse within my region, to which I was actually invited by the British Horseracing Authority, along with some other Members of the Senedd, who I'm glad to see are here this evening. The day started, of course, with a trip to Oliver Greenall racing to visit a racehorse training yard, which is something we're not usually exposed to when we see coverage of training. There are over 500 such vital rural businesses across Britain, 20 here in Wales, and, I have to say, you'd struggle to find more hard-working and dedicated people than stable staff. They're up at the crack of dawn, and they work 365 days a year to make sure, of course, that their horses receive the love and the care that they need in order to be at their best on the track. We then, of course, after that visit, went to the racecourse&#8212;an experience I would thoroughly recommend to anyone who has yet to go racing, because if you're looking for a day out with a group of friends, or even a family looking for a family fun race day, there is something for everyone&#8212;genuinely, something for everyone.<\/p><p>Now, there were over 160,000 visits to Bangor-on-Dee, Chepstow and Ffos Las in the last non-COVID affected year of 2019. That's a significant figure that struck me as something I hadn't realised, I have to say, but, of course, I know now from chairing the cross party-group on horse-racing here in the Senedd that the industry is particularly keen to work with the Welsh Government on expanding that number, given, of course, the huge potential economic benefits this could bring to all parties involved.<\/p><p>I recently had the opportunity to attend the Welsh racing awards, an annual event that recognises the significant achievements by members of the Welsh horse-racing community, both human and equine, and I was thrilled to find out just how successful Welsh-trained or owned horses have been over the past 12 months. We've had major wins at the Cheltenham Festival by the Evan Williams trained Coole Cody, and at Royal Ascot from the David Evans trained Rohaan. Both are positively representing Wales at some of the UK&#8217;s biggest sporting events, which are extremely competitive, of course, and involve international competition. Furthermore, David Probert and Sean Bowen are also in the top five jockeys in the country on the flat and over jumps respectively. But, of course, maintaining this success and growing the sector to realise even greater achievements and even more significant economic impacts would also require support from the Government. Now, I&#8217;ve been told that horse-racing is the third most followed sport in Wales in terms of attendances, behind football and rugby, but I&#8217;m not sure it receives anything like the same recognition in terms of its significance, and certainly in terms of its wider economic contribution.<\/p><p>Now, in racing, prize money acts as the lifeblood of the industry. It helps not only to sustain owners&#8217; critical investment in the industry, on which, I have to say, many don't receive a significant financial return, but it also supports training, businesses and the livelihoods of hundreds of the sport&#8217;s participants here in Wales. That also then, of course, drives that broader economic activity through the wider rural economy here in Wales. Owing to a range of factors, including the level of return from betting activity through statutory and commercial channels to the racing industry, racing across Britain faces increasing challenges in achieving competitive levels of prize money. On a measure of prize money per race, British racing now sits behind other major competitor jurisdictions, including Ireland, France, Australia, the United States, Hong Kong and Japan. Now, these competitor jurisdictions are continuing to drive prize money increases, and offering, of course, significant incentives for British owners to relocate their investment. Previous economic modelling has suggested that every 20 racehorses in training deliver around &#163;1 million in direct and indirect economic benefits, so there are real negative economic consequences if there is a contraction in this particular sector.<\/p><p>Now, the UK Government is, by statute, required to review the rate of the horse-race betting levy, currently set at 10 per cent of betting operators' gross profit on British racing. They need to review it by no later than 2024. And this provides a critical opportunity, I believe, for the imbalance in prize money to be rectified. The levy also, of course, provides critical investment in integrity, in training and education and, importantly, in equine welfare. And I'd just like to say a few words about equine welfare, because, through the levy, British racing has spent almost &#163;40 million on funding veterinary science or veterinary education projects aimed at improving the understanding of equine physiology and disease prevention. In March 2019, British racing established a new horse welfare board, independently chaired by Barry Johnson, a former president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, and with political representation on it as well from Tracey Crouch MP. The horse welfare board has published a comprehensive, five-year strategic plan called 'A life well lived', which was published in 2020, and its publication represents a landmark moment for British racing, providing, for the first time, a single, overarching welfare strategy, building on the many projects already under way across the industry to raise welfare standards and to improve safety levels for horses. Work is currently under way on 17 of the projects recommended by the horse welfare board, and &#163;3 million-worth of funding has been announced today, as it happens, to extend the horse welfare board's work through to 2025.<\/p><p>But, coming back to the horse-race betting levy, I know the Welsh racing industry would very much appreciate any representations that the Deputy Minister can make to her counterpart at Westminster and at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to expedite the review to support the industry in Wales. And I'd be very happy to follow up with a briefing on this subject, if the Minister should wish. And I can see her nodding, so I'm looking forward to her contribution even more now later on.<\/p><p>We have a real success story here in Wales when it comes to horse-racing, which isn't always recognised, maybe, as it should be, and I firmly believe there are clear benefits and opportunities for the Welsh Government from engaging constructively with racing here in Wales. And to that end, I was delighted to see that the Deputy Minister visited Chepstow in the summer, and I would be even more delighted if she accepted my invitation for her to join me for a day's racing in Bangor-on-Dee so that she can see what racing in north Wales has to offer as well. [<em>Interruption<\/em>.] Yes. Other Members can come along as well, yes, of course, of course. But I would urge the Minister and her Government to continue to proactively engage with and to support the Welsh racing industry, as there will be clear benefits in so many ways.<\/p><p>So, I thank you once again, Llywydd, for the opportunity to bring this debate forward. I very much look forward to other Members' contributions and to the Minister's response on this vital and successful industry for Wales. Diolch.<\/p>",

We are talking about a way of improving transparency, accepting that the new clause is not the perfect answer.<\/p><p>English limited partnerships have no directors, but they do have individuals required to sign paperwork, and the formation agencies that help to establish such limited partnerships often hire proxies to do that. A great example of that is Ruth Neidhart, a 71-year-old Swiss national who lived in Cyprus. She is a ceramic artist, she sometimes arranges pottery painting sessions for children&#8217;s birthday parties, and she has been signing documents for a formation agency called IOS since at least early 2009. We see that see that she has signed 161 of these ELPs since 2016 and has links to IOS companies in Nevis, the British Virgin Islands, Belize and the Bahamas, all offshore firms that have been used to form UK shell companies.<\/p><p>Alexandru Terna, a 32-year-old Romanian who lives on a busy road junction in west London in what is described as &#8220;a modest house&#8221;, has signed 306 of these ELPs. He said in an email to Finance Uncovered, which covered the story:<\/p><p class=\"indent\">&#8220;We worked only with [LAS],&#8221;<\/p><p>the formation agent. He added:<\/p><p class=\"indent\">&#8220;We have never been involved in the management or control of any of these companies or any other company, where we were appointed as signatories.&#8221;<\/p><p>I thought that was interesting. Then we have the infamous Moldovan bank fraud, where $1 billion vanished from three Moldovan banks in just two days through limited partnerships&#8212;a series of Hong Kong and UK-registered companies. The new owners took over the bank in 2012, buying shares and using funds from UK limited companies.<\/p><p>The Government argue that these limited partnerships are not legally separate from their partners and so they cannot be beneficially owned. However, the person of significant control requirements require control&#8212;that is the issue&#8212;and not necessarily ownership. There does not have to be separate legal personality and ownership for there to be significant control, and if there is a corporate partner, there must be a human being controlling that corporate partner. The corporate partner cannot exist without somebody controlling it.<\/p><p>The PSC is defined as somebody with more than 25% of assets or more than 25% of voting share, or&#8212;this is another aspect of the definition&#8212;who exercises significant influence or control over the business. In practice, all the leaked documents we have seen from journalists show that formation agencies routinely create ELPs and issue clients with documents that declare them as beneficial owners, so they use that term anyway; they see them as beneficial owners. Indeed, ELPs also open bank accounts. There is somebody behind them, and we need to try to get to that person.<\/p><p>I accept that what we are proposing is not a perfect answer, but I think it is better than the status quo. We would get nominees putting themselves forward, and we would get company service providers declared as persons of significant control, but the same nominee appearing frequently would be a red flag, and company service providers reappearing in relation to lots of companies would also be a red flag. Remember: transparency is the best disinfectant.<\/p>",

He has a skill that I can only aspire to.<\/p><p pid=\"b213.0\/2\">This is a serious issue, though, so with your indulgence, Madam Deputy Speaker, I will set out some of the context. I would first point with pride to the UK&#8217;s history of aiding those in genuine distress. In the last two years, we have opened our doors to an unprecedented 350,000 people fleeing conflict around the world, in Ukraine and in Afghanistan, or persecution in Hong Kong. It is the disposition of the people of these islands to be welcoming. It is also their expectation that laws be upheld and the character of our country preserved.<\/p><p pid=\"b213.0\/3\">It is the work of Government to balance these desires, but this is an Opposition day debate, and regrettably they have turned instead to the study of the smallest part. That is not necessarily a bad thing. Indeed, lessons are there to be learned, and I am grateful for their concern for the speck in our eye, but it is the responsibility of Government to keep sight of the big picture and real-world context, so let me briefly set this debate in the real-world context of what is happening in communities up and down the country.<\/p><p pid=\"b213.0\/4\">Last Sunday evening, I received a wave of concerned messages and phone calls from constituents of mine living in the community of Dolgarrog, and they were not about papers. I must explain that Dolgarrog is a rural Snowdonia village of around 400 residents. It is a tight-knit, deeply hospitable and Welsh-speaking community. It has its own rich history, woven with aspiration and with tragedy, and it has been my privilege to get to know this during my time as MP. By way of setting this in context, residents there address each other by name and children walk to their school. It came as a shock to them, and this is the reason for the calls to me on Sunday evening, when they discovered that the local hotel had been procured as overflow accommodation for asylum seekers. Overnight, the community found that its population had increased&#8212;<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a61.0\/1\">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs Cummins, and I thank <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Tim Farron\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11923\">the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron)<\/phrase> for securing a debate of such importance for my city of York. I will focus mainly on the hospitality sector, but I will also stray into a few other sectors where we are certainly experiencing skills shortages.<\/p><p pid=\"a61.0\/2\">To realise York&#8217;s potential productivity, and ultimately the value of the pound, we cannot stand still, which is why the debate is timely. We need to move forward by putting pragmatism ahead of ideology in order to understand the reality of particular sectors and local economies across the country, to focus on the data, which speaks so loudly, and to listen to sector leaders across our communities to ensure that their aspirations for their industries can be realised, and that we are not left short of potential opportunities that people want to bring to the economy.<\/p><p pid=\"a61.0\/3\">On Friday, I met York&#8217;s hospitality sector leaders&#8212;people from hotels, visitor attractions, restaurants and others&#8212;to talk about the challenges that we face in our city. Of course, the issue of skills shortages was high on the agenda. We have 1,605 enterprises in York&#8217;s hospitality sector, which employs 20,000 people, two thirds of them part time. It is growing, which is encouraging. Our  &#8220;Skills for Employment&#8221; strategy&#8212;a 10-year plan for skills that Lee Probert, the principal of York College, assembled for our city&#8212;highlights the fact that the sector grew by 7.8% between 2017 and 2020, so we have a great opportunity to consolidate it. However, many places cannot open their doors full time, and with the cost of living crisis hitting hard, businesses are struggling and we need to ensure that we get the labour. They live hand to mouth with the innovation that they are able to bring. They got to the summer, got to half term, and they are going to get to Christmas, but, come January, they are worried not only about the great freeze, but about the freeze in business itself. They are really worried about that, and I hope the Minister will talk to his colleagues in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport about the cliff edge that the sector faces.<\/p><p pid=\"a61.0\/4\">People in the sector do not want to limp from season to season. They want to be able to plan. When they plan, they can put in place their skills strategy. When they plan, they have the headspace and can grow their industry, whether in the supply chain or directly facing their customers. We therefore have to build resilience into the system. We are fortunate. We have around 40,000 students across York, which helps to address some of the capacity issues, but not by itself.<\/p><p pid=\"a61.0\/5\">Some businesses are doing incredible work. The Grand in York has taken refugees from Ukraine and supported people into employment, ensuring that there is a labour supply. It has also provided wider skills, including language courses, and has provided support even if people then move elsewhere in the sector. That is a positive sign of a good employer with the ability to invest, but not every employer has the margins to be able to do that.<\/p><p pid=\"a61.0\/6\">In York, we have a skills strategy for 10 years in the city, but it will not be enough when we are near 100% employment. That is why we need to look further afield to ensure that we have a supply of labour coming into the city.<\/p><p pid=\"a61.0\/7\">The Yorkshire hospitality sector has put together a three to five-year plan, looking at the cliff edges in front of it and highlighting the fact that only 5% of young people see a future in the hospitality sector. Again, we need to ensure that we have a supply of labour. The sector is using innovation as much as possible, with skills camps and academies in order to deliver so much more, but the workforce is not sufficient. That is why I turn, as other colleagues have, to the report by the Select Committee on Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. It highlights the scale of vacancies across the economy now, so we know we cannot stand still on this issue.<\/p><p pid=\"a61.0\/8\">The youth mobility scheme is excellent. It gives young people the opportunity to come to the UK, learn the language and skills and have vital life experience. When we look at the list of countries we have heard about today&#8212;Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Iceland, Hong Kong, India, Canada, South Korea, Monaco, San Marino and Taiwan&#8212;we do not have any EU countries on that list. With regard to the aim of bringing 1,000 people over to the UK, if we compare San Marino&#8217;s population of 34,000 with the EU&#8217;s 446.8 million, the Government&#8217;s thinking seems to demonstrate a disparity. We need the movement of young people to be expedited so that they come and support our economy and our labour market, and see that investment in their future and our future, too. It is a perfect scheme that would work for my city of York, where people can really enjoy the sector.<\/p><p pid=\"a61.0\/9\">We do have a challenge, and I am going to be very straight and honest about this. As has been mentioned in this debate, we need sufficient housing, and we need to address that urgently because of the cost of living in York and the Airbnb situation. The flipping of private rented accommodation into Airbnbs means that we need to ensure we have suitable housing for people when they come and give to our local economies. We must have systems in place to support the city.<\/p><p pid=\"a61.0\/10\">I want to highlight an opportunity to the Minister. I know he is working hard on the issue of those seeking asylum in the UK, but these people come with skills. That is why I ask him to look at the shortage occupation list to see whether we can passport people with skills into the economy, so that we can utilise the skills that people bring and ensure that we are not experiencing labour shortages in certain areas.<\/p><p pid=\"a61.0\/11\">York is about to receive 450 people into a hotel in the city. They will get an incredibly warm welcome and lots of support from the infrastructure within York. We will provide people with a home for as long as they are with us. However, if they are not able to work, that is a missed opportunity for them and for us. That is why we need to ensure that we enable people to both utilise and gain skills while they are with us. We recognise that people need time to get oriented and to heal their trauma, but engaging in good employment will give them the opportunities that they need and that our city needs. It is such a waste of talent, skill and life if people are just waiting in hotels for their claims to be processed. We want that process to be expedited, but while they wait, we welcome their employment across our industries. Those people then build relationships in the city, which gives greater security not only to them but to all of us. I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind and ensure that there is more opportunity for those individuals in future.<\/p><p pid=\"a61.0\/12\">The tourism and hospitality sector has the advantage that it can use its resources to pay staff slightly more than other sectors. As a result, people have been sucked out of the care sector. Indeed, I will end by speaking about the care sector. The scale of vacancies is affecting the delivery of social care and the ability to discharge patients from hospital. That means people cannot get in the front door and we have an NHS crisis. Not being able to bring care workers into the UK because they do not fit into the points-based system seems completely ludicrous and self-defeating.<\/p><p pid=\"a61.0\/13\">I trust that the Minister will look specifically at social care and the opportunity to bring highly skilled staff to the UK to deliver that vital role, so that all our constituents can have the care that they need, as we would expect. Not only are we in a crisis now, with 165,000 vacancies in social care nationally; given that 28% of care workers are over the age of 55, will have a greater crisis in future. That must be sorted out. I trust that the Minister will look at ways in which we can bring in young people and other people with skills, albeit for the short term, until we have the labour supply. However long it takes, we need to address those crises.<\/p><p pid=\"a61.0\/14\">I am calling for pragmatism over ideology. I am sure the Minister understands that our communities must be heard and that the skills they require must be met. It is for him to deliver that.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a50.0\/1\">My hon. Friend raises two important points. First, we are very concerned that a large number of individuals, certainly all those coming across in small boats, have transited through multiple safe countries before choosing to make the crossing to the UK. We do not want to be a country that attracts asylum shoppers. We want people to be seeking asylum in the first safe country that they enter. That may necessitate further changes to the law. We want to have a legal framework that is broadly based on individuals who are fleeing genuine persecution, such as war or serious human rights abuses, finding refuge in the UK through safe and legal routes, such as the highly effective resettlement schemes that we have established in recent years for, for example, Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine and Hong Kong. My hon. Friend was right to say that his constituents in Ipswich, like millions of people across the country, broadly support that approach and have played an important role in recent months, for example by taking in refugees under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. We do not want people to be encouraged by people smugglers to cross the channel illegally and then find refuge in  the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a50.0\/2\">The second point that my hon. Friend raises, which is equally perceptive, is that the UK&#8217;s asylum system grants asylum to a higher proportion of applicants than those of some comparable countries, such as France and Germany. The Home Secretary and I are looking at that issue in some detail to see whether we can make changes to the way we manage the process and the criteria we adopt, not so that we become a country that is unwelcoming or ungenerous&#8212;that is not the British way&#8212;but so that we do not create an additional pull factor to the UK over and above other countries that are signatories to exactly the same conventions and treaties to which the UK is party.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a87.4\/1\">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. There is an issue at the bigger end of the spectrum, with the involvement of potentially hostile foreign Governments, but right underneath that there are a number of individuals going to great lengths to disguise where the money ultimately comes from and to disguise their identities. I will come on to that issue in relation to  Birmingham City football club. The business model that that creates for football is not sustainable and should not be tolerated in something so vital to the fabric of our national life.<\/p><p pid=\"a87.4\/2\">In the end, as the fan-led review found, it is the regulatory underlaps and overlaps in the current system that are allowing bad behaviour to fall through the cracks, meaning that some clubs are left in severe financial distress. The Premier League and the English Football League have their own owners and directors tests, but given that there are several examples of unsuitable owners passing these tests&#8212;including those with a history of bankruptcy, those engaged in legal disputes with other football clubs, and even those with serious criminal convictions&#8212;let us just say that the tests do not fill anyone with any confidence whatsoever. The fan-led review laid bare all of those issues and the need for an independent regulator and a complete overhaul of the current system in order to prevent the collapse of football clubs across the country.<\/p><p pid=\"a87.4\/3\">I am desperate to make sure that Birmingham City football club can be rescued from its current predicament and put on a sustainable footing. It is one of the oldest football clubs in the country. It was founded in 1875 in Small Heath, which much of the country will know as peak &#8220;Peaky Blinders&#8221; territory, and which is also the part of Birmingham that I was born and raised in. It acted as a rifle range for training soldiers in world war one, and like much of Small Heath it was bombed during world war two. It is steeped in history and has a heritage that Brummies across the city are proud of, but for many years Blues fans have watched with devastation as financial and professional mismanagement has driven their beloved club to the brink.<\/p><p pid=\"a87.4\/4\">In 2009 the club was bought by Hong Kong-based businessman Carson Yeung, who was sentenced to six years in prison on money laundering charges just two years later. The club was then bought out of administration in 2016 by the current owners, Birmingham Sports Holders Ltd, a company that is backed up by a convoluted network of shell companies and overseas stakeholders. With a crumbling stadium and a far removed invisible ownership, points deductions and crippling debts, the club continues to swing from crisis to crisis. The once premier league team has not finished higher than 17th for six years in a row.<\/p><p pid=\"a87.4\/5\">How did our beloved club get to this point? The first issue is debt, which <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"James Daly\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25905\">the hon. Member for Bury North (James Daly)<\/phrase> has also raised, which has put the club&#8217;s finances under significant strain. The 2021 accounts reveal that the Blues spent &#163;37 million more cash than they generated from day-to-day activities and that they are grappling with over &#163;120 million of debt.<\/p><p pid=\"a87.4\/6\">It is well known why and how clubs can get themselves into such eye-watering levels of debt. As the fan-led review notes, our current system creates misaligned incentives, with clubs spending to the hilt to get promoted to higher leagues in order to secure bigger TV deals and financial rewards. This creates an incredibly destructive cycle. The current lack of regulation also means that football clubs can find themselves hostage to malevolent forces acting with intent other than the sustainability of the football club that they have acquired.<\/p><p pid=\"a87.4\/7\">What compounds those issues in the case of Birmingham City is its significant reliance on parent companies to bail it out of financial trouble. Birmingham City&#8217;s loss would have been much higher had it not been compensated  by major shareholder and chief executive officer of Oriental Rainbow Investments, Vong Pech. The club now owes his company more than &#163;22 million, raising serious questions about its financial position. The club&#8217;s own accounts state that there is<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a87.4\/8\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;a material uncertainty casting significant doubt about company&#8217;s ability to continue&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"a87.4\/9\">but<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a87.4\/10\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;the directors remain in the view the company can obtain required funding from parent or ultimate parent.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a87.4\/11\">The fan-led review evidences how it was that these exact practices led to the collapse of Bury football club. As soon as an owner is no longer interested or able to invest, the club faces ruin. This is the worst-case scenario that Blues fans dread, but it shows that across English football a completely unsuitable business model has been allowed to take hold, and it is not sustainable.<\/p>",

I congratulate <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Alyn Smith\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25848\">the hon. Member for Stirling (Alyn Smith)<\/phrase> for bringing this debate about, and I welcome the Minister of State, Department for Education, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Robert Halfon\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24784\">the right hon. Member for Harlow (Robert Halfon)<\/phrase>, to his new role.<\/p><p pid=\"a420.0\/2\">We have heard widely about the passion for higher education across these islands. The hon. Member for Stirling talked about its importance and power to inform, enlighten and aid discovery. We heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Kate Green\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24896\">the Member for Stretford and Urmston (Kate Green)<\/phrase> not just about the economic contribution that universities make, but about how they are cultural, social and economic powerhouses. My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Paul Blomfield\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24943\">the Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield)<\/phrase> talked about the soft power that our institutions have earned among Governments and institutions around the world, and the great achievements of the APPG. It is not just the size of the contribution that our institutions make that is so impressive; their cultural, societal and economic value cumulatively adds to the UK&#8217;s global reputation.<\/p><p pid=\"a420.0\/3\">Let us be clear: the UK is the aspiration destination for most international students. Through a powerful combination of our world-class lecturers, leading facilities and institutions&#8217; international standing, UK higher education is the benchmark around the world. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield Central said, that is clearly seen in the Higher Education Policy Institute&#8217;s soft power index, in which the UK is positioned second.<\/p><p pid=\"a420.0\/4\">The virtues of British higher education are reflected and amplified through Governments and leaders around the world. Closer to home, international students turn university campuses into melting pots of cultures, traditions, languages and thinking. Only two weeks ago during a visit to Oxford Brookes University, I sat around a table with half a dozen students hailing from Bulgaria, Nigeria and Hong Kong, as well as from the UK, all studying international development and sustainability. They were  using their individual experiences from back home to help to shape their learning and that of their fellow students. Many expressed a desire to return to their country of birth to show what they had learned from their lecturers and fellow students, but many want to stay.<\/p><p pid=\"a420.0\/5\">International students add enormous value to the UK economy and research base. The Entrepreneurs Network estimates that nearly half of Britain&#8217;s 100 fastest-growing start-ups have at least one immigrant co-founder. That leads me nicely on to the economic value of international students. Their precise economic value is really secondary to the wider social and cultural benefits that they bring, but it is still an important contribution to the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a420.0\/6\">Research conducted by The London Economic and HEPI, commissioned by Universities UK, found that the 2018-19 cohort of international students delivered a net economic benefit of &#163;26 billion to the UK economy. Although our economic benefit is most concentrated in London, as we have heard, the material benefit to each of our constituencies is marked, ranging from &#163;460 per constituent in the north-east and Scotland to &#163;330 per constituent in the south-east, and a staggering &#163;2,200 in Sheffield Central. In spite of the clear and obvious benefits that international students bring to the UK, Government rhetoric on migration, including international students, has tarnished the UK&#8217;s reputation as the aspiration destination&#8212;a point made by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Carol Monaghan\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25406\">the hon. Member for Glasgow North West (Carol Monaghan)<\/phrase>.<\/p><p pid=\"a420.0\/7\">I note the fiscal black hole caused by the recent Budget, which hovers at &#163;40 billion to &#163;50 billion. Let us put that into the context of the &#163;26 billion that international students bring to the UK. It is important that we welcome international students and do all we can to enhance our reputation rather than to trash it. Two weeks ago it was suggested that the then Home Secretary was set to announce sweeping reforms that would have seen international student numbers capped and limits imposed on the number of dependents that international students can bring. Not long before that statement was due, she resigned. Policies such as those, circulating in a sea of chaos at the heart of Government, dent the UK&#8217;s international reputation and risk putting off international students. I urge the Minister to set out his Department&#8217;s commitment to international student numbers and to seek a commitment from the Home Secretary that international students will not be the latest front in her culture war.<\/p><p pid=\"a420.0\/8\">In contrast, Labour is fully committed to protecting, encouraging and advancing the interests of all students, including international students. A simple comparative approach between the replacement Erasmus+ scheme in Labour-run Wales and SNP-run Scotland shows that, where action is required, Labour will always put opportunity for our young people ahead of political manoeuvres. Earlier this year, the Labour Government in Wales launched Taith.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a194.0\/1\">My Lords, I believe that it is the duty of the person finishing off the speeches by the many Back-Benchers who have spoken to somehow entertain. I fear that I am going to disappoint. However, I will admit to the fact that Lady Constance Lytton was the younger sister of one of my ancestors&#8212;my grandfather&#8212;and that, in another part of the family, my great-grandfather Wilfrid Scawen Blunt was imprisoned in Ireland for daring to have the temerity to defend the Irish tenantry against the eviction by their landlords. He went to Kilmainham Gaol, which was a tough old place. I therefore stand before you as tainted goods. I am bound to say that it follows that my sympathy tends towards the last resorts of protest and demonstration, irritating and disruptive though those actions may be.<\/p><p pid=\"a194.0\/2\">I can understand what it is like to not be heard or to feel you are not, and even to be consciously ignored or confronted with what might be described as a pitifully limited outcome&#8212;targets, policy objectives, pious words, but precious little action. That lies behind some of what we are dealing with in our democratic processes, because it is almost as if that particular process and forum is passing a sector of society by. They do not feel that they have a voice in that, and that is our problem.<\/p><p pid=\"a194.0\/3\">My email briefing suggests that the voices particularly of young, worried and committed citizens are not being heard&#8212;or, at any rate, not resulting in any appropriate resolve. This might suggest that the current arrangements need to be adjusted to accommodate additional platforms for dialogue and concomitant response, rather than seeking to aggregate powers to the Executive at the price of reduced freedoms for the people. If, as I am told, there are growing barriers of mistrust and disenchantment with party politics, then we have a duty to be more open-minded and take a more positive stance.<\/p><p pid=\"a194.0\/4\">It is not as if climate concern demonstrators, for instance, are not amply reinforced by report after report from national and international climate change expert committees, especially if the 1.5 degree global warming target is a train about to leave the station. Even something as basic as the immediate banning of non-recyclable plastics seems beyond our wits to implement, and regulators have not prevented raw sewage discharges into inland and coastal waters. So where are the protections? That is the question that is being asked.<\/p><p pid=\"a194.0\/5\">There is a dialogue to be entered into here, and if the place for that dialogue is not to be this Parliament or some other effective platform then the inevitable outcome is demonstration and direct action. Noble Lords posed the question about the degree to which clamping down would result in deteriorating outcomes. I associate myself with that point: better engagement is key.<\/p><p pid=\"a194.0\/6\">I accept that the right to demonstrate must be exercised reasonably, but I do not see where the overriding need is for these additional measures. Are they  proportionate and will they be effective? As far as I am aware, there has been little or no post-legislative evaluation of the measures we already have in law, particularly those most recently passed under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act. If they are now muddled and confused then we need consolidation and clarification, not to extend things on to the statute book.<\/p><p pid=\"a194.0\/7\">The police, with due respect to noble Lords who have that background, may well be happy to have additional powers: what organisation vested with statutory authority and a sense of its own noble purpose would not&#8212;but will then doubtless follow it up with a demand for additional resources? But essential need is the test here, not a desire for further aggregation of power. That said, our police forces generally have a very good track record of dealing with demonstrators, and particularly of distinguishing the violent anarchist from the vocal activist. My sense, reinforced by what I have heard in the House today, is that we have enough laws to enable them to do their work and to distinguish legitimate protest from the subversive undermining of society. Adding the measures in this Bill could risk alienating police and people, and indeed dividing society in ways that I suggest are more associated with authoritarian regimes elsewhere around the globe.<\/p><p pid=\"a194.0\/8\">I want to be sure that this is not some attempt to snuff out legitimate questioning of government policies, or the Government insulating themselves from difficult questions, but some of the processes in the Bill&#8212;the dilution and reversal of the burdens of proof, the blanket application of certain measures and woolly definitions&#8212;seem a bit Orwellian in scope and intent. Some of the details and definitions are incredibly vague and open to arbitrary interpretation. The provisions for stop and search without reasonable suspicion are extremely troubling. I am not an expert in this field but my instincts are to reject these provisions, because increasingly oppressive tactics in the name of the state merely engender a similar response from elements of society. I want to break that link.<\/p><p pid=\"a194.0\/9\">There is one last thing. Other noble Lords have mentioned that this country has a long tradition of tolerating dissent and responding to justified demonstrations, and an international reputation for freedom of speech, fair lawmaking and justice via an independent judiciary. Perceptions matter. We need to operate proportionately. We speak as a nation in support of basic democratic rights in places such as Hong Kong, for justice in the face of oppression in Myanmar, for women who suffer discrimination in Iran, in support of Black Lives Matter in the United States, and against religious, sectarian and racial oppression everywhere. Yet here, in 2022, we are come to what I can only describe as this disproportionately framed Bill. I simply ask myself: what compels the Government to propose these measures at the expense of trust, long-established custom, and our nation&#8217;s reputation and credibility on such slender justification?<\/p>",

The carrying of telephones&#8212;just switched off&#8212;into meetings is a security risk, because they can be switched back on and used as microphones. We know that.

This is about everything it does, such as the trashing of Hong Kong, the Uyghurs, taking over the South China seas and the attacks on people like me and others, including the Minister, as sanctionees. Will he make sure, first of all, that we lift China back into that bracket as a threat, treat them as a threat and do not excuse it? For those of us who are sanctioned, it would be marvellous if the Foreign Office or even Parliament were capable of giving us any advice about what happens to our families when they have to travel. I find it remarkable that when we ask them that question, we have no idea of what limitations that poses on us, even today.<\/p>",

Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Margaret Greenwood\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25349\">the Member for Wirral West (Margaret Greenwood)<\/phrase>, who always makes such a compelling case for public ownership. I was pleased that she mentioned the escalating privatisation of the national health service, which she has worked hard to expose. It seems to me, and to many others, that the Government have an ideological opposition to public ownership: no matter the evidence, reality or public opinion, the Government will resist it.<\/p><p pid=\"a253.1\/2\">Let us take a look at the petition that secured today&#8217;s debate: 109,000 people signed it, showing the strength of support for bringing energy into public ownership. A Survation poll this year showed that not a bare majority of the public, but 66%, believe that energy should be in public ownership. That includes a majority of Conservative party voters, and maybe even members too. The energy sector is being used as a cash cow for shareholders. We have an energy system that is privatised at every single stage&#8212;generation, transmission, distribution and supply. That means that at every opportunity, profits are extracted so there are higher bills for ordinary people, and so there is less investment and a worse service, resulting in a failure to make the green transition work.<\/p><p pid=\"a253.1\/3\">Let us take the big six energy suppliers. Common Wealth shows that &#163;47 billion-worth of dividends and share buy-backs have occurred since 2010. That money should have been in a public system, but it goes much deeper than that. Even the National Grid is paying out billions each year in dividends. It is lose-lose for everyone, apart from those who own our system. Who does own energy? Other states have bought our system, as is the case with EDF, for example. So have billionaires. Northern Powergrid is owned by the US billionaire Warren Buffett. UK Power Networks is owned by the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing.<\/p><p pid=\"a253.1\/4\">The high prices are not just about the global crisis. Of course, we are in a global crisis, but privatisation makes it much worse. In many other countries, energy bills have not increased as they have here. Their Governments are using public ownership as a tool to help people. In France, for example, publicly owned EDF kept energy bill rises to just 4% in April 2022, while our prices soared and soared. Norway has been paying 80% of people&#8217;s bills above a capped price.<\/p><p pid=\"a253.1\/5\">Even before the current energy crisis began, domestic energy bills steadily increased by 50% in real terms&#8212;inflation-adjusted&#8212;from 1996 to 2018. We see and people out there feel what privatisation means in practice. In practice, privatisation of our energy system means higher bills than needed. Research shows that prices are 20% to 30% lower in systems with public ownership. Privatisation means, in practice, wasting vital funds on lining the pockets of shareholders. Privatisation means, in practice, failing to invest enough in connecting renewable energy to the grid, with the needs of the current fossil fuel firms put first.<\/p><p pid=\"a253.1\/6\">What is the way forward? This petition, signed by well over 100,000 people, shows the way forward: nationalise the big five energy supply retail companies, most of which are just owned by bigger companies anyway. I welcome the plan from the TUC setting out how a publicly owned energy retail system could deliver a social pricing structure that lets everyone afford the energy they need to cook, clean and stay warm all year round, while the wealthiest with extravagant energy use pay more per unit. The way forward is also to bring the privatised monopolies of the National Grid and regional distribution into public ownership to help us prepare for the energy transition that we need. The way forward must include introducing permanent&#8212;and high&#8212;windfall taxes on North sea oil and gas companies that use the revenues to cut people&#8217;s bills, invest in renewable energy and pay for further nationalisation policies that will benefit the country.<\/p><p pid=\"a253.1\/7\">We must create a new state-owned renewable energy company to ensure that the errors of privatisation are not repeated. It is useful to reflect on the fact that nine out of 10 countries leading on green transition have a state-owned company leading the way on renewables. We cannot become fixated on continuing and defending privatisation because of ideological dogma and the hero worship of the Thatcher period. As someone once said, &#8220;What matters is what works.&#8221; Public ownership works; privatisation has failed. Let us have an energy system that puts people and planet before profit. If we do, that is a good way to set about helping to get people through this cost of living crisis and making way for a better, greener, fairer and more decent future.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1698.1\/1\">I am grateful to the noble Lord. He will be glad to know that I will come to Ukraine as one of the two examples I want to give your Lordships&#8217; House as I proceed with my remarks.<\/p><p pid=\"a1698.1\/2\">The meticulous analysis that I referred to and shared with the Minister was written before the shocking discovery of mass graves in Bucha and the hunting down of the Hazara in Afghanistan. How will that be assessed? How will those responsible, like those in North Korea, be held to account? In preceding debates, I have provided details of some of the genocides I have mentioned. Today, I shall refer to and focus on the two cases I have already mentioned.<\/p><p pid=\"a1698.1\/3\">In the second half of 2021, as the Taliban reimposed its rule on Afghanistan, the Hazara once again became a reviled target. Over the months that have followed, we have witnessed specific attacks on Hazara mosques and the bombing of schools and other community places in the predominantly Hazara regions. These targeted attacks increased in April and May and have led to hundreds of people being killed. On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-09-03\">3 September<\/phrase>, the Hazara inquiry, a joint effort of cross-party parliamentarians from both Houses and experts working together revealed atrocities and called for the promotion of justice for the Hazara in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in a report which we published.<\/p><p pid=\"a1698.1\/4\">As a member of the inquiry team, I chaired some of the hearings and met with several members of the Hazara community. I sent that report to the Minister. It focuses on the situation in Afghanistan since 2021. It found that Hazara in Afghanistan, as a religious and ethnic minority, are at serious risk of genocide at the hands of Islamic State Khorasan Province&#8212;IS-K&#8212;and the Taliban. Our findings reiterate the responsibility of all states to protect the Hazara and prevent a possible genocide, as we are required to do under the genocide convention and customary international law.<\/p><p pid=\"a1698.1\/5\">The Taliban have reversed the 20-year progress made in addressing the marginalisation and discrimination experienced by the Hazara minority&#8212;gains that were referred to in the report on Afghanistan by your Lordships&#8217; International Relations and Defence Committee, on which I serve. The return to power of the Taliban has included brutal acts of violence against the Hazara throughout Afghanistan and a return to terror. In August 2022 alone, IS-K claimed responsibility for several attacks that resulted in over 120 fatalities in a  matter of days. Witnesses told me that they anticipate further attacks because of inaction and impunity in response to the targeting of the Hazara&#8212;a trend that is likely to continue.<\/p><p pid=\"a1698.1\/6\">This underlines the pressing need, in line with our international obligations, at least to examine the evidence, make a determination, and protect the Hazara with at least the knowledge that those responsible for these crimes might one day face justice. Many of us have met Afghans, including some of those women judges who fled to the safety of this country. Their passion for the rule of law is one we must share, and we must not allow &#8220;baffling reasons&#8221; to prevent us doing so.<\/p><p pid=\"a1698.1\/7\">Even closer to home, 2022 has shown us that atrocity crimes, and possibly even genocide, may well be happening on European soil in Ukraine. In questions, speeches and letters to Ministers, and during a debate I initiated on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-07-21\">21 July<\/phrase> on &#8220;Food Insecurity in Developing Countries due to the Blockade of Ukrainian Ports&#8221;, in which the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, the noble Lord, Lord Collins, and others in your Lordships&#8217; House participated, I have repeatedly asked for greater clarity on the determination we are attaching to Putin&#8217;s atrocities, and encouraged the Minister to invite the International Criminal Court prosecutor, Karim Khan KC, to visit your Lordships&#8217; House to brief us on the ICC&#8217;s actions and intentions. I encourage the Minister to facilitate that.<\/p><p pid=\"a1698.1\/8\">Since Putin&#8217;s illegal war on Ukraine began on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-02-24\">24 February<\/phrase>, evidence of atrocity crimes, be it war crimes, crimes against humanity and even possible genocide, has accumulated. In May 2022, the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights and the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy published a legal analysis of the serious risk of genocide in Ukraine and Russia&#8217;s incitement to commit genocide. The report makes two important findings: first, of the existence of a serious risk of genocide; and, secondly, of the direct and public incitement to commit genocide. Among other findings, the report cites a litany of open-source data in relation to both findings, including evidence of mass killings, torture, the use of rape and sexual violence, and deportations of children to Russia, about which I have corresponded with the Minister.<\/p><p pid=\"a1698.1\/9\">On the serious risk of genocide, the report analyses the risk factors specific to genocide, as per the UN&#8217;s Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes, focusing on evidence of Russia&#8217;s denial of the very existence of Ukrainians as a people; the history of atrocities committed with impunity; past conflicts over resources or political participation; and signs of genocidal intent, including<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1698.1\/10\">&#8220;documentation of incitement, targeted physical destruction, widespread or systematic violence, measures that seriously affect reproductive rights or contemplate forcible transfer of children, dehumanizing violence, use of prohibited weapons, strong expressions of approval at control over the protected group, and attacks against homes, farms, and cultural or religious symbols and property.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1698.1\/11\">No one can deny that these risk factors have been there for a long time, inexorably culminating in Putin&#8217;s unleashing of horrific atrocities.<\/p><p pid=\"a1698.1\/12\">If this has not concentrated our minds on the urgency of a new approach to genocide in this country, most likely nothing ever will. Instead of offering the  same old platitudes, it is time to open our eyes to the evidence that is before us, recognise it for what it is, and act upon it.<\/p><p pid=\"a1698.1\/13\">This Bill would introduce two important mechanisms: one that would empower victims of genocidal atrocities to have the genocide determined by a competent court; and one that would ensure checks and balances, transparency and oversight over the Government&#8217;s response to genocide globally.<\/p><p pid=\"a1698.1\/14\">Let me spell it out. First, in Clause 1, the Bill empowers victims by way of equipping a person or group belonging to a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, or an organisation representing such a person or group, with the power to apply to a court for a preliminary determination that there is a serious risk of genocide or that genocide is being or has been committed. Indeed, we know that, in order to implement the duty to prevent genocide, as explained by the International Court of Justice in its 2007 judgment, a state is required to act upon the serious risk of genocide rather than wait until genocide is being perpetrated.<\/p><p pid=\"a1698.1\/15\">The preliminary determination is not the end goal in itself. No: it is a crucial determination to trigger responses. Indeed, Clause 3 states that, once the court has made a preliminary determination, the Secretary of State must refer the determination as a finding of a United Kingdom judicial body to the country standing accused of the crime, to other countries that are parties to the genocide convention, and to other bodies, including the International Court of Justice and the United Nations Security Council.<\/p><p pid=\"a1698.1\/16\">Secondly, in Clause 2 the Bill ensures checks and balances, transparency and oversight over our government responses to genocide globally by way of expanding the already existing mechanism for genocide responses in Section 3 of the Trade Act 2021.<\/p><p pid=\"a1698.1\/17\">To conclude, the Bill enjoys all-party support. It provides for the same mechanism as the so-called &#8220;genocide amendment&#8221; that was carried by a majority of 153 and 171 in this House.<\/p><p pid=\"a1698.1\/18\">Earlier this year, on the anniversary of being sanctioned by the Chinese Communist Party for my actions in relation to the Uighurs and Hong Kong, I was invited, with the other six sanctioned parliamentarians, to a meeting at 10 Downing Street. The then Prime Minister and the then Foreign Secretary told us that they would support the reform of how we deal with genocide. Here is an opportunity for the Government to honour that promise. I beg to move.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1590.0\/1\">My Lords, this is my first opportunity to welcome the Minister to his position, and I wish him well. I also pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Popat, not only for initiating this  debate but for his record in business, as a government Minister and certainly as a trade envoy. I have had a few conversations with him about that, and, like him, I think it is right for him to point out the tremendous economic progress that has been made in Uganda. I too welcome the presence of Her Excellency the high commissioner. However, as I have said before to the noble Lord, Lord Popat, I hope that he and Her Excellency will recognise that a successful and inclusive society is one that respects and protects all minorities and marginal groups within it. I hope my comments will be fully understood in that regard.<\/p><p pid=\"b1590.0\/2\">The 50th anniversary is a time for both reflection and celebration. There should be reflection on what was experienced by Ugandan Asians who were forcibly expelled from their home and arrived in the UK to an uncertain future. There should also be absolute celebration, as we heard in this debate, both of the communities who welcomed their new neighbours in so many different ways and of the contribution that the Ugandan Asian population has made to those communities and to our national life.<\/p><p pid=\"b1590.0\/3\">It has been good to hear the memories of Members across the House of that period. I welcomed the recollections of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt&#8212;for me, he remains a &#8220;young Conservative&#8221;. As to my own memories, I cannot compete with others, but I was then an active member of the Spelthorne Young Socialists. Sadly, when we as a borough&#8212;the Labour group, as well as the Conservative group&#8212;tried to ensure that there was a proper housing allocation to welcome the Ugandan Asians, I recall trying to defend my Labour councillors from physical attack during the demonstration that was held outside that town hall, made up of, sadly, hundreds of people in our community. Of course, Spelthorne is now the constituency of Kwasi Kwarteng, which shows how communities and people have obviously changed. We have to reflect on that.<\/p><p pid=\"b1590.0\/4\">It was a pleasure to hear my noble friend Lord Bach speak of his experience in Leicester, where it was estimated that one in five of those who came to the UK would permanently settle. The Leicester experience shows the complexities of our history; my noble friend referred to that notorious advert that was placed in a newspaper in Kampala.<\/p><p pid=\"b1590.0\/5\">When we talk about our history, we must also be honest about the darker parts of it: the discrimination which this community was faced with in different parts of the country, and the racist activities of people&#8212;we have heard reference to the National Front. The noble Lord, Lord Balfe, referred to the trade union movement. In my own union&#8212;the dockers were members of the Transport and General Workers&#8217; Union following the meat porters at Smithfield who marched in support of Enoch Powell&#8212;there was change in my union movement, but it was a lot slower than the noble Lord mentioned.<\/p><p pid=\"b1590.0\/6\">That change is testament to those who stood against racism and have shown determination and bravery to defend those who came here to be part of our community. I pay particular tribute to my noble friend Lord Morris of Handsworth, who was part of that Windrush generation&#8212;people who came to this country post war to help us rebuild our communities and build our national health service. Sadly, that generation later  faced a &#8220;hostile environment&#8221;. We must learn the lessons of that. You cannot turn the clock back; people have memories about that.<\/p><p pid=\"b1590.0\/7\">We have heard about the immense contribution that the Ugandan Asian community has made to the United Kingdom in particular. Many people were highlighted by the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, and I will not repeat them, but I also reflect on the fact that it is an achievement for a country to have a Prime Minister of south Asian descent. It is important for our society.<\/p><p pid=\"b1590.0\/8\">I listened intently to the contribution of the noble Baroness, Lady Verma. I am part of that generation in the Labour Party who are determined for our party to remain the party of aspiration and enterprise. We will certainly continue to do that as we face some of the actions of the Government ahead. We must recognise that migrants have enriched our communities. They have built businesses, served our NHS and, as I just mentioned, made a significant contribution to our politics. Britain has some excellent stories to tell of welcoming those people.<\/p><p pid=\"b1590.0\/9\">More recently, we have had the Hong Kong scheme and the immense generosity of the British public to those fleeing war in Ukraine. I must say that on Ukraine it has been the generosity of the public that we should recognise, while the Government&#8217;s handling of visas, for example, has caused delays and real difficulties. A visa scheme that left very young children waiting for months for a visa, despite having a safe British home waiting for them, and families having to travel with young children for hundreds of miles across Europe to get biometrics is not a good example.<\/p><p pid=\"b1590.0\/10\">It is not enough to tell the tale that we have a proud history of integration and providing a home to those who are forced to leave theirs; it must also be woven into our future. I, too, reflected on the debate 10 years ago, reading in particular the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, who quoted somebody that I would not normally, but I will on this occasion: the late Baroness Thatcher. She said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1590.0\/11\">&#8220;a new resilience derived from diversity can only strengthen Britain&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b1590.0\/12\">I completely agree with her. The noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, also said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1590.0\/13\">&#8220;we are in a global race and Britain has a secret weapon: the races from around the globe that make up our diverse nation. These people have ingenuity, resilience, determination and links and networks around the world.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class=\"offrep\" id=\", 6\/12\/12; col. 825.]\"><i>Official Report<\/i>, 6\/12\/12; col. 825.]<\/phrase><\/p><p pid=\"b1590.0\/14\">These words are even more relevant 10 years on, in our very insecure world. How we treat people domestically is also how we are seen globally. It is very hard to be optimistic about that while the policy of deportations to Rwanda of those seeking asylum, fleeing torture and horrors, still stands.<\/p><p pid=\"b1590.0\/15\">As well as marking this anniversary and celebrating parts of this history, we must also ask ourselves what lessons we should continue to learn from it and how they can be applied to British life for the next 50 years. My noble friend Lady Donaghy also mentioned elements of the speech made 10 years ago by the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, who, in her response, spelled out very  concrete actions that the Government were taking for everyone to play a full part in our lives. She said then that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1590.0\/16\">&#8220;the things that stop people getting on are the same things that stop people getting on with each other.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class=\"offrep\" id=\", 6\/12\/12; col. 825.]\"><i>Official Report<\/i>, 6\/12\/12; col. 825.]<\/phrase><\/p><p pid=\"b1590.0\/17\">That is a lesson for us all, but one particularly for this Government in the weeks ahead.<\/p>",

I welcome the Bill, and particularly clause 24 because of its competitiveness duty, for which I have campaigned for quite some time. I would prefer it to be a primary objective, and perhaps the Minister will look into that, but if we keep it in its current form, then we have to go further for it to be meaningful. There must be proper metrics to ensure that the regulator follows up on it. For that reason, I support the amendments put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon.<\/p><p>In the evidence sessions, I was surprised to hear that the FCA was not aware of any other regulator that had a competitiveness duty. That is quite worrying. It seemed slightly detached from what our competitors are doing. We need to ensure that the FCA is pressed hard on this issue, and that there is a clear, stated objective for them to promote competitiveness in the industry. To be clear, this is not at all about lowering standards. The FCA said in its evidence that it considers jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and Australia to be robust financial centres. They all have a competitiveness duty, so a duty of that kind can be beneficial.<\/p><p>Let me put this into context by giving the example of insurance-linked securities. The FCA created regulations regarding them, which Singapore then lifted&#8212;took and used. Because of Singapore&#8217;s competitiveness duty, we lost one firm midway through the process. In the same timeframe, 15 firms have been regulated there, against five in this country. The estimated loss is around $700 million. That is money out of our economy that could come our way with just this simple change.<\/p><p>There is a similar story on captives. We do not have any set up here. The reason cited is over-burdensome regulation. The industry agrees that there needs to be regulation, but it needs to be proportionate, and we need to ensure that it does not block investment in this country. I hope the Minister will consider the amendments and see what can be done to strengthen the measures.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c402.1\/1\">I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for her kind words about my appointment. I was honoured to be appointed by the Prime Minister 48 hours ago to  help my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary to lead the Home Office forward, and to tackle issues, such as this, which are of the greatest concern to the British public.<\/p><p pid=\"c402.1\/2\">We want to build a fair immigration system that enables people who come to the UK via safe and legal routes to do so, while also being robust in dealing with those who choose to come here illegally. It is not right that people smugglers are enabling people to risk their lives in dangerous channel crossings. Individuals often come from safe countries, and at the expense of people we would want to bring to this country, such as those from Hong Kong, Afghanistan and Ukraine.<\/p><p pid=\"c402.1\/3\">With regard to the right hon. Lady&#8217;s specific questions, I was of course concerned to read the evidence that was presented to her Committee yesterday by David Neal, the independent chief inspector. I will meet Mr Neal next week, and will listen directly to his concerns. I intend to visit Manston as soon as possible&#8212;hopefully next week.<\/p><p pid=\"c402.1\/4\">We want to ensure that the site is maintained legally, of course. It is absolutely essential that any site that the Home Office operates is managed within the law. Mr Neal raised a number of concerns, and I will refer briefly to as many of them as possible. With regard to the conditions for individuals staying at the site, the site was designed to be temporary. Individuals who enter it are supposed to stay for only a matter of hours&#8212;perhaps 24 hours at a maximum&#8212;and as a result the facilities are temporary. People are none the less given accommodation that is heated and has air conditioning, food and medical supplies. Families are prioritised for better accommodation and for swift opportunities to leave for hotel accommodation.<\/p><p pid=\"c402.1\/5\">I was concerned at Mr Neal&#8217;s suggestion that there had been a degree of unrest and of health considerations. I am told that, although there have been some incidents, the site is mainly stable, but I will take that up further and see for myself when I visit. There have been a very small number of cases of diphtheria. Those individuals were isolated and public health guidelines were immediately followed, and a permanent ward, with a doctor, has been created to manage that situation.<\/p><p pid=\"c402.1\/6\">Our longer-term plan is clearly to reduce the population at Manston as quickly as is practicable. The numbers that I read out in my opening remarks show that the population of the site is reducing, but that is dependent on the numbers coming across the channel, so our longer-term aim has to be to strongly deter people from making that extremely dangerous crossing of the channel, and to use all means available to us. I hope that that aim can unite us across the House. It cannot be right for individuals to leave a safe country&#8212;our closest, safest ally: France&#8212;to risk their lives coming to the United Kingdom. In doing so, and by coming to sites such as Manston, they are putting immense pressure on the system, meaning that we are unable to fulfil our obligations to individuals who come safely and legally from Ukraine, Afghanistan and other countries, who must be the first priority of the UK Government.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1423.0\/1\">My Lords, in all this discussion, not enough is said about the horror of what was experienced in the years leading up to the Good Friday agreement. We are forgetting that. In the language of decency in the House of Lords, we are allowing ourselves to somehow not remember the full horror of that period. That horror was rooted in inequality, a lack of rights for certain people in the community, and a strong sense that the only way towards peace was to somehow protect the rights and equalities of people in Northern Ireland. You would not have got people to the table if there had not been a very honest discussion about the pain, loss and suffering that came out of those inequalities. I can say this as somebody who did more trials involving those Troubles than probably anybody in this House.<\/p><p pid=\"a1423.0\/2\">The noble Lord, Lord Bew, said that the primacy of the Good Friday agreement is there in the protocol. All I can say is, let us remind ourselves of that and what was at the heart of the Good Friday agreement: a recognition that the platform on which rights were being premised was the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Justice&#8217;s protection of rights. So, when it came to the protocol, a formula had to be found to protect rights. One of the things  that was part of that commitment was that, in order to deal with the strong sense of injustice that had led to the Good Friday agreement, there should be no diminution of rights going forward, and that in the protocol we would be committing ourselves to making sure that rights would follow into Northern Ireland as they developed in Europe. Of course, that is one of the things that members of the DUP are not too happy about. They do not like the idea that there might ultimately be some place in which solutions are found when there is conflict over rights and the development of rights.<\/p><p pid=\"a1423.0\/3\">Noble Lords will remember that at the heart of the whole Brexit debate was the idea that we had to disentangle ourselves from European courts. There is still a whole section of the UKIP-driven Conservative Party that even wants to leave the European Convention on Human Rights. This House should not forget that rights and equality and the pursuit of them was part and parcel of the Good Friday agreement. That is why people are sensitive; it is not talked about sufficiently in this House.<\/p><p pid=\"a1423.0\/4\">If we are to have impact statements, and if we have some time to look at what the implications of the Bill might be, I would like us to look at its implications when it comes to that very carefully drawn set of protections for rights and equality in Northern Ireland which was at the basis of the Good Friday agreement, and which has to be still in our minds as we talk about the protocol. I am afraid that that is being lost in the whole business of whether there are going to be tariffs and so on. Of course, those matters are of vital importance, but there are other rights in here as well. That is why I am in favour of some delay, because I would like to see a proper assessment of the impact of the Bill, in a deep way, on that carefully wrought Good Friday agreement, which was about rights and equality as much as other things&#8212;actually, it was fundamentally about that.<\/p><p pid=\"a1423.0\/5\">I also want to know why we are not seeing the legal opinion which says what our position is with regard to international law. There is not a lawyer in this House who does not agree that this is an affront to international law, as I mentioned last time. On Monday of this week there was a meeting in this House about the treatment of Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong. He is a media owner being put on trial under the new national security law because of the erosion of the rule of law in Hong Kong. We want to say that that is an affront to international law because of the agreement made with China over Hong Kong&#8217;s future, but how can we say that with any kind of respect in the world when we are doing this to another international treaty because it has become inconvenient to us? That really is wrong, and I would like an impact assessment on the human rights implications of this piece of legislation.<\/p>",

I thank <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Scott Benton\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25800\">the hon. Member for Blackpool South (Scott Benton)<\/phrase> for presenting the petition. I am very much in favour of retaining the Human Rights Act as it is. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Joanna Cherry\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25404\">The hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh South West (Joanna Cherry)<\/phrase> said that there might be a need to do some tweaking or make some changes. I am not against that, provided we have a chance to discuss it and see what the changes are. However, I am very much of the opinion that the Human Rights Act should be retained as it is.<\/p><p pid=\"a38.0\/2\">I start by thanking all the 230,000 people who signed the online petition to stop reform of the Human Rights Act. That is almost a quarter of a million people who voiced their objection to human rights being diluted in any circumstance, and I believe that they reflect the views of possibly millions more people. Certainly, people to whom I speak in my constituency want things left as they are. All these people oppose moves to make the Government less accountable, and support increasing the ability of people in need to make human rights claims; I, too, think there is a need to have that opportunity in the law.<\/p><p pid=\"a38.0\/3\">To give an idea of just how many people 230,000 are, that is twice the population of even the largest constituency in the UK, and it is about one in eight voters in Northern Ireland, which has a population of 2 million people. This is not a fringe issue; it is a massive issue. The correspondence that I receive on it tells me that people are deeply concerned about it.<\/p><p pid=\"a38.0\/4\">In fact, as a general rule, people want more human rights safeguards in place, not fewer. A third of the population of the United Kingdom believes that the UK Government are not doing enough to promote human rights abroad. I am very pleased to see the Minister in his place, and I will make some comments about human rights abroad. As everyone knows, I chair the all-party parliamentary group on international freedom of religion or belief, and I am a deep and strong believer that when it comes to making trade deals with any country in the world, the key to that process must be regard for human rights, including people&#8217;s liberty to serve and worship their god as they wish. I know that the Government are committed to that; I understand that. However, I still want to put that on the record.<\/p><p pid=\"a38.0\/5\">As I say, a third of people in the UK believe that the UK is not doing enough to promote human rights abroad; I think that the Government are quite active, but people tell me otherwise. Almost three quarters of  the British public agree that the UK should take into consideration a country&#8217;s human rights standards when negotiating or signing a deal with it. More than half of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland agrees that the amount of foreign aid given to a country should be tied to its performance against human rights standards; I fully support that condition. When I ask questions of Ministers with responsibility for different parts of the world about that, I am encouraged by what they say happens in that regard.<\/p><p pid=\"a38.0\/6\">If this Government&#8212;my Government&#8212;are to reform human rights, they should make the standards higher. Let us do human rights better, rather than water them down. If that is what the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh South West is saying&#8212;I think it is&#8212;I agree that we should do that, rather than make the legislation more dependent on the Government&#8217;s economic and trade interests.<\/p><p pid=\"a38.0\/7\">Human Rights Watch said to the Joint Committee on Human Rights that the repeal of the Human Rights Act would<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a38.0\/8\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;weaken human rights protections&#8230;and send a negative signal globally about the value of international human rights standards and the worth the UK government attaches to them.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a38.0\/9\">I am confident that the Minister does not want that to be the opinion of those who look at the United Kingdom from outside. I think many would agree that that is a scathing assessment of the impact that any repeal would have.<\/p><p pid=\"a38.0\/10\">Globally, human rights have never been under greater threat. We know about all the things that are happening in Putin&#8217;s war in Ukraine. Every one of us is dismayed, disgusted and angered by it, and our Government and our Ministers have taken strong action. We all watched the protests across the villages, towns and cities of Iran. Ladies were often at the fore in those protests; they are the ones feeling the brunt of it. More than 400 people have been killed&#8212;most of them women and children&#8212;and almost 20,000 have been arrested, all looking for freedom, liberty and human rights. We support that. Then there is China&#8217;s treatment of the Hongkongers, not just in Hong Kong but in Manchester, as we witnessed the week before last. We want human rights observed in this country as well as in Hong Kong. The bombings of schools in Afghanistan are human rights abuses. It is really quite annoying. Those are things that have made the headlines in just the past month. If we are to continue to be a global champion of human rights, we cannot let the message be lost. What we do at home is so important.<\/p><p pid=\"a38.0\/11\">Hon. Members have made fantastic contributions, and I endorse all of them. Many have a greater knowledge than I do. In my capacity as chair of the APPG for international freedom of religion or belief, I am frequently in dialogue with civil society organisations and Government representatives from countries where freedom of religion or belief is a major concern. When I talk to all those groups from across the world, it is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&#8217;s leading influence in the defence of human rights that makes bilateral accountability possible. That is vital. I and many others are concerned that replacing the Human Rights Act with a Bill of Rights would send to those countries the message that the UK does not practise what it preaches. That is the interpretation they will make. I am sure that the Minister will respond positively and lay that to bed.  We must see human rights as an absolute good in themselves, and not as a means to an end. Such transparently selfish interests would inevitably undermine attempts to promote human rights abroad, and would do far more harm than good.<\/p><p pid=\"a38.0\/12\">The Human Rights Act should be left as it is. There are many in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and many more across this great world, whom we have a duty to protect. We need the Human Rights Act, not a Bill of Rights, but if we change the Act, we should make it better. I cannot and will not agree to the dilution of the current provisions.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b905.0\/1\">This is the first debate for a long time in which I have agreed with every single word of the motion, so I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Peter Aldous\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24904\">the Member for Waveney (Peter Aldous)<\/phrase> and <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Judith Cummins\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25393\">the hon. Member for Bradford South (Judith Cummins)<\/phrase>. Frankly, we and all our constituents are concerned about the growing crisis in NHS dentistry. We are worried that nine out of 10 practices are not accepting new NHS patients, including large numbers of children. We also regret the number of dentists who are moving away from NHS practice. Those are all issues to which all hon. Members could strongly relate, if they were here.<\/p><p pid=\"b905.0\/2\">I have been asking myself how the problem came to be and what can be done. First, it strikes me that there is a wider issue with the delivery of public services. Governments will always be judged on the same things: whether they can achieve economic growth to provide jobs and fund public services; whether they can manage those public services competently; and whether they can do so with compassion so that our most vulnerable constituents are looked after. In the health and care sector as a whole, there is no doubt that there are significant challenges in all three aspects. Dentistry is just one aspect of the effective delivery of public services, an issue that we all recognise from emails and telephone calls with often very frustrated constituents.<\/p><p pid=\"b905.0\/3\">However, there is a particular aspect of dentistry that is unique. With acute hospitals, mental health services, ambulance trusts and so on, MPs have some agency: we can organise regular meetings with NHS trusts, hold  them to account, ask difficult questions, discuss problems and find out what they need from the Government. With dentistry we have no agency, because the local NHS organisations&#8212;they are currently known as integrated care systems, but frankly in most of our constituencies it is easier to refer to them as the local NHS&#8212;have no agency. They have no say in the contracts between NHS England and the dentists.<\/p><p pid=\"b905.0\/4\">As my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Paul Beresford\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10041\">the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford)<\/phrase> helpfully pointed out, the contracts go back to 2006. Most of us have no idea what is in them. I have never seen them; I was not aware of them. No dental association, nationally or locally, has ever contacted me&#8212;or, I suspect, many of us&#8212;to say that there is a problem that needs to be resolved or to ask for help. The first we hear of it is when constituents contact us to say, &#8220;I cannot get an NHS dental appointment for myself, my children or my family.&#8221; At that stage, we go back to the local dentists and ask what the problem is.<\/p><p pid=\"b905.0\/5\">This is what a local dentist in Gloucester has come back with:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b905.0\/6\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;The majority of dentists move away from the NHS because of the continual pressures that the NHS contract places upon them in terms of requirements, payments, audits&#8230;and many other factors&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b905.0\/7\">She writes that an NHS dentist in her surgery, who has ceased to be an NHS dentist,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b905.0\/8\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;was under a prototype contract that was patient-centric and when this was discontinued and changed to align with the usual NHS contract, the dentist did not feel this gave the best type of care for patients&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b905.0\/9\">She goes on to say:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b905.0\/10\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;I&#8217;ve continually battled&#8221;&#8212;<\/p><p pid=\"b905.0\/11\">she has been doing this for 25 years, by the way&#8212;<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b905.0\/12\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;to ensure that any patients who want NHS dental services should be able to access them, but there needs to be correct remuneration for the time and quality of services, removing a treadmill of patient care.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b905.0\/13\">That suggests that there is a problem with the contract, as my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney rightly says, as well as the problem of there being no local NHS involvement.<\/p><p pid=\"b905.0\/14\">I welcome the Minister to his role. I know that he will bring to it the same quality of analysis and compassion that he brought to his role in the Department for Work and Pensions. I hope that he will look closely at how the contracts can and should be changed&#8212;I believe that there is a window of opportunity in April&#8212;to allow all local NHS organisations to play a key role in the distribution of resources, emphasis, recruitment and so on. We will then finally have some agency, so we can do better than replying to our constituents with &#8220;I am very sorry to hear this, but there is absolutely nothing I can do,&#8221; which frankly is more or less the situation at the moment.<\/p><p pid=\"b905.0\/15\">Several colleagues have helpfully indicated solutions beyond the contract. I agree with the point about making it far easier for dentists, whether they come from the nations of the Commonwealth, such as New Zealand and Australia&#8212;mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley&#8212;or from India or Hong Kong, which is another example that was given earlier. The Government clearly have an opportunity to do something about this if they wish, not just in the short term but in the longer term, and I hope the Minister will give us some good news in that regard.<\/p><p pid=\"b905.0\/16\">There is also the issue of skills and training. Setting up a new dental school, first, takes time; secondly, is expensive; and thirdly, will not solve short-term problems, although we do need to look at capacity for the longer term. There is a continuing problem with longer-term thinking&#8212;in the context of public services, and indeed in other contexts&#8212;to which all Governments have been susceptible for too long.<\/p><p pid=\"b905.0\/17\">The private sector certainly has a role to play. At the risk of plugging a particular organisation, I will mention an organisation of which I think the Minister will be aware: Genix, which has a training facility in Leeds. Its founder and CEO, Mustafa Mohammed, has a strong track record of supporting the whole business of upskilling and training dentists and providing NHS dentistry services around the country. Let me reassure my constituents and others who feel that dentistry is an entirely public-sector activity by saying that just as the private sector, through GP surgeries, plays such an important part in, for example, the delivery of covid vaccinations, it can play an important part in dentistry as well.<\/p><p pid=\"b905.0\/18\">There is, in fact, a role for a mixed economy, and, as was pointed out earlier, there is an opportunity for some short-term contracts. Perhaps the Department could step in directly, with NHS England, to provide relief for those in pain and for those with children who may never have seen a dentist in their short lives. I am sure we would all welcome that.<\/p><p pid=\"b905.0\/19\">That leads me to the question of what some term the nanny state&#8212;the role of education and proselytising about the value, particularly for young families, of getting stuck in with toothpaste and toothbrushes, and, perhaps, the opportunity to relieve them of VAT. We know that, just as with education, if things start well there is a strong likelihood that they will continue well, whereas if they start badly and people&#8217;s teeth do not get the treatment they need at an early stage, there will be problems later. I believe that the Government have an opportunity to play a part in this, although not uniquely, for everyone can play a part; and I hope the Minister will allude to that as well when he winds up the debate.<\/p><p pid=\"b905.0\/20\">Let me finally say that dentistry clearly needs to be represented in local NHS bodies&#8212;especially if they are actually going to play a role in it, which I very much hope they will&#8212;and that cash will be crucial. Nothing comes cheaply, but I think we can all agree that sorting out dentistry and making sure everyone has access to NHS dentists is a very precious cause, and we all hope we will find solutions fast.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b842.2\/1\">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his question and deeply aware of the strength of feeling in this House and the other place about the scenes of violence at the consulate of the People&#8217;s Republic of China in Manchester on Sunday afternoon. I am happy to provide an update on our response. You have been kind enough, Mr Speaker, to indicate that you will allow me to speak for a couple more minutes to set out the position.<\/p><p pid=\"b842.2\/2\">As the House will know, on Sunday afternoon officials were in touch with Greater Manchester police regarding the incident. On Monday, officials spoke to the Chinese embassy to express our very serious concerns at the reports and demand an explanation. FCDO officials were clear that all diplomats and consular staff based in the UK must respect UK laws and regulations. On Tuesday, I announced in this House that the Foreign Secretary had issued a summons to express His Majesty&#8217;s Government&#8217;s deep concern at the incident and demand an explanation for the apparent actions of the staff at the consulate general.<\/p><p pid=\"b842.2\/3\">Following my statement, the Chinese charg&#233; d&#8217;affaires attended a summons at the FCDO in his capacity as acting ambassador. For the avoidance of any doubt, I should say that the Chinese ambassador is currently out of the UK and it is standard practice in such circumstances to summon the charg&#233; d&#8217;affaires. I should also be clear that receiving an official summons from the Foreign Secretary is not, as has been described, a light rap on the knuckles but the delivery of a stern message, well understood within the context of diplomatic protocol. It is customary for senior officials to deliver such messages. These summons are not an invitation for an ambassador to have an audience with the Foreign Secretary or Ministers; in any case, given that the charg&#233; d&#8217;affaires was involved, it was doubly appropriate that they should be delivered by a senior official.<\/p><p pid=\"b842.2\/4\">In the summons the official set out that peaceful protest is a fundamental part of British society and that everyone in the United Kingdom has the right to express their views peacefully and without fear of violence. He reiterated our clear expectation that diplomatic and consular staff should conduct themselves in accordance with UK law. We have made it absolutely clear to the Chinese embassy that the apparent behaviour of consulate general officials during the incident, as it appears from the footage&#8212;more of which is coming out, even as we discuss this&#8212;is completely unacceptable.<\/p><p pid=\"b842.2\/5\">The independent police investigation is now under way. Greater Manchester police have been clear that there are many strands to what is a complex and sensitive inquiry and that it may take some time. As the Foreign Secretary has said, we await the details of the investigation, but in the meantime I have instructed our ambassador  to deliver a clear message directly to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing about the depth of concern at the apparent actions by consulate general staff. Let me be clear that if the police determine that there are grounds to charge any officials, we would expect the Chinese consulate to waive immunity for those officials. If it does not, diplomatic consequences will follow.<\/p><p pid=\"b842.2\/6\">Finally, allow me to reiterate to the House the value that we place on the Hong Kong community in the UK. When the national security law was imposed on Hong Kong in 2020, this Government acted immediately in announcing the scheme for British national overseas status holders and their dependants. Since then, more than 100,000 people and their families have made the decision to move to the UK to live, work and make it their new home. I want to put on the record, here, now, again and officially, a reaffirmation of our unwavering support for them and our commitment to their safety. They are most welcome here. Recognising the interest that this issue has across the House, the Government will seek to update the House on this matter next week.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1160.0\/1\">My Lords, I thank noble Lords for all the contributions that have  been made during this debate, which, as has been observed, was very wide-ranging. There are obviously significant differences of opinion on the subject, so whatever I say I will upset half your Lordships. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, for the spirit of his remarks; I completely understand where he is coming from, and they are noted.<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/2\">I will start by talking through the changes to the Immigration Rules. I will try to deal with all the questions that have been asked of me but, in the time available, I suspect I will struggle. I expect a bout of letter-writing at the end, which I commit to do in full, having studied Hansard.<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/3\">The changes to the Immigration Rules that have been the subject of this debate were made in line with the relevant provisions within the Nationality and Borders Act 2022, as has been observed, which came into force on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-06-28\">28 June<\/phrase>. I remind noble Lords that we debated similar topics extensively throughout the passage of the Nationality and Borders Bill. The guidance was also published on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-06-28\">28 June<\/phrase>, in line with the relevant provisions in the Act. I assure and remind the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, that our policies do not contravene our international obligations, a subject that I will come back to. Everything that we do complies with the refugee convention. I will try to deal with the more specific questions at the end.<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/4\">Your Lordships will excuse me if I do not get into a philosophical discussion about ID cards. However, as an aside, I note that we all carry around a smartphone which probably has far more detail than any ID card ever would, so perhaps it is time to reopen that debate.<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/5\">I take on board the very sensible comments of the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, about the Law Commission. This is a complex subject and we are extremely grateful to the Law Commission for its detailed and constructive work. We have already established a simplification of the rules review committee to look at the drafting and structure of the rules, as part of the multiyear programme of change which is being led by the Home Office. I hope to have some good news for the noble Lord in due course.<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/6\">Pretty much everybody raised the subject of an impact assessment. In essence, the question is whether there will be an impact assessment for group 2 refugees and, if so, when will it be published. As with all our policy changes under the New Plan for Immigration, differentiation will be subject to ongoing monitoring and evaluation, with the operation of our policies being kept under close review. The Home Office routinely publishes migration statistics, which form the basis of our analysis. My predecessor committed to publishing this in due course, and I am also happy to undertake that, but I cannot go further than that at this precise moment.<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/7\">If your Lordships will allow me, I will take this opportunity to explain the purpose and function of the Nationality and Borders Act. Its core objectives are to increase the fairness and efficacy of our asylum system, to deter illegal entry to the UK and to remove those with no right to be here more easily and quickly. Differentiation is designed to discourage individuals from embarking on unnecessarily dangerous journeys to the UK and to arrive by the various safe and legal routes that are available. I will come back to &#8220;safe and  legal&#8221;. It is self-evident that those in need of protection should claim in the first safe country that they reach; that is the fastest route to safety. It is not right that the control of national borders should be suspended to allow people who have already reached safety in countries with fully functioning asylum systems to travel further to another country as a matter of preference. This undermines the broader immigration system and, as has been noted across the House, encourages people to fund criminal gangs and risk their lives trying to get into the UK in unseaworthy vessels or packed dangerously into cars or lorries. We have all seen the tragic results and there are some very uncomfortable statistics about how that sometimes ends.<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/8\">I will briefly touch on the subject raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner. We will come back to golden visas on another Bill so, if she does not mind, I will pass on that for the moment.<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/9\">As I have said, people are losing their lives by making extremely dangerous crossings over the channel. As a responsible Government, we have to do everything in our power to stop these criminal smugglers. I think that is a general point of agreement.<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/10\">I will briefly clarify how differentiation functions. Section 12 of the Nationality and Borders Act introduced two groups of refugees. Individuals who came directly to the UK, claimed asylum without delay and, where appropriate, can show good cause for any illegal entry or presence will be recognised as group 1 refugees. If an individual does not meet all these requirements, they will be deemed a group 2 refugee. Both groups will have full access to the labour market and healthcare. The Act means that we may differentiate between refugees based on their group in a number of ways, including the length of permission to stay granted, the route to settlement, recourse to public funds and family reunion rights. That probably does not go into enough detail for the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, and his more detailed question about that subject so, if he will permit me, I will write rather than waste all the time of the speech.<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/11\">This is what the policy and legislative changes established, with the intention to influence the decision-making of migrants, stopping them turning to criminal smugglers and thus undercutting that business model.<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/12\">The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, asked about the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. There is no specific provision within the refugee convention that defines a certain term or sets out a specific procedure. Where there is no supranational body akin to the European Court of Human Rights, for example, it is open to states to interpret the terms of the refugee convention. Limit is placed on that autonomy to interpret by way of the principles of treaty interpretation in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The general rule of interpretation in Article 31(1) of that convention requires a treaty to<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1160.0\/13\">&#8220;be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/14\">On that basis, we have considered relevant factors, such as the law in other jurisdictions, case law and the words of academics. We believe that all provisions reflect a good-faith, compatible interpretation of the  refugee convention. I appreciate that opinions on that may differ, but the purpose is to discourage asylum seekers from travelling to the UK other than via safe and legal routes. It aims to encourage individuals to seek asylum in the first safe country they reach after fleeing persecution, avoiding dangerous journeys across Europe. The policy is compliant with our international obligations under the refugee convention and the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/15\">The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, asked me about returns to various countries. On a case-by-case basis, we have returned asylum seekers to Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden. I do not believe there are overarching agreements, but it does happen on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/16\">On the subject of internal relocation, all our asylum claims are carefully considered on their individual merits and in accordance with our international obligations. Each individual assessment is made against the background of relevant case law and the latest available information on the country of origin. It has been a long-standing policy that refugee status will not be granted where an individual can internally relocate to another part of their country of origin in safety.<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/17\">I am going to talk now about safe and legal routes. We already welcome thousands of vulnerable people in need of protection to the UK through a number of safe and legal routes, including our resettlement schemes. Our schemes have provided, and will continue to provide, protection in the UK to tens of thousands of people to start new lives in the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/18\">We should consider the magnitude of the schemes, some of which we have referred to over the course of this debate. The UK resettlement scheme is a global scheme that resettles refugees who have been identified for resettlement by the United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR. We have been agile and compassionate in our response to world events, as has been noted.<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/19\">In January this year, the Government launched the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme to provide up to 20,000 individuals with a safe and legal route to resettle the UK. The scheme will prioritise those who have assisted the UK efforts in Afghanistan as well as vulnerable people, including women and girls and members of minority groups who are at risk.<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/20\">As has been noted, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in March 2022 we launched uncapped schemes including the Ukraine family scheme and the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which have so far allowed more than 189,000 individuals to seek sanctuary in the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/21\">To expand on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, I can illustrate this further by reporting that, as of June this year, more than 140,500 British national (overseas) passport holders, threatened, obviously, by the situation in Hong Kong, had submitted visa applications to the UK and 133,124 of those applications have been granted.<\/p><p pid=\"a1160.0\/22\">The Government also provide safe and legal routes to bring families together through their refugee family reunion policy.

The resettlement schemes focus on providing sanctuary to the most vulnerable, as determined by the UNHCR, where refugees satisfy the eligibility criteria for our schemes and UN agencies consider resettlement as being the most appropriate durable solution for their circumstances. That ensures that all our schemes are accessible to all refugees, including members of minority groups. I appreciate that probably does not go far enough to answer that very specific set of circumstances.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I beg to move amendment 19, in clause 1, page 1, leave out subsections (2) and (3).<\/p><p>It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Pritchard. I congratulate the Minister on being knighted. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Hear, hear!&#8221;] It is a pleasure to see him and, indeed, his fellow members of the anti-growth coalition in their places this morning.<\/p><p>Labour Members had hoped that the Bill would provide an opportunity for a much bigger debate on the entirety of the trade agreements with New Zealand and Australia. Sadly, however, the way in which the Bill has been drafted means that it is only the procurement chapters of those agreements that we will be able to debate. I shall illustrate why this is a restrictive approach. There are more than 2,500 pages in the Australia deal&#8212;a  member of my staff has counted them&#8212;but only 30-odd of them are on Government procurement. The New Zealand trade deal has fewer pages, but there are more than 500 of them, with only 30-odd pages on Government procurement. Our opportunities to scrutinise are, therefore, far more restrictive than the House would have liked. None the less, we will raise one or two of the concerns that have been put to us about the Government procurement chapters of both deals.<\/p><p>I should stress at the outset that we welcome increased trade with Australia and New Zealand. They are key allies led by strong, progressive, effective leaders in Anthony Albanese and the incomparable Jacinda Ardern. Their legal systems and value systems are similar to ours, and it makes enormous sense to deepen the economic ties between us.<\/p><p>Our concerns about the procurement chapters arise from the fact that the now Prime Minister appeared to be in a bit of a rush when negotiating both deals. Perhaps one or two mistakes were made and a deal of insufficiently high quality was secured. Members will remember the context in which the Australia deal in particular was negotiated. The flaws in the deal that the now Prime Minster had negotiated with Europe were becoming very obvious, and Ministers were clearly desperate to divert attention from them by negotiating a deal with Australia.<\/p><p>Amendment 19 seeks to delete subsections (2) and (3) from clause 1. Those subsections allow Ministers to extend specific provisions that are included in the UK-Australia and UK-New Zealand agreements, and which go beyond provisions of the Government procurement agreement to all covered procurement. They also bring procurement within the scope of the GPA and other UK trade treaties. These GPA-plus provisions of the UK-Australia free trade agreement could be made part of domestic law and would apply to all suppliers, not just those from Australia. On the GPA-plus elements of FTA clauses relating to estimating values of contracts without a fixed term, the UK-Australia FTA requires that all contracts with unknown value are deemed as covered procurement. Other examples of the so-called GPA-plus provisions that this clause makes available to all suppliers include the advertisement of procurement opportunities and the termination of awarded contracts.<\/p><p>Our amendment seeks to prevent Ministers from quietly slipping into law measures that they have negotiated as part of the trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand, in particular the procurement chapters, that they suddenly think should apply generally. The specific concern that has been brought to our attention relates to contracts of unknown value and length.<\/p><p>Let me go into more detail, to help the Minister and the Committee to understand those concerns. Under current UK rules, contracts of an unknown duration or without a fixed term are advertised only if their estimated cost over 48 months exceeds the relevant value threshold. Under the free trade agreement with Australia, those contracts always have to be advertised. To give effect to the FTA, our domestic UK law will have to be reformed as a result of this Bill.<\/p><p>That surely raises two issues. First, more contracts will have to be advertised, and that will benefit not only Australian tenderers but all tenderers in countries that are members of the Government procurement agreement.  That is because the contract opportunity will be advertised online and will be in English. I will explain shortly why that raises concerns. Secondly, domestic legislation is being reformed as a result of free trade agreement, which gives rise to the question whether a trade discussion is the most appropriate way in which to address reforming UK contract law. It certainly gives rise to the question of how much consultation Ministers have had, not only across Government but with business, industry and others who might be affected.<\/p><p>Why does the Minister think it is a good idea to extend to very other member of the GPA the so-called GPA-plus provisions negotiated as part of the Australia trade deal? That gives rise to an obvious question: does it mean that every other member of the GPA will offer us the same arrangement?<\/p><p>I have been describing the concerns in technical detail, so let me give some specific examples to bring the concern to life. On contracts of unknown value, a contract for office printing&#8212;a pay-as-you-go service&#8212;would come under the scope of the concerns put to us. Let us imagine that a local authority did not want to buy or lease printers, but rather preferred an all-inclusive service comprising availability of equipment, maintenance, help-desk services and supply of paper and other consumables. The contractor would be remunerated on a per-printed-page basis&#8212;a pay-as-you-go price. Let us say that the contract was for five years and that the contracting authority&#8212;a council on its uppers, perhaps, one like Northamptonshire that had either gone bust or very nearly gone bust&#8212;had provided an estimate of the average number of pages printed over the last few years, so as to allow tenderers to price their offers up. However, the contracting authority would not know the total value of the contract at the time of advertising because future consumption could vary.<\/p><p>We have been given similar scenarios that could emerge from cloud computing services. In the cases that I have described, regulation 6(19)(b) of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, which apply at the moment, requires the contracting authority to calculate a likely monthly value of the contract and multiply it by 48 months. If that estimate exceeded the relevant threshold, which is currently just over &#163;213,000, the contract would have to be advertised. If the estimate was below that threshold, it would be possible that no advertisement was required. If the contract was estimated at below &#163;25,000 in value for the next 48 months, there would be no obligation to advertise the contract opportunity at all. The contract could be directly awarded by the local contracting authority, perhaps following a request for tenders to two or three local small and medium-sized enterprises.<\/p><p>Conversely, under the requirements of the UK-Australia free trade agreement&#8217;s procurement chapter&#8212;paragraph 9 of article 16.2&#8212;given that the total value of the contract over its entire duration is not known in the example I gave, there would be an obligation to advertise the contract. Surely that would reduce the chances of local small and medium-sized businesses getting the contract. There seems to be a clear negative potential effect for SMEs that seems at odds with the Government&#8217;s declared policy of boosting SME access to public contracts. Paragraph 13 of the national procurement policy statement refers to that, and paragraph 10 notes as a strategic priority the need to improve<\/p><p class=\"indent\">&#8220;supplier diversity, innovation and resilience&#8221;.<\/p><p>It explicitly refers to the goal of creating a more diverse supply chain to deliver the contracts that will better support start-ups and small and medium-sized businesses in doing business on public sector contracts.<\/p><p>The Minister will remember the clear evidence we heard last Wednesday from Lucy Monks, the Federation of Small Businesses representative, who said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\">&#8220;Small businesses have problems accessing public procurement in the UK as it stands, because they find it technically difficult. They obviously do not have the ability to take the same kind of risks as larger businesses. They might not have the technical departments, lawyers or whoever might support them through that process.&#8221;<\/p><p>She went on to spell out, in even starker terms, that<\/p><p class=\"indent\">&#8220;small and medium-sized enterprises are basically underserved in the UK procurement processes&#8221;.&#8211;&#8211;[Official Report, Trade (Australia and New Zealand) Public Bill Committee, <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-10-12\">12 October<\/phrase> 2022; c. 5.]<\/p><p>SME representatives are already expressing serious concerns that the people they represent are struggling to win sufficient UK Government contracts. It appears that under clause 1(2) and (3), Ministers are about to make the situation even more difficult for SMEs. That is particularly the case because it is not just Australian and New Zealand businesses that might want to try to win these contracts in future; every other member of the Government procurement agreement could also bid for these contracts.<\/p><p>Although it might seem unlikely that GPA members such as firms based in Hong Kong would want to bid for contracts of unknown value, a business based in the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the GPA, could conceivably think, &#8220;Well, now we&#8217;ve got an opportunity to bid for a contract in Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales. It is within the realms of possibility that we could win that contract and offer it for our purposes.&#8221; I gently emphasise to the Minister that he needs to explain not only to the Committee but to SMEs across the UK, which are at the moment able to secure contracts of unknown value and length, why he thinks it is in the interests of our country to make it more difficult for them to do so.<\/p><p>If the printing example has not helped the Committee enough, let me give another example from a different economic sector. The Minister will understand just how important procurement is as a means of supporting the UK&#8217;s food and agricultural industries. To be fair to the Prime Minister, even she understood that role very clearly when she was in a previous role as the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. She published a plan for public procurement, which was designed to help SMEs to win contracts, especially SMEs from the food and agricultural sector.<\/p><p>Public procurement in this type of situation could sometimes involve the direct delivery of agricultural products, perhaps bought in bulk by local government, but that is less likely than the outsourced provision of meal services for schools or the NHS. With that in mind, tenders for meal services can and increasingly tend to include supply chain considerations that can support local agricultural industries through criteria in the contracts that schools and local NHS hospitals set. That involves shortening the supply chains, perhaps as a way of reducing carbon footprint. Again, that is something that one would have thought we all wanted to continue supporting.<\/p><p>Contracts for meal services can be very difficult to price at a tender stage, especially if there is an element of price competition, which is the norm. It might be surprising that school meals are very difficult to price. However, my own offspring often change their minds over whether they want a school meal or a packed lunch, and I imagine that that scenario is mirrored in families across the country. That makes it difficult for those who are setting the tender terms for meal services to be able to guarantee a set amount of products.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b843.0\/1\">My Lords, I too would like to start by reiterating the backing of the Opposition for the Government&#8217;s support for the people of Ukraine, and of course these sanctions are a vital element of that support. I am pleased to see such a  wide range of issues being covered in today&#8217;s measures, which the noble Lord, Lord Purvis, has mentioned. We support these sanctions and measures, but it is only right that this House can scrutinise and understand whether the Government are properly resourcing them. It is one thing having the law; it is another thing to be able to ensure full compliance. I think a lot of my questions will echo those of the noble Lord, Lord Purvis, regarding that question.<\/p><p pid=\"b843.0\/2\">In the other place, the Minister Jesse Norman stressed &#8212;and I accept this&#8212;that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b843.0\/3\">&#8220;the first instinct in a war situation is to get sanctions on the books as quickly as possible.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b843.0\/4\">I noticed what the noble Lord said regarding the Joint Committee, and of course we even had amendments to our Standing Orders to ensure that we could get these in place as quickly as possible. I reassure the Minister that the Opposition will do whatever they can to ensure speedy implementation and adoption of these sanctions.<\/p><p pid=\"b843.0\/5\">Jesse Norman also argued that the sanctions<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b843.0\/6\">&#8220;have been effective because the Treasury Committee has reminded us of that, and we have plenty of other evidence that it is the case.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b843.0\/7\">I would echo the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Purvis, that it would be good to have that assessment in a more political context so that we can properly understand it.<\/p><p pid=\"b843.0\/8\">Jesse Norman also acknowledged that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b843.0\/9\">&#8220;as the situation evolves so we need to evolve the response, and as the concerns about the humanitarian impact and unfairness evolve, the sanctions picture inevitably becomes not merely more widespread and more expensive, but more complex&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class=\"offrep\" id=\", Commons, 22\/9\/22; col. 919]\"><i>Official Report<\/i>, Commons, 22\/9\/22; col. 919]<\/phrase><\/p><p pid=\"b843.0\/10\">But, as my honourable friend Stephen Doughty pointed out, Putin and his cronies will seek every single loophole, omission and error that we may make to try and circumvent the objectives of our sanctions. We must not allow him to do that. We have stressed in many previous sanctions debates&#8212;the Minister will recall my previous comments on this&#8212;that it is critical that we properly resource those units in the FCDO and elsewhere to ensure that they are able not only to draft the appropriate legislation properly but to ensure that we have a proper regime with proper compliance.<\/p><p pid=\"b843.0\/11\">In May, James Cleverly&#8212;then a Minister, now the Foreign Secretary&#8212;told Stephen Doughty that 150 individuals were working full-time in the sanctions taskforce in the FCDO and that the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation had at least doubled in size. He tried to get further clarity about the resourcing going on, and how this is increasing, particularly with sanctions getting more complex. He was promised a written response, but sadly he did not get that&#8212;Jesse Norman did say in the other place that he will ensure that a letter is sent. Jesse Norman also talked about resourcing and referred to<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b843.0\/12\">&#8220;the increase in the size of OFSI, and that is matched by the seriousness with which this issue is taken across Government.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class=\"offrep\" id=\", Commons, 22\/9\/22; col. 920]\"><i>Official Report<\/i>, Commons, 22\/9\/22; col. 920]<\/phrase><\/p><p pid=\"b843.0\/13\">I hope that the Minister will tonight be able to perhaps put a bit more meat on this and give us a more detailed response about our capability and capacity.  In fact, let me put that a different way. I have full support for the staff in the FCDO&#8212;I think we have got some of the best experts, and I certainly admire their commitment and dedication&#8212;but capacity is going to be a critical issue that we need to address. What extra financial resources have been given to those bodies? What conversations has the Minister had with the National Crime Agency to ensure the proper enforcement against those who breach the sanctions regime?<\/p><p pid=\"b843.0\/14\">In the previous debate, as the noble Lord, Lord Purvis, has said, we have both focused on the circumvention of sanctions, and not only on those issues that the noble Lord, Lord Purvis, has mentioned in terms of India. We have also had in the debate in the Commons the question of steel and how that is being exported to one country and then potentially imported to here, so there are areas that we obviously need to consider.<\/p><p pid=\"b843.0\/15\">Also, how much of those resources that were in this country have been able to leak or escape? What assessment have the Government made of where those oligarchs are moving their money to? When I was in a meeting in the City recently, I heard talk about how there was this sudden surge of movement into Istanbul&#8212;I do not think that it is just people who are moving there; other issues are occurring, and that was the impression I got from the City. Of course, the press reported today about how Hong Kong is now becoming a key area for resources, both physical and financial. What assessment have the Government made of that?<\/p><p pid=\"b843.0\/16\">The noble Lord referred tonight to how we are addressing those gaps and working with our allies to do so. As my honourable friend Stephen Doughty said in the other place, it is crucial that we work with some of the best minds around the world to look at other areas where we can bring pressure to bear. My honourable friend mentioned McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, and others, including those from the Ukrainian Government, who have a working group looking at additional ways to expand sanctions and make them tougher. Jesse Norman did not answer my honourable friend&#8217;s question on this. Apparently, we have no representation on that working group and are not involved in it&#8212;perhaps the noble Lord can tell us why that is the case. I hope we will ensure that we have somebody on that group because we need to lead, along with the United States and others, to ensure that we have the toughest, broadest and deepest regime.<\/p><p pid=\"b843.0\/17\">Obviously, in the last few weeks we have seen remarkable progress by the Ukrainian forces in the east and south of the country and an incredible counteroffensive. Indeed, the Ukrainians have shown extraordinary courage, strength and ingenuity in the face of Russian aggression, so it is even more important than ever to show our firm resolve to stand behind Ukraine in every way, not only militarily&#8212;which we discussed earlier this week&#8212;but politically, economically and, of course, diplomatically. One area I know the noble Lord takes really seriously is the crucial element of ensuring that Putin and his cronies face the consequences for their illegal and barbarous actions. The indiscriminate bombing we have seen over the last week is the strongest evidence of why we must do everything to end Putin&#8217;s aggression, violence and  cruelty. Sadly, however, we saw earlier evidence of brutality, not only in the scenes of mass graves and torture but in stories of sexual violence. We have the conference on this coming up fairly shortly. I hope that the noble Lord will do whatever he can to ensure that those victims of sexual violence&#8212;those voices and that evidence&#8212;are also a feature of our conference on the prevention of sexual violence in conflict.<\/p><p pid=\"b843.0\/18\">I will not go on much further; I echo the comments on some of the details of these sanctions. The thrust of our contribution tonight is that it is good that we have and are adapting the sanctions&#8212;but let us make sure that we are vigilant in enforcing them in the best way possible.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a707.0\/1\">My Lords, like so many others, I oppose this Bill because it contravenes the rule of law. First, there is this flagrant breach of international law and its serious implications for our global reputation. Others have mentioned our invocation of international law when we are denouncing Putin&#8217;s conduct in relation to Ukraine. How can we&#8212;as I sought to do last night&#8212;condemn China for its conduct towards Hong Kong in breach of the Sino-British agreement, an international treaty, when we are breaking an international treaty ourselves? It is this sort of shocking conduct which I am afraid will do great damage to our reputation around the globe for law and our commitment to it.<\/p><p pid=\"a707.0\/2\">The Government claim the defence of necessity. The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, has very effectively demolished that. There has to be grave and imminent peril, and that is not the situation here, as the history of this Bill relates.<\/p><p pid=\"a707.0\/3\">In addition to breaching international law, this legislation also puts at risk other legal obligations. I remind the House that the protocol was designed to  do more than protect economic interests; it had a number of objectives, one of which was to protect the Good Friday agreement &#8220;in all its dimensions&#8221;. The House will remember that concerns about human rights and equality have always been at the heart of the conflict in Northern Ireland, and a lot of work has gone into addressing those problems&#8212;I do not have to explain what I am referring to. As a result, we have seen the creation of important legal remedies, as well as institutions such as the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, both of which have expressed concern about this Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"a707.0\/4\">Article 2 of the protocol provides that the UK has continuous obligations regarding human rights and equality in Northern Ireland. It provides that there shall be &#8220;no diminution of rights&#8221;. No diminution means that the people in Northern Ireland had rights before the UK left the European Union and these cannot be reduced as a result of Brexit. Rights can only stay the same or advance; they cannot regress.<\/p><p pid=\"a707.0\/5\">As we know, Article 2 does not stand alone. It is supported by and must be interpreted in the light of other provisions of the protocol and the withdrawal agreement. In particular, there is an obligation on the United Kingdom for what is known as dynamic alignment in certain situations. That means keeping Northern Ireland up to date with developments in European Union law. Let me emphasise: protected rights in the Good Friday agreement that are underpinned by EU law may not be diminished as a result of Brexit and have to keep up with EU advances. Article 2 of the protocol gives that overarching guarantee. However, Clause 14 of this Bill provides that Article 13(3) of the protocol, which is on dynamic alignment, is to be disapplied immediately. Clause 20(2) provides that, in proceedings relating to the protocol, a court or tribunal is not to be<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a707.0\/6\">&#8220;bound by any principles laid down, or any decisions made &#8230; by the European Court&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a707.0\/7\">I am afraid that that does involve a departure. It is important to understand that this Bill ranges more widely than undermining only the trade and customs provisions of the protocol. The Bill presents a real danger to the protection of human rights provisions because of the powers that it gives to Ministers, which are not confined to trade. I remind the House of the law of unintended consequences. It could have serious implications for the citizens of Northern Ireland and their rights. That is yet another reason why this Bill should be abandoned.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>Thank you very much, Mark Isherwood. I think I made it very clear in my statement how important it was to have a Minister for refugees, Richard Harrington. Actually, we were meeting with him on a fortnightly basis; the job certainly wasn&#8217;t done. He played a very important role. He actually resigned the day before the leadership of the Conservative Party was announced, and I believe that his understanding, from the meeting we had only a week before&#8212;. He was actually going to come down to Wales; we had it in the diary. We were going to go and visit a welcome centre together. The job certainly isn&#8217;t done.<\/p><p>I am pleased to hear from my officials that, in terms of the role that was played and the important issues that we were raising with the then Minister for refugees, there is a recognition that that needs to be followed through. I would be very interested to see what reply we get from the Home Secretary and Simon Clarke, the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. I&#8217;m very happy to share the letter that we wrote, myself and Neil Gray. We reiterated the points that we were discussing. We paid tribute to Lord Richard Harrington for his commitment. We asked if there was going to be a UK Minister with portfolio responsibility, not just, I have to say&#8212;. In terms of his ministerial responsibility, it wasn&#8217;t just for Ukraine, it was for Afghan and Hong Kong welcome schemes as well. We'd very much welcome a dedicated Minister, and would support the appointment of a successor.<\/p><p>But we raised the issues&#8212;the financial issues, the real issues&#8212;that are now causing a great deal of concern. He called&#8212;and publicly, actually&#8212;for a doubling of the &#163;350 monthly thank-you payment to hosts. We asked for an increase at least to &#163;500, or up again, doubling to &#163;700 per month. An urgent decision is needed regarding this, because the hosts now, as they reach the end of their six-month period&#8212;. That is beginning to start; we&#8217;re writing to all hosts to see if they will continue. This is a crucial issue. We asked for quick decisions, and I hope you&#8212;as I perhaps asked you last week when we had a briefing about this&#8212;and your colleagues will also urge for a quick decision on this funding package.<\/p><p>Also, in terms of the funding package, which we&#8217;ve raised on a regular basis, we have no information. And of course, the finance Minister has raised this as well about year 2, year 3. We have no funding for ESOL services from the UK Government, or indeed tariffs for health either&#8212;both, actually, that were provided to the Afghan resettlement scheme. I&#8217;ve had no contact from the immigration Minister about this, or any other responsibility in relation to refugees and migrants.<\/p><p>I look forward perhaps that maybe we might have some telephone calls from not only the Prime Minister but other Ministers to us in Government. It&#8217;s vital that we do actually engage with them and follow this through. There is a huge job of work to be done here. We&#8217;re taking responsibility in the way that I&#8217;ve outlined fully, and also funding not only our welcome centres, but also paying thank-you payments to hosts if they support a family who initially arrived in Wales under the Ukraine family scheme. That's not happening in England. The commitment that we're making is considerable. I hope everyone will join us today, saying that we need to press for those answers in terms of financial support.<\/p><p>You introduced me, in fact, Mark, to Link International in north Wales, a fantastic organisation. They're a key part our third sector network, which meets regularly with officials and with myself. They also, of course, link to all of the other voluntary groups, the WhatsApp groups now all over Wales that the Ukrainians are organising themselves, which is, of course, what we want to encourage. In fact, this coming weekend, they've organised an arts festival at the Sherman Theatre. I hope people will have seen that. I shall be speaking at the opening event. It's also being sponsored by key Welsh celebrities who are backing what they are doing. But it is important that the support from the third sector is recognised.<\/p><p>In terms of devolved services, I said in my statement that we are now meeting&#8212;. Well, I met throughout the whole summer with local government leaders, and we have work streams that run at official level on everything to do with the initial welcome, the move-on services. But we're meeting fortnightly at meetings chaired by the Minister for Finance and Local Government on Ukraine, because the local leadership is crucially important in terms of the provision of those devolved services. They are linked, of course, to the health service, to the third sector, ESOL, et cetera.<\/p><p>We did contact the MOD, and they had no accommodation available. There are many good examples of how authorities, universities, the third sector are coming forward, and, obviously, we would welcome anything else that came forward. But we followed that MOD contact&#8212;nothing at that point, or indeed now. But they are all coming together to make contributions. Also, I very much welcome the work that the Polish integration society has undertaken.<\/p><p>In terms of north Wales, we are very thankful to all the authorities in north Wales, all the third sector, to the universities as well, who are engaging, both Bangor and Glynd&#373;r. There is excellent work in terms of welcome and also, of course, those family hosts.<\/p>",

I have one duty to discharge and one reminiscence to share.<\/p><p pid=\"d529.0\/2\">Like many noble Lords, I once served in an organisation bestowed with the title &#8220;royal&#8221;: in my case, the Royal Hong Kong Police. Her late Majesty bestowed that title in 1969 after the Hong Kong Police, as it was then known, had endured a very difficult few years, stoically and steadfastly doing its duty. We took great pride in that title and, on taking office as police officers, were privileged to swear an oath of loyalty to Her late Majesty. On behalf of all the men and women with whom I served and those before and after&#8212;Hong Kong Chinese, British, and from the broader Commonwealth&#8212;it is a privilege to pay tribute to our late Queen, thank her for what she did for us and send our sincere condolences to His Majesty the King and the rest of her family.<\/p><p pid=\"d529.0\/3\">I met Her late Majesty only once, at an investiture, and I am proud to say that I was able to make her laugh. I will not tell you the joke I told her, but I mention it because one of my best friends was with me on that occasion, and he happens to be American. He  did not meet the Queen, but he still says that that was one of the best days of his life. I know that he feels a sense of personal loss, as do we all, but that captures the essence of Her late Majesty. She touched people in so many ways, but often just by her very presence. She epitomised &#8220;majesty&#8221; in the truest sense of the word. It is perhaps a difficult thing to define, but I think we know what it means. Through her majesty, she reminded us all that honour, service and&#8212;that word again&#8212; duty are not redundant concepts, as the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, just noted. I have a strong suspicion that I will never achieve majesty, but I will strive to achieve those other qualities with renewed vigour.<\/p><p pid=\"d529.0\/4\">Thank you for that, Ma&#8217;am. Thank you for everything. May you rest in peace. And God save the King.<\/p>",

Clause 1 provides for a full sweeping away&#8212;a full revocation&#8212;of essentially all the retained EU law concerning financial services in the UK. This is radical and this is right. Indeed, it is what Brexit was all about and this Bill delivers it.<\/p><p pid=\"c291.1\/3\">We will move appropriately to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2020 model where the Government set the overall policy approach and delegate the operational implementation of those regulations to the independent regulators. As my hon. Friend the Minister said this is the internationally respected gold standard for how to do this. I was pleased to hear the Minister comment on the call-in power, and I urge him and the Government to quickly bring forward the means for that power, because both my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury and I believe it is the right thing to do. We talked about accountability earlier in this debate. It must be right for a democratically elected Government, with the consent of this House, on an exceptional basis, to intervene on financial regulation in the public interest, and I hope that the Government will follow through with those plans.<\/p><p pid=\"c291.1\/4\">On what this Bill does to support competitiveness, for the first time, our financial regulators will have a new statutory objective to support international competitiveness and growth, moving us in line with jurisdictions such as Australia, Singapore, Japan and Hong Kong. There will be new statutory panels to give better external scrutiny and challenge on the regulators&#8217; cost benefit analyses. We heard much about the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive over the past several weeks and I am pleased that the Bill brings forward those reforms to MiFID: to remove restrictions such as the double volume cap when trading in wholesale capital markets to improve pricing for investors; to modify the transparency regime in fixed income and derivatives to remove unnecessary burdens; and to modify the commodities position limits so that market activity is not unreasonably restricted.<\/p><p pid=\"c291.1\/5\">There are three areas on which I urge the Government to consider going further than I think we heard in the Minister&#8217;s opening remarks. First, to improve the efficiency of capital markets raising, there is an opportunity to reform European regulations in the prospectus directive. I hope the Government will bring forward draft statutory instruments for us to consider during the Bill&#8217;s passage. Secondly, the European packaged retail and insurance-based investment products directive is ripe for reform. I suggest repealing PRIIPS and replacing it with a tailor-made  regime specifically for UK markets. This will eliminate a counterproductive regulation, broaden the range of products available for UK investors and, indeed, increase UK retail participation in our financial markets.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>Today I am updating Parliament on Home Office delivery since my statement of 31 March 2022. The Department is committed to delivering better outcomes for the public and will continue to work to deliver a safer, fairer and more prosperous United Kingdom.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Reducing Crime<\/strong><\/p><p> <\/p><p>The first job of any government is to keep its people safe, which is why we have made it our absolute priority to get more police on our streets, cut crime and protect the public. Over the last three years the Home Office has worked hard to achieve these priorities and improve confidence in policing.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In July 2021, my Department published the Beating Crime Plan which sets out our approach to driving down crime, restoring confidence in the criminal justice system and better supporting victims. It balances the prevention we need to keep our citizens safe, with the enforcement required to deliver swift and certain justice for those who choose to break our laws.<\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p>We are delivering the commitments we made in the plan<em>.<\/em> As of 30 June, police forces in England and Wales have recruited 13,790 additional police officers, 69% of the 20,000 officers targeted by March 2023 under the Police Uplift Programme. Moreover, we are focused on cutting crime in areas with the highest levels of crime.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>As part of our commitment to excellence in the basics, every neighbourhood in England and Wales will have a named and contactable police officer and league tables have been introduced for 999 call answering times.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>I removed restrictions on Section 60 searches that have been in place since 2014. These restrictions have limited when officers could use the vital power and decreased their confidence in deploying it. Since 2019, stop and search use has increased by around 85% and has contributed to over 70,000 deadly knives and offensive weapons being taken off our streets.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In January 2020, we launched the place based Safer Streets Fund, directing &#163;120m of investment to the worst affected areas to tackling acquisitive crime, neighbourhood crime, anti-social behaviour, and violence against women and girls, and improving public safety for all.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Since 2019, we have invested &#163;170 million into the multi-agency Violence Reduction Units and a further &#163;170 million into bolstering the police response to serious violence in the areas most affected by serious violence. The Government will invest &#163;130m in 2022-23 to tackle serious violence, including murder and knife crime. Together, these programmes have prevented 49,000 violent offences in their first two years of activity, providing a saving of &#163;3.16 for every &#163;1 spent.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We are continuing to invest in the future of young people and intervening early to divert them away from a life of crime, including through the &#163;200 million, 10-year Youth Endowment Fund, which has supported 195 projects and already reached more than 64,097 at-risk young people.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We know that the drugs trade is at the heart of much of the homicide, serious violence and neighbourhood crime that blights our communities. Our 10-year Cross-Government Drug Strategy provides &#163;300 million of dedicated investment over the next three years, to drive work on tackling drug supply and reduce drug demand.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Our work is achieving results on the ground. Under our County Lines Programme, between November 2019 and March 2022, the police closed 2,400 lines, made over 8,000 arrests, and safeguarded more than 9,500 people. Our work on Project ADDER, which focuses on the response to addiction, diversion, enforcement and recovery has supported over 700 Organised Crime Group disruptions, more than 12,500 arrests, 6,000 Out of Court Disposals started by police, more than 14,000 drug treatment interventions by outreach workers, and diverted people away from offending and into recovery support between January 2021 and February 2022.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Our work at the border has delivered consecutive annual increases in drug seizures in each of the past three years. Last year, thanks to our investment, the Police and Border Force made 223,106 drug seizures in England and Wales during 2020-21 &#8211; a 21% increase on the previous year. We have also launched the new Conflict Stability and Security Fund counter supply of Illicit commodities programme to enable priority countries to disrupt priority threats' supply chains more effectively, focused on Class A drugs, illicit firearms, and cash trafficking.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Home Office has supported important legislation through Parliament, to reduce crime, support victims, and put the law-abiding majority first.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 was passed in April. It doubles the sentences for assaults on emergency workers, introduces Harper&#8217;s Law, and puts the Police Covenant in statute. It equips the police to combat crime and create safer communities, while overhauling sentencing laws to keep serious sexual and violent offenders behind bars for longer.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Meanwhile the Public Order Bill will further enhance the police&#8217;s ability to deal with disruptive protests that prevent ordinary people going about their daily lives and divert police resources from communities where they are needed most to prevent serious violence and neighbourhood crime.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Following Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act was passed in March. Hundreds of individuals and entities were designated within hours of it becoming law. The Government has sanctioned over 1,000 individuals and over 100 entities. The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill will allow us to bear down further on kleptocrats, criminals, and terrorists who abuse our financial system, strengthening the UK&#8217;s reputation as a place where legitimate business can thrive while dirty money is driven out.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls, including domestic abuse, has been supported by major funding and the landmark Domestic Abuse Act. It means action to prevent and raise awareness of these crimes, including investing &#163;3m per annum in prevention projects, improved support for victims, directly supporting thousands of victims and children, and tackling perpetrators through an ambitious &#163;25m package of behaviour change programmes and research to reduce further violence. The Home Office provides funding for a number of helplines and online services to support victims of VAWG, including domestic abuse. This includes specialist domestic abuse helplines for elderly, deaf and disabled, LGBT and male victims, as well as teachers and employers. In 2021\/22, over 81,000 people used the national tackling VAWG helplines for support.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Tackling Child Sexual Abuse Strategy, published in January 2021, has driven improvements in education, social care, health, law enforcement, and industry. We are working with international partners, to ensure we are doing all that we can to keep children safe online and in our communities in the UK and around the world.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Reducing the risk from terrorism to the UK &amp; UK interests overseas, securing a safe and prosperous UK<\/strong><\/p><p> <\/p><p>The threats we are responding to are becoming more complex and they increasingly overlap. In May, this year, the National Security Bill was introduced to Parliament. It completely overhauls and updates outdated espionage laws and provides updated investigative powers and capabilities so that our law enforcement and intelligence agencies can deter, detect, and disrupt a wide range of modern-day threats from hostile states.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco and I released a joint statement in July announcing that the UK-US Data Access Agreement will enter into force in October. It allows UK and US law enforcement to directly request data held by telecommunications providers in the other party&#8217;s jurisdiction for the exclusive purpose of preventing, detecting, investigating, and prosecuting serious crimes such as terrorism and child sexual abuse and exploitation. It will have a transformative effect.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Government is committed to tackling the threat from all forms of terrorism. In the last three years, I have proscribed four extreme right-wing terrorist groups, including Sonnenkrieg Division and Feuerkrieg Division. I also proscribed the Islamist group Hamas in its entirety and we supported the successful US prosecutions of two members of Daesh: Alexanda Kotey and Elshafee Elsheikh.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We opened the world-leading Counter-Terrorism Operations Centre in June 2021, including a cutting-edge counter-terrorism operations suite and state-of-the-art forensics laboratory. For the first time it brings together all the London-based elements of counter-terrorism policing to ensure they can discover and disrupt threats more quickly.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Home Office delivered the first UK policing counter-drone capability, which was used effectively at the G7, COP26 and the Commonwealth Games. A combination of deterrence communications, effective use of airspace restrictions, and new police equipment, powers and procedures is reducing the incidence of mis-used drones and facilitating their tracking and seizure.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We have passed key pieces of legislation such as the Terrorist Offenders (Restriction of Early Release) Act 2020 which ended the automatic early-release of terrorist offenders. In addition, the Counter-Terrorism and Sentencing Act was passed in 2021 and which ensures that sentences reflect the severity of the offence and strengthens the monitoring of suspects.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>To enhance our ability to protect the UK we have also passed the Air Traffic Management and Unmanned Aircraft Act 2021, which provides the police powers to better protect the UK from malicious drone use. We completed a Call for Information last year on the Computer Misuse Act 1990, to ensure that our legislation and powers continue to meet the challenges posed by the threats in cyberspace.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Tackling illegal migration, removing those with no right to be here, and protecting the vulnerable <\/strong><\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Nationality and Borders Act is the cornerstone of the Government&#8217;s New Plan for Immigration. Since receiving Royal Assent on 28 April 2022, I have wasted no time in implementing the Act &#8211; delivering a fair but firm system to ensure that we can better support those in genuine need of asylum; deterring illegal migration, especially dangerous small boat arrivals; breaking the business model of vile criminal gangs; and removing from the UK those with no right to be here.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We have already achieved significant changes in the system with the first raft of reforms, including: the introduction of fixes to the asylum system; new and tougher criminal offences for illegal entry and people smuggling; and nationality law changes that allow fairer access to British nationality.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The reforms will build towards a new National Age Assessment Board and Scientific Age Assessment methods to protect children, modern slavery reforms and a new one-stop process and appeals to stop repeated, unmeritorious and last-minute claims seeking to frustrate removal.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In July 2021, I signed a new agreement to strengthen UK-France cooperation on tackling illegal immigration across the Channel. Through our joint action with France, we prevented more than 23,000 crossings in 2021. So far in 2022, over 17,000 people have been prevented from crossing the Channel in small boats &#8211; around 70% more than to this point in 2021. In addition, the UK-France Joint Intelligence Cell, established in July 2020, has, with France, dismantled 21 small boat organised criminal groups, securing over 500 arrests. In the few months it has been operational, the NABA has already resulted in a further 82 arrests, 62 charges, 10 convictions with sentences handed down of 5.9 years following the introduction of the NABA legislation. This includes 38 arrests, 32 charges and 1 conviction for facilitation. Also there has been 23 arrests for illegal entry, 17 charges and 7 convictions.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We successfully transferred primacy for operations in the Channel to the Ministry of Defence, as part of the whole of Government effort to counter Channel crossings by irregular migrants. This sees Border Force, Immigration Enforcement and Service Personnel working side-by-side to ensure the UK&#8217;s borders are protected and to effectively manage pressures in the Channel.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In April 2022, I announced the world-leading Migration and Economic Development Partnership with Rwanda. It is part of a suite of measures under the New Plan for Immigration to tackle the increasing number of small boats arrivals since 2019 by deterring them from making dangerous crossings. The Partnership will see those travelling to the UK through illegal, dangerous and unnecessary methods considered for relocation to Rwanda, where they will have their asylum claim processed. While there are ongoing legal proceedings, the partnership arrangement fully complies with all national and international law and we prepare for delivery.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We deported 11,532 foreign national offenders between 2019 and March 2022. Since April 2020 we have used 151 charter flights and so far this year, we have returned 1,741 FNOs and other immigration offenders. To support this work, we have agreed new international returns agreements with international partners in Albania, Serbia, Nigeria, and most recently Pakistan.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In addition, since 2019, we have helped over 11,000 people return home through our Voluntary Return Service and other initiatives; offering practical support and assistance to those who wish to return to their home countries but have no means to do so.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The UK continues to welcome refugees and people in need of protection, Our safe and legal routes have resulted in over 320,000 people coming to the U.K. Since the Hong Kong BN(O) route was set up in January 2021, over 140,000 BN(O) status holders and their family members have chosen to take the UK up on this offer and have applied for the BN(O) route as of 30 June 2022.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In February 2021, the Home Office completed our commitment to resettle those 20,000 people fleeing conflict in Syria. An additional 1,838 refugees were resettled through the Vulnerable Children&#8217;s Resettlement Scheme.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Through the UK Resettlement Scheme (UKRS), we have expanded our geographical focus beyond the Middle East and North Africa to continue to offer safe and legal routes to the UK for some of the most vulnerable refugees around the world. 1,685 vulnerable refugees have been resettled through the UKRS since the launch of the scheme in March 2021 and since January 2019, 8,710 refugees have been resettled across all the Government&#8217;s resettlement schemes (not including Afghan schemes).<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We helped over 15,000 people to safety from Afghanistan in the biggest and fastest emergency evacuation in recent history. A further 5,000 more people have been helped to enter since the evacuation. This January the Government launched the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme which will see up to 20,000 people from Afghanistan and the region resettled to the UK over the coming years. This is in addition to individuals relocated through the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy. In less than a year, almost 7,400 Afghan evacuees have been provided with permanent homes.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine we set up some of the fastest and biggest visa schemes in UK history. The Ukraine Family Scheme had received 58,600 visa applications by 23 August 2022, of which 50,100 visas had been issued. We had received 149,900 Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme visa applications, and issued 128,800 visas, by 23 August 2022.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In June we also announced that the Homes for Ukraine scheme will also allow eligible children under the age of 18 who are not travelling with or joining a parent or legal guardian, to come to the UK in carefully defined circumstances.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>This record of delivery demonstrates the efforts of the Home Office to get on with the job of protecting the public, keeping our borders secure and the British people safe from harm.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Enabling the legitimate movement of people and goods to support economic prosperity<\/strong><\/p><p> <\/p><p>In 2019, we had uncontrolled immigration from the EU. Since then, we have ended free movement and launched a points-based system, creating a single, global immigration system, attracting and retaining the brightest and best global talent, while realising the enormous potential of our domestic workforce.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We have made significant progress in digitising the immigration system, making further improvements to how applicants apply for, access and prove their immigration status to others.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In terms of operational processing, between January and July 2022, 96.4% of UK standard passport applications were completed within the published processing time of 10 weeks. The Passport Office is working hard to investigate and conclude the reducing number of cases which fall outside 10 weeks. We plan to recover Work in Progress (WIP) to base levels across all workstreams in time for year-end WIP target levels, so that we are prepared for the levels of intake next year which we anticipate will be similar to those of 2022.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We are currently facing extremely high pressure globally across our visa network, caused by a significantly increase in visa demand following the easing of travel restrictions and the prioritising of Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine applications in response to the humanitarian crisis caused by Putin&#8217;s barbaric invasion of Ukraine. We are working hard to reduce the current processing times as quickly as possible by flexing staff resource and utilising agency across our visa routes as well as pursuing a programme of transformation and business improvement initiatives which will speed up decision making, reduce the time people spend in the system and reduce the numbers who are awaiting an interview or decision. We have also recently reintroduced Priority and Super Priority services in a number of our visa routes to improve the customer experience.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Ahead of our exit from the European Union, Border Force recruited 1,570 new staff and trained a total of 8,000 in new policy and processes. We worked with HMRC to operationalise new inland border facilities, effectively creating 5 new ports; and delivered complex and interrelated change across a total of 125 ports.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We have further expanded our points-based immigration system to attract the most promising international talent to the UK and maintain our status as a leading international hub for emerging technologies. In May 2021, we expanded our Global Talent Route to allow recipients of international awards, including the Nobel Prize for Physics, to automatically qualify for the visa. In 2022 we introduced the Global Business Mobility, High Potential Individual and Scale-up visa routes.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Since 2019, we have continued to increase border efficiency through the increased use of eGates, expanding their use to passengers from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea &amp; USA, in addition to British, Irish and EU nationals, and with Border Force now operating 288 eGates at 15 ports. National rollout of the eGate upgrade, which has introduced a new operating system, Border Crossing, and upgraded the software, was completed six months early.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Since I overhauled the Windrush Compensation Scheme in December 2020, interim payments rose from &#163;250 to &#163;10,000. As at the end of June 2022, &#163;53.8 million had been paid or offered under the Windrush Compensation Scheme, with &#163;43.9 million paid out across 1,098 claims. Our One Home Office cultural transformation programme features an increased focus on ethical decision-making with new routes for colleagues to escalate concerns and think more about the &#8216;Face Behind the Case&#8217;.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>By 30 June 2022, we had concluded nearly 6.5 million EU Settlement Scheme applications, granting status in over 5.9 million applications. Over 450,000 individuals have been supported to apply to the EUSS by our network of grant-funded organisations across the UK. This includes victims of human trafficking and domestic abuse.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In 2021, we removed the ability for EU, EEA, and Swiss nationals to travel on an ID card, unless the holder is protected by the Citizens&#8217; Rights Withdrawal Agreements, given they were one of the most abused documents at the border.<\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p>All these achievements represent a record of delivering on the people&#8217;s priorities &#8211; a record of which I am very proud.<\/p>",

All relevant documents referred to will be placed in the Library of the House.<\/p><p><strong>We have delivered stronger local leadership<\/strong>.<\/p><ul><li>A Devolution Deal has been signed with York and North Yorkshire to create a Mayoral Combined Authority comprising the City of York and North Yorkshire Councils and covering a population of 818,000 people. The deal, which is subject to ratification by the councils, includes a &#163;540 million investment fund over the next 30 years and over &#163;22.5 million to support the building of new homes on brownfield land and to drive green growth in the area; the devolution of the Adult Education Budget; an integrated transport settlement and confirmation that the Government is minded to provide additional support for the regeneration of the York Central brownfield site, subject to an agreed business case. The first Mayoral election would be in May 2024 and the new Mayor would take on the functions of the Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner. There will be a locally run public consultation, and the secondary legislation to implement the deal is subject to consent from councils and Parliamentary approval.<\/li><li>A Devolution Deal has been signed with Derby, Derbyshire, Nottingham and Nottinghamshire to create an East Midlands Mayoral Combined County Authority. The deal is subject to ratification by the councils, and to the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill receiving Royal Assent. The deal includes a Mayor for the 2.2 million people of the area to be elected in May 2024. Both the Government and the four councils place great importance on the involvement of the 15 district and borough councils in the area. The deal establishes an investment fund of &#163;1.14 billion over the next 30 years &#8211; the joint largest of any Devolution Deal so far, over &#163;17 million to support brownfield development and further investment, subject to business cases, of &#163;18 million to support local housing and Net Zero priorities. The deal also includes devolution of the Adult Education Budget and an integrated transport settlement. There will be a locally-run public consultation and the secondary legislation to implement the deal is subject to consent from councils and Parliamentary approval.<\/li><li>Other deals named in the Levelling Up White Paper are progressing well, notably with councils in Suffolk and North East England, and with Cornwall, as well as additional trailblazer deals with the West Midlands and Greater Manchester.<\/li><li>We have taken decisive action to restore good governance to councils in England that have let down local residents, in Slough, Liverpool, Nottingham and Thurrock. In making interventions we have established an approach that help from within the local area should be pursued wherever possible and we are grateful to Mayor Steve Rotheram for stepping forward to guide the future of Liverpool City Council and to Essex County Council for leading the intervention in Thurrock.<\/li><li>We have tightened rules to prevent councils in England from using creative accountancy to avoid the spirit of the financial frameworks which are there to protect taxpayers, and have advised consultancies that they should not facilitate such practices at the taxpayers&#8217; expense.<\/li><li>We have published for consultation the draft Policy and Strategy Statement for the Electoral Commission required by the Elections Act 2022, in which combatting electoral fraud through so-called family voting in local and national elections is emphasised.<\/li><\/ul><p><strong>We have provided further opportunities to level up across the United Kingdom. <\/strong><\/p><ul><li>Round 2 of the &#163;4.8 billion Levelling Up Fund was opened on 15 July and closed on 2 August.

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1168.3\/1\">I can ask my officials to look at that specific point and come back to the hon. Gentleman on it.<\/p><p pid=\"b1168.3\/2\">The UK has designated more individuals than any other G7 member, demonstrating our leadership in this field. We also brought forward emergency legislation so that we could respond even more swiftly and effectively. We now have a significantly expanded sanctions directorate within the FCDO to take forward these measures. I visited it this week, where I was impressed by the incredibly hard work everyone is putting in to deliver our objectives. Let me be clear that these measures are working. Sanctions imposed by the UK and our international partners are having deep and damaging consequences for Putin&#8217;s ability to wage war.<\/p><p pid=\"b1168.3\/3\">My right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green asked about greater collaboration with the US as we move forward on sanctions designations. I will be in the US next week to speak to counterparts, looking at sanctions and how we can work together even more in the coming months and years on this point. That may not be quite what he wanted me to say, but it shows our commitment to work with our international partners. Having come into office 10 days ago, I will be in the US next week meeting counterparts about this specific, important issue.<\/p><p pid=\"b1168.3\/4\">Meanwhile, we continue to impose sanctions in support of human rights and democracy elsewhere in the world, using our geographic regimes. That includes measures cutting off arms flows to the military in Myanmar, targeting those supporting the Assad regime in Syria, and bearing down on politicians who undermine the hard-won peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In recent years, we have boosted the tools at our disposal through our independent sanctions framework. We launched our global human rights sanctions regime in 2020 and our global anti-corruption sanctions regime the following year.<\/p><p pid=\"b1168.3\/5\">Our global human rights sanctions regime helps us hold to account those involved in serious human rights violations or abuses&#8212;including torture, slavery and forced labour&#8212;by imposing targeted asset freezes and travel bans. Since the regime was launched, we have designated 81 individuals and entities. We have used it to stand up for the rights of citizens in countries ranging from Russia to Belarus, Venezuela, Pakistan, The Gambia and North Korea. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Wendy Chamberlain\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25872\">The hon. Member for North East Fife (Wendy Chamberlain)<\/phrase> mentioned Belarus. Only yesterday, the other place approved the Republic of Belarus (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) Regulations 2022, which will come back to this House in September, allowing for further debate.<\/p><p pid=\"b1168.3\/6\">China and Hong Kong have been mentioned by parliamentarians across the House. We have taken robust action to hold China to account for its appalling human rights violations in Xinjiang, including systematic restrictions on religious practice. On that point, I thank the hon. Member for Strangford for the amazing work of the all-party parliamentary group for international freedom of region or belief, which he chairs. As a former special envoy for freedom of religion or belief, and having worked with my US counterpart, Sam Brownback, the US ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, to set up the International Religious Freedom or Belief Alliance&#8212;it had 26 member states at the time&#8212;I totally understand what such partnership working and collaboration can do to advance interests that are important to both our great countries.<\/p><p pid=\"b1168.3\/7\">Last year, we imposed unprecedented joint sanctions against those responsible for enforcing China&#8217;s oppressive policies in Xinjiang. We took that action alongside 29 other countries, demonstrating the strength of international resolve. We have also led international efforts to hold China to account at the United Nations, taken measures to tackle forced labour in supply chains, funded research to expose China&#8217;s actions, and consistently raised our concerns at the highest level.<\/p><p pid=\"b1168.3\/8\">On Hong Kong, we continue to challenge China for breaching its legally binding commitments under the joint declaration. We have called out its conduct on the world stage. Together with our G7 partners, we have condemned the steady erosion of political and civil rights. We have also opened our doors to the people of Hong Kong through a new immigration path for British nationals overseas, with over 120,000 applications. Moreover, we have suspended the UK-Hong Kong extradition treaty indefinitely, and extended to Hong Kong the arms embargo applied to mainland China since 1989, as updated in 1998.<\/p><p pid=\"b1168.3\/9\">Although it would not be appropriate for me to speculate about future possible designations, we remain committed to working with partners to hold China to account, and not only China. We remain committed to working with international partners, whether our friends in Canada, our friends in Australia, who apply a similar system of sanctions, or the EU. We will work together, hand in hand, to ensure that everything that can be done is being done to hold those perpetrators to account for serious human rights violations. That is a top priority for this Government.<\/p><p pid=\"b1168.3\/10\">Our global anti-corruption sanctions regime targets those involved in bribery and misappropriation, stopping them freely entering the United Kingdom and using it as a safe haven for dirty money. The hon. Members for Hammersmith (Andy Slaughter) and for Argyll and Bute (Brendan O'Hara) talked about how we can address the issue of dirty money coming into the United Kingdom. That is also a key priority for the Government. In just over a year, we have designated 27 people, including Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta and their associate Salim Essa, who were at the heart of long-running corruption that caused significant damage to South Africa&#8217;s economy.<\/p><p pid=\"b1168.3\/11\">I conclude by reflecting on the words of Winston Churchill:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1168.3\/12\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;It is wonderful what great strides can be made when there is a resolute purpose behind them.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-05-07\">7 May<\/phrase> 1947; Vol. 437, c. 455.]<\/p><p pid=\"b1168.3\/13\">The United Kingdom Government have demonstrated our vision and purpose by taking significant steps on this issue. Of course we can do more, and we will do more. The Government will work with parliamentarians to do all we can to ensure that serious human rights violators are brought to account.<\/p><p pid=\"b1168.3\/14\">Again, I thank the hon. Member for Rhondda and my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green for all they have done. I look forward to working with them when Parliament returns in September. I go to the United States next week, so this timely debate enables me to say to my US counterparts how important this issue is not just for Congress but for Parliament.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>The Government that I have had the privilege to lead has focused relentlessly on delivery. This statement updates the House on what we have achieved since I was invited by Her Majesty The Queen to form a government in July 2019, and puts on record why the millions of people who voted Conservative in 2019, many for the first time, were right to place their trust in me and in this Conservative Government.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>First, after the country had endured three years of indecision and uncertainty with a deadlocked Parliament and a paralysed government, we got Brexit done. We delivered on the decision the people of the United Kingdom made in 2016, and took our country out of the European Union, negotiating a new Trade and Cooperation Agreement that preserves zero tariff, zero quota trade. Since our exit, we have been seizing the opportunities that come with this new freedom. We have signed three major new trade deals with Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, supporting food, drink and manufacturing exports as well as digital trade, and taking our total number of FTAs to over 70, with negotiations underway on many more. We have selected eight locations for freeports, with two already operational and the others coming on stream later this year. We have passed the Agriculture Act and the Fisheries Act, reforming what were wasteful and bureaucratic European schemes to the benefit of our farming and fishing communities and the environment. We have put in place a points-based immigration system that gives the people of this country control over our own borders. It is because we have this control that we have been able to react swiftly and generously to events in Afghanistan, Hong Kong and Ukraine, and strike the Migration and Economic Development Partnership with Rwanda in response to the shared international challenge of illegal migration, breaking the business model of people smuggling gangs.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Second, thanks to the fortitude and spirit of the British public, we guided the country through its greatest challenge since the Second World War. A pandemic is the kind of crisis that no administration wants to face, but which it is the Government&#8217;s solemn duty to tackle. We supported the NHS and the incredible doctors, nurses and carers who acted so valiantly to treat and care for the ill, and to whom I owe my own life. We built a huge testing regime, distributing more than two billion lateral flow tests across the UK, and at the peak delivering more than seven million tests to households every 24 hours. We invested in antivirals, adding more powerful new drugs to our armoury than any of our neighbours. In the face of predictions of 12 per cent unemployment, we deployed the furlough scheme, which supported the jobs of 11.7 million people through lockdown. Most importantly, we bet early and bet big on vaccines before success was guaranteed, becoming the first country in the world to administer one outside of clinical trials and the fastest in Europe to roll them out at scale &#8211; over 70 per cent of the entire UK population aged 12 or above received at least one dose within the first six months, and the total number of jabs now stands at over 150 million. Thanks to these efforts, we were able to emerge from lockdown early and set out our plan for living with COVID, getting our lives back on track.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Third, when I became Prime Minister I stood on the steps of Downing Street and said it was my job to level up the country, because while potential is evenly distributed throughout the population, opportunity is not. This meant bringing down crime, strengthening our health system, sorting out social care and improving our schools &#8211; and the Government acted on every front.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Our streets are safer. We have recruited more than 13,500 additional police officers, over halfway to delivering our pledge to put an extra 20,000 officers on the streets by 2023. We have taken over 50,000 knives and offensive weapons off the streets, and brought knife crime and thefts down last year compared to 2019. We have backed the police with the support they need, providing the largest funding boost in a decade, and equipping them with new powers to tackle disruptive protests and use stop and search. We have rolled up over 1,500 county lines, going for the gangs that peddled them and protecting the young people exploited by them. We have changed the law to make sure serious violent and sexual criminals spend more time behind bars.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Our NHS is on a surer footing. We have more doctors and around 30,000 more nurses than in March 2019, well over halfway to meeting our commitment of 50,000 more nurses by 2024. We have recruited another 18,000 primary care staff, such as physiotherapists and pharmacists, putting us on track to reach 26,000 by 2024. We have launched the biggest catchup programme in the NHS&#8217;s history to tackle the legacy of the pandemic, aiming to deliver around 30 per cent more elective activity by 2024-25 than before the pandemic hit, underpinned by a &#163;39 billion investment. We have opened almost 100 Community Diagnostic Centres, helping millions of patients to access earlier diagnostic tests closer to home. We have begun the biggest hospital-building programme for a generation. We have published England&#8217;s first women&#8217;s health strategy to improve the health and well-being of women and girls, and widened access to life saving drugs.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Our broken social care system is finally being fixed. We have ended the cruel lottery of social care costs with a plan that means no one will pay more than &#163;86,000 over their lifetime, when previously many had to pay six figure sums. We have lifted the previous limit for financial support by more than 400 per cent, so that anyone with assets of under &#163;100,000 will be eligible for help, and those with under &#163;20,000 will pay nothing at all. We have designed a way to make the overall system fairer, so that those who fund themselves do not pay more than state-funded individuals for the equivalent standard of care. We have committed to providing our brilliant social care workforce with new training and qualification opportunities, so that they can progress and improve while providing an even greater standard of care.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Our schools are better. We have supported children to recover from the impact of the pandemic with over two million tutoring courses and a programme to reach six million by 2024. We have supported teachers too, with over 80,000 benefitting from additional training and support, while bringing starting salaries up to &#163;30,000, attracting more bright and able graduates to inspire the next generation. We have injected the biggest funding boost in a decade, taking core funding to &#163;56.8 billion by 2024-25. We have driven up school standards, with 87 per cent of schools now rated Good or Outstanding, up from 68 per cent in 2010. We have set an ambition for 90 per cent of children to leave primary school at the expected standard in reading, writing and maths by 2030.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Fourth, in spite of the challenges posed by COVID and the subsequent headwinds in the global economy, we secured the fastest economic growth in the G7 last year. We have helped people into jobs by partnering with employers, including 500,000 since January this year through the Way to Work programme, and we have the lowest unemployment rate in almost 50 years. We have focused on getting young people into work, an area where versus other OECD countries we know we can do better, with 163,000 supported by the Kickstart Scheme to start their career and gain vital work experience. We have redressed Britain's historic underinvestment in infrastructure, developing a five-year, &#163;600 billion pipeline of infrastructure projects to improve connectivity and drive economic growth, including a &#163;96 billion investment through the Integrated Rail Plan &#8211; building three new high-speed lines in Northern Powerhouse Rail, HS2 East and HS2 West, and reopening lines to industrial and country towns cut off under Beeching. We have committed &#163;5 billion to boost buses and cycling and a further &#163;5.7 billion to level up local transport systems in the mayoral combined authority areas. We have accelerated the deployment of wind, new nuclear, solar and hydrogen power generation, with the Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution and our broader net zero agenda already yielding &#163;22 billion in private sector investment and 68,000 clean jobs &#8211; and an ambition to unlock &#163;100 billion of investment and 480,000 such jobs by the end of the decade. We have continued to support the production of domestic oil and gas in the nearer term, which must underpin our transition to cleaner and cheaper power, working to retain the skills and industry in Aberdeen and elsewhere by putting nearly &#163;2 billion into technologies such as carbon capture, usage and storage. We have raised the proportion of properties able to access the fastest gigabit-capable broadband from nine per cent when my administration took office to 68 per cent now. We have set an ambitious 2030 date for ending sales of new petrol and diesel cars, with over half of all new cars sold now electric or hybrid, and we have bolstered our strategic road network through a &#163;27.4 billion Road Investment Strategy that includes building the first new trans-Pennine dual carriageway since 1971.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We have awarded 101 Towns Deals across the country to address high levels of deprivation and open up new opportunities by fostering economic regeneration, stimulating investment and delivering vital infrastructure. We have made it easier to own a home, with over 400,000 first time buyers last year marking the highest number since 2006, and housebuilding rebounding strongly after the challenges posed by the start of the pandemic. We have set out plans for renters reform that will provide renting families more security at the same time as supporting landlords. We have cemented the UK&#8217;s status as a science superpower, recognising that the ability to advance and exploit science and technology will be an increasingly important competitive edge over the coming decade, growing research and development spending by 33 per cent over this Parliament, the fastest ever rate. We have attracted more venture capital investment in tech startups this year than any country bar the US, putting us ahead of China, Japan and Germany. We are levelling up skills, because stronger skills lead to better, higher paid jobs &#8211; with over 20,000 people already benefiting from Skills Bootcamps, and 175 colleges due to offer T-Levels from this September. We have announced a Lifelong Loan Entitlement so that from 2025 everyone can access funding to support up to four years of post-18 study, be that modular or full time &#8211; helping people gain skills at any stage of their life. We have increased the National Living Wage by the largest ever cash amount, and reduced the Universal Credit taper rate to make sure work pays.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Fifth, embracing the freedom we now have to chart our own course, we led on the international stage. We used our G7 Presidency to launch the $600 billion Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment &#8211; closing the infrastructure gap in developing countries while enhancing our economic and national security &#8211; and to agree a minimum corporate tax rate to crack down on avoidance. We have driven action on climate change, marshalling nearly 200 countries at COP26 to treble global net zero agreements so that they now cover 90 per cent of the world economy, committing to reach net zero in the UK by 2050, and driving down emissions at the fastest rate in the G7. We have stepped up where our help was needed, be it in evacuating over 15,000 people from Afghanistan in just 16 days through Operation Pitting, offering a route to the UK for holders of British National (Overseas) passports and their family members in Hong Kong, standing up the Homes for Ukraine scheme, or providing &#163;548 million to COVAX to get 1.3 billion vaccine doses into 87 developing countries.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Across these five fronts &#8211; Brexit, COVID, public services, the economy, and the world stage &#8211; this Government has delivered. As we prepare for a change in administration, there are two further fronts on which we are already taking decisive action, and on which the commitment of the next Conservative Prime Minister will not waver.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>At home, we are standing by the side of the British public as we cope with pressures on the cost of living &#8211; just as we did in the darkest hours of the COVID crisis. We have set out a &#163;37 billion package which will see the most vulnerable eight million households get support worth &#163;1,200. Qualifying low income households will get &#163;650, with the first half being paid into bank accounts this month, and the remainder following in the autumn. Every household in the country will get &#163;400 towards their energy costs. Most will get a &#163;150 council tax rebate. Pensioners in receipt of winter fuel payments will get a separate payment of &#163;300, and disabled people a further &#163;150. Both I, and my successor, will continue to focus support on those who need it the most.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Abroad, we are standing up for Ukraine &#8211; as we always have when our fundamental values are threatened. We have brought the G7 and NATO together in support of the Ukrainian people so that the free West speaks with one voice and brings its collective might to bear. We have provided significant amounts of lethal aid, including 2,000 anti-tank missiles in January before the invasion started. We have committed military, humanitarian and economic assistance totalling nearly &#163;4 billion, more than any other country apart from the US. We have donated over 11 million medical items, 856 mobile generators and 20 NHS ambulances, and sent the largest fire deployment to ever leave the UK. We have acted decisively with our allies to sanction over 1,000 individuals and 100 entities, freeze the assets of banks, and isolate Russia from international trade. We have introduced the fastest and largest visa scheme in our history to welcome Ukrainians who wish to find safety elsewhere, with over 95,000 arriving in the UK to date. We have stepped up our NATO commitments to strengthen the alliance, more than doubling our presence in Estonia, providing the SkySabre air defence system to Poland, and delivering enhanced air policing missions. For as long as it takes, the UK will continue to back Ukraine&#8217;s fight for freedom.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Finally, in everything this Government has done, we have striven to deliver for the whole of our United Kingdom &#8211; for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. From the vaccination programme, where we were able to ensure everyone across our islands could benefit from swift access to jabs, to the furlough scheme, which relied on the financial firepower of the UK Treasury, to our Levelling Up Fund, supporting town centre and high street regeneration, local transport projects, and cultural and heritage assets across the UK, the benefits of our great union have never been more evident.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>I am proud of our record in office since 2019. I remain determined that we continue to deliver in our final weeks. And I know that the Conservative Government that follows after us will do what its predecessors have always done and meet the challenges of the day by serving the British people.<\/p>",

I know that a few people say, &#8220;Oh, the zombie Prime Minister made a few errors because he didn&#8217;t know he was at the party, he didn&#8217;t know it was a party, he didn&#8217;t know if he was drinking at the time and he didn&#8217;t know the law even though he wrote the law, so we should let him off&#8212;but he got the big issues right.&#8221; I put it to the House that he did not get the big issues right.<\/p><p pid=\"c794.0\/2\">Take covid: 200,000 people dead&#8212;the highest number in Europe. That is a complete disaster. People say, &#8220;We got the vaccine out.&#8221; Well, we had the vaccine. The Prime Minister claims, &#8220;If we had been in the European Medicines Agency, we wouldn&#8217;t have been able to roll it out.&#8221; That is not true; we would have. He keeps repeating that untruth again and again.<\/p><p pid=\"c794.0\/3\">Billions have been lost in procurement over this whole episode. How do we know? Well, Wales was given &#163;1 billion to deliver test, track and trace, and it spent only &#163;0.5 billion, because it delivered that service through public health and local authorities, instead of through people putting their hand in the till and taking the money, as happened when the local landlord of the former Health Secretary, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Matthew Hancock\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24773\">the right hon. Member for West Suffolk (Matt Hancock)<\/phrase>, got a contract. It is absolutely ridiculous!<\/p><p pid=\"c794.0\/4\">What about the economy, which is supposed to be doing well? We just heard from my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Stephen Timms\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10596\">the Member for East Ham (Sir Stephen Timms)<\/phrase> that the Prime Minister consistently stands at the Dispatch Box and says, &#8220;There&#8217;s half a million more people in jobs,&#8221; or whatever he says that week, when he knows that those are only the payroll figures, which do not include the self-employed. If we asked the Official for National Statistics, we would learn that there are something like half a million fewer people in jobs. The Prime Minister  is intentionally, in my view, giving the wrong impression of the economy. We have the slowest recovery in the G7, the slowest projected growth and the highest inflation. It is a disaster. Then we are told, &#8220;He&#8217;s got Brexit done,&#8221; but 25% of the fruit is not being picked and we are not butchering the meat. Some 40,000 pigs have been culled, yet the price of ham is up by 27%. Is that a success?<\/p><p pid=\"c794.0\/5\">What about trade? Trade is down 15%. What about those trade deals? If we had got the Japanese trade deal through the EU, we would have made &#163;1 billion more in GDP. What about efficiency? Passports&#8212;you&#8217;ve got to wait 12 weeks. Driving licences? All the civil servants were pushed into Brexit management&#8212;botched Brexit&#8212;and now the Government are going to cut 90,000 civil servants. That is going to go well, isn&#8217;t it, if you are in a queue?<\/p><p pid=\"c794.0\/6\">Then there is the Northern Ireland protocol. We are pulling out of the single market, so business will fail, we will mess up the peace process and we will break international law. Talking of which, what about Rwanda? Israel did not want to send its refugees to Rwanda. Why? Because they were being tortured, raped and killed, yet we are. And, oh, the solution to that is to pull out of the European convention on human rights, which Churchill put together. Our fundamental values of democracy, freedom and human rights are being ripped up at a time when China is abusing democracy in Hong Kong and the human rights of the Uyghurs, and confronting Taiwan. Russia is moving in and we are abandoning the right to protest, playing into Putin&#8217;s hands. Even the windfall tax is being given back to the oil producers.<\/p><p pid=\"c794.0\/7\">The fact is that the Labour Government produced 40% growth in 10 years and doubled spending on health and education.

            "body": "<p pid=\"b644.0\/1\">I am grateful for another superb intervention from my hon. Friend, and I bow to her wisdom. Sometimes we do not get what is written on the tin.<\/p><p pid=\"b644.0\/2\">Clause 2 amends article 1 of the shark finning regulation 1185\/2003, which forms part of retained EU law, to make sure that shark finning cannot take place by any vessel fishing in UK waters, or by any UK vessel fishing in non-UK waters. That ensures that our domestic protections are of the highest standard. Clause 3 sets out the territorial extent of the Bill and when or how each provision comes into force. As the Bill relates to devolved matters, legislative consent will be sought from the devolved Administrations during the passage of the Bill, but I understand that they are supportive of taking action against the cruel and unsustainable shark fin trade.<\/p><p pid=\"b644.0\/3\">I would like to thank stakeholders and colleagues who have contacted me on this important matter, particularly members of Shark Guardian and Bite-Back Shark &amp; Marine Conservation, who have been instrumental in throwing a spotlight on the issue of shark finning for many years&#8212;some of them are watching from the Gallery today. Since 2004, Bite-Back Shark &amp; Marine Conservation has been at the forefront of successful campaigns to end the sale and consumption of shark fins and shark products in Britain. In recent years it launched its &#8220;No Fin To Declare&#8221; campaign&#8212;I love the name&#8212;exposing Britain&#8217;s contributions to the global shark fin trade. The charity argues that a decision to ban all import and exports of detached shark fins will establish Britain as a global leader in the conservation of sharks and, ultimately, inspire other countries to introduce their own bans and join the UK in the protection of this keystone marine species.<\/p><p pid=\"b644.0\/4\">In 2021, Shark Guardian, a charity based in Nottingham, launched a petition on Parliament&#8217;s website to ban the British shark fin trade, which secured more than 115,000 signatures, showing the depth of support for my Bill among a passionate and caring British public. Shark Guardian believes that if my Bill is passed into law, that will have a huge and positive knock-on effect on the continent, because the European Union will have to take note of our legislation, and take steps to pass a similar EU law to ban the import and export of shark fin through its borders too, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol East mentioned. That is important because Spain is by far the single biggest exporter of frozen shark fins to Hong Kong, a city that has, for many years, been the epicentre of this cruel and unsustainable trade. If the supply chain to Hong Kong, and, by extension to China, can be cut, global shark populations that are threatened with extinction today can be offered a new lease of hope tomorrow.<\/p><p pid=\"b644.0\/5\">This Bill is crucial to ensuring the long-term survival and recovery of vital shark populations. It is an important step for the UK to demonstrate its leadership and commitment to shark conservation. I therefore urge all Members to support the smooth passage of the Bill through this House and onto the statute book.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1633.1\/1\">My Lords, I join other noble Lords in thanking the noble Lord, Lord West of Spithead, for tabling this debate, and I thank all noble Lords for their insightful contributions.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/2\">Before I respond to the points raised during this debate, I have to declare an interest. I lived in Hong Kong for the best part of a decade and I am a former  member of the APPG on Hong Kong. I should also say at the outset that, when I refer to China in this debate, I am referring specifically to the Chinese authorities and not to the Chinese people. The noble Lord, Lord Liddle, made a similar point in his remarks.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/3\">My noble friend Lord Howell made the fair point that this is an enormous subject. He is obviously quite right. It will be difficult to do justice to all the contributions in the short time I am allowed, but I will study Hansard and if I miss anything I commit to write.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/4\">The scale and reach of China&#8217;s economy, the size of its population, the speed of its technological advancement and its increasing ambition to project its influence on the global stage have profound implications worldwide, including for UK interests. The UK&#8217;s integrated review of security, defence, development and foreign policy sets out the Government&#8217;s commitment to respond to the systemic challenge that China poses to our security, prosperity and values and those of our allies and partners. At the same time, we are committed to maintaining a robust but functioning relationship. We must try to manage disagreements and preserve space to engage where our interests align.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/5\">My friend the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of St Albans asked about the economic and financial dialogue. No date has been agreed for it. Arrangements for it sit within the Treasury.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/6\">We are both permanent members of the UN Security Council, and members of the G20. There are mutually beneficial reasons for us to work together, from increasing trade and co-operation in science and innovation to tackling climate change and rebuilding the global economy. As we work to understand and respond to the long-term security challenges arising from China&#8217;s increasing assertiveness and the modernisation of its military, we are in good company. As many noble Lords noted, including the noble Lords, Lord West, Lord Alton and Lord Foulkes of Cumnock, there was an unprecedented joint address by MI5 and FBI heads in the last couple of weeks, I think it was. They have a mandate to speak out about threats to our countries and there are serious and well-evidenced concerns. The speech was clear that engaging China is in the UK&#8217;s interest. We want UK organisations to be able to engage safely, and they can do so only if they are aware of the potential risks arising from China&#8217;s actions.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/7\">As the noble Lord, Lord West, noted, in June the Prime Minister joined other NATO leaders to sign off a new NATO strategic concept. To answer the noble Viscount, Lord Waverley, I do not think it is ambiguous. For the first time, it recognises that China&#8217;s ambitions and coercive policies challenge the alliance&#8217;s interests, security and values. The Prime Minister also met G7 leaders in June, when they renewed their commitment to stand up to China&#8217;s efforts to undermine freedom, human rights, and the rules-based international system. For China to be a responsible power requires transparency, good faith and confidence building, and maintaining lines of communication in order to maintain stability and reduce tensions. We encourage China to take its international responsibilities seriously; for example, engagement as one of the permanent members of the Security Council in the P5 nuclear risk reduction process.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/8\">The integrated review sets out the Government&#8217;s commitment to reduce our vulnerabilities and improve our resilience to persistent threats. Most noble Lords referred to the specific issue of a published strategy. Our approach to China is co-ordinated across government. The FCDO is at the heart of the cross-Whitehall strategic approach to China, but led by the National Security Council, as referenced by the noble Lord, Lord Collins. The integrated review highlights that we will do more to adapt to China&#8217;s growing impact, managing disagreements, defending our values and co-operating where our interests align, but it remains the case that we do not publish NSC strategies on China or other issues. We continue to implement a comprehensive and co-ordinated approach to China, which identifies and pursues UK interests in these areas, engaging international partners as we do so.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/9\">A number of noble Lords, including, powerfully, I thought, the noble Lords, Lord Rogan and Lord Collins, mentioned Taiwan. The UK, like our international partners, has a clear interest in enduring peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. The UK&#8217;s long-standing position on Taiwan has not changed, as the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary have made clear. The numerous Chinese military flights that have taken place near Taiwan recently are not conducive to regional peace and stability. We consider the Taiwan issue one to be settled peacefully by the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait through constructive dialogue, without the threat or use of force or coercion. In June, G7 leaders confirmed their shared perspective on this issue. We support Taiwan&#8217;s meaningful participation in international organisations as a member where statehood is not a prerequisite, and as an observer or guest where it is; for example, at the World Health Organization.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/10\">The noble Lord, Lord West, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of St Albans asked some very pertinent questions around issues in the South China Sea. We remain seriously concerned by militarisation, coercion and intimidation in the South China Sea, and we are opposed to action that raises tensions. We believe in the primacy of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and in freedom of navigation and overflight. We are clear that the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea is the legal framework for all activities in the oceans and seas. That is why we set out our full legal position on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the South China Sea to Parliament in September 2020. We have objected to China&#8217;s claims based on the so-called nine-dash line, and the &#8220;offshore archipelagos&#8221; concept, and believe they are unfounded in UNCLOS. We agree with the findings of the 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Award in this respect and we are supporting ASEAN partners to strengthen maritime law and security capacity, including by delivering law of the sea training in February.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/11\">The Royal Navy, as the noble Lord, Lord West, will be delighted to hear, continues to operate in the South China Sea and the wider region, with the Carrier Strike Group having navigated the South China Sea in July and October last year. Building on this deployment, HMS &#8220;Spey&#8221; and HMS &#8220;Tamar&#8221; have established a permanent Royal Navy presence in the Indo-Pacific. They have also operated in and around the South  China Sea and have been working hard to deepen our relationships with allies and partners throughout the region.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/12\">I turn to China&#8217;s economic and political influence around the world. It is an authoritarian state, with different values from our own. Our aim is to bring more countries into the orbit of free-market economies. We have launched British investment partnerships as part of the international development strategy, which will contribute to the G7 partnership for global infrastructure and investment. We aim to mobilise up to &#163;8 billion of UK-backed financing a year by 2025, including from investors in the private sector. Additionally, we will invest &#163;1.5 billion to &#163;2 billion a year through British international investment in private sector companies, expanding into the Indo-Pacific and the Caribbean.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/13\">A couple of noble Lords referred specifically to the Solomon Islands. As I think I referenced earlier, the UK is committed to and strategically focused on the Indo-Pacific region, as set out in the integrated review. As a long-standing partner and friend, the UK works to support peace and prosperity for the people of the Solomon Islands and across the Pacific region. Our recent deployment of the UK Emergency Medical Team demonstrates our commitment to the Solomons.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/14\">We have also taken steps to protect domestic security and increase our resilience. These measures are not targeted at China specifically; they shield us from all potential external threats. We have introduced the National Security and Investment Act to prevent predatory investment that undermines our national security. The noble Lords, Lord West and Lord Alton, and my noble friend Lady Meyer addressed the domestic operations of certain Chinese companies. The National Security Bill will make it even harder for states to commit hostile acts against the UK. In specific answer to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, as he will know, the Business Secretary has decided to call in the acquisition by Nexperia of Newport Wafer Fab for a full national security assessment.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/15\">The National Security Bill will modernise our counter-espionage laws and provide our world-class law enforcement and intelligence agencies with new tools to protect us from evolving threats, including from China. It is worth pointing out that we have also enhanced export controls and strengthened measures, including visa vetting, to prevent the transfer of sensitive technologies through academic collaboration.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/16\">A number of noble Lords asked about Hikvision cameras. As we have said before, we take the security of our citizens&#8217; systems and establishments extremely seriously and have a range of measures in place to scrutinise the integrity of our arrangements. It remains our long-standing policy not to comment on the detail of those arrangements, but I can say that we are taking robust action to help ensure that UK businesses and the public sector are not complicit in the human rights violations occurring in Xinjiang.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/17\">The noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, asked about the extent of the economic threat from China; in particular, coercion. China&#8217;s scale of economy, population and ambition means that it will contribute more to global growth than any other country, but it also presents the  biggest state-based threat to the UK&#8217;s economic security. As an open economy, we welcome foreign trade and investment, including from China, where it supports UK jobs and growth in non-strategic areas, but we will not accept investments which compromise our national security and must make sure that trade is reliable and avoids strategic dependency.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/18\">I am running out of time, so will try to race through the last couple of pages of my speech. On cyber, widespread and credible evidence demonstrates that malicious cyberactivity emanating from China poses a threat to UK security. In response to the various cyberthreats we face, we are pursuing a new &#163;2.6 billion national cyber strategy, which will cement the UK&#8217;s place as a leading cyber power. We will also continue to raise our concerns with China in private and call it out publicly, as we did alongside 38 like-minded partners in July 2021.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/19\">On all these issues, we will continue to co-operate with our allies and like-minded partners. As a European power with global reach, we will continue to play a leading role in the continent&#8217;s security. Through our Indo-Pacific tilt, we will continue to deepen our ties with the region, as we have by obtaining ASEAN dialogue partner status and through our AUKUS relationship.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/20\">The noble Lord, Lord West, asked about membership of the IP Quad. The UK recognises the need to be flexible in building new partnerships in the region to realise opportunities and manage risks. The Indo-Pacific Quad is an important means for four of the UK&#8217;s closest partners in the region&#8212;the US, Australia, India and Japan&#8212;to work together more closely. The UK is looking at options for closer practical co-operation with the Quad members in these areas, bilaterally and collectively, supplementing our important bilateral partnership.<\/p><p pid=\"b1633.1\/21\">My noble friend Lord Cormack made an extremely good point: this is a very large subject and deserves a much longer and wider debate. To conclude, the UK is well-prepared to respond to the long-term security challenges emanating from China; we have strong relationships, partnerships and alliances, including through the G7, NATO, ASEAN and other multilateral groups. We have strong security architecture to protect us as the threat from China and other states evolve. We have a permanent regional presence and growing ties in the Indo-Pacific. Underpinning all of those, we have a long-term strategic approach, as articulated in the integrated review. We believe that these collectively equip the UK to adapt to the changing international environment and to China&#8217;s increasing international assertiveness.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1241.0\/1\">My Lords, first, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, for introducing this Bill today. I am happy to support it. The Government tell us&#8212;I was very interested to read the briefing note with its three points&#8212;that their objectives and plan for immigration are<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1241.0\/2\">&#8220;To make the system fairer and more effective to better protect and support those in genuine need of asylum &#8230; To deter illegal entry into the UK breaking the business model of criminal trafficking networks and saving lives &#8230; To remove from the UK those with no right to be here.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1241.0\/3\">Actually, who could disagree with those words? That is all fine; we have no problem with that at all. The problem, of course, is the implementation. We all want to do those things, but I think it is fair to say that, beyond them, the position is unclear, confusing and not doing the job that the Government say they want to do.<\/p><p pid=\"a1241.0\/4\">I have been in this House for 12 years and have lost count of the number of immigration Bills that have come forward from the Government in that time. In every Session there is another one, and it is supposed to be the Bill that will sort out all the problems: this is the one we have been waiting for. &#8220;We could have had it in the last Bill, but here is another Bill&#8221; and it goes on and on. Nothing is actually solved: there is always another scheme; it is always somebody else&#8217;s problem, somebody else&#8217;s fault. At the end of the day, the Government are the Government; they need to get their act together and they are failing dramatically to do that.<\/p><p pid=\"a1241.0\/5\">There are so many schemes that I cannot remember them all. It was really useful to get the briefing note from the Library, because I had forgotten some of the schemes that are in place. We had the Afghan citizens&#8217; resettlement scheme, the Hong Kong British national (overseas) visa, the Dubs scheme that has now been stopped, the gateway protection programme, the vulnerable persons resettlement scheme, the vulnerable children&#8217;s resettlement scheme and the UK resettlement scheme. None of these schemes is doing what it is supposed to be doing and that is part of the problem.<\/p><p pid=\"a1241.0\/6\">Look at the Dubs scheme. It was brought in when amendments were passed in the name of my noble friend Lord Dubs and then, when 480 children were brought into the UK, the Government shut the scheme down. Does anyone really believe that all we needed to do was bring 480 children into the country and the problem would be solved? Of course, they do not, but the Government decided to shut the scheme down and that is partly why we are here today with this Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"a1241.0\/7\">We need a scheme and a policy that protects and looks after vulnerable people when they come to the UK. We listened to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham, and his description of the children coming from Afghanistan was heartbreaking. Thousands of miles away with no parents, they are left here and  it is heartbreaking; they do not know where their parents are.<\/p><p pid=\"a1241.0\/8\">As the noble Baroness, Lady Wheatcroft, said, we all missed our family&#8212;and we had the luck of living in a safe country. How would you feel if you were a young person and did not know where your parents were? You cannot get hold of them; you do not know whether they are going to get there. Then, of course, you have the Government here not doing what they should be doing.<\/p><p pid=\"a1241.0\/9\">We all talk about the need for safe and legal routes. We want safe and legal routes&#8212;they are what the Government have failed to provide, and they are the particular issue this Bill is trying to deal with&#8212;but let us also look at the issue of criminal gangs. I want the people responsible, the criminals, caught. I want them prosecuted and put out of business. That would involve the authorities here working with our partners across the channel, but that is not happening. There is lots of huffing and puffing going on&#8212;lots of bullets being fired and people moaning about whose fault it is&#8212;but we actually need to talk with our colleagues in France, Belgium, Holland and elsewhere to put these people out of business once and for all.<\/p><p pid=\"a1241.0\/10\">If we deal with that and have safe and legal routes, we will begin to sort the problem out. That is where we are going wrong here. So, as I said, I am happy to support the noble Baroness&#8217;s Bill. It is an attempt to get those things right. If we do not do so, we will end up coming back here again and again to deal with issues that have not been solved and more immigration Bills that achieve very little. We will not get anywhere.<\/p><p pid=\"a1241.0\/11\">I support the Bill and hope that we will get a positive response from the Minister. I expect that we will not, but perhaps he will surprise me. This issue is not going to go away until the Government deal with the question of how we can have proper safe and legal routes and deal with the criminal gangs. This Bill is one attempt to deal with those problems, which we all know are there and are heartbreaking to see.<\/p>",

The Government undertook to report after due consideration taking place later this year and next. Can the Minister confirm that this is still the position? Does she have anything to add to it?<\/p><p pid=\"a994.0\/2\">The second issue concerns the treatment of Hong Kong Military Service Corps veterans who did not retain their British passports as had some of their number in 1997. I raised this in the debate on the then Armed Forces Bill. The MoD passed it to the Home Office for further consideration. I raised it again in the debates on the then Nationality and Borders Bill earlier this year, which led to a commitment from the Dispatch Box that the Government would resolve this long-standing issue by the end of this calendar year with a further undertaking to report on progress in June. June has been and gone, and I have yet to have a response to my Question for Written Answer seeking information on progress. As this concerns veterans, I hope that the MoD will continue to take an active interest in the outcome which veterans have long sought.<\/p>",

I, too, thank <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Robert Goodwill\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11804\">the right hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Sir Robert Goodwill)<\/phrase> for securing this crucial debate on the future of bus and coach manufacturers. I am also a member of the all-party parliamentary group for the bus and coach industry.<\/p><p pid=\"a274.0\/2\">Like many others, I am very proud of my local bus manufacturer in the Falkirk constituency. I know so many of the people, and their families and friends, who have worked for that company for so long&#8212;some have spent their entire life in the same business. It is a testament to that model company, how good it is and how it retains its staff for so long.<\/p><p pid=\"a274.0\/3\">The right hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby covered many of the concerns in his speech, so excuse me, Mrs Murray, for reiterating some of his well-made points&#8212;they were so well put over to us all. I am sure  that my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Gavin Newlands\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25291\">the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire North (Gavin Newlands)<\/phrase>, the Front-Bench spokesperson, will bring in the Scottish perspective and how well we are doing in Scotland.<\/p><p pid=\"a274.0\/4\">Let me add some context on Alexander Dennis Ltd. Alexander Dennis is the UK&#8217;s largest bus and coach manufacturer, with a market share consistently above 60%. ADL offers single and double-deck vehicles under the brands Alexander Dennis and Plaxton, and has more than 31,000 vehicles in service in Scotland, the wider UK&#8212;including, of course, here in London&#8212;Europe, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Mexico, Canada and the United States. It is the largest employer in the sector, with a global headcount of 2,100. In the UK, it has eight sites, employing nearly 2,000 people. They are all good, well paid and highly skilled jobs.<\/p><p pid=\"a274.0\/5\">ADL is part of NFI Group, one of the world&#8217;s largest independent global bus manufacturers. ADL is the only bus and coach manufacturer in a position to offer custom-made buses and coaches spanning electric, hydrogen and, as of the latter part of this year, a fully autonomous bus service, as has already been said. I have watched these buses going across the Forth road bridge. It is quite scary to begin with, but they are being well tested. They will be of great benefit in improving the air quality of the whole area. I look forward to seeing them go into service. I advise anybody in this room&#8212;or anywhere else&#8212;to try to take a trip on board one. I think that would probably allay some of the fears that we would all have.<\/p><p pid=\"a274.0\/6\">As well as UK buses being built in Falkirk and Larbert, which supports local supply chains, ADL is leading the charge for Scotland plc, setting the highest standards of engineering. A project that illustrates that is Scotland&#8217;s first built hydrogen fuel cell double-deck bus. Alexander Dennis was selected by the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority as the supplier for 20 zero-emission hydrogen double-deck buses following a competitive tendering process. The 20 ADL Enviro buses are being directly purchased through the Liverpool city region&#8217;s transforming cities fund, and will be owned by the people of the city region. We have a proud history, grounded in heritage and tradition, with a long legacy in Falkirk going back as far as 1902. There are nearly 700 people employed in Falkirk and Larbert, and Larbert is the global headquarters of the business.<\/p><p pid=\"a274.0\/7\">Alexander Dennis is committed to supporting the UK Government&#8217;s ambitions, but it is almost at breaking point and the Government need to deliver on their funding promises. The company is investing heavily in UK operations in facilities across the whole of the UK. I want the Minister to listen to this: Alexander Dennis is investing in innovation, engineering, production, apprenticeships, graduate programmes, people development, after-market support and, most importantly, a zero-emission future. These bus and coach manufacturers are well driven, but the Government are not matching their ambition, even though the policy is driven by the Government.<\/p><p pid=\"a274.0\/8\">I have two questions for the Minister. The UK Government said that they are committed to their promise of 4,000 British-built buses. Could she outline what steps the UK Government are taking to protect British bus and coach manufacturing jobs, many of which are in my Falkirk constituency? I would like to hear about  that in detail. Finally, the zero-emission bus regional areas scheme delays are unacceptable, frankly. It has been over a year. I have been outside Parliament speaking with Baroness Vere, who promised that they would arrive imminently. That has not happened, and it is unacceptable. Manufacturers were promised that the funding would result in new orders that would and could then be built in Falkirk.<\/p><p pid=\"a274.0\/9\">The UK bus and coach industry is still desperate for a shot in the arm. It needs certainty on the delivery of that promise. If the trend of stagnation and the inertia continues, there will&#8212;no maybes&#8212;be serious consequences for the future of UK bus and coach manufacturing in the likes of Falkirk. What action are the Government taking to resolve those crucial concerns?<\/p>",

My problem today is that some of  the questions have simply not been answered. What is the issue around Hikvision and Departments? Why are we still engaged with a company that has been declared a security risk? Why will we not get rid of these things? What is happening over Huawei? It is distorting universities by its constant presence and money&#8212;it is not alone in that. What about the selling of British-owned, strategic security companies to Chinese companies? Very little is being done about that.<\/p><p pid=\"a113.3\/2\">Those are all background issues. The main issue, which simply cannot be answered, is that we are dealing with a Chinese Government that have invaded the South China sea, killed Indian soldiers on their border, and are carrying out a declared genocide in Xinjiang. They use forced labour; they have sold products to the world&#8212;which we have bought&#8212;made by slave labour. They are persecuting Christians and, as I now understand it, Inner Mongolians. They distort the global trading system, and they are guilty of enormous, as yet unprosecuted, human rights abuses.<\/p><p pid=\"a113.3\/3\">That Government is responsible for Hong Kong. In what world would we think that our current complaints carry any weight whatsoever? The persecutions and arrests in Hong Kong of peaceful democracy campaigners are an abomination. However, my Government need to do much more. I simply cannot understand why America can sanction the people who are trashing the agreement, and my Government talk of keeping it under review. Sophistry is what we have got, and it is simply unacceptable. I am sorry that I should be saying this, but the Foreign Office&#8217;s failure to act is a damnation of its capability. Time and again we tiptoe around those issues instead of confronting them<\/p><p pid=\"a113.3\/4\">Today was an opportunity for my Government to say, &#8220;Enough is enough. We are now going to sanction them.&#8221; There are people who own property here. We had to drag the Government kicking and screaming to start sanctioning over Ukraine&#8212;now we have to do it over Hong Kong. Let us stand up for freedom, democracy, the rule of law and human rights. Let us not spend our time worrying about whether we will get a trade contract from a country that is abusive and disgraceful.

It addresses a problem that is far less severe than right-wing think tanks have claimed, and for which the Government&#8217;s White Paper admitted that there is very little supporting evidence. Ministers who preach deregulation and shrinking of the role of government are introducing a Bill to impose burdensome and costly new regulations on British universities&#8212;the sort of thing that authoritarian Governments in Hungary and Russia impose to limit critical debate and cripple civil society. This is not what a Government who claim to be leading the democratic world against authoritarian regimes should be doing.<\/p><p pid=\"b585.0\/2\">It is also an orphan Bill. Those who pushed for it in government&#8212;Munira Mirza, the champion of culture wars in No. 10, and Gavin Williamson and his special advisers in the DfE&#8212;have now left. Perhaps for that reason, the Bill loitered in the Commons through the last Session, giving hope to some of us that reasonable voices in government had thought it wise to let it die. But here it is, staggering on because wiser counsels within the Conservative Party have not prevailed, pushed  onwards by the American and Australian-trained campaigners in No. 10 who think that fighting culture wars appeals to the Conservative base.<\/p><p pid=\"b585.0\/3\">Our Prime Minister has been fond of the boast that the UK is &#8220;a soft power superpower&#8221;. The Minister will recall that the integrated review of foreign and security policy devoted an entire chapter to the importance of soft power. It listed as its most valued institutional components the BBC, the British Council, the quality and financial scale of our overseas development programme, the reputation of our universities, and the strength of our cultural sector. Since then, the Government have cut the aid budget, sidelined the British Council and repeatedly attacked and financially weakened the BBC. Now this Bill threatens to weaken the global standing and reputation of our universities by extending government oversight of academic debate, appointments and promotions.<\/p><p pid=\"b585.0\/4\">There is a problem of toleration of dissent by the current student generation in our universities. The Higher Education Policy Institute has just published a survey which indicates that students have become more protective of what they see as vulnerable minorities, less willing to accept that freedom of speech necessarily includes the right to offend and less willing to tolerate university teachers whose views clash sharply with their own. We have seen a small but painful number of instances in which universities have failed to defend their staff in such circumstances, most sharply the University of Sussex in the case of Professor Stock.<\/p><p pid=\"b585.0\/5\">University leadership needs to underline the importance of tolerance of different views among staff and students, but in a free society that role should be played by university leaders and not be imposed by government. In any case, how severe and widespread a problem is this for the over 100 universities? Is the challenge we face worse than in in previous cycles of student activism, which universities have come through without requiring heavy-handed government intervention?<\/p><p pid=\"b585.0\/6\">Gavin Williamson in his preface to last year&#8217;s White Paper specifically deplored attempts to block Ministers from speaking at and ambassadors from visiting universities. The very first lecture I gave as a newly appointed lecturer at Manchester University in January 1968 was disrupted by a protest at the suspension of a student for assaulting an Education Minister the night before. I went to a ceremony at King&#8217;s College London some weeks ago to unveil a portrait of one of the students who had disrupted my lecture, who has since become an adviser to Governments and a globally recognised academic.<\/p><p pid=\"b585.0\/7\">Some noble Lords may be old enough to remember the Stop the Seventy Tour and the wider student campaign against apartheid South Africa. My wife can still remember the song she and others sang as they blocked the South African ambassador from speaking at Oxford University. I have just read a memoir of the Stop the Seventy Tour which confirms that at least two of its most activist members have since become Members of this House.<\/p><p pid=\"b585.0\/8\">Last year, I spoke to a number of vice-chancellors about this Bill and the issues it raises. One retired VC reminded me that he had struggled to maintain order on his campus in the face of deliberately provocative  speakers invited by the then chairman of his student Conservative Association, one John Bercow. A current vice-chancellor told me that the biggest problem of this sort he faces is keeping the peace between his Chinese and Hong Kong students.<\/p><p pid=\"b585.0\/9\">There is nothing new about student protest or arguments about the limits of freedom of speech in universities&#8212;and I have been an academic for 40 or more years. The question is whether the imposition of a heavy external burden of intrusive regulation, with the introduction of a new tort that will transfer large sums of money from university funds to lawyers through litigation, is a proportionate response to the limited number of unacceptable instances we have seen, above all related to trans rights. I suggest that the proposals are disproportionate. This extension of state interference over autonomous institutions is authoritarian and not Conservative.<\/p><p pid=\"b585.0\/10\">The Bill covers not only students and student unions but also staff, visiting speakers and the loosely defined &#8220;members&#8221; of higher education providers. I understand that, as a retired professor, I may count as a &#8220;member&#8221; of the LSE, with standing to sue or be sued under the Bill&#8212;I shall have to check with the director. The provision that permits discontented staff to sue if they consider<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b585.0\/11\">&#8220;the likelihood of their securing promotion or different jobs at the provider being reduced&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b585.0\/12\">opens a huge can of worms. I declare an interest: I was once passed over for promotion at the department of government at Manchester on the grounds that I was &#8220;too interested in politics&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b585.0\/13\">The anti-intellectual right in the United States, with its claims that universities are hotbeds of liberalism actively discriminating against honest conservative thinkers, has close links with right-wing bodies in the UK. Policy Exchange in London has claimed on its website to have provided the foundations for the Bill, with almost all of its recommendations in two reports being accepted. I regret that the noble Lord, Lord Godson, is not here today to take credit for that achievement. He might also wish to tell us how much of the significant American funding for Policy Exchange has come from those right-wing foundations that have fuelled Trumpian Republicanism. Think tanks, like universities, should be transparent about their foreign funding.<\/p><p pid=\"b585.0\/14\">I was struck when I read the Policy Exchange papers that they had almost as many references to American examples as British, including some from hard-right foundations. They included the claim that the staff of British universities are overwhelmingly left-wing: 80% apparently failed to vote Conservative or UKIP in the last two general elections. Given that over 20% of staff in most universities are not British citizens, and that a large proportion of that staff are scientists and medics and not particularly interested in politics, I find this statistic completely unbelievable.<\/p><p pid=\"b585.0\/15\">I am concerned, however, about the undertow of anti-intellectual, anti-rational argument from right-wing critics about Britain&#8217;s alleged liberal elite and its allegedly malign hold on our cultural and educational institutions. The Times gave Douglas Murray two pages last Saturday to develop this theme, in which he stated that it&#8217;s now virtually impossible for a climate change sceptic to  gain appointment as a university chancellor or museum director. If challenging the allegedly oppressive liberal cultural elite means insisting on climate change sceptics being appointed to senior academic positions regardless of their attitudes to evidence and reasoned debate, then our universities and their reputation are, indeed, at risk.<\/p><p pid=\"b585.0\/16\">The shadow of Brexit hangs over this, of course, as over so many other aspects of British politics and public debate. The claims that appointments and promotions are biased against conservatives comes from leading members of Historians for Britain and a handful of political scientists. There is no evidence that I am aware of of structural bias against conservative academics; indeed, the founder of UKIP was a friend of mine and a colleague at the LSE. Opening appointment and promotion procedures to challenges over alleged political bias would be a serious incursion into the autonomy of our universities and a feast for lawyers in civil cases.<\/p><p pid=\"b585.0\/17\">This is not the first time that structural bias in universities has been alleged. When Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister, she was determined to abolish the Social Science Research Council. She believed, as a hard scientist, that there was no such thing as social science; that what was taught in universities was intrinsically socialist. She asked Lord Rothschild to report. He, thankfully, responded that careful social and economic research was essential to good government, and that public money should continue to underwrite it. She nevertheless insisted on removing the word &#8220;science&#8221; from what has since then been labelled the Economic and Social Research Council.<\/p><p pid=\"b585.0\/18\">Allegations about left-wing bias in universities focus on social science and humanities, and above all on historians, but history faculties have always argued among themselves, often bitterly. The political balance among academic historians in Britain has been adversely affected by the choice too many of our self-declared patriotic historians have taken to emigrate and take better-paid posts in the United States. Different disciplines have different tendencies. One vice-chancellor told me that his university has a structurally left-wing sociology department and a structurally right-wing economics department: it goes, he said, with the disciplines. Those who want to use this Bill as a lever to promote more solidly conservative views in our higher education institutions should reflect that Britain&#8217;s most clearly conservative institution, after the University of Buckingham, is Christ Church College, Oxford: not the greatest example of toleration of dissent and diversity.<\/p><p pid=\"b585.0\/19\">Others will touch on the tangle of vexatious lawsuits that this Bill will impose on universities. I briefly mention the comment of another vice-chancellor that it will be completely impossible, in the current heated political atmosphere, to find a candidate for the post of free speech champion who will be acceptable to all sides. Nor can we have confidence in Ofcom assuming this role, when the noble Lord, Lord Wharton, as chair, associated himself with Viktor Orb&#225;n and the authoritarian right at a recent Budapest conference. I speak with particular feeling on this as a former visiting professor at the Central European University and a member of its senate in Budapest in its early years, when Viktor Orb&#225;n still called himself a liberal.<\/p><p pid=\"b585.0\/20\">At a time when trust in this Government is at an all-time low, when suspicion of No.10&#8217;s political appointments is high, when the contamination of the Conservative Party by American Republicanism should concern all decent Conservatives, we will have to do our best, as the revising Chamber, to mitigate the damage this Bill could do to the global reputation and standing of our universities.<\/p>",

Lady is talking about where we do have real challenges, with goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. There were flexibilities and vagueness, and some areas of the protocol, in terms of implementation, were not resolved. That was why we had the grace periods, why we had to extend the grace periods and why we now have the standstill. That is exactly why the EU&#8217;s offer, which it pretends provides flexibility, is a backwards step from where we are today; and it is why nobody in this House should accept it unless they are determined to do damage to Northern Ireland.<\/p><p pid=\"d125.1\/2\">This legislation will fix the practical problems that the protocol has created in Northern Ireland. It will enable us to avoid a hard border, protect the integrity of the United Kingdom and safeguard the EU single market. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"David Lammy\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10678\">The right hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy)<\/phrase> spoke at some length&#8212;more than half an hour&#8212;in his opening remarks, and yet in the totality of those remarks we heard no plan, no proposal and no alternative from the Labour party, just words. The same goes for the hon. Member for Hove.<\/p><p pid=\"d125.1\/3\">There were two interesting points, however. The right hon. Member for Tottenham raised Magna Carta to show the importance of treaties. He is right that Magna Carta is an important piece of our history, but he may want to recall that there were 63 clauses in it, and treaties evolve; that is why only four of them remain in place today. He also outlined, and I quote:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"d125.1\/4\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;In our discussions, the DUP had consistently said that it wanted a negotiated settlement&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"d125.1\/5\">I gently say to him that that seemed to be a surprise to all the DUP Members, so he learned something else&#8212;[Interruption.] He talks from a sedentary position, but he might want to check Hansard.<\/p><p pid=\"d125.1\/6\">As I say, what we have heard is an outline of noise without any real proposals or any alternative. Many hon. Members, however, have raised important points around the question of legality, particularly my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Theresa May\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10426\">the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)<\/phrase> and my hon. Friends the Members for Bromley and Chislehurst (Sir Robert Neill) and for North Dorset (Simon Hoare). I can assure the House that this Bill is not just necessary, but lawful. Proceeding with this Bill is legal in international law and in support of our prior obligations to the Belfast\/Good Friday agreement. The protocol is undermining all three strands of the Belfast\/Good Friday agreement, as <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jeffrey M. Donaldson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10172\">the right hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Sir Jeffrey M. Donaldson)<\/phrase> well outlined, and the institutions that underpin it. It is the Government&#8217;s  assessment that this Bill is currently the only way to provide the means to alleviate the socio-political conditions while continuing to support the protocol&#8217;s overall objectives of including and supporting north-south trade and co-operation, in the interests of both the EU and the UK, by ensuring that we protect its single market while protecting the UK&#8217;s internal market. These are all aspects of the Belfast\/Good Friday agreement.<\/p><p pid=\"d125.1\/7\">We recognise that necessity can only exceptionally be invoked in lawfully justified non-performance of international obligations, as was covered very eloquently by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for South Swindon. This is a genuinely exceptional situation. It is only in the challenging, complex and unique circumstances in Northern Ireland that the Government have decided to bring forth this Bill. It has always been this Government&#8217;s position that should the operation of the protocol or withdrawal agreement be deemed to undermine the Belfast\/Good Friday agreement, this would take precedence as the prior commitment under international law. That was outlined back in March 2019 by the then Attorney General and the then Secretary of State for the Department for Exiting the European Union. That was not just the understanding of the UK Government; it was the basis on which the protocol was agreed by both parties. The text of the protocol itself is clear that the Belfast\/Good Friday agreement should be protected in all its parts. We should all take note of the important and powerful words of Lord Trimble, an architect of the Good Friday agreement.<\/p><p pid=\"d125.1\/8\">Many colleagues have raised article 16. We have always reserved the right to take safeguarding measures under article 16 and have made the case that since the summer of last year, the threshold had been met. This Bill is the most effective, efficient and sustainable way to address the far-reaching problems that have arisen as a result of the application of the protocol. Article 16 in itself does not solve the problems in the way this Bill will. It is not only temporary but starts another process.<\/p><p pid=\"d125.1\/9\">Hon. Members such as my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Bill Cash\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10095\">the Member for South Swindon and my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)<\/phrase> talked about the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly. We have been clear with all parties in Northern Ireland that we do need to see, and I want to see, the Executive back up and running to deliver for the people of Northern Ireland. That has to be a priority for all of us. We want to see that Assembly and Executive as soon as possible. The people of Northern Ireland deserve a stable and accountable devolved Government who deliver on the issues that matter most to them. It is clear from comments today that this Bill is a key component that will see the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly return, as we heard from the right hon. Members for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) and for Lagan Valley. I think we can all welcome those comments. This Bill builds on that work. That is what I have heard in the conversations I have had in meeting all party leaders who want to see Stormont return.<\/p><p pid=\"d125.1\/10\">The New Decade, New Approach agreement restored the devolved institutions after a three-year impasse, and we all need to work together to uphold the stability that it provided. We as a Government have a strong record in making sure that the institutions are up and running after too many years of hiatus. The New Decade, New Approach agreement, as set out in legislation, provides  for a period of up to 24 weeks for Northern Ireland&#8217;s political representatives to restore functioning devolved institutions. I expect the parties to make full use of this time to engage with one another in earnest to restore fully functioning devolved institutions and to develop a programme of government that I have written to all the party leaders to encourage work on.<\/p><p pid=\"d125.1\/11\">We do have a role on the international stage. The UK has shown what it stands for in the world, not just with rhetoric but with actions, through our extensive support of Ukraine, our unprecedented offer to those fleeing political instability in Hong Kong, and our leadership of international institutions that is demonstrated again this week at the G7 and NATO summits. We have led the way on climate change, as in so many other areas. That is why it is important, and we are focused on ensuring, that we are acting within the bounds of international law. Indeed, we have repeatedly emphasised that it is only the rare, exceptional circumstances in Northern Ireland that make this intervention necessary.<\/p>",

It takes us into a surreal world of fantastical Government, in which, as the Minister for Brexit Opportunities declares,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b424.0\/2\">&#8220;our country will achieve great things.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class=\"offrep\" id=\", Commons, 22\/6\/22; col. 866.]\"><i>Official Report<\/i>, Commons, 22\/6\/22; col. 866.]<\/phrase><\/p><p pid=\"b424.0\/3\">That is like Donald Trump promising he will make America great again&#8212;just as windy and as empty of content.<\/p><p pid=\"b424.0\/4\">There is no evidence behind this Statement. I challenge the Minister to find any. A great deal of evidence was gathered and analysed on exactly this issue between 2012 and 2015 in what was labelled the balance of competences exercise. Eurosceptic Conservatives in the coalition Government believed that an extensive survey of business, sector by sector, would produce a long list of unnecessary Euro regulations that the UK Government could then demand to be renegotiated.<\/p><p pid=\"b424.0\/5\">Three Ministers oversaw this exercise: David Lidington, Greg Clark and myself&#8212;two Conservatives and a Liberal Democrat. Sector by sector the responses came in, saying that companies were happy with the current balance between domestic and European regulation. Several transport companies argued for greater emphasis on common European regulation rather than less of it. The Scotch Whisky Association, whose then chief executive was David Frost, now the noble Lord, Lord Frost, was particularly enthusiastic about the advantages of common regulation with the European single market. Of course, that was before the noble Lord&#8217;s damascene conversion from evidence-based argument to embittered opposition to everything European.<\/p><p pid=\"b424.0\/6\">Can the Minister tell us what consultations the Government have conducted in the past year with large and small companies before committing themselves to diverge from EU regulations in the way Mr Rees-Mogg plans? My understanding is that UK exporters, both large and small companies, would much prefer the Government to maintain close alignment between UK regulations and those in our largest overseas market. Does the Minister have any recent evidence to the contrary? Does he understand that the Government have any recent evidence to the contrary?<\/p><p pid=\"b424.0\/7\">The chimera of making a bonfire of regulations has appealed to the ideological right ever since Friedrich von Hayek and Milton Friedman. Belief in the superiority of unregulated markets has survived through stark evidence to the contrary, as in the loose regulations that led to the Grenfell fire. Margaret Thatcher understood that a well-regulated market is fundamental to a thriving economy, which is why she pushed for the common regulatory structures of the European single market. British Ministers and officials played a major role in creating that common single market. Many of the regulations that Mr Rees-Mogg is now denouncing were shaped by UK efforts, not imposed by foreign Governments on a powerless UK, as he is now suggesting&#8212;but Mr Rees-Mogg&#8217;s career has been entirely in finance rather than the real economy of production, marketing and exporting, and much of it offshore in Hong Kong, Singapore and other low-tax financial jurisdictions.<\/p><p pid=\"b424.0\/8\">Mr Rees-Mogg is also the Minister for Government Efficiency. He notes in his Statement the extra work that Whitehall officials have undertaken to grasp these &#8220;Brexit freedoms&#8221;, as he puts it. He does not note that leaving the EU and setting up a range of national regulatory agencies to replace those we shared with our European partners has required a substantial increase in both the number of officials and the costs involved. Part of our contribution to the EU budget went towards funding those common agencies; some of them, such as Europol, were led by British officials. Yet at the same time as being Minister for Efficiency&#8212;that wonderfully odd phrase&#8212;Mr Rees-Mogg is pushing for a sharp reduction in Civil Service numbers, without regard to the additional tasks that it is taking on. Can the Minister explain how the Government propose to manage this additional effort while slashing the number of staff?<\/p><p pid=\"b424.0\/9\">There are more windy comments in the Statement about restoring the sovereignty of Parliament, followed by the declaration that most of this will be pushed through under secondary, even tertiary, legislation, without effective parliamentary scrutiny. The illusion that we now stand imperially sovereign in the world, freed of the European yoke, is punctured by the letter that the noble Lord, Lord Grimstone, circulated yesterday, announcing that we are opening trade negotiations with the Gulf Cooperation Council&#8212;in which we will not mention civil or political rights so as to avoid offence. This Government are willing to negotiate and compromise with the GCC but not with our democratic neighbours. Can the Minister explain how giving concessions to the Gulf autocracies avoids limiting UK sovereignty while Mr Rees-Mogg insists that any compromise with the EU infringes on UK sovereignty?<\/p><p pid=\"b424.0\/10\">Last night, I wondered whether the Minister might revolt as he attempted to justify this irrational ideological waffle and follow the example of the noble Lord, Lord Agnew, by walking out of the Chamber and the Government mid-Statement. However, I fear that he has not yet reached that point, despite the nonsensical Statement that he is forced to defend.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a281.0\/1\">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Hollobone. I want to start by thanking <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Damian Collins\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24744\">the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins)<\/phrase> for securing such an important debate and for not giving up when the previous date was cancelled because of Prorogation. Freedom of the press is a right that we celebrate in our country, but sadly it is still severely limited across the world. In the hon. Member&#8217;s opening comments, he very appropriately remembered not only the journalists who have been killed for telling the truth about Russia in Ukraine, but others among the 29 journalists and two assistants who have been killed thus far this year. It is a tragedy.<\/p><p pid=\"a281.0\/2\">The hon. Member mentioned the wealthy people using our British courts to try to silence journalists with whom they disagree&#8212;a shocking but true fact. He also mentioned the hollowing out of local and national media in the United Kingdom through the loss of advertising revenue, partly because of the rise of social media. He rightly said that the protection of journalistic content should be part of the Online Safety Bill, and I certainly support that. Finally, he mentioned something even more important: journalists who publish in their own names are truly accountable for what they write and are often exposed to the risks involved. The truth in news is vital to freedom and democracy.<\/p><p pid=\"a281.0\/3\">We then heard from <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Kenny MacAskill\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/14031\">the hon. Member for East Lothian (Kenny MacAskill)<\/phrase> , who mentioned Shireen Abu Akleh, who I too will talk about shortly, and Julian Assange. He concentrated on Sweden&#8217;s treatment of Assange and his condemnation of Assange&#8217;s extradition to the United States, which was mentioned by other hon. Members as well. The hon. Member, who is the former Justice Secretary of Scotland, also mentioned Craig Murray, whom I have met, his treatment in Scotland and the media&#8217;s attitude.<\/p><p pid=\"a281.0\/4\">We then heard from <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Margaret Ferrier\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25287\">the hon. Member for Rutherglen and Hamilton West (Margaret Ferrier)<\/phrase>, who talked about the achievements of so many women journalists in what is still a male-dominated profession. She made an important point. She mentioned the tragic story of Anna Politkovskaya, who was murdered on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-10-07\">7 October<\/phrase> 2006 in Moscow at the age of just 48&#8212;a brave woman journalist, who was murdered for what she published and the truth that she found and exposed. The hon. Member suggested that the UK should outlaw SLAPPs and also mentioned that 127 journalists are currently detained in China.<\/p><p pid=\"a281.0\/5\">After that, we heard from my dear friend, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jim Shannon\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/13864\">the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)<\/phrase>, who as we know is the chair of the all-party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief. He mentioned China, Hong Kong, Myanmar and the persecution of religious minorities and the journalists who expose those abuses. He said that we know about the persecution of religious minorities only because there is freedom of the press. When that is clamped down on, we no longer hear about the appalling abuses of religious minorities. He rightly said that any restriction of press freedom is an attack on democracy.<\/p><p pid=\"a281.0\/6\">Then we heard from my neighbour and hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Richard Burgon\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25391\">the Member for Leeds East (Richard Burgon)<\/phrase>, who concentrated on the case of Julian Assange, currently in Belmarsh prison as a political prisoner. He mentioned the support for Assange from across the political spectrum and the condemnation of his extradition to the United States, speaking of its chilling effect on other journalists in the UK and around the world. He said that the Assange case was &#8220;an act of intimidation&#8221; against all journalists, and the fact that so many politicians and journalists, of all political views, condemned it said a lot about why what is happening to Assange is totally wrong.<\/p><p pid=\"a281.0\/7\">Just last month, the killing of journalist Shireen Abu Akleh and the disgraceful scenes at her funeral served as a stark reminder of the threats journalists face every single day and that many pay the ultimate price simply for doing their jobs. Shireen&#8217;s death was also an attack on the freedom of the press and the independence of journalists working around the world. As we have heard from right hon. and hon. Members today, it was sadly not an isolated incident. It is vital that the UK acts urgently to protect journalists who are increasingly under threat and puts diplomatic pressure on those who choose to violate their fundamental rights.<\/p><p pid=\"a281.0\/8\">Today I shall focus my remarks on one of our country&#8217;s most influential institutions abroad: the BBC World Service, which reaches 465 million people every single week. It is a vital part of this country&#8217;s soft power and international influence. However, we have seen journalists at the BBC World Service in Russia and Ukraine under constant threat, with their journalistic freedoms severely limited. In the face of those threats, the United Kingdom must support the BBC in using its considerable influence to extend British values around the world. It is firmly in our interests to act.<\/p><p pid=\"a281.0\/9\">The BBC has provided reliable information to the Russian people as Putin continues to wage his illegal and unprovoked war, which he claims to do in their name. We certainly welcome the &#163;4.1 million in emergency funding provided to the BBC World Service so that it can continue its vital work in Ukraine and Russia, but that money took far too long to arrive. The UK must  act far more urgently if we are to protect journalists abroad, particularly when we have such an important tool in Britain&#8217;s armoury against Putin&#8217;s misinformation.<\/p><p pid=\"a281.0\/10\">The Russian public deserve to hear the truth about Putin&#8217;s illegal war. Whether they work for the BBC or not, the courageous journalists who report from some of the most dangerous areas of the world should not be threatened as a result of providing that service. The limiting of the BBC in Russia is part of a series of measures as part of which President Putin has weaponised his own laws to target independent journalists. The worrying amendments to the law on foreign agents, which expanded the grounds for designating individuals as &#8220;foreign agents&#8221;, was rightly condemned by the Venice Commission as constituting<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a281.0\/11\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;serious violations of basic human rights, including the freedoms of association and expression&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a281.0\/12\">It is not just Russia that has introduced restrictive legislation. We should apply diplomatic pressure to every country that seeks to undermine the work of journalists. Across Council of Europe member states, many journalists are detained as criminals, with the vast majority in Turkey. I urge the Minister to raise that at the earliest possible opportunity with her Turkish counterpart.<\/p><p pid=\"a281.0\/13\">In Afghanistan, a ban on foreign media has formed part of the crackdown to prevent reporting from several media outlets. The Taliban&#8217;s attempt to censor the media has led to a huge reduction in the number of media organisations in the country. Will the Minister tell us whether the UK has any plans to help those organisations to continue to report from that country?<\/p><p pid=\"a281.0\/14\">It is extremely disturbing that 98% of jailed journalists are local people imprisoned by their own Governments and that 70% of jailed journalists imprisoned globally were arrested on so-called anti-state charges, including, appallingly, terrorism. We all have to do more to bring such appalling repression to an end. Across the House, we must also put an end to the increase in dangerous rhetoric, with journalists who do not agree with one&#8217;s political opinion being labelled as enemies. That simply contributes to the problem, as we have seen not only in Turkey but across the world in countries as diverse as the United States and Iran.<\/p><p pid=\"a281.0\/15\">The UK must play its part in protecting journalists who deliver high-quality, independent and accurate information to the public at home and abroad. It is completely unacceptable that journalists face so many threats, as we have heard from both sides of this room today. The freedom of the press is an essential part of any democracy, and we all have a responsibility to help to extend the freedoms we enjoy in this country to the rest of the world.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1390.0\/1\">My Lords, I have a quick comment. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for his history lesson. During the period he mentioned, Rutland had the unfortunate experience of being part of Leicestershire. Had grammar schools still existed then, I can only look back and wonder what my own education&#8212;with no money for tutoring&#8212;would have been if the local school in the market town had been left as a secondary modern.<\/p><p pid=\"b1390.0\/2\">I have a specific question on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, about the backstop power, which I was surprised to see included in, I think, the White Paper. What is the timing of that? At the moment, we know that some boroughs are under extraordinary pressure. When we nationally decide, for instance, to admit tens of thousands of families from Hong Kong&#8212;which is a great policy&#8212;we create extraordinary influxes of children into particular areas. I was just reading a Manchester Evening News article about the pressures Trafford Council is under at the moment, having had an extraordinary influx of Hong Kong Chinese families into the area. This has unusual ripples in Trafford, where there are grammar schools within the borough.<\/p><p pid=\"b1390.0\/3\">What would the timing of this be? At the moment, we have local authorities which cannot have any effect on admissions, particularly in those secondary schools that are academies. There is a proposal for a backstop power. This was also before we admitted tens of thousands of Ukrainian families into this country. If in the consultation it is decided not to have the backstop power&#8212;I recognise the view from those in the academies sector on local authorities&#8217; admission policies&#8212;is there not a case for some emergency power in a situation when tens of thousands of families come into an area? You need different admissions arrangements because you have to think about the cohesion of the area  locally. If you have an influx of families, families who have lived in an area for many years find that they cannot get their children into the schools they want. There are also the unpredictable ripples of selection in an area. Can my noble friend the Minister outline the timing of this, because there are boroughs under pressure today?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I begin by thanking my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Sharon Hodgson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11592\">the Member for Washington and Sunderland West (Mrs Hodgson)<\/phrase> for her work on drafting these amendments and others relating to this chapter, which I will speak to shortly. She has campaigned excellently over many years in her role as chair of the all-party parliamentary group on ticket abuse. I attended the most recent meeting of that group back in April to discuss what we need to see changed in the Bill to protect people from scams online. I am grateful to those who have supported the group and the anti-ticket touting campaign for their insights.<\/p><p>It is welcome that, after much flip-flopping, the Government have finally conceded to Labour&#8217;s calls and those of many campaign groups to include a broad duty to tackle fraudulent advertising on search engines through chapter 5 of part 3 of the Bill. We know that existing laws to protect consumers in the online world have failed to keep pace with the actors attempting to exploit them, and that is particularly true of scams and fraudulent advertisements.<\/p><p>Statistics show a steep increase in this type of crime in the online world, although those figures are likely to be a significant underestimate and do not capture the devastating emotional impact that scams have on their victims. The scale of the problem is large and it is growing.<\/p><p>The Financial Conduct Authority estimates that fraud costs the UK up to &#163;190 billion a year, with 86% of that fraud committed online. We know those figures are increasing. The FCA more than doubled the number of scam warnings it issued between 2019 and 2020, while UK Finance data shows that there has been a significant rise in cases across all scam types as criminals adapt to targeting victims online. The pandemic, which led to a boom in internet shopping, created an environment ripe for exploitation. Reported incidents of scams and fraud have increased by 41% since before the pandemic, with one in 10 of us now victims of fraud.<\/p><p>Being scammed can cause serious psychological harm. Research by the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute suggests that three in 10 online scam victims felt depressed as a result of being scammed, while four in 10 said they felt stressed. Clearly, action to tackle the profound harms that result from fraudulent advertising is long overdue.<\/p><p>This Bill is an important opportunity but, as with other issues the Government are seeking to address, we need to see changes if it is to be successful. Amendments 23 and 24 are small and very simple, but would have a profound impact on the ability of the Bill to prevent online fraud from taking place and to protect UK users.<\/p><p>As currently drafted, the duties set out in clauses 34 and 35 for category 1 and 2A services extend only to the design, operation and use of a category 1 or 2A service in the United Kingdom. Our amendments would mean that the duties extended to the design, operation and use of a category 1 or 2A service that targets users in the United Kingdom. That change would make the Bill far more effective, because it would reduce the risk of a  company based overseas being able to target UK consumers without any action being taken against them&#8212;being allowed to target the public fraudulently without fear of disruption.<\/p><p>That would be an important change, because paid-for advertisements function by the advertiser stating where in the world, by geographical location, they wish to target consumers. For instance, a company would be able to operate from Hong Kong and take out paid-for advertisements to target consumers just in one particular part of north London. The current wording of the Bill does not acknowledge the fact that internet services can operate from anywhere in the world and use international boundaries to circumvent UK legislation.<\/p><p>Other legislation has been successful in tackling scams across borders. I draw the Committee&#8217;s attention to the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006, which made it a crime to sell a ticket to the Olympics into the black market anywhere in the world, rather than simply in the UK where the games took place. I suggest that we should learn from the action taken to regulate the Olympics back in 2012 and implement the same approach through amendments 23 and 24.<\/p><p>New clause 5 was also tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Washington and Sunderland West, who will be getting a lot of mentions this afternoon.<\/p>",

I have a number of questions about how we respond to this and particularly about the place of trade with a country which crushes dissent and which stands accused by our own Foreign Secretary, Elizabeth Truss, of committing genocide against the Uighur people of Xinjiang. In doing so, I refer to my non-financial interests declared in the register.<\/p><p pid=\"a505.0\/2\">Do the Government Front Bench think it is licit to promote trade with a country accused of genocide; a country which threatens Taiwan daily; a country which disregards&#8212;as the noble Lord, Lord Ahmad, said to me in response to a question recently&#8212;every single one of the 30 articles in the 1948 convention on human rights, not least in Hong Kong? Despite Project Defend, which was described to me and the noble Lord, Lord Blencathra, during a helpful meeting with the noble Lord, Lord Grimstone, the UK&#8217;s trade deficit with China more than tripled last year. Our imports were valued at more than &#163;40 billion more than our exports, while UK exports declined by 34%. We spent &#163;10 billion on NHS procurements from China, which is the size of our entire diminished ODA budget. Some of the purchased products were defective  and some were produced fraudulently. Most could and should have been made by British manufacturers, but if competitors use slave labour, they will always be able to outcompete British interests. What difference has Project Defend made to that? What would the Government regard as its success?<\/p><p pid=\"a505.0\/3\">In this context, when the noble Lord, Lord Ahmad, comes to reply, I would like to know if he is for or against the sale of Newport Wafer Fab to a Chinese company. Does he disbelieve or believe the CCP when it says its objective is to take control of semiconductor chip production and acquire intellectual property? Could he tell us how many UK businesses in the semiconductor supply chain are foreign owned? What assessment has been made of the value of Newport Wafer Fab&#8217;s intellectual property and the sensitivity of any defence contracts it currently has? How does this fit with the objective of a digital markets Bill? Will he say what impact the proposed takeover will have on the UK&#8217;s stated ambition in the integrated review to be a digital and data hub?<\/p><p pid=\"a505.0\/4\">In 2019, the United States blacklisted China General Nuclear, accusing it of stealing nuclear secrets. Where does this leave the United Kingdom and, for instance, Hinkley Point? Where does it leave Sizewell? Surely allowing a company linked to the CCP to be involved in building a nuclear plant at Bradwell, just 50 miles from London, must cause the noble Lord some concern.<\/p><p pid=\"a505.0\/5\">With human rights in free fall, I hope the noble Lord will tell us whether the Procurement Bill, mentioned in the gracious Speech, will follow the admirable lead of the Department of Health and its Secretary of State, Sajid Javid, who has banned Hikvision surveillance cameras in his department. A company linked with the Uighur surveillance state in Xinjiang has 1 million cameras in the United Kingdom. Some of our Five Eyes allies have banned and sanctioned Hikvision. Why have we not?<\/p><p pid=\"a505.0\/6\">Given reports from our intelligence services of CCP agents at work in this very Parliament, can the Minister explain why the foreign agent registration scheme has been omitted from the National Security Bill? Some of these issues are addressed in the September 2021 report on China, trade and security from the International Relations and Defence Select Committee, subtitled A Strategic Void. When will the Government provide time for it to be debated?<\/p><p pid=\"a505.0\/7\">I finish where I began, in Hong Kong, where in 2019 I witnessed, as an election monitor, 3 million people, equivalent to 71% of registered voters, voting for democracy. By contrast, a handful of cadres have just appointed John Lee, the enforcer of the national security law, as the new Chief Executive. While HSBC welcomed Lee&#8217;s appointment, G7 Foreign Ministers and the European Union have spelt out their &#8220;grave concern&#8221; about the<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a505.0\/8\">&#8220;continued assault on political pluralism and fundamental freedoms.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a505.0\/9\">UK trade and economic deals, such as JETCO, were suspended in response to the national security law under which last week&#8217;s arrests were made. I hope that, when he comes to reply, the noble Lord will take the opportunity today to repudiate reports that these initiatives may be restarted and assert that, in the long term, we must strengthen our international alliances and be united in response to Chinese belligerence.<\/p>",

Will these arrests bring a change of approach by the UK Government? Will we see speedier action?

            "body": "<p pid=\"b218.0\/1\">I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and Mr Deputy Speaker for being so understanding regarding my need to be  absent from the Chamber for a period of time and then allowing me to come back to speak. That is very gracious of you.<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/2\">It is always an honour to follow <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Lloyd Russell-Moyle\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25667\">the hon. Member for Brighton, Kemptown (Lloyd Russell-Moyle)<\/phrase>, who has a flair for theatrics. He is a gentleman I certainly enjoy conversing with. I am sure that his audition just now for the Christmas panto in Brighton will get some phones ringing for him.<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/3\">The people of Stoke-on-Trent, Kidsgrove and Talke were delighted with this Queen&#8217;s Speech, because it talks about the very places that they are proud to call home, and about the very issues that they raised with me on the doorsteps when I was out knocking doors in the recent local elections. Today&#8217;s theme of safer streets is clearly one of those. They were delighted that the Government are pushing forward with the measures in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, which will see child killers receiving a whole-life sentence, killer drivers being given longer sentences, and an end to the automatic early release of violent and sexual offenders.<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/4\">We will also see the adoption of the Desecration of War Memorials Bill, which I brought to this House after the shameful acts of vandalism upon our Union flag at the Cenotaph in London over a year ago now. When I looked into that, I noticed that it was happening not just in London but across the country, and sadly even in Tunstall, where a war memorial to our glorious dead was graffitied. Thanks to two fantastic young girls who went along to clean it, that really brought to people&#8217;s attention the importance of making sure that war memorials&#8212;and war graves, which the Government rightly added&#8212;have special protection. While the monetary value of war graves, for example, would require 10 or more to be damaged for any offence to go to a magistrates court, we now have an offence that reflects the emotional damage done to a community. These war memorials and war graves are in every village, town and city of our United Kingdom, and our glorious dead should always have the respect that they rightly deserve. It was just a shame that when I brought the Bill to the House Opposition Members ridiculed it as somehow being protection for statues rather than what it was clearly about&#8212;protecting war graves and memorials to our glorious dead. I hope that their jumping on the Twitter bandwagon, as the Opposition frequently like to do, will be a lesson learned and they will now come out and say that it was absolutely right to make sure that those memorials have full protection.<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/5\">I am delighted to hear that we will have the draft victims Bill, because giving rights to victims is so important. It is sometimes easy, in the criminal justice system, for us to focus on the offenders and forget the victims. It is vital that we ensure that victims not only have their day in court but receive extra support and welfare after any sentence is given so that they can rightly feel recompensed for the crime committed against them.<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/6\">The Nationality and Borders Act 2022 is exactly what the people of Stoke-on-Trent, Kidsgrove and Talke voted for when, back in 2016, 73% of them voted to leave the European Union because they wanted us to take back control of our borders. They wanted to send a very clear message that while they have absolutely no issue with people coming to this country legally&#8212;people, for example, who they can see are coming from Afghanistan, Syria and Ukraine fleeing persecution&#8212;they do have  an issue with people choosing to come across as illegal economic migrants from safe mainland European countries such as France, putting tens of thousands of pounds into the hands of people-smuggling gangs and fuelling an industry that is causing misery and turning the English channel into a watery grave. Let us not forget that 70% of those making that journey are men. My constituents see that queue-jumping and it does not  sit right with them. That is not because they are  not compassionate: Stoke-on-Trent is the fifth-largest contributor to the asylum dispersal scheme. They are happy to do all they can to support those who are most vulnerable and most in need, but they want fairness. If someone is coming from Ukraine, Syria, Hong Kong or Afghanistan, that is fair. People choosing to make that journey unnecessarily is simply not right. It is jumping the queue, and the British public were delighted to hear, when I was out in Stoke-on-Trent North, Kidsgrove and Talke, that we are taking action. They are just waiting to see that first flight take off and that policy come to fruition.<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/7\">The Public Order Bill is another fantastic piece of legislation. My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Lee Anderson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25894\">the Member for Ashfield (Lee Anderson)<\/phrase> was absolutely correct to say that it is simply not right that the crusty woke warriors who are busy gluing themselves to pavements or roads, or standing on top of trains, meaning that they cannot leave&#8212;people who are preventing others from going out to earn their money&#8212;are allowed to take that action without feeling the full force of the law. There are plenty of ways for someone to demonstrate their feelings about wanting to solve the climate change crisis without having to go to those extremities where they damage people&#8217;s lives, particularly when we are suffering with rising inflation and a rising cost of living. They are asking people potentially to lose out on a day&#8217;s pay, and that is simply not right. Those people need to be held to account, especially when&#8212;the Policing Minister has said this from the Dispatch Box&#8212;they are taking extremely dangerous action on motorways, risking the lives of men, women and children, as well as their own. That is simply not appropriate, and it is therefore correct that we take action with this Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/8\">Then we have the Government&#8217;s fantastic ambition of 20,000 extra police officers, of which more than 13,500 have so far been recruited, with over 201 in Staffordshire alone. What is important&#8212;I know that the Policing Minister gets this&#8212;is that we do not just have these numbers, but that we see them transferred on to the streets. We are very lucky in Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire to have got rid of the absolutely pathetic former chief constable, who had no ambition, no drive and no understanding of what the people wanted or expected. We have now brought in the fantastic new chief constable, Chris Noble, who has already drawn up a completely new plan for neighbourhood policing in our local area. It means Newcastle-under-Lyme will have a new policing hub based there, with dedicated officers for the Kidsgrove and Talke area. The plan will also look at how the Stoke-on-Trent North policing area, which I also cover, will work. That will be extremely well received. The plan has bobbies on the beat and bobbies engaging with local businesses, schools and communities, but also makes sure that those response times are met. Those are all the types of thing that people want to see.<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/9\">Finally, there is the safer streets fund, which I fully support. In Stoke-on-Trent, we have had a whopping &#163;2 million or more from four successful bids. My only gripe is that none of that money has gone to Stoke-on-Trent North. It has all gone to my friends in Stoke-on-Trent Central and Stoke-on-Trent South, and I am greedy. I want my own pot of money for places such as Cobridge, Tunstall and Smallthorne, which rightly want alley gates, more CCTV and new back doors and front doors. The blight of antisocial behaviour and fly-tipping is something that Members in all parts of this House will experience in their constituencies. We need to ensure that all the measures that can be taken are taken to prevent that as best as possible. I therefore look forward to lobbying the Minister, Stoke-on-Trent City Council and the Staffordshire police, fire and crime commissioner Ben Adams to make sure that those bids go to the right place.<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/10\">We also need to look at the consequences for those who are responsible for antisocial behaviour. It is easy to blame the Government, and it is easy for the public sometimes to moan at the police, but personal actions are someone&#8217;s personal responsibility, and those individuals should be held accountable for their poor choices. In the case of someone under the age of 18 who is constantly having the police knock on their door, and whose parents or carers are taking no action to back the police, the school or a social worker when they say, &#8220;You need to have stricter controls on the young person you are in charge of&#8221;, perhaps we should look at making sure that those high-vis chain gangs are not just for those who commit ASB. Perhaps the household should be made to go out and tidy up the community and clean up the streets. If they have to suffer the consequences of that delinquent&#8217;s poor actions&#8212;that feral youth who is acting in such a poor way&#8212;perhaps the whole household will take much more seriously the need to back our police, our teachers, our social workers and our care system when they say, &#8220;You, as a parent or carer, have a responsibility to bring up your child or young person in care in a responsible way.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/11\">It is about holding people accountable. Boundaries are important. I know that, because I spent eight and a half years as a teacher before coming here. As a head of year, I was in charge of attendance and behaviour, as well as being&#8212;I am sure Opposition Members will be shocked&#8212;a trade union representative on the shop floor, proud to represent the NASUWT for all that time.<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/12\">I will be quick about the other things in the Queen&#8217;s Speech because I do not want to be cheeky with time. The Mental Health Act reform Bill is personal for me; I shared my story in The Daily Telegraph about my struggles with mental health. I am proud to be part of a campaign called No Time to Wait led by my friend and former Government adviser James Starkie, which calls on the Government to ensure that we have a mental health nurse in every GP surgery across the country to help to triage. We know that 40% of GP cases are specifically for mental health, so we need action on that. I am delighted to have support from Labour Members, such as <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Rosie Duffield\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25656\">the hon. Member for Canterbury (Rosie Duffield)<\/phrase>, who is not in her place, and Liberal Democrats Members as well as the Royal College of Nursing, The Daily Telegraph and Mind, which is an important charity.<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/13\">I was also delighted that the Chancellor hosted a reception for us yesterday at No. 11 Downing Street to share the campaign&#8217;s aims and raise awareness of it. I hope that that is something that the Government will take up. I see the Minister for Health, my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Edward Argar\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25396\">the Member for Charnwood (Edward Argar)<\/phrase>, on the Treasury Bench and I am delighted that he has had the chance to hear that. I look forward to meeting him and the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to have those further discussions. It is something that we simply must come to terms with and deal with quickly.<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/14\">I am delighted that the Online Safety Bill is coming forward, because we need to tackle those vile online sites that coerce and advise people on how to take their own lives. In Stoke-on-Trent, a young man called Brett Stevens was sadly a victim of that type of crime. His mother Angela brought that to my attention and we have been engaging with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. It is vital that the legislation creates a new offence so that anyone who encourages or assists self-harm is held accountable by the law, as the Law Commission recommended. It is not right that those websites can do such things.<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/15\">Then we have our places and the Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill: this is what the Government were elected on and what Stoke-on-Trent has been long overdue and waiting for after 70 years of Labour neglecting it and forgetting where it is, because the assumption was that it would automatically vote Labour at every general election. It took Labour losing Stoke-on-Trent for its party members to find where it is, although that was a bit of a journey&#8212;they thought it was in Stoke Newington at first, but they finally made their way to Stoke-on-Trent on a couple of occasions. Every time they have come, the Conservative gains have increased in the local elections and by-elections, so I thank them very much for all the campaigning that the Opposition are helping us with.<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/16\">With the planning reforms that are being undertaken, I want the Government to go further than just compelling landlords on the high street to fill their shops after a year. I want them to strengthen planning enforcement to make sure that if a landlord&#8217;s window is broken or dirty, if there is poo muck, as there sadly is outside some of my shop fronts, or if the signs are hanging half off, the landlord is held responsible and tidies it up. It is not appropriate for a private landlord to allow the high street to become neglected and ruined. The state should give the power to local councils to hold those responsible to account.<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/17\">I also want the Government to adopt my ten-minute rule Bill, which I introduced more than two years ago and reintroduced in the previous Session&#8212;I will be doing that again this time&#8212;about section 215 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. It would increase the current fine of a maximum of &#163;1,000 on a rogue or absent landlord, as we have at Price and Kensington, to make it unlimited to allow a judge to determine the seriousness of the fine. The Bill would also increase the daily fine after that from &#163;100 to &#163;500 so that rogue landlords can be held accountable and responsible for their actions.<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/18\">On education, we have the Skills and Post-16 Education Act 2022, which is brilliant because it is about time that we have a focus on technical education and apprenticeships. We need to make sure that apprenticeships work, which   is why we need to reform the apprenticeship levy. Members across the House will agree that it is not working in the interest of business and is not enticing businesses to take on apprentices. We need to ensure that that lot of money, which is sitting in a pot somewhere not doing anything, is doing what it should be doing and helping those young people or adults who are looking to reskill and retrain. I am delighted to have Jess from Talke Pits as an apprentice in my office, who is doing a fantastic job. We will soon advertise for our new apprentice from Stoke-on-Trent College, because I want to make sure that I am leading the way. If I am calling for businesses to do it, I need to set the example.<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/19\">The &#163;4 billion that is going into those skills through the lifetime skills guarantee is also superb. The higher education Bill with the lifelong loan entitlement will reap benefits for those people who need to reskill or retrain, or who want to have a change, which is exciting. The Schools Bill banishes the lazy culture of low expectations and poor aspiration, which is also important, especially the increase in literacy and numeracy to 90% in young primary school students.<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/20\">There are two other points. It is good that we are going for full academisation by 2030&#8212;it is about time that we do this&#8212;but there are some rotten multi-academy trusts in our system, as I know from my time as a trade union rep. We want a Bill to make sure that the board of trustees of a multi-academy trust faces an Ofsted inspection to look at its governance structures, its accounts and how it is applying its policies across the board. I want these to work, and if they do not work Labour Members will say that these are just more unaccountable and less transparent local education authorities. I do not want the Labour party to be right, which is why I want to make sure we get this policy right. I therefore hope that the Government will adopt my ten-minute rule Bill. I will be reintroducing it in this Session and seeking the cross-party support for it that I got in a previous parliamentary Session, because it is about time that boards of trustees are held to the same standards as the teachers who work within their profession.<\/p><p pid=\"b218.0\/21\">I also wrote not long ago about grammar schools. I know that some Conservative Members will say I am just dragging up an age-old Tory argument, and Labour Members will be going, &#8220;Oh, here we go&#8212;a bit of blue on blue!&#8221; However, I think grammar schools are fantastic. I believe they are fantastic because&#8212;as I saw with my own mother, who is the beneficiary of one, and my own brother, who is the beneficiary of one&#8212;those I have met in Stoke-on-Trent who were able to attend one say that it transformed their lives for the better. It is so important to remember that 60% of grammar schools are situated in 11 out of 150 local education authority areas, which is simply not right. A child in the north-east does not have access to a single one, and that is not appropriate. That is why I hope this Government will work with me to see how we can lift the ban on grammar schools and give parents such a choice, so that parents have the same choice for a kid in Stoke-on-Trent as for a one in Kent.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c691.1\/1\">The history leading into any conflict will be pored over, and there will be various different accounts. We have to deal with the here and now. Having spoken to the parliamentarians who recently came over from Ukraine, I know they have faith in what this country is doing. We will learn on our feet as we go.<\/p><p pid=\"c691.1\/2\">The people of Stroud care deeply about this issue. I receive emails all the time asking me to advocate for more equipment and more lethal aid, and to make sure we are doing whatever we can to support Ukraine. The majority of the public understand the complexities and the essential need to work with NATO, rather than trying to go it alone, despite the emotional pull to do more and more. Stroud very much wants to see Russia defeated and President Putin stopped in his tracks. We give respect to the Ukrainian forces that are keeping up the fight.<\/p><p pid=\"c691.1\/3\">I will focus my remarks on the local work for Ukrainian families. The Minister for the Armed Forces and the Minister for Europe and North America are sitting on the Front Bench, and they are very aware that the fighters being brave for Ukraine need to know that their loved ones are supported and have safe sanctuary in the UK, or in whichever country they choose.<\/p><p pid=\"c691.1\/4\">The schemes we have put in place are very important. We have already settled 88 guests across 43 properties in Gloucestershire, and many more people have put themselves forward to host families. My office is handling 55 applications, and over the last week we have had 27 confirmations that visas and permission to travel letters have been sent out. My website has an awful lot of information for anyone listening to this debate, and I give credit to organisations such as the Help for Ukraine Support Hub down in Dursley and Stroud&#8217;s Ukraine refugee community support network, which are doing a lot of organising.<\/p><p pid=\"c691.1\/5\">It is right to raise concerns in this place where we see problems with procedures and schemes, but the Homes for Ukraine scheme has never been done before anywhere in the world. As we know, the Home Office is already stretched with various schemes to look after families from Afghanistan and Hong Kong, on top of all its day-to-day business. I am the first to criticise, sometimes but not always constructively, when I see problems, but I believe the public understand that, although we want to go faster, we have to be cautious on safeguarding. We have to get this right, and we have to make sure that children and women, in particular, are not at risk of trafficking.<\/p><p pid=\"c691.1\/6\">I have permission to speak on behalf of the &#8220;team Gloucestershire&#8221; MPs, all six of us, on two key points for the Ukrainian refugees who hope to come to our county. First, I want to see fast work to organise a rematching programme for when placements through  the host-matching programme break down for whatever reason. The second is the sharing of data between councils, particularly on the families scheme and on registering issues that arise with safeguarding cases and hosts.<\/p><p pid=\"c691.1\/7\">I completely understand that there is a lot of focus on the original match scheme, but the rematching of willing sponsors with refugees is a vital part of the puzzle. We know that there will situations where relationships with hosts will break down, no matter how much effort is put in on both sides. There will also be situations where councils have to reject homes that are not considered right to host refugees, for whatever reason, and, more importantly, where safeguarding concerns are identified. We know that we all have hundreds of families in our constituencies who wish to take part&#8212;that is particularly the case in Stroud and Gloucestershire, because people have put their hands up quickly&#8212;so it makes no sense that the option available to families if a relationship breaks down or if there is a problem with the host is that they end up in a homelessness situation. I would like us to find a way to use that good will and the option for refugees and councils to rematch on a formal basis, not informally, so that we have all of the Government safeguarding and co-ordination put in place. I hope that the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities is able to achieve that soon.<\/p><p pid=\"c691.1\/8\">Similarly, I hope we can tighten up data sharing, as that will be necessary for safeguarding and for ensuring that the schemes are efficient. In a local case, a 23-year-old female guest was coming to Gloucestershire, but the shared bedroom with a male sponsor was found to be unsuitable, and he had also made an inappropriate comment about the guest during a visit by the property team. Obviously, red flags were going up there, but there is no way to stop that match; the visa was issued. When spoken to, the guest said that the person was their boyfriend, but they have since moved on to another family and there is no way to track them. These are issues of safeguarding. We are talking about a vulnerable lone female. As I have said, we cannot stop the visas, and the guests are not deemed vulnerable under the legal definition as they are adults with no mental illness or disability, so councils cannot intervene. We cannot stop the original sponsors going on to rematch again, because there is no way of registering that there is a red flag for that host.<\/p><p pid=\"c691.1\/9\">I am not going to be a negative ninny&#8212;I completely understand the complexities&#8212;but there are changes we can make to improve these schemes. I have been having wonderful conversations with people in Stroud. In my village of Frampton on Severn, everything starts with a WhatsApp group and there is a fantastic one looking after people who want to host or refugees who are coming. I want this scheme to work. I want it to be a strong pillar of our help for Ukraine, alongside the UK&#8217;s efforts from the MOD, Foreign Office and Home Office. It will bring comfort to those brave Ukrainian men and women fighting on the frontline to know that there are good, strong refugee schemes coming into this country. I look forward to working with all Ministers on a cross-departmental basis to achieve that. The world is dangerous, or it feels dangerous to us, but it is absolutely horrendous for quite a lot of people living in Ukraine right now.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b156.0\/1\">My Lords, I shall add a little balance to this debate by speaking on behalf of the Government on this particular Bill. I speak in particular to Amendment C1 from the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, Amendment B1 from the noble Baroness, Lady Chakrabarti, and Amendment H1 from the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester. I say straightaway that I have great sympathy for the point of view they put forward in those three amendments. In particular,  it is almost certainly the case that there are not enough legal routes for genuine refugees to this country. I recognise what the Minister said about the extent to which we have already accommodated refugees and the figures she quoted, but I still think that we do not have enough legal routes for the generality of refugees, leaving aside those from Hong Kong, the Afghans and Syrians and so forth.<\/p><p pid=\"b156.0\/2\">The noble Lord, Lord Paddick, made the point very well on the previous group of amendments that if we compare the number of asylum seekers to the number of economic migrants&#8212;the number of work visas, for example&#8212;that is the real problem: in numbers. It is numbers I am concerned about principally and not the number of asylum seekers, which is comparatively small. I would trade a reduction in the number of economic migrants&#8212;people taking work visas, particularly the golden visas we have heard about more recently as a result of the Ukraine war&#8212;for an increase in the number of legal routes for genuine asylum seekers. That would be a very sensible thing to do. Not only that but it would be humane. I would do it on the simple humanitarian grounds that some people need legal routes more than purely economic migrants.<\/p><p pid=\"b156.0\/3\">But the problem with that argument is that it only goes so far. First, there is the capacity to absorb new immigrants, given where we are with a large number of work visas, family visas and undergraduate visas each year and, on top of that, the Ukrainians, those from Hong Kong and the rest, and particularly as most immigrants go into the poorer areas of our country. If you read about or experience, as I have done as a former Member of Parliament, the effect on housing, schooling and GPs in the poorer areas of this country of a rapidly increasing number of immigrants over quite a short period, you can see the anger and despair of ordinary British people dealing with this situation. You cannot leave that out of account, particularly when one of the Government&#8217;s major objectives is the levelling-up agenda, which is precisely to help those areas most affected by the number of immigrants coming into the country, whether those are the large number of economic migrants or the smaller number of genuine refugees.<\/p><p pid=\"b156.0\/4\">Finally on this point, however many legal routes we may have, we will not stop the traffickers in human beings just by having more legal routes. We have to tackle the problem directly. While there is a way of getting to this country by paying somebody &#163;2,000 or &#163;3,000 to come across the channel, people will take that opportunity. That is the difficulty. While I respect the views of the Opposition and the independents that we need more legal routes, that will not solve the problem of the traffickers across the channel. That is why we have this Bill; we need to tackle that problem directly.<\/p><p pid=\"b156.0\/5\">I fully agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, and the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, on the important point they made about the 2001 refugee convention. I do not want this Government to step outside that in any way. It would be a tragedy if that happened. It should not be allowed to happen; I believe that it will not happen. The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, said that there had been no really serious arguments from the Government against his position on this issue, but he must have heard the  arguments from the noble Lord, Lord Wolfson of Tredegar, earlier in this Bill&#8217;s passage. At some length and across several columns of Hansard, he set out in detail exactly what the Government&#8217;s position was. Surely the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, must agree that the noble Lord, Lord Wolfson, was very persuasive. He may not agree with him, but he was certainly persuasive in his full and detailed account of the Government&#8217;s position and why what they are doing remains within the refugee convention. That is the first point.<\/p><p pid=\"b156.0\/6\">Secondly, lawyers such as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown, and the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, are arguing this in theory and in absentia, being in the Chamber as we are. However, it has already happened in Australia, which has for many years had an offshoring policy agreed between all the parties. In the early stages of that process, its Government had to argue precisely what our Government are arguing now: that what they were doing by way of offshoring was within the 1951 convention and did not abrogate or step outside it in any way. There were court cases in Australia on precisely this point. The Australian Government won them all, because they showed clearly that they were not stepping outside the 1951 convention. So there is that evidence from another country which has done precisely what our present Government are doing.<\/p><p pid=\"b156.0\/7\">In addition, the Australian Government did a sensible thing. Throughout the long development of their offshoring policy&#8212;it took two or three years; this is not something that will be resolved here overnight, perhaps not even in a year or two&#8212;they made a point of having a dialogue with the UNHCR, which is the guardian of the refugee convention. At every stage, they took the trouble to talk to not only the UNHCR&#8217;s headquarters in Geneva but to its local regional representatives and to allow them to inspect exactly what was happening in the offshoring areas and in Australia itself. This kept the UNHCR on board, if you like, so that it had no reasonable reason to disagree with what the Australian Government were doing. I hope that our Government will do exactly the same thing, because it is sensible to do so. We want the UNHCR to have an understanding that what our Government are doing is sensible and appropriate. We do not want to be excessively controversial.<\/p><p pid=\"b156.0\/8\">There is a more general point about this Bill, which I have mentioned before. It is an enabling Bill. It simply sets the scene and gives the Government the power to do something. It is not the final policy. We are way off a final policy. For a start, we must have a sensible arrangement with France to deal with all this. I am sure that that will be a necessary part of any government policy. Having a sensible arrangement with France may be rather easier now that we know who its president is, but it will not be enough for Boris Johnson to say, &#8220;Donnez-moi un break, Emmanuel&#8221;. He will have to have a much more rounded policy, which may take several years given all the other issues we have with France on shipping, the Northern Ireland protocol and all the rest of it. It will take a long time to sort that out; it is far from finished.<\/p><p pid=\"b156.0\/9\">Equally, on offshoring, although I hear what my noble friend the Minister said about what information is available, I still feel extremely vague about what is  happening. I have no idea whether it will work. I have many questions about how this is going to be pursued. It may be a disaster for all I know. I think that a great deal will depend on how exactly it is executed. Again, the Australians, who did this, always say to me that it takes great effort to get these sorts of policies going because they are international policies involving other Governments and you have to get that all right.<\/p><p pid=\"b156.0\/10\">So what we are saying here is that this is an enabling Bill. I ask the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, to think back to his period as a distinguished diplomat. He might well be saying to the Government, in these circumstances, &#8220;Keep the Bill as broad as possible. Give yourselves as much room to manoeuvre as possible, because you simply do not know what will come up in the course of these negotiations with France, Rwanda or whoever&#8221;. You have to allow for that and, if you find yourselves in a situation in which you would like to pursue a course of action but cannot, because the Bill simply does not allow for that and we do not have the legislation in place, it would be a disaster for the Government.<\/p><p pid=\"b156.0\/11\">In that respect, we should consider that the Government do not have a final policy. We have an enabling Bill. Is it right for the Lords to prevent the Commons from even trying to have this policy, which may or may not eventually work? We should remember that, in the most recent votes on this, there was a majority of 70 or 80 in the Commons&#8212;more or less the government majority, without any dissent&#8212;on every single resolution put to it, against us and in favour of their arrangements. I cannot quote the present Attorney-General, but I can quote a recent one, Sir Robert Buckland. He is not necessarily any friend of the Government, as we know, because of the history there. He was the Attorney-General and is now the MP for South Swindon. He said that he worked with Priti Patel on the Bill and that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b156.0\/12\">&#8220;it is in direct fulfilment of our manifesto commitment. There is no doubt in my mind about its importance and about the need for it to be passed.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class=\"offrep\" id=\", Commons, 22\/3\/22; col. 212.]\"><i>Official Report<\/i>, Commons, 22\/3\/22; col. 212.]<\/phrase><\/p><p pid=\"b156.0\/13\">That was the view of a recent Attorney-General, Sir Robert Buckland, who is no one&#8217;s idea of a raving right-wing Tory.<\/p><p pid=\"b156.0\/14\">Finally in all this, I think the Government should try to get as much consensus as possible, because I suspect this will be with us for several years&#8212;perhaps even over more than one Government, as it was in Australia. They should establish a forum for debate, where critics of the Government can talk and explain their worries and concerns. Maybe churchmen should be in it, and maybe the Refugee Council. The noble Lord, Lord Kerr, is a trustee of the Refugee Council, so maybe he should be on this forum. Something like that would be a means of discussion whereby we do not just talk at each other across the Chamber and in the newspapers, but talk seriously about this very important problem, which any Government of whatever description would have to resolve&#8212;namely, these illegal boat trips across the channel.<\/p>",

As I will set out, we are leading efforts to hold China to account for human rights violations and I will set out some of the conversations that have been had.<\/p><p pid=\"b436.1\/2\">We were the first country to lead a joint statement on China&#8217;s human rights record at the UN. Last month, the Foreign Secretary expressed her deep concern, in an address to the UN Human Rights Council, about the violations occurring in Xinjiang and Tibet. We made clear our concerns about mass surveillance in Xinjiang, which my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton discussed, including in a joint statement alongside 42 other countries at the UN in October. We also raise our concerns directly with the Chinese authorities at the highest levels, and I personally raised these issues with the Chinese ambassador to London in December. Meanwhile, we continue to work with our international partners to address the human rights violations taking place across the People&#8217;s Republic of China. We have imposed sanctions on senior Chinese officials and introduced enhanced controls to block exports of technology that might facilitate human rights violations.<\/p><p pid=\"b436.1\/3\">The UK co-founded the Media Freedom Coalition in defence of journalists. The coalition has issued statements about the deteriorating media environments in Egypt, Belarus, Hong Kong, Myanmar and Russia, among others. We have committed &#163;3 million over five years to the UNESCO global media defence fund, which has supported more than 1,700 journalists, including many of those who have received threats online. We also support media freedom through our development aid budget and have spent more than &#163;400 million on that over the past five years. Last December, we joined the Freedom Online Coalition taskforce, which is committed to tackling the growing problem of internet exclusion and shutdowns. We also fund the #KeepltOn campaign,  run by the digital advocacy non-governmental organisation Access Now. The campaign brings together a coalition of more than 240 organisations from 105 countries in a global effort to end internet restrictions and shutdowns.<\/p><p pid=\"b436.1\/4\">We also support projects that use the online world to foster open societies. Through our digital access programme, we are closing the gap for excluded groups, strengthening cyber security and spreading economic opportunities. Our most recent figures show that, in just one year, the programme benefited 2.3 million people in almost 300 communities in Indonesia, Brazil, Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. Within the United Nations, we are working to build a coalition of states committed to promoting digital access, protecting human rights online and countering disinformation. We have co-sponsored UN resolutions to urge member states and social media companies to combat misinformation, antisemitism and all forms of hatred. We are also looking forward to hosting the freedom of religion or belief conference in July, which my hon. Friend mentioned. I thank her again for everything that she is doing to support the conference in her role as the special envoy. The impact of digital technologies on freedom of religion or belief and human rights more broadly will be on the agenda.<\/p><p pid=\"b436.1\/5\">In order to have influence abroad, we must set an example at home. We are committed to turning our Online Safety Bill into law to require tech companies to tackle illegal activity and content on their platforms, including hate crime, harassment and cyber-stalking.<\/p><p pid=\"b436.1\/6\">I am incredibly grateful to my hon. Friend for securing the debate. The online space and new digital technologies represent not only opportunities, but challenges for the protection of human rights. We have heard about some of the terrible abuses and violations perpetrated through digital means.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a109.5\/1\">My right hon. Friend quite rightly highlights that case and makes that name public. I am sure that will have achieved what he wanted. There are other cases, of course: Morad Tahbaz and Mehran Raoof, whom we have heard mentioned, are two other British-Iranians whose arbitrary imprisonment continues despite the recent negotiations. There is also British citizen Jimmy Lai, who is being held in solitary confinement in Hong Kong under the dystopian national security law.<\/p><p pid=\"a109.5\/2\">Today, however, I want primarily to tell the story of my 30-year-old constituent Luke Symons, who has been held without charge or trial by the Houthis in various prisons in Sanaa, Yemen, since 2017. Like many people in Cardiff, Luke has a Yemeni family background, owing to the seafarers who settled around the city&#8217;s thriving docklands in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By 1914, the Yemeni population of Cardiff represented one of the two largest Muslim communities in Britain, and it continues to constitute a proud and vibrant part of the diverse population of Wales&#8217;s capital city.<\/p><p pid=\"a109.5\/3\">In exploring his religious and cultural roots, Luke travelled to Yemen, where he met his future wife, Tagreed, a Yemeni national, in 2014. In 2016, they had a son  together. Shortly after Luke&#8217;s arrival in the country, the civil war started, leading rapidly to the overthrow of the Yemeni Government, and he found himself caught in the middle of a violent conflict that came to involve military intervention by regional powers, including Saudi Arabia. Luke and his wife tried to flee to safety; they tried to come back to the UK via neighbouring countries. They managed to get to Djibouti, but they did not get the support they needed from the UK authorities to be able to travel to Britain; sadly and unfortunately, they had to return to Yemen. Following that, in April 2017, Luke was detained at a Houthi checkpoint in Yemen upon the discovery that he held a British passport.<\/p><p pid=\"a109.5\/4\">In the ensuing five years, despite numerous promises from Houthi and Yemeni officials, talks between regional authorities and UK Foreign Secretaries, and a visit to the prison by the UK special envoy to Yemen, Luke has remained incarcerated. As the Minister will know, in October 2020, it appeared as though Luke might be included in a substantial UN-supervised exchange, which consisted of more than 1,000 prisoners. The Foreign Office says that, following extensive negotiations and logistical planning for Luke&#8217;s release, with arrangements also being made to ensure safe passage for his wife and child, Luke&#8217;s captors inexplicably broke the agreement and severed lines of communication with the UK Government. That was obviously devastating for Luke&#8217;s family, who watched helplessly as other foreign nationals, including some from the United States, were returned home by their Governments from captivity in Yemen.<\/p><p pid=\"a109.5\/5\">Since then, there has been very little outward progress on Luke&#8217;s case. Occasionally, his family have been allowed to communicate with him via telephone. They have become increasingly concerned and distressed by his poor physical health, which has been exacerbated by the notoriously squalid conditions of his captivity and the ongoing covid pandemic. There is also concern about the lack of access to medical attention for Luke. I understand that his wife, Tagreed, was recently informed by Houthi officials that the visits that she had been able to make have been suspended.<\/p><p pid=\"a109.5\/6\">Perhaps most notably of late, Luke&#8217;s grandfather, Bob Cummings, who is also my constituent and, along with other family members, has campaigned consistently and courageously for Luke over the years, has told me of Luke&#8217;s worsening mental health and diminishing spirit. Luke is isolated; he is alone in his cell and is not allowed outside. He is deprived of contact with any other prisoners, and sometimes he is not even aware of the day of the week. The telephone conversations he has had with his family in the UK, which have been few and far between, have been supervised by his captors and cut off after very short periods. I take this opportunity to appeal directly to his captors&#8212;after all, they are ultimately responsible for his incarceration&#8212;to release this innocent young man, who has no part in the ongoing conflict in Yemen, so that he can be reunited with his family and return to the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a109.5\/7\">Other countries have lacked diplomatic presence in Yemen, and that is often cited by the Foreign Office as a significant factor limiting the UK Government&#8217;s influence and options for intervention in this case. I appreciate that it is very difficult to deal with the Houthis and not a traditional Government of any kind, but we must note that other countries whose embassies in Sanaa are closed and vacant, including the United States and  France, have been able to secure the return of multiple citizens in the past couple of years. That prompts the question: if those countries have been able to do that, why has the United Kingdom not been able to secure Luke&#8217;s release?<\/p><p pid=\"a109.5\/8\">I ask the new Minister for the Middle East to make it clear to her officials that securing Luke&#8217;s release during her time in office is a high priority, if not one of her highest priorities. I ask her to commit to taking a fresh look personally at Luke&#8217;s case, mastering the details and doing everything in her power, with all her energy, to try to secure his release. I want her to redouble efforts to open channels of communication once again with the Houthis, by whatever means, and to engage personally with her counterparts in France and the United States to understand their recent successes in securing the release of prisoners by the Houthis.<\/p><p pid=\"a109.5\/9\">As we enter the third week of the two-month-long UN-brokered ceasefire and the associated prisoner exchange negotiations between the Houthi regime and the Saudi-led coalition that have been reported, and during the opportunity that the holy month of Ramadan provides, it is vital that the UK Government exhaust all options and use their international influence, including via the UN and, quite frankly, their much-boasted relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to explore any avenue to achieve Luke&#8217;s release.<\/p><p pid=\"a109.5\/10\">This country&#8217;s close ties with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are often controversial in this House because of that country&#8217;s human rights record. However, when Ministers are pressed on those ties, they are always quick to emphasise that the relationship allows us to influence the Saudi regime. Why, therefore, was Luke&#8217;s case not raised by the Prime Minister during his meeting with Mohammed bin Salman on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-03-16\">16 March<\/phrase>, which, per the Government press release, included discussions relating to concerns about human rights issues?<\/p><p pid=\"a109.5\/11\">Will the Minister undertake to speak with her Saudi counterparts to press them to include Luke&#8217;s name in any prisoner exchange that may take place during the current ceasefire? Recent discussions have not convinced Luke&#8217;s family that our diplomats are doing enough to leverage that relationship with Saudi Arabia, which is much discussed by Ministers, to press Luke&#8217;s plight.<\/p><p pid=\"a109.5\/12\">The Minister will know that she is the fifth Minister to be appointed to the middle east portfolio since Luke&#8217;s arbitrary detention more than five years ago. There have also been four different Foreign Secretaries while Luke has been detained&#8212;the current Prime Minister, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jeremy Hunt\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11859\">the right hon. Member for South West Surrey (Jeremy Hunt)<\/phrase>, the current Deputy Prime Minister, and of course the current Foreign Secretary&#8212;all of whom have expressed support for Luke but none of whom has met his grandfather, despite extending opportunities for meetings to the families of other British nationals in similar positions around the world.<\/p><p pid=\"a109.5\/13\">Luke comes from an ordinary working-class family in Cardiff. They do not have any special connections or friends in the media or anywhere else, but they deserve the same consideration and respect from this Government as anyone else. I ask the Minister to commit to Luke&#8217;s family that she will raise his case with the Foreign Secretary at their next meeting. I ask her to involve herself in this case personally, as she has done with  other cases, and to take full advantage of this latest, time-limited opportunity to reunite Luke with his family. I also ask her to ask the Foreign Secretary to meet Luke&#8217;s family personally, so that she can truly understand their plight.<\/p><p pid=\"a109.5\/14\">This incarceration has gone on too long. I believe that with a prioritised and renewed diplomatic effort, using the current window of opportunity, Luke&#8217;s release could be secured, and he and his family could be reunited. I implore the Minister to act now.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"d1893.0\/1\">My Lords, it is a great pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Dubs. I entirely agree with what he has just said, and I associate myself with the other amendments in this group in speaking to Motion K1. I also refer to relevant all-party parliamentary groups of which I am an officer, and my role as a patron of the Coalition for Genocide Response.<\/p><p pid=\"d1893.0\/2\">The Minister set out the terms of Motion K1 at the beginning of our debate and explained what it does. At Second Reading, she challenged us&#8212;quite rightly&#8212;to come up with safe and legal routes, and that is what this genocide amendment seeks to do. I should say in parentheses that I am grateful to the noble Baroness, not least for the support and consideration that she gave to the amendment that I moved earlier in proceedings on this Bill, on the position of young people in Hong Kong who did not qualify under the BNO scheme but who now, under the regulations which the Government will introduce, will do. Like the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham, I also applaud what the Government have done in the case of refugees from Ukraine. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Stroud, however, I ask the question: should we not make the same provision, as far as the right to work is concerned, for all those who seek asylum in this country?<\/p><p pid=\"d1893.0\/3\">Of course, I am disappointed that the all-party amendment on genocide, which had its origins in the Yazidi genocide that began in 2014, has not been accepted by the Government. I place on record my thanks to those Conservative Members of Parliament, including former Ministers, the Opposition Front Benches and other Members of the House of Commons, for their strong and welcome support. I must admit to sharing some of the frustration that has been expressed during this debate&#8212;even bewilderment&#8212;as we heard from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, and the noble Lords, Lord Cormack and Lord Horam.<\/p><p pid=\"d1893.0\/4\">I spent pretty well two decades as a Member of the other place, and I read with perplexity the debate on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-03-22\">22 March<\/phrase> when the guillotine was imposed after just three hours. That was three hours of debate on amendments that had been considered one by one in your Lordships&#8217; House in great detail and with great scrutiny: Amendments 1, 4 to 9, 52, 53, 10 to 20, 54, 2,  3, 43 to 51, and 21. All these amendments were taken together in an inevitably disjointed debate in which Members ranged across multiple issues. By way of example, in the case of the genocide amendment, it was linked with Amendment 11, on the issue of numbers coming into this country, so it was impossible even to vote with any differentiation between those amendments.<\/p><p pid=\"d1893.0\/5\">As the Minister told us earlier, the Minister in the Commons, Tom Pursglove, opposed the genocide amendment, because, he said, &#8220;many thousands&#8221; would apply for asylum. Confusingly, however, he admitted that the amendment as it left your Lordships&#8217; House contained a cap on the numbers. Then he said that that it would put the lives of our officials in our embassies at risk. These are victims of genocide whom we are talking about. They do not pose a risk: they are hunted down by the perpetrators. It is the victims, not British officials, who are at risk. Mr Pursglove went on to argue that bespoke schemes were a better approach, but there has never been a bespoke scheme for the Yazidis or other victims of the ISIS genocide. This demonstrates that this, too, is a straw man argument.<\/p><p pid=\"d1893.0\/6\">I received an email just two days ago from one of those who works for Yazidi interests, and she told me that she believes that there is bias in the implementation of other programmes because of the exclusion of people from minorities in the leadership and oversight of these programmes. It is an issue I have previously raised, as the Minister knows, with the Home Office. My correspondent copied in the Bishop of Truro, whose excellent report is being reviewed by the Foreign Office this year. This lady said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"d1893.0\/7\">&#8220;We failed Yezidis who have been left to rot in tents; only 8 are recorded as resettled from Iraq and 44 from Syria, although without knowing who they are we cannot say they are truly Yezidi. I doubt the Home Office would know the difference.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"d1893.0\/8\">Quoting Home Office guidance about ethnic and religious minorities, she says:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"d1893.0\/9\">&#8220;Recognising their vulnerability and ACTUALLY including them in these schemes are obviously two different things.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"d1893.0\/10\">For years, the Government have emphasised that Yazidis have been facing horrific atrocities, especially when Ministers have met Nadia Murad and other victims. But opening doors in &#8220;a bespoke scheme&#8221; to welcome at least some from their community simply did not happen. Let us contrast that with Canada and Germany, among others, which have provided protection.<\/p><p pid=\"d1893.0\/11\">One of those who spoke in favour of the amendment in the House of Commons was the former Conservative Minister, Tim Loughton. He and I are two of the seven parliamentarians who have been sanctioned by the Chinese Communist Party for raising what the Foreign Secretary has described as the genocide of the Uighurs. During a very helpful and encouraging meeting which sanctioned parliamentarians recently had with the Prime Minister and Elizabeth Truss, the Foreign Secretary, we were told that the Government would look again at this country&#8217;s response to genocide. I put this on record and greatly welcome what they have said. It is significant progress. Accepting today&#8217;s amendment, which would place on the Home Secretary a duty within one year to publish a report on the Government&#8217;s approach to the treatment of genocides&#8212;at least as it pertains to those seeking asylum&#8212;would be a good start. Failing that, I hope that the Minister will  at least commit the Home Office to taking part, which has been promised by the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister, in looking again at the duties that are laid out in the 1948 convention on the crime of genocide. That requires us to prevent and protect, and to punish those responsible. Given what has been said to me, I am willing to take back this amendment this evening and not take it to a Division. Needless to say, of course, I will keep pressing the Minister until progress is made on what I regard as an incredibly important issue.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a315.0\/1\">Normally, to get up with almost half an hour left in which to summarise a debate would be a sheer joy for a parliamentarian or politician. [Laughter.] However, I will not take the full time on this one.<\/p><p pid=\"a315.0\/2\">I will simply conclude by saying that today is a remarkable day. It may not be a day that people will discuss in the bars and the pubs across the country, because many of them probably do not understand or have not heard much about the issue, but it is something that we, as democrats and politicians, know about. We should be celebrating the fact that the UK Government have acted, as a result of the continual campaigning by many of us in this area&#8212;from Hong Kong Watch to IPAC, and others&#8212;for an end to the superficial legitimacy that our judiciary had been lending to a regime that had been breaking, and is breaking, many of the rules regarding human rights, the rule of law and democracy, not just in Hong Kong but more widely across China.<\/p><p pid=\"a315.0\/3\">In my last few remarks, I want to remind everybody what this matter is all about. It is not really just about judges agreeing not to serve in Hong Kong in a common law system that has become debauched, and it is not just that those judges have taken a self-denying ordinance. It is about something much more important&#8212;shedding light on the single fact that we are seeing, as I said earlier, literally being fought out in Ukraine. For too long, we have felt that we must accommodate totalitarian regimes that have no regard whatever for the basic things that we believe in and that make us who we are:  that sense of human rights, the rule of law and democracy, without which this place could not exist, and this country and so many other countries in the west could not exist in the shape that we do.<\/p><p pid=\"a315.0\/4\">The reality, writ large, is that we now have to end that accommodation with the Chinese Government. Our dependency on them allows and fuels them to continue to believe that their form of government and their concept of the ending of these rights is the right way to go and the natural order. Democracy, the rule of law, the independent judiciary and human rights are delicate flowers; they cannot be maintained unless we fight for them, talk about and believe in them, and unless, when people end them, we ostracise them and tell them they are wrong.<\/p><p pid=\"a315.0\/5\">I thank the Government for moving on this issue,  and the President of the Supreme Court for accepting independently that judges will not serve. Following many comments on the subject, it is important for others who ply their trade in the same courts to think again about what they do. I call on the Bar Council to recommend, as has the President of the Supreme Court, that its members think carefully about adding legitimacy to these courts in Hong Kong. I know it is complicated, but I also call on the Law Society to make a strong statement about the limits of action that lawyers in Hong Kong, representing companies, should take in the pursuit of commercial interests.<\/p><p pid=\"a315.0\/6\">Today is not the end, and, as has been said before, it is not the beginning of the end, but it may just become the end of the beginning. The action that we take today may stave off future violent invasions that could come from a country that believes it has impunity. Today we have sent a signal that freedom matters and that people&#8217;s freedoms, above all else, are critical to the very way we live our lives. On that basis, I thank the Government for having moved on this matter.<\/p><p pid=\"a315.0\/7\">Question put and agreed to.<\/p><p pid=\"a315.0\/8\">Resolved,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a315.0\/9\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">That this House has considered the role of British and overseas judges in Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"a315.0\/10\">Sitting suspended.<\/p>",

Not everyone wants to lose the status of their nationality. For example, my husband does not want to give up his Spanish citizenship, which he may have to do. A number of European countries have started to change but they did not allow dual nationality. A lot of people could lie about that, but he does not want to give it up. I certainly do not want to give up my nationality.<\/p><p pid=\"b1316.1\/2\">When we were in the EU, we were in the comfortable position of being, as we used to describe ourselves, EU citizens; we could locate and meet our families in our respective countries with ease. Now that has changed and we accept that, but I do not quite understand why we do not accept that there is a settled status, where someone has lived in the country for 27 years, paid tax, national insurance and everything else&#8212;they have taken the responsibility of a citizenship&#8212;but for one reason or another do not want to take formal citizenship, and why that should preclude them from having the right to vote.<\/p><p pid=\"b1316.1\/3\">It is crazy that, as I mentioned, an Australian student who comes over for their OE can immediately apply for the right to vote. I would rather the debate focused on what entitles somebody to vote. We have talked about taxation, we have talked about responsibility, and I say that clear levels of residence should establish some basic rights, so that we treat people who live here equally, and when they contribute to the success of our country we should acknowledge that.<\/p><p pid=\"b1316.1\/4\">I come back to what the noble Lord, Lord Green, said. One of the issues his amendment ought to probe and cause us to think about is: what is a British citizen? He says that British nationals (overseas) are not included. We can make commitments suddenly; for example, we made a commitment to Hong Kong citizens who are BNOs because of the breach of an international agreement. I have no doubt that in future, as we have done in the past, we will want to protect our legacy. The noble Lord, Lord Desai, spoke about the legacy of British Empire, which of course we cannot ignore, and things have changed.<\/p><p pid=\"b1316.1\/5\">I welcome the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Green, has tabled this amendment but we need to consider it in the light of all the amendments we have had on the right to vote and what the qualifications are. I do not think we should ignore residency.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1292.0\/1\">My Lords, I offer Green support for the general trend of these amendments. I also join the rest of the House in wishing the noble Lord, Lord True, a quick recovery. I very much agree with the comments from the noble Lord, Lord Scriven, and disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson. If someone is here contributing to society and is a part of this community&#8212;maybe that is only for 20 or 30 years and maybe they will eventually go back to the country they came from, to care for their elderly parents or another reason&#8212;they should have a say. They have chosen to make this their home and we should recognise that with the vote.<\/p><p pid=\"b1292.0\/2\">It is really interesting if we look at the overall context of the Bill&#8212;and I very much agree with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, about the general sense of confusion and the lack of a real sense of clear direction&#8212;that where there is a sense of direction, it is utterly the wrong direction. As we were talking about with voter ID and offering a positive alternative of automatic voter registration, we have seen a trend over centuries for more and more people to have the right to vote. Yet, what we have done right now with the Brexit situation and with the rules as they currently are with the Bill without these amendments is that fewer and fewer people are having the right to have a say. That is a diminution of what democracy we actually have.<\/p><p pid=\"b1292.0\/3\">I very much agree with the comment from the noble Viscount, Lord Stansgate, that if you are able to vote, you should be able to stand. There is a really interesting case study related to that of the kind of tangles that electoral law can get itself into. Between 1918 and 1928, there were certain groups of women who could stand but not vote. The Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918&#8212;with 27 words, it is the shortest law on the statute book&#8212;created a rather strange tangle where women were able to stand, and indeed some women did stand, when they could not vote for themselves. That really is an illustration of how you can get yourself into a mess when things are not properly thought through.<\/p><p pid=\"b1292.0\/4\">I have some very specific questions. I am aware that the Minister has kind of been landed with this, so I entirely understand if he might wish to write to me  later. One of the things that perhaps many of us in your Lordships&#8217; House do not think about very much is that there is another reason to be on the electoral roll beyond voting: being on the electoral roll is good for your credit rating and improves your access to credit. I will confess, it is something I have used many times on the doorstep to encourage people to go on the electoral roll. One of the things we will do with this current change is to make access to credit more difficult for some people, such as EU citizens who do not qualify for the vote. As we are seeing with all these complications, I wonder whether the Government have really looked at this situation and considered whether it is appropriate to allow that to continue when we are randomly taking that right away from people.<\/p><p pid=\"b1292.0\/5\">We have already heard very clearly laid out from a range of noble Lords, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, and the noble Baroness, Lady Ritchie, all the complicating factors about whether you are allowed to be on the electoral roll or not. Are the Government confident that they have given full and clear instructions to all the local authorities in the land to ensure that they are able to implement this effectively? Are people on the roll rightly when they should be? With local elections coming up, I am sure all of us, except perhaps the Cross-Benchers, know people who are out now knocking on doors and talking to voters and potential voters. Is there a place where the Government have set this all out very clearly so political campaigners out encouraging people to get involved can find out who is eligible to vote and who is not? That would be a very useful practical resource to have.<\/p><p pid=\"b1292.0\/6\">This is something that has just occurred to me as we have been going through the debate: I imagine that to vote when you do not have the right to vote is an offence. Are the Government going to provide directions to acknowledge that some people, with the best will in the world and no ill intention, will end up voting in this coming and future elections when they do not have the right? I think people in that situation should be protected, given the complexities that we have all just heard outlined.<\/p><p pid=\"b1292.0\/7\">I will briefly make two other specific points. On an earlier group, the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, I think, noted how Scotland has given refugees the right to vote. Given the situation that we see in a world with more and more refugees, and as we will, I hope, welcome more refugees here, I wonder whether the Government have considered that.<\/p><p pid=\"b1292.0\/8\">I declare my position as co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hong Kong. Of course, BNO passport holders have the right to vote, but their children will not&#8212;so it could literally be that someone who was born in Hong Kong on a certain day has the right to vote, but a person born there one day later does not. So have the Government considered the situation of the children of BNO passport holders who have come here with their parents now? The Government have said that they are looking to allow, from September, the children of BNO passport holders to come on their own&#8212;so might that not be another group to consider?<\/p><p pid=\"b1292.0\/9\">Since I have just introduced several other layers of complexity, is not the obvious situation to base this right to vote on residence? If people have made themselves part of the community and contributed to it, that should be the basis of the right to vote.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a832.0\/1\">My Lords, I regret that we heard the Home Secretary and now the Minister accept the principle of the Opposition&#8217;s fast-track public space protection orders in relation to Motion H and use that to justify broader anti-protest amendments as a balance in protecting non-protesters. I regret it but I am not surprised. The danger of advocating any measures that strengthen anti-protest measures is that it sets a tone that suggests that some protesters are good and some are bad, which politicises a general and universal right that I think we should defend. Putting that to one side, I want to oppose the Government&#8217;s doubling-down on a noise trigger and follow on particularly from the remarks made by the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, and others who have expressed their opposition so well.<\/p><p pid=\"a832.0\/2\">I want to nod to the democratic dilemma of this ping-pong and whether we are actually blocking democracy. When summing up the rejection of the second tranche of anti-protest amendments on Report, the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, chided all of us who opposed them for ignoring the public&#8217;s demand that authorities deal with new forms of protest activities such as those we have seen used by Extinction Rebellion and its offspring, such as Insulate Britain.<\/p><p pid=\"a832.0\/3\">I disagreed that those amendments would have dealt with those new forms of protest. I thought they were so broad as to sweep up all and any protests, including anyone who might have wanted to protest against net zero, to take an example of a different political side. The state also already has huge powers, whether the Emergency Workers (Obstruction) Act or the Public Order Act, as we have heard, that could have been used to deal with these forms of protest which are a particular nuisance, as the public would have it. Despite that, I felt the Government were at least responding to a particular form of protest about which there has been some public agitation and concern. Therefore, that chiding was listened to.<\/p><p pid=\"a832.0\/4\">But now, here we are with government amendments on protest that bear absolutely no relation to the Home Office&#8217;s motivation on new forms of protest. I do not think the Government have a democratic mandate for these amendments. Fundamental and foundational democratic rights, such as the right to assemble or protest or the right to free speech, should be protected by an iron curtain. If there is any attempt to undermine them, the presumption must rest with the Government to justify in absolutely clear terms, with a sense of the absolutely exceptional reasons for the proposed changes, any more draconian measures being brought in.<\/p><p pid=\"a832.0\/5\">It just does not add up. As I have noticed before, even these new types of protest that apparently upset the public are often silent, so the noise trigger does not apply to them in any way whatever. The authorities should consider proposing accruing further power  when limiting the right to assembly, and ultimately the right to free speech, only ever in exceptional circumstances. In this instance, those exceptional circumstances are just not there.<\/p><p pid=\"a832.0\/6\">Even more galling is the smoke and mirrors of posing these proposals as protecting the public from the consequences of protest. The public are described as &#8220;non-protesters&#8221;; as I think the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, pointed out, this turns the public into two different groups of people, but actually the public are the people who go on protests. They might not go on all of them all the time, but it is their right as the public that we are talking about. There is an Alice in Wonderland approach here that gets the issues upside-down and implies that the Government are far removed from the reality that free protests have been crucial for the public over centuries. The denial of that right, whether in Putin&#8217;s Russia or China&#8217;s Hong Kong, should be a visceral reminder to us here of why protest &#8212;warts and all&#8212;matters.<\/p><p pid=\"a832.0\/7\">Of course not all protests are popular. Many of the modern protests I have mentioned, such as those by Extinction Rebellion, I do not support and they irritate me but, as with all fundamental democratic rights&#8212;free speech, free association and so on&#8212;it does not matter whether they are annoying, unpleasant or objectionable, or even if those demonstrations are directed in a hostile way against what you believe to be true.<\/p><p pid=\"a832.0\/8\">We cannot pick and choose which speech or which protest we agree with and then endorse only the ones that we like. We have to make sure that we do not let those kinds of political prejudices get in the way. We are bound to feel uncomfortable at times when people protest for things that we disagree with, but that is freedom for you. It has never been claimed that living in a free society is safe and cosy. It is designed to make you, on occasion, feel uncomfortable. But there are principles here. As the Court of Appeal notes:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a832.0\/9\">&#8220;The right to protest becomes effectively worthless if the protesters&#8217; choice of &#8216;when and where&#8217; to protest is not respected as far as possible&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"a832.0\/10\">and I stand by that.<\/p><p pid=\"a832.0\/11\">Finally, we should, if anything, be doing something in this House to facilitate civil society having the freedom to stand up to power. We should not only encourage the public to have their right to be heard protected loudly but encourage voters to actively engage in extra-parliamentary activity and to shout as loudly as possible about what concerns them, because that way we will get to actually hear some of that public debate. It is also a safety valve for democracy. If, on occasion, that causes inconvenience or annoyance or is too loud, we will survive, and democracy will be better for it.<\/p><p pid=\"a832.0\/12\">I will finish with a quote from a participant from the Citizens&#8217; Assembly on Democracy, because it sums up what is at stake: &#8220;When civil society or minority groups or opinions are ignored by politicians, it is the British way to assemble or march with an exuberant voice, carrying placards and symbols of protest. Peaceful protest sheds light on the mood of the nation and informs the elected representatives&#8221;&#8212;and, dare I say, the unelected representatives&#8212;&#8220;of the strength of opinion residing outside their bubble or chosen focus group.&#8221; I say &#8220;hear, hear&#8221; to that, and gladly.<\/p>",

All the Lords amendments would just add to the pull factors. For instance, one amendment says that people should be allowed to work after six months. That is an extraordinarily attractive pull factor. I am afraid that the Government have to hold the line.

            "body": "<p class=\"italic\" pid=\"a356.0\/1\">The following Statement was made in the House of Commons on Monday 14 March.<\/p><p pid=\"a356.1\/1\">&#8220;With permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a Statement on our Government&#8217;s response to help those fleeing the conflict in Ukraine.<\/p><p pid=\"a356.1\/2\">This Government and this House&#8212;indeed, everyone in the UK&#8212;continue to be in awe of the bravery of the people of Ukraine. They are victims of savage, indiscriminate, unprovoked aggression. Their courage under fire and determination to resist inspire our total admiration.<\/p><p pid=\"a356.1\/3\">The United Kingdom stands with the Ukrainian people. My right honourable friend the Defence Secretary has been in the vanguard of those providing military assistance. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary has been co-ordinating diplomatic support and, with my right honourable friends the Chancellor and the Business Secretary, implementing a new and tougher  than ever sanctions regime. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the Home Office have also been providing humanitarian support on the ground to Ukraine&#8217;s neighbours, helping them to cope with the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people&#8212;but more can, and must, be done.<\/p><p pid=\"a356.1\/4\">To that end, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary has already expanded the family route. She has also confirmed that from tomorrow Ukrainians with passports will be able to apply for UK visas entirely online without having to visit a visa application centre. As a result, the number of Ukrainians now arriving in this country is rapidly increasing and numbers will grow even faster from tomorrow.<\/p><p pid=\"a356.1\/5\">We also know, however, that the unfailingly compassionate British public want to help further. That is why today we are answering that call with the announcement of a new sponsorship scheme, Homes for Ukraine. I thank my right honourable friend the Home Secretary and officials in the Home Office, in my own department and across government for their work over the past days and weeks to ensure that we can stand up this scheme as quickly as possible. In particular, I thank my noble friend Richard Harrington, now Lord Harrington of Watford, whose experience in ensuring that the Syrian refugee resettlement programme was a success will prove invaluable in ensuring that we do right by the people of Ukraine.<\/p><p pid=\"a356.1\/6\">The scheme that Lord Harrington has helped us to design draws on the enormous good will and generosity of the British public, and our proud history of supporting the vulnerable in their hour of greatest need. The scheme will allow Ukrainians with no family ties to the UK to be sponsored by individuals or organisations who can offer them a home. There will be no limit to the number of Ukrainians who can benefit from it.<\/p><p pid=\"a356.1\/7\">The scheme will be open to all Ukrainian nationals and residents, and they will be able to live and work in the United Kingdom for up to three years. They will have full and unrestricted access to benefits, healthcare, employment and other support. Sponsors in the UK can be of any nationality, with any immigration status, provided they have at least six months&#8217; leave to remain within the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a356.1\/8\">Sponsors will have to provide accommodation for a minimum of six months. In recognition of their generosity, the Government will provide a monthly payment of &#163;350 to sponsors for each family whom they look after. These payments will be tax-free. They will not affect benefit entitlement or council tax status. Ukrainians arriving in the United Kingdom will have access to the full range of public services&#8212;doctors, schools, and full local authority support. Of course, we want to minimise bureaucracy and make the process as straightforward as possible, while doing everything we can to ensure the safety of all involved. Sponsors will therefore be required to undergo necessary vetting checks, and we are also streamlining processes to security-assess the status of Ukrainians who will be arriving in the United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"a356.1\/9\">From today, anyone who wishes to record their interest in sponsorship can do so on GOV.UK; the webpage has gone live as I speak. We will then send any individual who registers further information setting  out the next steps in this process. We will outline what is required of a sponsor and set out how sponsors can identify a named Ukrainian individual or family who can then take up each sponsorship offer. Because we want the scheme to be up and running as soon as possible, Homes for Ukraine will initially facilitate sponsorship between people with known connections, but we will rapidly expand the scheme in a phased way, with charities, churches and community groups, to ensure that many more prospective sponsors can be matched with Ukrainians who need help. We are of course also working closely with the devolved Administrations to make sure that their kind offers of help are mobilised. I know that all concerned want to play their part in supporting Ukrainians, who have been through so much, to ensure that they feel at home in the United Kingdom, and I am committed to working with everyone of good will to achieve this.<\/p><p pid=\"a356.1\/10\">Our country has a long and proud history of supporting the most vulnerable during their darkest hour. We took in refugees fleeing Hitler&#8217;s Germany, those fleeing repression in Idi Amin&#8217;s Uganda, and those who fled the atrocities of the Balkan wars. More recently, we have offered support to those fleeing persecution in Syria, Afghanistan and Hong Kong. We are doing so again with Homes for Ukraine. We are a proud democracy. All of us in this House wish to see us defend and uphold our values, stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies, and offer a safe haven to people who have been forced to flee war and persecution. The British people have already opened their hearts in so many ways. I am hopeful that many will also be ready to open their homes and help those fleeing persecution to find peace, healing and the prospect of a brighter future. That is why I commend this Statement to the House.&#8221;<\/p>",

The aviation industry is a critical part of the UK economy, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs, and we all want to see a safe return to international travel, which is why, earlier this year, Labour outlined our comprehensive plan to live well with covid and to protect lives and livelihoods.<\/p><p pid=\"c787.0\/2\">We know that the virus will continue to change and adapt and we will need to live with it as it does, and that is critical when it comes to the travel industry. Another variant of concern may emerge, as the Secretary of State has acknowledged, and lessons must be learned from previous Government responses that damaged the industry. He partially outlined some contingency measures, but he had previously committed to publishing a full contingency strategy to deal with possible future variants. With surging cases in international hubs such as Hong Kong and Shanghai, does he agree that he should be fully transparent about his plans, and that that would boost confidence for the travelling public and the airline industry? Can we get a commitment to the publication of that strategy today?<\/p><p pid=\"c787.0\/3\">Today&#8217;s announcement, which ends restrictions for the unvaccinated, is a reminder of another stark truth: in an era of global international travel, no one is safe until everyone is safe. We in the UK have learned that lesson the hard way. The Secretary of State has confirmed that we will be sending 100 million doses to low-income countries by the summer. Will he explain how 77 million doses will be delivered in just three months, when 23 million have been delivered over the past nine? If we are to break the cycle of new variants, there is only one way to do it: to vaccinate the world.<\/p><p pid=\"c787.0\/4\">The elephant in the room today for the Transport Secretary is the cost of living crisis about to engulf this country. The barrier to passengers booking holidays with confidence this spring and summer is not a passenger locator form; it is the historic collapse in living standards facing millions, and the Conservatives&#8217; refusal to do anything about it. The barrier will be the record rise in energy bills in two weeks&#8217; time, the brutal national insurance hike that his Government are imposing on working people, and the record prices of petrol that are swallowing up the incomes of millions of British people as we speak.<\/p><p pid=\"c787.0\/5\">This country is facing the largest decline in living standards since the 1950s, putting a holiday beyond the reach of many, and the Transport Secretary has literally nothing to say. Indeed, the only step he has taken is to hike up rail fares by the largest amount in a decade. Today&#8217;s announcement eases the remaining travel restrictions, but let us be clear: the barriers to holidays this summer are the tax rises his Government are imposing on hard-working families, the surging petrol prices, and the cost of living crisis made in Downing Street. Either he is oblivious to this crisis, or he is completely indifferent. Either way, is it not time this Government woke up?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>Thank you, Presiding Officer.<\/p><p>Before I turn to Covid, and with your permission, I would like to give a brief update on our efforts to welcome refugees from Ukraine.<\/p><p>The response of the public across the United Kingdom in offering support has been truly outstanding, and I thank everyone who has volunteered. Under the UK scheme&#8212;with the exception of cases in which people already know someone who is seeking refuge&#8212;it may be some time before most of those who are offering help will be able to welcome someone from Ukraine. The Scottish Government&#8217;s super-sponsor proposal is intended to short-circuit that and allow Ukrainians to get here and be safeguarded and supported more quickly.<\/p><p>I am pleased to advise that the UK Government has now indicated support for the proposal in principle and has committed to working with us towards its immediate launch, alongside the wider UK scheme. That is a positive development. I hope that&#8212;assuming that we can agree details&#8212;as a start, it will allow us to welcome 3,000 Ukrainians to Scotland very soon. I will update Parliament more fully on these matters tomorrow.<\/p><p>Let me turn to Covid. I will confirm Cabinet&#8217;s decisions on lifting the limited measures that remain in law, and I will set out our intentions for the testing programme. First, though, I will give a brief overview of the state of the pandemic. Public Health Scotland has had server problems over the past 24 hours, so no daily figures were published yesterday&#8212;and, of course, figures are no longer published at weekends. The case number that is being reported today&#8212;38,770&#8212;is therefore the cumulative total for the past four days. For context, the total for the equivalent four-day period last week was 36,051.<\/p><p>The figures reflect the recent increase in cases. The Office for National Statistics survey suggests that, in the week to 6 March, one in 18 people in Scotland had Covid. Three weeks ago, an average of 6,900 new cases a day were being reported; the average now is just over 12,000 a day. There has also been a rise in the number of people who are in hospital with Covid. Three weeks ago, that stood at 1,060; today it is 1,996. The increase in cases over the past three weeks has been driven by the BA.2 sub-lineage of the omicron variant, which is estimated to be significantly more transmissible, with a growth rate since mid-February that is perhaps 80 per cent greater than that of the original omicron.<\/p><p>BA.2 is now the dominant strain in Scotland, accounting for more than 80 per cent of all reported cases. It has become dominant in Scotland earlier than in England and Wales, hence the more rapid increase in cases here than south of the border in recent weeks, although the numbers of cases and hospital admissions are now rising sharply again in England, too. Encouragingly, there is no evidence that BA.2 causes more severe illness than BA.1 or that it is more effective at evading natural or vaccine immunity. Indeed, immune protection means that the recent rise in cases and hospital admissions has not translated into a commensurate increase in cases of severe illness requiring intensive care. In other words, even though the weight of numbers of infections is putting significant pressure on hospital capacity&#8212;which is a real concern&#8212;we continue to observe strong evidence that the link between infection and serious health harm has weakened considerably.<\/p><p>It is likely that that is due to immune protection&#8212;not least from vaccines&#8212;more than it is due to omicron being inherently milder. That is borne out by current experience in Hong Kong, where relatively low rates of vaccination, particularly in the older population, mean that omicron is causing very significant levels of severe illness and death. That underlines the continued vital importance of vaccination. If you have not yet had doses that you are eligible for, please get them now.<\/p><p>Extension of the programme is on-going, in line with Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation advice. Letters inviting five to 11-year-olds who are not in higher-risk groups to be vaccinated started arriving at the end of last week, and the first vaccinations are scheduled for Saturday. Additional booster jags for older adults in care homes started last week, and appointments will start next week for everyone aged 75 and over. Additional boosters for those who are immunosuppressed will start from mid-April. I know that people who are immunosuppressed and, indeed, others on the highest-risk list are concerned about high case rates at a time when regulations are being eased. It is important to stress, therefore, that significant protection is provided by vaccination.<\/p><p>The higher transmissibility of omicron poses challenges, but protection from vaccines and the increasing availability of effective Covid treatments are important factors. Using the approach that is set out in our revised strategic framework, and on the basis of clinical advice, our assessment is that the virus continues to present a medium threat. However, we remain optimistic that it will move from medium to low over the spring. As a result, we consider that the overall transition signalled in the strategic framework remains appropriate. We should&#8212;and will&#8212;continue the transition away from legal requirements to advice and guidance instead. Therefore, I can confirm, first, that from Friday, and in line with other UK nations, all remaining Covid-related travel restrictions will be lifted. Although we have some concerns about that, UK travel patterns mean that diverging from the rest of the UK would cause economic disadvantage without delivering any meaningful public health benefit. We do, of course, retain the ability to reintroduce travel measures if, for example, a new variant emerges.<\/p><p>Secondly, from next Monday, 21 March, the remaining domestic legal measures&#8212;with one temporary, precautionary exception&#8212;will be lifted and replaced with appropriate guidance. That means that, on Monday, the requirement for businesses and service providers to retain customer contact details will end. So, too, will the requirement for businesses, places of worship and service providers to have regard to Scottish Government guidance on Covid. They will, instead, be expected to take reasonably practicable measures set out in the guidance.<\/p><p>The exception relates to the requirement to wear face coverings on public transport and in certain indoor settings. Given the current spike in case numbers, we consider it prudent to retain that requirement in regulation for a further short period. I know that that will be disappointing for businesses and service providers such as day-care services, but ensuring the maximum continued use of face coverings will provide some additional protection&#8212;particularly for the most vulnerable&#8212;at a time when the risk of infection is very high, and it may help us to get over this spike more quickly. We will review the regulation again in two weeks, before the Easter recess, and our expectation now is that that regulation will convert to guidance in early April.<\/p><p>The other issue that I want to cover today is testing. Regrettably, our freedom of manoeuvre here is severely limited by the fact that our funding is determined by UK Government decisions that are taken for England. However, we have sought, as far as we can, to reach the right decisions for Scotland. It is important to note that we are aiming for the same long-term position as England on testing. However, we consider that the transition should be longer. In England, testing for people without symptoms ended in mid-February and will do so at the end of this month for those with symptoms.<\/p><p>We intend the transition to last until the end of April. That is as far as we can go within funding constraints, but it allows us to take account of current case numbers and to better support the shift in our overall management of the virus. A paper that sets out the detail has been published on the Scottish Government&#8217;s website. In summary, for the next month&#8212;until Easter&#8212;there will be no change to our testing advice. If you do not have symptoms, you should continue, for now, to use a lateral flow test twice weekly, daily for seven days if you are a close contact of a positive case, and before visiting someone who is vulnerable. If you have symptoms, you should continue to get a polymerase chain reaction test, either at a testing site or by post.<\/p><p>Following the Easter weekend, from 18 April, we will no longer advise people without symptoms to test twice weekly. With the exception of health and care settings, the advice to test regularly will end from 18 April for workplaces, early learning and childcare settings, mainstream and special schools, and universities and colleges. However, until the end of April, we will continue to advise the use of LFTs daily for seven days for people who are a close contact and on each occasion when visiting a hospital or care home, and we will continue to advise people with symptoms to get a PCR test.<\/p><p>Contact tracing of positive cases will continue until the end of April. PCR test sites will remain open during this period, although opening hours and locations might change during the transition. Although, as with all measures, we will keep this under review, our intention is that, from the end of April, all routine population-wide testing will end, including for people who have symptoms. Contact tracing will end at that point, too, although people with symptoms of respiratory illness will be advised to stay at home.<\/p><p>Physical test sites will close at the end of April, although mobile testing units and lab capacity will be retained for our longer-term testing purposes. During the transition, we will do everything that we can to support the people who have worked on the testing programme. I thank all of them for their invaluable contribution over the past two years.<\/p><p>From 1 May, in place of a population-wide approach, we will use testing on a targeted basis to support clinical care and treatment and to protect higher-risk settings and for surveillance, outbreak management and responding to significant developments such as a new variant. I stress that, for any purpose for which we continue to advise testing, access to tests will remain free of charge in Scotland.<\/p><p>Today marks steady progress back to normal life and a more sustainable way of managing the virus. However, while cases are spiking, there is still considerable pressure on the national health service and concern among the most vulnerable, in particular. Therefore, I ask everyone to be patient for a little while longer on face coverings and to continue to follow all advice on hygiene, ventilation, testing and, of course, vaccination.<\/p><p>I take the opportunity to again thank everyone for their continued efforts.<\/p>",

They are victims of savage, indiscriminate, unprovoked aggression. Their courage under fire and determination to resist inspires our total admiration.<\/p><p pid=\"b619.1\/3\">The United Kingdom stands with the Ukrainian people. My right hon. Friend the Defence Secretary has been in the vanguard of those providing military assistance. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has been co-ordinating diplomatic support and, with my right hon. Friends the Chancellor and Business Secretary, implementing a new and tougher than ever sanctions regime. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the Home Office have also been providing humanitarian support on the ground to Ukraine&#8217;s neighbours, helping them to cope with the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people&#8212;but more can, and must, be done.<\/p><p pid=\"b619.1\/4\">To that end, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has already expanded the family route. She has also confirmed that from tomorrow Ukrainians with passports will be able to apply for UK visas entirely online without having to visit visa application centres. As a result, the number of Ukrainians now arriving in this country is rapidly increasing and numbers will grow even faster from tomorrow.<\/p><p pid=\"b619.1\/5\">We also know, however, that the unfailingly compassionate British public want to help further. That is why today we are answering that call with the announcement of a new sponsorship scheme, Homes for Ukraine. I thank my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and officials in the Home Office, in my own Department and across Government for their work over the course of the past days and weeks to ensure that we can stand up this scheme as quickly as possible. In particular, I thank my noble Friend Richard Harrington, now Lord Harrington of Watford, whose experience in ensuring that the Syrian refugee resettlement programme was a success will prove invaluable in ensuring that we do right by the people of Ukraine.<\/p><p pid=\"b619.1\/6\">The scheme that Lord Harrington has helped us to design draws on the enormous good will and generosity of the British public, and our proud history of supporting the vulnerable in their hour of greatest need. The scheme will allow Ukrainians with no family ties to the UK to be sponsored by individuals or organisations who can offer them a home. There will be no limit to the number of Ukrainians who can benefit from it.<\/p><p pid=\"b619.1\/7\">The scheme will be open to all Ukrainian nationals and residents, and they will be able to live and work in the United Kingdom for up to three years.[Official Report, <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-03-15\">15 March<\/phrase> 2022, Vol. 710, c. 9MC.] They will have full and unrestricted access to benefits, healthcare, employment and other support. Sponsors in the UK can be of any nationality, with any immigration status, provided they have at least six months&#8217; leave to remain within the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"b619.1\/8\">Sponsors will have to provide accommodation for a minimum of six months. In recognition of their generosity, the Government will provide a monthly payment of &#163;350 to sponsors for each family whom they look after. These payments will be tax-free. They will not affect benefit entitlement or council tax status. Ukrainians arriving in the United Kingdom will have access to the full range of public services&#8212;doctors, schools, and full local authority support. Of course we want to minimise bureaucracy and make the process as straightforward as possible while doing everything we can to ensure the safety of all involved. Sponsors will therefore be required to undergo necessary vetting checks, and we are also streamlining processes to security-assess the status of Ukrainians who will be arriving in the United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"b619.1\/9\">From today, anyone who wishes to record their interest in sponsorship can do so on gov.uk; the webpage has gone live as I speak. We will then send any individual who registers further information setting out the next steps in this process. We will outline what is required of a sponsor and set out how sponsors can identify a named Ukrainian individual or family who can then take up each sponsorship offer. Because we want the scheme to be up and running as soon as possible, Homes for Ukraine will initially facilitate sponsorship between people with known connections, but we will rapidly expand the scheme in a phased way, with charities, churches and community groups, to ensure that many more prospective sponsors can be matched with Ukrainians who need help. We are of course also working closely with the devolved Administrations to make sure that their kind offers of help are mobilised. I know that all concerned want to play their part in supporting Ukrainians, who have been through so much, to ensure that they feel at home in the United Kingdom, and I am committed to working with everyone of good will to achieve this.<\/p><p pid=\"b619.1\/10\">Our country has a long and proud history of supporting the most vulnerable during their darkest hour. We took in refugees fleeing Hitler&#8217;s Germany, those fleeing repression in Idi Amin&#8217;s Uganda, and those who fled the atrocities of the Balkan wars. More recently, we have offered support to those fleeing persecution in Syria, Afghanistan and Hong Kong. We are doing so again with Homes for Ukraine. We are a proud democracy. All of us in this House wish to see us defend and uphold our values, stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies, and offer a safe haven to people who have been forced to flee war and persecution. The British people have already opened their hearts in so many ways. I am hopeful that many will also be ready to open their homes and help those fleeing persecution to find peace, healing and the prospect of a brighter future. That is why I commend this statement to the House.<\/p>",

She has heard a lot of complaints about the things that Members of your Lordships&#8217; House disagree with, and I associate myself with some of those complaints, but this Bill has been something of an endurance test. At a quarter to one in the morning last week, as we debated citizenship fees, I thought that maybe this was not the way to conduct parliamentary business. However, I was particularly pleased that, during the course of our proceedings, the noble Baroness was specifically recognised and raised to the Privy Council; it was a just reward for the way in which she serves your Lordships&#8217; House.<\/p><p pid=\"a29.0\/2\">I notice that the noble Lord, Lord Patten of Barnes, has been listening in the Chamber this afternoon. He spoke in our debate last week about the position of young Hong Kongers. Along with the noble Lord, Lord Sharpe, the noble Baroness was incredibly helpful in incorporating into this Bill something that will really benefit young people in Hong Kong who, born after 1997, were not part of the BNO scheme that their parents had been part of. I have already seen emails from people in Hong Kong expressing their thanks to your Lordships&#8217; House.<\/p><p pid=\"a29.0\/3\">Finally, I extend my thanks to Members from all sides who supported my amendment on providing safe and secure routes out of genocide in various parts of the world.

            "body": "<p pid=\"c1554.7\/1\">I thank noble Lords and join in the general confusion about where we are up to. I speak in favour of the two amendments in this group tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher. They seem to be a ranging shot on one of the most important issues embedded in this Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"c1554.7\/2\">I hope that noble Lords will excuse me if I take this opportunity to explore what the amendments do and why it is so important that they and other matters relating to Clauses 14 and 15 are given serious consideration. These provisions are at the heart of the matter which I want to speak about. The question is really: is the United Kingdom to retain, as one of its trusted institutions and symbols of democratic legitimacy, the Electoral Commission, or is it to join an increasingly long list of countries that have, step by step and little by little, eroded their democratic base, undermined trust in their electoral processes and cast doubt on the legitimacy of their elected representatives?<\/p><p pid=\"c1554.7\/3\">The Electoral Commission was set up as a direct result of recommendations by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, on which I serve. The committee is chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Evans of Weardale, and its first chairman was Lord Nolan. People refer frequently to the Nolan principles but those are in the guardianship of the Committee on Standards in Public Life; so, we believe, is the Electoral Commission. It is a body which emerged from recommendations presented to the Prime Minister by the CSPL. It has since been overhauled and reviewed by the CSPL and there have been changes made in legislation, again based on recommendations made directly by the CSPL. In a report last year, the Committee made further recommendations to the Prime Minister about changes that needed to be made in response to the inquiry and the evidence that it took. All those recommendations were designed to make the Electoral Commission a more effective body, with clear and specific recommendations on how that should be done in each case.<\/p><p pid=\"c1554.7\/4\">The Electoral Commission was set up on the advice of the CSPL. It was updated on advice from the CSPL, and the Government have before them clear recommendations from the CSPL on how it could be improved further. Our report strongly emphasised what every piece of evidence showed: that to maintain trust in the electoral integrity of our democratic processes, it was essential that the Electoral Commission retains its independence from political interference&#8212;interference from any political party or faction, but particularly from the party in power at any one time. Unfortunately, Clauses 14 and 15 take our country in the wrong direction. The two amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, try hard to pull it back from the brink, so yes, they have our support.<\/p><p pid=\"c1554.7\/5\">At Second Reading, I asked whether the Minister would be ready to hand over to a future radical-left Government the powers that the Bill, in its present form, would give them. He is far too skilled an operator to answer that question, but it is very hard to believe that he would. It could start off with something as innocuous as a requirement for the Electoral Commission to have regard to the Government&#8217;s manifesto policies; levelling up, for instance, or maybe levelling down, as will surely be achieved as a completely accidental by-product of other provisions in the Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"c1554.7\/6\">In many areas, but particularly Clauses 14 and 15, the Bill seems to have been drawn up by people who have never been in opposition, which is startling because the Minister has plenty of experience of that, having lived as an oppressed political minority in the Liberal Democrat-run London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. The Minister may protest that there is to be a comprehensive consultation with various bodies before any strategy statements come into force. Of course, the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, very much bear on the question of the terms and conditions on which such a strategy report might be made.<\/p><p pid=\"c1554.7\/7\">The Minister might refer me to the elaborate wording of proposed new Section 4C, which is in Clause 14. But when I pointed out to him at Second Reading, as many noble Lords did, that practically every outside body that had expressed an opinion on these changes had strongly advised against them, and that the CSPL itself, which created the commission, had said that our electoral processes must be overseen by an independent regulator protected from political pressures and separate from the Government, and that it must demonstrate its impartiality and effectiveness at all times, the Minister&#8217;s reply was that the Government take a different view.<\/p><p pid=\"c1554.7\/8\">Noble Lords should bear in mind that five bodies must be consulted, according to proposed new Section 4C, before any such strategy document moves forward. It would be interesting to know what they will do when they get their first strategy statement. Actually, we do not have to wonder, as they have already commented on the proposals in front of them. Two opted out in disgust, which is why the Scottish and Welsh amendments flow in the next group. The Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee has strenuously protested and recommended that the Government take these provisions out of the Bill. That is three of them. The Speaker&#8217;s Committee is packed with Cabinet  Ministers, which is an offence when it is the budget holder for the Electoral Commission&#8212;a matter we shall talk about later. It is also worthy of note that all but one of the Electoral Commissioners jointly wrote an open letter of protest, pointing out that this fundamentally undermines their legitimacy and our democratic system. Therefore, of the five consultees in proposed new Section 4C, four have expressed vigorous dissent with the proposal and one is packed with Cabinet Ministers.<\/p><p pid=\"c1554.7\/9\">Interestingly, neither the CSPL or any local government institution was consulted: the one which created the electoral commission, and the people who will receive the benefit of its administration above anybody else. What we learn from this is that a fig leaf of consultation, even when we have a benign regime such as this, is not a safeguard. Under a less benign regime, as seen from the Minister&#8217;s viewpoint, that fig leaf could be gone in the space of a short consultation. I repeat my question: is the Minister completely at ease with the provisions in these two clauses? I and my noble friends are certainly not.<\/p><p pid=\"c1554.7\/10\">A look at the international stage may help noble Lords to understand our deep unease more clearly and explain why we are so strongly in favour of the Minister giving a fair wind, at the very minimum, to the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher.<\/p><p pid=\"c1554.7\/11\">Any power-hungry regime anywhere in the world, on coming to power and wishing to keep it, looks around to take steps to make that happen without having to take too much account of the vagaries of public opinion, if necessary. Some well-understood steps to take are set out in the autocrat&#8217;s playbook. High on the list is undermining the independence of the election regulator. Following that, guidance can be produced that facilitates the selection or deselection of candidates, the application of rules and the prosecution of offences&#8212;I will not give away any more trade secrets. But noble Lords can see where that goes by looking at Russia today. Mr Putin&#8217;s most dangerous opponent in the last presidential election managed to overcome the requirement to get a million signatures on his nomination form, obviously placed there by the election regulator, but it was deemed that there were a few duds in his list of nominees, and, although he had a million valid ones, he was disqualified for submitting fraudulent names&#8212;strictly according to the rules, of course.<\/p><p pid=\"c1554.7\/12\">Another entirely rules-based democratic disaster is playing out in Hong Kong. Legislation on elections there, largely bequeathed by Britain, has been subtly modified by the applications of government strategies on the election regulator. That should give the Minister nightmares. Candidates there could stand for election only if they had signed up to one of that Government&#8217;s key manifesto policies&#8212;unification with mainland China. It was hardly a surprise that only unification candidates were elected and that the election had the lowest turnout of voters since British handover.<\/p><p pid=\"c1554.7\/13\">I ask the Minister to consider a hypothetical UK Government with a majority of 80 and a core policy of rejoining the European Union and the power that these two clauses would give that Administration to  facilitate their desired outcome. I ask the Minister for a third time: is he completely at ease with forcing these disastrous and damaging clauses through Parliament?<\/p><p pid=\"c1554.7\/14\">When the Berlin Wall came down, the United Kingdom Government, driven on by Mrs Thatcher, set up the Westminster Foundation for Democracy as a vehicle to help the newly emerging civic societies in eastern Europe understand the basic rules of a democratic multiparty system. There were many exchanges between politicians of all parties in the UK with civic and political organisations in those emerging democracies as part of that effort, and one group visited the Liberal Democrats as part of that study tour. Members of that group had never heard of knocking on doors and engaging with electors. They were absolutely at ground zero. After a day of seminars and discussions, we had a feedback session. There was a lot of enthusiasm and excitement coupled with some trepidation about the lessons that they had learned and the work ahead of them. However, the spokesman for three dour Albanians simply said, &#8220;We prefer to win our elections by administrative means&#8221;, and that sounds a great deal more chilling with an Albanian accent.<\/p><p pid=\"c1554.7\/15\">There are some faint echoes of that today. Mrs Thatcher knew the importance and value to Britain of our soft power and our reputation for robust multiparty democracy, fought on a level playing field with a referee who did not take instructions from whichever club happened to be top of the league when the match was played. Mrs Thatcher knew the value of and invested in democracy. Perhaps in a small way, the responses of those same eastern European nations to the current Ukraine disaster show that it was money well invested. I ask the Minister not to throw all that away. Give some comfort to the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, and adopt her amendments as a small first step to undoing the harm proposed in the Bill. He needs to take these two dangerous clauses out of the Bill, and my noble friends and I will energetically make that case in the debates that follow.<\/p>",

People are fleeing for their lives and, up to now, the response from the Home Office has been a total disgrace,  bringing shame upon our country. A 90-year-old holocaust survivor was left in makeshift accommodation in Poland even though her granddaughter was struggling to get here. Mums with small kids have been told that they cannot get an appointment for weeks and have had to queue for days to get biometrics in freezing weather in Rzesz&#243;w, only to be told that they then have to travel 200 miles to Warsaw to pick up their visas.<\/p><p pid=\"d467.3\/3\">It is welcome that the Home Secretary is now introducing the online approach. We know that different ways of doing this were tried for Hong Kong visas, but why has it taken so long when she has had intelligence for weeks, if not months, that she needed to prepare for a Russian invasion of Ukraine? If we still have to wait until Tuesday for this new system to come in, what is to happen for everybody else in the meantime? Why is she not bringing in the armed forces? They have offered to help. We have had 1,000 troops on stand-by to provide humanitarian help for two weeks, so why not use them now to set up the emergency centres and to get people passported through as rapidly as possible and get them into the country?<\/p><p pid=\"d467.3\/4\">What about the Ukrainian nurse here on a healthcare visa? Is she finally to be allowed to bring her elderly parents to the country, which we have asked for for so long? Is this still just being restricted to those with family?

We are pushing vulnerable people from pillar to post in their hour of need. Week after week we have seen this happen. It is deeply wrong to leave people in this terrible state.

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1517.0\/1\">My Lords, as a brief declaration I remind noble Lords that I introduced a debate on relations with Russia in January 2018, then Salisbury occurred. Shortly thereafter, I introduced a debate on relations with Ukraine. In the same spirit, I also state that in 1997, I travelled in a delegation made up of Europeans to explore mechanisms to have Ukraine admitted to the European Union. I regret that that initiative did not advance.<\/p><p pid=\"a1517.0\/2\">I welcome the Bill. However, while the catalyst for it has been the war in Ukraine, it is a much-needed staged process, having been on the drawing board since 2018, to usher in overdue fiscal discipline to the United Kingdom. Once again, it is an illustration of the type of principled country we should be.<\/p><p pid=\"a1517.0\/3\">Put into context, the Bill has three elements&#8212;tactical, strategic and political&#8212;which should be considered. First, I shall deal with the tactical. The current draft leaves the door open to companies that hold UK property claiming they have no beneficial owner. This is already a common problem with the company register. The number of companies registered using overseas addresses that have been dormant since conception  surprises me. It was explained to me that overseas people can have an accountant register a company and open a bank account; once established, there is an exchange of shares to the actual and final beneficiary. Alternatively, the horses have bolted, and I am told that moveable assets have already taken flight to such destinations as Hong Kong or Nauru in the Pacific.<\/p><p pid=\"a1517.0\/4\">Some 1,892 property titles were purchased by overseas companies before January 1999. These would be exempt from having to declare their owners under the current drafting. I favour research being done retrospectively, asking questions where concerns arise. There are concerns that the legislation will allow individuals to hide ownership of companies through nominee agreements with professional services firms. Such agreements could allow the true owners to claim that the offshore companies are controlled by, for example, a nominated law firm which is named on the register, rather than the true owner.<\/p><p pid=\"a1517.0\/5\">The Chartered Institute of Taxation, which sent a note to a number of your Lordships, raised a central point, however: it believes there is a lack of clarity over what the Government are trying to achieve. The Government might want to respond specifically to that point. If the Government&#8217;s aim is, as suggested in some government statements, revealing the real identity of foreigners who own UK properties, the institute does not believe the Bill will achieve this. This is because the legislation, as currently drafted, does not require the disclosure of the ultimate beneficial owner of the property, but rather disclosure of the beneficial owner of the overseas entity which, in turn, owns the property. Its response is that if a separate nominee company is set up for the particular beneficial owner, then it thinks they would be caught. But if a non-UK law firm&#8217;s general nominee company is used and acts for hundreds of different clients, it will be difficult to see that any one of them exercises significant influence or control of the nominee company. So says the Chartered Institute of Taxation.<\/p><p pid=\"a1517.0\/6\">The combination of the imposition of fines for sanctions breaches and the expansion of the unexplained wealth order regime should be a central plank, however, as they will be effective in allowing the NCA and other prosecutors to disrupt criminal activity.<\/p><p pid=\"a1517.0\/7\">It is with some trepidation, in the presence of such fine judicial minds, that I venture to move on to my next point. Clause 49 amends Section 146 of the Policing and Crime Act 2017, introducing a strict liability offence for the breach of financial sanctions. Significantly, the individual or entity did not, therefore, have to know, or have reasonable cause to suspect, that they were breaching a financial sanction. A defence is to illustrate that appropriate policies are in place that illustrate compliance with the law, as is the case under the Bribery Act 2010.<\/p><p pid=\"a1517.0\/8\">Secondly, on the strategic element, the Bill probably shall not decisively weaken the Russian regime. It is wrong to believe that kleptocracy measures equate to a massive blow to the Russian leadership. The relationship of many oligarchs with the Putin power structure is often ambiguous. If anything, the proposed measures will be vocally lauded by much of the Russian public. The power structure of the regime is based on the  siloviki, translated literally as &#8220;the powerful ones&#8221;, consisting of the intelligence apparatus, the higher echelons of the military structure and the deep-state bureaucracy at federal and local levels. They are the people who need to be followed: they are estimated to be around 1% of the population. These people&#8212;and it is they who will decide the future of a Putin presidency&#8212;are normally not allowed to travel abroad or own any assets overseas. They are the people the Government need to keep an eye on.<\/p><p pid=\"a1517.0\/9\">Other measures will affect Putin&#8217;s cost-benefit analysis on the war in Ukraine, with a notable measure being the announcement that Russia&#8217;s central bank would have its foreign reserves frozen. The banning of all transactions with the Russian central bank, with the United States establishing the list of specially designated nationals, which would prevent financial brokers and central security depositories dealing with it, will have considerable effect.<\/p><p pid=\"a1517.0\/10\">Thirdly, on the political element, while this Bill is introduced in the context of Russia&#8217;s attack on Ukraine, it is important to note that its impact will not be limited to Russian entities or persons but will affect all non-UK entities and individuals in Britain. The purpose of this Bill is not to disrupt legal arrangements in our haste to target certain Russians.<\/p><p pid=\"a1517.0\/11\">Any law is only as effective as its enforcement. The provisions in the new Bill will make little difference unless authorities are provided with additional resource to enforce them. The UK already has strong tools to target illicit funds, but law enforcement agencies have struggled to make full use of them because of resourcing issues.<\/p><p pid=\"a1517.0\/12\">The Bill will place additional administrative burdens on Companies House and the Land Registry. Will the Government confirm today that funding for the enforcement of new powers&#8212;including the enforcement of the register of overseas entities and the sanctions proposed in the Bill&#8212;will be put in place?<\/p><p pid=\"a1517.0\/13\">In conclusion, and more generally, I will focus on what has brought us together this evening. Consequences for sanctions are a small price to pay for the blockades, the bombing of population centres, the targeting of hospitals, the abuse and mining of humanitarian corridors, the destruction of essential infrastructure and food supply disruption.<\/p><p pid=\"a1517.0\/14\">The situation is sickening, and those responsible must be held to account. The building blocks and justifiable slow drumbeat of a European war, defending our values and Ukraine, are possibly just on the horizon. President Zelensky&#8217;s call to arms to Parliament may be a precursor to Britain&#8217;s accepting engagement. Ukraine&#8217;s war is our war.<\/p>",

I do believe that there does need to be checks when people are applying to come here, but there is a model we can use; it's the model that was used when the Hong Kong situation was spiralling out of control, and it is supported by the Labour Party in London as well. Anyone who saw Yvette Cooper's comments, the shadow Home Secretary, on Sky News this morning, saying that they also support the checks and balances that need to be put in place&#8212;. But we can do more. We can do more and we must do more. Two and a half million people have left Ukraine as we sit here today. The projections are up to 7 million people leaving that country, but I bet you a pound to a penny that virtually every single one of them want to get back to their homeland and rebuild that homeland when it does eventually assume its rightful place as a democratic nation, led by Ukrainians, who ultimately, as Tom Giffard touched on, has a president who was voted for by 70 per cent of the population. We don't want to create another Belarus because, ultimately, that's what Putin wants to happen. He wants it to be a satellite state that will do his bidding for him, and the Ukrainians are fighting tirelessly to make sure that they do face him down.&#160;<\/p><p>There is a fundamental difference between us when it comes to nuclear weapons. Some of us believe that they are the ultimate deterrent that stop the tanks rolling beyond Ukraine and into Europe and spreading the war. I accept we will not solve that problem this afternoon, but I do urge&#8212;. And I regret that this hasn't happened and we haven't got a joint signed motion&#8212;normal channels seem to have fallen down on this one, because I do think it's important that the Senedd speaks with one voice today. And I would just ask my colleagues in Plaid Cymru to consider the amendment that they have tabled so that we can have a unanimous vote here this evening, endorsing the motion that is before us, as Sam Kurtz highlighted in his opening remarks&#8212;some of the strongest language that I've ever seen here&#8212;about deploring the invasion into Ukraine, making sure that we show our support for the refugees and the citizens of Ukraine. And I would ask Plaid Cymru to consider withdrawing that amendment that is a dividing line between those who believe that nuclear weapons are a deterrent and an effectual deterrent, and those who want to see a nuclear-free world. I don't discourage people from arguing that point&#8212;it's a perfectly reasonable point to make&#8212;but it will divide this house this evening when we vote, and I would hope that we can avoid that division.&#160;<\/p><p>Adam Price, the leader of Plaid Cymru, touched very powerfully on the point about sanctions and the tools that are in the toolbox. We do need to deploy those tools fully and make sure that every dollar, every dime, every pound, every penny is stopped from going to the Russian treasury to buy those guns, buy those tanks and pay those wages of mercenaries who are going into Ukraine. The UK&#8212;. As contributions from the backbenches here on the Conservative benches and across this Chamber have highlighted, &#163;258 billion&#8212; &#163;0.25 trillion&#8212;has been sanctioned already in London. If you take Europe, another &#163;0.25 trillion has been sanctioned on the European continent. If you make sure you add these sums together, we are talking&#8212;. The financial blockade is talking hold and we must continue the pressure. We agree with that and we want it to continue, and it is by working together that we will put that noose to make sure that the economy cannot function to pay the war machine that is causing such devastation in Ukraine. There is no division on that whatsoever.&#160;<\/p><p>But I do want to reiterate the points that Peter made in his contribution. He brought the comments of a lady who had gone from Ukraine and the horrors that she had seen. He brought those words into this Chamber for us all to hear. Every day we are hearing those words. As Natasha Asghar touched on, her constituent and the family that is so personal to her now, and the experience that they went through&#8212;we can achieve it when we clear those communications and get people out of Ukraine and make sure that they come to the safety of the west. Whether that be in the countries that surround the country of Ukraine or further into the continent of Europe, or to our own islands here in the United Kingdom, we can and we will do more. But let's not forget, when we stand together, united in this cause, we can face down everyone, and we will succeed in doing that and achieving the goal we all want to see, which is Ukraine a proud, sovereign, independent nation, rebuilt and standing on its own two feet. But we won't do that if we divide in the west and we divide across the globe, and it is vitally important that we stay united, and I do make that plea to Plaid Cymru to consider their amendment tonight, to withdraw it, so that we can vote and vote united and send that powerful message, as this is the first time that this Parliament will have voted on this particular matter. And that's why I urge support of the motion that's before us this evening, and I hope it will be a united message that comes out of this Parliament this evening. Thank you.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1456.1\/1\">My Lords, I too thank the Minister for his presentation and the noble Lord, Lord Davies, for bringing forward these amendments. I also declare my interest as set out in the register.<\/p><p pid=\"a1456.1\/2\">As my noble friend Lady Kramer said, Amendment 54 is a crude and oppressive attempt to fetter the discretion of local government pension schemes. It was introduced late and with minimum scrutiny. The Government should not be in the business of directing how local government pension schemes should invest their funds. These funds are set up under strict legal requirements, as we have seen. Their members are very often vocal about wishing to have ethical considerations considered as part of their investments. As far as I can see, schemes do not appear to have been damaged in any way by investments of local government pension schemes.<\/p><p pid=\"a1456.1\/3\">The job of pension scheme managers should not be to look at UK foreign policy when setting their investment strategy. That really is not their job. Foreign policy changes, and Governments change, so are we really expecting local government pension scheme fund managers to change their long-term investment strategy every time the UK&#8217;s foreign policy changes?<\/p><p pid=\"a1456.1\/4\">As I said, local government pension schemes aspire to invest ethically, with the members of such pension schemes having the right to express their ethical views and to have them taken into account. Why should these people not require ethical considerations? As my noble friend Lady Kramer mentioned, a clear example in the 1980s was disinvestment from South Africa. The then UK Government were obdurate and determined to defend South Africa from financial sanctions despite the violence, discrimination and widespread human rights abuses of apartheid. I, for one, cannot see why pension schemes should not reflect the views of their members when they want to protest against human rights being abused, as was happening in South Africa.<\/p><p pid=\"a1456.1\/5\">In the mid-1980s one in four Britons were boycotting South African goods. Many local councils followed their local communities and measures were taken to  disinvest from South Africa, including pension schemes, and there were boycotts of South African goods and the boycott of Barclays Bank, which pulled out of South Africa. It was certainly said at the time that foreign banks calling in South African loans was one of the reasons given by the South African President that enabled him to agree with his party the release of Nelson Mandela. So I do not accept that pension schemes should not be used for these purposes.<\/p><p pid=\"a1456.1\/6\">I feel that this is a measure introduced by a Government with an authoritarian record who wish to take more and more powers to themselves and using the whole idea of BDS to justify that. The amendment is also so loosely worded&#8212;as my noble friend Lady Kramer has said, it is directions, not advice, that is being given&#8212; that it could easily prevent local government pension schemes making prudent investment decisions based on environmental, social and governance considerations, as is part of their code of conduct. For example, the local authority pension scheme of my former authority, Bristol, sought to disinvest from the tobacco industry as a result of the campaign by Smokefree Bristol. I know of local authorities that wish to disinvest from Saudi Arabia on the grounds of arms sales, and others are looking at boycotting investment in China on the basis of its treatment of the Uighurs and its conduct of the affairs of Hong Kong. As my noble friend Lady Sheehan has said, carbon-neutral boycott is now a common principle, and many local authority pension schemes wish to disinvest from further investment in local gas and coal.<\/p><p pid=\"a1456.1\/7\">We have experienced in other legislation the relentless expansion of government powers. There is an opportunity in this amendment for the Government to interfere in pension scheme investment when it is not in line with their own views&#8212;and I have to say that Governments are notoriously slow in catching up with public opinion.<\/p><p pid=\"a1456.1\/8\">I thank the noble Lord, Lord Leigh, for clarifying that criticism of the Government of Israel is not at all anti-Semitic. I would also like to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, for her contribution&#8212;although she seemed to imply that if we support this Motion then we are somehow being anti-Semitic. I disagree with the noble Baroness, Lady Altmann, with whom I have had the pleasure of working on many pension schemes issues: I do not believe that there is any anti-Semitic intention behind this. I do not see why, if people object to the Israeli Government&#8217;s treatment of the human rights of Palestinians, they should not demonstrate that and campaign for disinvestment from Israel if that is part of their beliefs.<\/p><p pid=\"a1456.1\/9\">The amendment is ill thought-out, badly worded, hastily constructed and has been introduced with no scrutiny, and I do not believe we should support it. If the noble Lord, Lord Davies, moves his amendment and tests the opinion of the House, we will support him.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1384.0\/1\">My Lords, noble Lords will know the importance that I attach to numbers. This has become even more important as the number of refugees and migrants entering the UK increases, as they arrive perfectly legitimately from Hong Kong, Afghanistan and, unless disaster can be reversed, Ukraine. My Amendment 81 would require the Secretary of State to ensure that information is regularly published on immigration, including regular data on both asylum and other immigration. I am grateful for the support of the noble Lord, Lord Green, and my noble friend Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts.<\/p><p pid=\"b1384.0\/2\">Many years ago, I was the Home Office adviser in the Downing Street Policy Unit, and I discovered just how difficult it was to get up-to-date figures on the movement of people. The International Passenger Survey improved things, but although revived after a Covid break, it no longer includes the key questions on passenger arrivals or departures that the ONS needs to produce accurate statistics. Adequate data matters, whatever your position on immigration. It is vital to make provision for housing, schooling, health services and transport, and to prepare for other aspects of the care and employment of migrants.<\/p><p pid=\"b1384.0\/3\">We had a good and mature debate on Friday at the Second Reading of my noble friend Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts&#8217;s Private Member&#8217;s Bill on the office for demographic change. Even if the Government were discouraging, a strong case was made for more and better work by the ONS and the Home Office on immigration and asylum data to aid long-term planning. However, today, local authorities bear the immediate impact of the need to look after migrants, and are therefore also in need of immediate and up-to-date data.<\/p><p pid=\"b1384.0\/4\">As things stand, we risk chaos when there is a surge of arrivals, yet the tone of the response in Committee, certainly in respect of asylum seekers crossing the channel, was to produce less data, including<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1384.0\/5\">&#8220;presenting data in a way that enhances the public&#8217;s understanding of key issues and puts the data into appropriate context, as well as the need to prioritise the department&#8217;s resources.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class=\"offrep\" id=\", 8\/2\/22; col. 1552.]\"><i>Official Report<\/i>, 8\/2\/22; col. 1552.]<\/phrase><\/p><p pid=\"b1384.0\/6\">The Commons Library has produced a good report, dated <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-03-02\">2 March<\/phrase>, on asylum statistics, which perhaps unsurprisingly showed that in 2021 we saw the highest annual figure for asylum since 2003, up two-thirds from 2020, and that work in progress was 125,000 claims &#8212;far too high a figure. That is a lot of people waiting. I also picked up from discussions with officials that it was thought desirable to delay the logging of some immigration data for up to a year, to check whether those who had arrived remained.<\/p><p pid=\"b1384.0\/7\">My noble friend the Minister is always so helpful that I hesitate to be critical. However, taking all this together, it sounds like a move to less up-to-date data,  more spin and fewer facts and figures on which to base sound policy. Knowing the Secretary of State as I do, I am very disappointed and wonder whether this is fully understood by her. In any case, I call on my noble friend the Minister for more reassurance.<\/p><p pid=\"b1384.0\/8\">My second amendment, Amendment 82, follows reports in the media that the publication of a regular daily or weekly count of migrants crossing the channel to the UK was being discontinued. To my mind, this is unacceptable. My amendment therefore provides for at least weekly figures published within seven days, and not all at once in quarterly updates. Rather to our surprise, my noble friend Lord Sharpe of Epsom indicated in Committee that this was the Government&#8217;s new approach. Given the degree of concern about channel crossings and the abuse of migrants by traffickers who lure them into dangerous boats in busy shipping lanes, I deplore this reduction in transparency.<\/p><p pid=\"b1384.0\/9\">I have tried to get to the bottom of the matter with the help of our wonderful Library, which has referred me to the data in the Home Office&#8217;s statistics on irregular migration to the UK. This is monthly data going back to January 2018, and includes data up to December 2021. It was published on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-02-24\">24 February<\/phrase> 2022. It contains a good deal of information, including both the number of small boats detected and the number of people in those boats by month, and the number of people in detected small boats by nationality, age group and sex. But&#8212;and here is the rub&#8212;there does not seem to be any information available on shorter periods, such as by day or by week.<\/p><p pid=\"b1384.0\/10\">In my opinion, the change in statistical publicity will take more and more of our arrivals below the radar and could provide a further incentive to the wicked traffickers. It is a step in the wrong direction that will be regretted by those trying to deal well with migrants arriving on our shores, such as local authorities, and indeed across this House as a reduction in openness.<\/p><p pid=\"b1384.0\/11\">I am sorry that we do not have Divisions in Committee any more as I might have won the day then. However, we have a lot to get through this evening, so I am looking instead to the Government for a clear statement of their intentions on providing up-to-date figures on channel crossings, and perhaps some follow-up discussions with me. I am not going to go away on these data issues. I beg to move.<\/p>",

Hong Kong has been hit by a mendacious Government in Beijing&#8212;including Mr Putin&#8217;s best friend, we are now told&#8212;who have set about comprehensively and vindictively destroying the freedoms of a great and open society. It is particularly appropriate that we have recognised some of those who have been more affected, particularly with the charges that have  been levelled at them in recent weeks around civil disobedience and freedom of speech. This amendment and the proposals of the Government will help those who have been most affected: the younger Hong Kongers who are the children of people already able to get a BNO passport but who unfortunately are in the group born after 1997. It is a very important amendment. I am delighted that the Government have accepted it and that they continue to assert our continuing moral responsibility for Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"b1363.0\/3\">I expect, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said in our earlier debate, that the young people who come here will make a really significant contribution to this country.

That is not entirely in our hands, though the more we behave like a liberal democracy that believes in liberal democracy, the more likely it is to happen.<\/p><p pid=\"b1363.0\/4\">I am delighted that I am able on this occasion to say how much I support what the Government have done, and I look forward to doing so on many future occasions&#8212;there have not been quite enough in the past.

I have set out for the House, as I know my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has already, the big, big package of measures that we are putting in to help people fleeing Ukraine. I just want to repeat: look at the numbers we took from Afghanistan and look at the numbers of BNOs from Hong Kong. Huge numbers of people have come to the UK.

            "body": "<p pid=\"c615.0\/1\">My Lords, we had a long debate on this subject in Committee, so I shall be brief. We ought to remember throughout what the Bill was originally about. It is fundamentally about stopping, or curbing, the channel migrants. Obviously, we hope to do it in a sensible way. If we could have an agreement with the French, the Belgians or the Dutch to deal with this in a bipartisan way, that would be ideal, but none of us is very optimistic, particularly before a general election in France and so on.<\/p><p pid=\"c615.0\/2\">We need other options: a plan B, or maybe a plan C. I agree that some of them stretch the credibility of what any Government would want to do, because the problem of the cross-channel migrants is indeed very difficult to deal with. You have to deal with them separately because, however sympathetic one may be with people in the hands of traffickers coming across the channel for whatever reason, it is a difficult way to come across. It is unsafe, they are clearly behaving illegally&#8212;it is against the law to enter this country in that way&#8212;and they are doing so in a very public way. Every night on television, you can see people coming across the channel and on to the beaches in Kent and so forth. They add to the number of people the Government have agreed to accept by proper routes&#8212;the Chinese from Hong Kong, the Afghans and, now, Ukrainians. Like the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, I hope we will have a generous scheme to allow Ukrainians who wish to come here to do so, just as I hope that Europe will have a generous scheme. I suspect and hope that they will come here only temporarily.<\/p><p pid=\"c615.0\/3\">Coming across the channel is an open-ended and uncontrolled method and, if successful, encourages even more to come. Last year, 29,000 came; the prediction is that 60,000 will come this year. That is more money for the traffickers. The traffickers now make more money out of human beings than they do out of drugs, which will increasingly be the case. If we allow  that to carry on uncontrolled, it makes it more difficult for local authorities, which have to deal with these people&#8212;housing them, making welfare arrangements, schooling their children and dealing with their families.<\/p><p pid=\"c615.0\/4\">They add to the problems in the most disadvantaged parts of the country. It is not the leafy areas of Hampstead where these people end up; it is in places such as Blackpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Middlesbrough and Doncaster. I was talking to a red wall MP from the north-west. Blackpool has five of the eight poorest wards in the country; it has real problems. There is fury on the streets of Blackpool at the way they are being dumped on with people such as the migrants who come across the channel. They do not understand why they have to receive them.<\/p><p pid=\"c615.0\/5\">The levelling-up agenda, which is central to this Government, is set at nought when that situation is arising in the areas of this country which need to be levelled up. It makes a proper, organised, rational immigration policy more difficult. As my noble friend Lord Hodgson said in a previous debate, informed consent&#8212;the consent of the people&#8212;is essential for a rational, substantiated and long-term immigration policy. If we do not have a policy that people are comfortable with, in the long run, we will not sustain it.<\/p><p pid=\"c615.0\/6\">It also makes it more difficult for the immigrants because, if they are dumped in a place such as Blackpool or some other city because there is nowhere else to go, it causes resentment among other people who find that they are pushed further down the council waiting list for a home. That is a problem.<\/p><p pid=\"c615.0\/7\">As my noble and learned friend Lord Clarke mentioned in a debate we had in Committee, if you do not deal with this problem, you run the risk of having real right-wing parties, as fortunately we have avoided in this country; we do not have a Le Pen or a Zemmour or the German equivalent of Alternative f&#252;r Deutschland and all the rest of them. We do not have such a party in this country. We have managed to keep it within the bounds of the usual national parties. If there is no attempt to deal with this problem, that is a risk you run.<\/p><p pid=\"c615.0\/8\">The noble Lord, Lord Kerr, also said that it goes outside the refugee convention and that there is no example anywhere in the world of this happening. But in Australia, of course, they are doing precisely this. We are trying to take that as a model. In Australia, 10 years ago, exactly this kind of legislation was passed. Since then, it has had the campaign to stop the boats, and it has been highly successful. Where there were 50,000 people a year going by boat into Darwin and so forth in the north of Australia, now there is none, and there has been none for many years. Both the major parties&#8212;the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party of Australia&#8212;support this policy because it is successful. That is, I imagine&#8212;I do not know as I am not privy to government thoughts on this matter&#8212;a possibly alternative if negotiations with the French is our main purpose and this is enacted.<\/p><p pid=\"c615.0\/9\">There are examples in the world of highly successful policies which are presumably inside the refugee convention&#8212;I am not aware of Australia being sanctioned  or penalised by the UNHCR. The facts are that this is an alternative which the Government are looking at. It is a difficult alternative&#8212;I agree that it is well beyond what Governments would normally look at&#8212;but, in these circumstances, the Government here are laying the legal framework for the possibility of enacting this. To take it out of the Bill would be hugely destructive and deeply irresponsible.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c557.0\/1\">My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have spoken in this debate. I also thank the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, for meeting my noble friend Lady Williams last week and for the opportunity to hear further about the issues impacting the Chagossian community. As has been said previously, both in Committee and when my noble friend met the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, last week, and as noted by my noble friend Lady Altmann, the Government empathise and sympathise with the Chagossians about how they were treated in the 1960s and 1970s.<\/p><p pid=\"c557.0\/2\">It is, however, important to clarify who this amendment seeks to assist. It is not those Chagossians who were of the generations born on the British Indian Ocean Territory, as they have always been British nationals and have been automatically considered both British Overseas Territories citizens and British citizens since 2002. Similarly, it is not their children, the first generation of Chagossians born outside of British territory, who are also both automatically British Overseas Territories citizens and British citizens. It is also not those in the first generation of Chagossians born outside of British territory, who, as the Chagossian community highlights, have missed out on rights to British nationality due to historical legislative unfairness, and this Bill already seeks to rectify that issue.<\/p><p pid=\"c557.0\/3\">This amendment is limited to those in the second and successive generations of Chagossians born outside of British territory who, like all children of British nationals by descent, face a different route to British nationality. For this generation, if they wish to acquire British nationality, it is right that they must establish a close, continuing connection with either the UK or a British overseas territory by lawfully residing and settling there, although I recognise that since the 1970s, it has not been possible to establish such a link to the British Indian Ocean Territory. This must be in line with  either the UK&#8217;s or an overseas territory&#8217;s Immigration Rules. This has also been the case with Hong Kong British Nationals Overseas, who do not have a right of abode in British territory and must complete a period of residence in the UK before acquiring the permanent residence status that is required in order to naturalise as a British citizen.<\/p><p pid=\"c557.0\/4\">The points raised by the descendants of Chagossians, who are members of the second generation born outside British territory and who are now seeking to settle in the UK under the Immigration Rules, are often very complex. As the Minister for Safe and Legal Migration has stated in the House of Commons, the Home Office is keen to consider what more we could do to support those families seeking to settle here under the current system.<\/p><p pid=\"c557.0\/5\">The Home Office is actively engaging with the Chagossian community to identify practical proposals that would support the second generation born outside British territory in navigating the system. In addition, the Home Office is discussing with the FCDO how the &#163;40 million Chagos support fund, referenced by the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, could be used to deliver further support for Chagossians seeking to settle here under the Immigration Rules. Those discussions are current and ongoing, and I had some this morning.<\/p><p pid=\"c557.0\/6\">As the Government have consistently stated, allowing entitlements to&#8212;<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a522.1\/1\">This is what happens during debates. I assure the noble Baroness that I was at the United Nations during the General  Assembly debates. It is not just about shoring up support with our friends and allies but about doing so across the globe. We mentioned previously the contributions of the permanent representative of Kenya. Over the last few days and weeks, we have been working and shoring up support for any resolution. It is true that the UN Security Council resolution will no doubt be vetoed by Russia.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/2\">Important contributions were made by the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, and others about talking to other near neighbours. Indeed, right after the debate I intend to have a meeting with the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Turkmenistan on various issues, including the very issue of support from the near neighbours of Russia.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/3\">Of course, it is important to consider our response, and I hope during the time I have to pick up on a number of the questions raised by noble Lords. Let me assure the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, from the outset that we are using Britain&#8217;s position on the world stage to condemn the onslaught against Ukraine, and we will counter the Kremlin&#8217;s blizzard of lies and disinformation by telling the truth about Putin&#8217;s war of aggression. We are working together with a number of key allies to ensure that we never give up on peace, as the most reverend Primate reminded us we should never do. He quoted the words, &#8220;Blessed are the peacekeepers&#8221;, and we keep that very much at the forefront of our minds. The door of diplomacy should always remain open. However, when the opposite side rejects, as Mr Putin has done, the very existence of the nation of Ukraine, the challenge becomes all the more difficult.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/4\">Many noble Lords alluded to what is happening in Russia, and it is right that we recognise the strong rejection of Russian actions. Yet we have seen, through Mr Putin&#8217;s action on Mr Navalny, for example, what he thinks of democracy in his own country.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/5\">My noble friend Lord King talked about the quality of today&#8217;s debate: he is quite right, and he is a good example of it. The House is a great source of wisdom. As the Minister responsible&#8212;and I know I speak for my noble friend as well&#8212;I can say that the contributions today, as the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, reminded us, inform our policy. I know that noble Lords regularly challenge us because there are things we are not doing or not doing fast enough, but I assure them that we reflect very carefully on the valued contributions that this House makes thanks to its wisdom, insight and expertise.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/6\">The past few hours have seen Russian forces approaching Kyiv, and we need to make sure that we focus on that and continue to work with allies to provide support, particularly to the brave President Zelensky. On the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, we are in touch with the Ukrainians. I am in regular touch with the Ukrainian Foreign Minister, as is my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary, and my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has spoken regularly to President Zelensky, who has made a clear and courageous decision to remain in his country. The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, mentioned the president&#8217;s address, in Russian, to the Russian people. It was a very poignant message, delivered in Russian, that his fight is not with the Russian people, and he therefore implored them to reject Mr Putin&#8217;s actions.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/7\">The Government and our allies have warned for weeks, as the noble Lord, Lord Ricketts, acknowledged, that President Putin was preparing for the actions we have seen. As my noble friend Lord Howell reminded us, this is not limited to Europe, but goes way beyond. I assure my noble friend and my noble friend Lord King that colleagues, led by the Foreign Secretary, are speaking to Foreign Ministers around the clock to shore up support for the General Assembly vote at the UN.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/8\">We were constantly told by the Russian Government that there were no plans to invade Ukraine, but it is obvious to all of us, now that various events have come to pass, that, as the Russian Government have demonstrated, they were never serious about diplomacy. My noble friend Lady Meyer reminded us of their rejection of the Minsk accord. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, rightly spoke passionately, as he always does, about human rights. I intend to be at the Human Rights Council on Monday, events allowing, and will certainly be pursuing whatever further action can be taken at the HRC. The noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, reminded us of the importance of rights within country, and that will be central to our thinking and support of Ukraine&#8217;s position.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/9\">Turning to the issue of sanctions, the noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, and my noble friends Lady Neville-Jones and Lord Tugendhat talked about the public register and the economic crime Bill. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister announced yesterday that we will bring forward measures on unexplained wealth orders. I have heard again the strength of feeling on expediting the economic crime Bill, a point made well by the noble Baroness, Lady Northover. We will be laying further legislation, starting next week, to broaden the scope to allow us to act quicker and more broadly on the issue of sanctions as a whole.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/10\">The noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, also asked about what is happening currently in Hong Kong and Singapore. I know my right honourable friend the Trade Secretary is currently visiting that region. The points she made about how quickly centres can move is not lost on me, as I spent 20 years in the City of London, but I assure her that we are ensuring that we work with key partners. Hong Kong poses its own challenge, for obvious reasons, but we can work with Singapore as a partner and an ally.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/11\">Noble Lords made a point about ensuring that we talk to China. Only this morning my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary spoke to State Councillor Wang Yi about the position of China, including at the UN Security Council, and we again impressed on China the importance of unity and purpose, not just on the Security Council but further afield. As the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, reminded us, the Chinese are no fans of annexation in terms of republics declaring self-determination. Nevertheless, we will continue to work to the wire at the UNSC.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/12\">The noble Lords, Lord McDonald, Lord Adonis and Lord Alderdice, my noble friends Lord Robathan and Lord Tugendhat, the noble Baronesses, Lady Kramer and Lady Wheatcroft, and others rightly raised the issue of sanctions. We intend to freeze the assets of Russian banks, totally shutting out Russian banks from today.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/13\">A number of noble Lords raised the cost. It is, of course, real. The noble Lord, Lord Owen, talked poignantly in this remarks about the cost. The cost is not just to the Ukrainian people or to those who neighbour Ukraine; it will be felt by all of us. As someone who has some insight into banking, the freezing of the assets of organisations such as VTB will have an impact on many businesses that operate within the UK, but severe restrictions will hammer Russia&#8217;s leading defence companies and significantly degrade Russia&#8217;s economic and military development. The sanctions will also have an immediate impact on Russia&#8217;s wealthy elite and Putin&#8217;s inner circle. We have targeted specifically his former son-in-law. The noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, talked about ensuring that we meet our obligations in this regard and about the long-term impacts being understood. We are going to introduce further legislation allowing us to ban Russian state and private companies from raising funds in the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/14\">On SWIFT, which the noble Lords, Lord Adonis, Lord Alderdice and Lord Coaker, and many other noble Lords mentioned specifically, we believe that Russia should be cut out of SWIFT. That is not a shared view, but we continue to work with our European allies and friends to ensure that we can move forward as quickly as possible on that.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/15\">We will impose asset freezes on more than 100 entities and individuals and we will limit the amount of money that Russian nationals hold in their UK bank accounts. We will ban the Russian carrier Aeroflot. There is the tat-for-tat that also takes place. I assure the noble Lords, Lord Kerr and Lord Hannay, that we are scaling up trade measures on high-tech goods, which will erode Russia&#8217;s strategic development with immediate effect. All existing export licences for dual-use items going to Russia will be suspended and no new licences will be granted. I will write to the noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, on numbers in the kleptocrat unit within the NCA&#8212;but, yes, it is important that it is properly resourced and funded. That point was made by my noble friend Lady Neville-Jones.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/16\">The UK sanctions that currently exist against 120 businesses and oligarchs are part of a concerted strike against Mr Putin&#8217;s regime and are carefully co-ordinated with our international allies, including the US, the EU and other G7 partners. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Bennett, that when we look across the G7&#8212;I am a big advocate of it&#8212;there is an increasing number of women Foreign Ministers, including in the Five Eyes, where I believe the only male member is the United States Secretary of State. There is a real move to ensure that women are rightly in key leadership positions.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/17\">The UK will also take decisive action against Belarus for its part in the wholly unjustified attack on Ukraine.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/18\">I note very carefully the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, on legal registers et cetera, and I would of course be keen to hear more details and thoughts on how that can perhaps be incorporated into future consideration.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/19\">VTB, Russia&#8217;s second-largest bank, is worth &#163;154 billion, so there are impacts to be felt.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/20\">The noble Lord, Lord Newby, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Bennett and Lady Kramer, raised specific names. As I have already said, we have taken action against elites. I cannot go into future designations, but noble Lords will be kept up to speed by the fact that the broader legislation will allow us to capture more people. The noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, also asked about the applicability of sanctions to the overseas territories and the Crown dependencies. The sanctions instrument which we plan to lay will apply to the OTs and CDs.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/21\">Gazprom was raised by several noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, and the noble Baroness, Lady Kramer. We are co-ordinating with our allies to maximise the economic cost. This must include addressing the issue of European dependence on gas companies such as Gazprom. VTB and VEB are prevented, under existing sanctions, from raising further finance in the City of London and the UK. As I have said, further legislation will be made next week. In the time that I have, I hope that this gives a sense of the sanctions issue, our intent and our direction of travel. We are working tirelessly with our allies and partners to co-ordinate our response in this respect.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/22\">I assure the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, that the Council of Europe is very much on our agenda. I welcome further thoughts&#8212;following what the noble Lord talked about&#8212;on the exclusion of Russia from European bodies. That is very much for the bodies themselves to decide, but there is a point to be made on ensuring that Russia knows that there is a sanction for its actions.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/23\">We are also currently looking at energy, which was referred to by my noble friend Lord Howell, among others. We welcome the statements made recently by the German Chancellor on Nord Stream 2. At the G7 meeting yesterday, the UK agreed to work in unity to maximise the economic price that Mr Putin will pay for his aggression. I agree with noble Lords that this must include ending Europeans&#8217; collective dependence on Russian oil and gas. Ours is circa 3%. We are moving to other sustainable sources. Nevertheless, it is important that we work together with our European colleagues and friends.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/24\">Rightly so, humanitarian support is high up on our agenda. On this, I assure noble Lords, as someone who is now responsible for humanitarian thematic work within the FCDO. The UK has already committed funding and technical expertise to agencies working on responses to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. Earlier this week, I met the UN Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, to outline our support. We are finalising the financial package and working hand in glove with OCHA to ensure that we provide the support to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund that is needed. These concerns were raised by the noble Lord, Lord Collins, as well as my noble friend Lord Davies. I assure the noble Baroness, Lady Goudie, that, in all our support, and particularly on humanitarian matters, the issue of girls and women will be central to our thinking and support.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/25\">I turn to visas and help for refugees, raised by the noble Lords, Lord Newby and Lord Hannay, the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, and others.  The noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, also flagged this as a specific issue. Today, the Home Secretary has confirmed that Ukrainians here in the UK on work or study visas will have their visas extended and will be able to switch to different visa routes. All visa routes are also based on what noble Lords have said. I share the sentiments that were expressed, including by my noble friend Lady Neville-Jones. It is my strong personal view that if people are fleeing persecution and need assistance, the United Kingdom has been and will&#8212;I hope, always&#8212;remain a country that is open. We need to work to ensure that we stand firm in this commitment, as we have done previously. I am sure that the Home Secretary will have listened to the comments made today, and we will continue to work in this respect to ensure that we provide the support that the Ukrainians need.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/26\">I will indulge the House slightly further on important issues of defence and NATO. Defence is playing a central role in the UK&#8217;s response to the Russian invasion, and we will ensure that the UK and our security interests are secured. Secondly, we will work through NATO and closely with our allies and partners&#8212;including Ukraine, of course&#8212;in the hours and days ahead. Working together is a real strength. I hope the noble Viscount, Lord Stansgate, is reassured that we are ensuring that we provide security to all parts of NATO. This was a key point raised by the noble Lord, Lord West. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup, and the noble Lord, Lord Dannatt, reminded us of the importance of our security and defence partnerships.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/27\">The question of whether we are sending further troops to Ukraine was asked. We have stood up support, such as helping with humanitarian support. I was in Estonia a couple of weeks ago when we announced the increase in the support we provide to Estonia through NATO and doubled our number of troops; that has been stood up. We are offering further military support, in terms of defensive capabilities, to Ukraine directly. We have already begun our military support to NATO allies and partners. An initial deployment of Royal Marines has arrived in Poland. On a bilateral basis, we are strengthening our solidarity with our NATO allies. In addition, the further Typhoon aircraft that my noble friend Lady Goldie mentioned will allow us to establish a full squadron at RAF Akrotiri. Over the coming months we will also maintain our activities to provide further reassurance.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/28\">We also remain supportive of Ukraine&#8217;s NATO membership application, in line with the 2008 Bucharest summit. I assure the noble Lords, Lord Sedwill and Lord Campbell-Savours, that we remain firm on what NATO is. It is a bedrock of European security, but it is a defensive alliance; that point needs to be understood.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/29\">I assure my noble friend Lady Rawlings that we are offering broader support to others. My noble friend Lady McIntosh mentioned discussions under Articles 4 and 5. Those are very much under way to ensure that all members of NATO receive the support and the reassurances they currently require as Russia continues to exercise its expansionist policies.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/30\">On wider defence issues, I welcome the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Owen, about how we have increased spending. I listened carefully, as did my  noble friend Lady Goldie, on the importance of ensuring that we are equipped in our defence responses to meet the requirements of the day. Meeting the challenges of cyber is not lost on us.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/31\">The UK leads as a European contributor to NATO&#8217;s defence capability, and it is important that other NATO partners step up in their response as well. We have readiness forces and make contributions to NATO formations. Our Armed Forces have been built up to face major state threats; that is why they include state-of-the-art capabilities such as F35 fifth-generation fighters, the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier and other assets. During this crisis, the UK is doubling the number of personnel in Estonia, as I said, and sending four additional UK Typhoon jets to Cyprus. HMS &#8220;Trent&#8221; is conducting patrols in the eastern Mediterranean and HMS &#8220;Diamond&#8221; is preparing to sail. Over the last week, 350 Royal Marines of 45 Commando committed to Poland have already been deployed. As I said, we have also put 1,000 more British personnel at a state of readiness to support the humanitarian response.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/32\">The noble Lord, Lord Newby, talked of Russian election interference. We have taken steps to secure more mitigations against such interference, but we should be ever ready. The Russian state continues to disrupt Ukraine, Europe, the UK and the world, and we need to ensure our state-of-the-art response. Anyone who has had any engagement with the National Cyber Security Centre will know that we really are world leading in this respect.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/33\">My noble friend Lady Meyer asked about Russian and Ukrainian expertise in language training. That is very much at the forefront of how we deploy our diplomats, as I am sure other former Permanent Secretaries of the FCO will testify. The skills training for our diplomats, including our current diplomats serving in Moscow, reflects the language skills they require.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/34\">My noble friend Lord Cormack and the noble Baroness, Lady Goudie, raised the BBC World Service. Last year the FCDO announced &#163;94.4 million to help the World Service build on its great work. I assure noble Lords that we are looking to see how, through an additional &#163;3 million of funding, we can directly address additional investment to tackle disinformation.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/35\">We have had a very extensive debate. Over the next few hours and days, we will continue working with G7 partners. We are active at the UN Security Council, and working very closely with our NATO allies, in Brussels and bilaterally, but also more broadly in ensuring that our humanitarian, defence, security and cyberdefence response, and our continuing work on sanctions, are fully aligned.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/36\">In seeking to divide us, Mr Putin has done quite the opposite. This is, as the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, said, one of those occasions when we have 99.9% unanimity and solidarity across your Lordships&#8217; House. A clear message goes out from here: you have not only united us but you have united Europe, and we are working on uniting the world.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/37\">What has happened in Ukraine is blatantly against the UN charter. Russia is a P5 member that signs up to it. There is an extra responsibility. I was in that chamber when I heard the Russian representative, an ambassador whom I know, directly attack the Secretary-General of  the United Nations. For what? Secretary-General Guterres was standing up against aggression and condemning it. That should not be happening in the United Nations. He was doing what he should as Secretary-General: bringing countries together. The 190-plus nations of the United Nations must stand together against that one nation which clearly has violated the sovereignty of another. NATO, the European Union and our work through all key alliances and the United Nations are central to our thinking and our actions.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/38\">In thanking all noble Lords for their very insightful, expert contributions today, I end with the words of an anthem known well to the Ukrainians, which perhaps   embellishes our support and emboldens the spirit of Ukrainians. From this House and from the other place, from this Parliament and from our country, there is a message of solidarity and unity: we stand with you. In the words of the anthem:<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/39\">&#8220;Glorious spirit of Ukraine shines and lives forever.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/40\">Blessed by fortune, brotherhood will stand up together.<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/41\">Like the dew before the sun, enemies will fade,<\/p><p pid=\"a522.1\/42\">We will further rule and prosper in our promised land.&#8221;<\/p><p class=\"italic\" pid=\"a522.1\/43\">Motion agreed.<\/p><p class=\"italic\" pid=\"a522.1\/44\">House adjourned at 3.23 pm.<\/p>",

We will uphold international rules and norms and hold Russia to account for breaches of them, working with our international partners as we did after the Salisbury attack. In the context of Ukraine, hon. Members will be aware that the UK is working intensively with allies to ensure that Russia&#8217;s actions are met with a united international response. We are doing so through NATO, the UN, the OSCE and our partners in the G7 and across Europe. We have engaged with the Russian Government at every level, but Putin has chosen the path of destruction over diplomacy.<\/p><p pid=\"c532.1\/3\">The integrated review identifies Russia as representing<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c532.1\/4\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;the most acute direct threat to the UK&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"c532.1\/5\">as well as predicting that it<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c532.1\/6\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;will be more active around the wider European neighbourhood&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"c532.1\/7\">It makes a separate assessment of China, highlighting the<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c532.1\/8\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;scale&#8230;of China&#8217;s economy&#8230;population, technological advancement and&#8230;ambition to project its influence&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"c532.1\/9\">It emphasises China&#8217;s increasing international assertiveness and scale as one of the most significant geopolitical shifts of the 2020s. Consequently, our approach to China aims to promote a positive economic relationship, but one that avoids strategic dependency and enables us to engage where possible to tackle global challenges. It also addresses the inescapable fact that China is an authoritarian state with a different set of values from the UK&#8217;s. We cannot let China undermine freedom and democracy. We will hold it to account for human rights violations, whether they are in Xinjiang or in Tibet, and for the erosions of rights and freedoms in Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"c532.1\/10\">The Government are clear that in areas of shared interest, the UK will preserve space for co-operation and continue to engage with China and Russia, which, like us, have permanent seats on the UN Security Council. As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary set out in her Chatham House speech in December, we must be<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c532.1\/11\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;on the front foot with our friends across the free world, because the battle for economic influence is already in full flow.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c532.1\/12\">That requires a robust diplomatic framework that allows us to manage disagreements, defend our values and co-operate where our interests align, but let me repeat that we will not accept the campaign that Russia is waging to subvert its democratic neighbours.<\/p><p pid=\"c532.1\/13\">As a P5 Member, China has a critical role to play. The UN Secretary General has said that Russia&#8217;s action<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c532.1\/14\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;conflicts directly with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"c532.1\/15\">Just as China refused to recognise the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, we would expect China to uphold the UN charter in the face of this latest violation of Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.<\/p><p pid=\"c532.1\/16\">The UK is determined to lead the way in defending democracy and freedom. We will continue to develop an international approach that defends UK interests and promotes our values, including with Russia and China. We will uphold the founding principles of international peace and security in the United Nations, which all three of our countries are duly bound to respect and protect.<\/p>",

The route reflects the UK&#8217;s historic and moral commitment to those people of Hong Kong who chose to retain their ties to the UK by taking up BN(O) status before Hong Kong&#8217;s handover to China in 1997, and followed China&#8217;s passing of the National Security Law which significantly impacts the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The route has already been a great success and as of 31 December 2021, there have been 103,900 applications since the route launched.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The current rules enable adult children of a BN(O) status holder to apply as a dependant if they apply at the same time as their BN(O) parent, are part of their parent&#8217;s household in Hong Kong, the UK or the Crown Dependencies and were born on or after 1 July 1997. However, some of this cohort cannot currently access the BN(O) route because their BN(O) parent does not wish to apply, because they are not part of their parent&#8217;s household, or they are unable to apply at the same time.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>It was right to think about the family unit of the BN(O), but this is creating unfair outcomes for the families of BN(O) status holders with some children able to access the route independently as they were old enough to be registered for BN(O) status, while their younger siblings aged between 18 and 24 are unable to access the route. It is right and important to address this so the Government has made the decision to enable individuals aged 18 or over who were born on or after 1 July 1997 and who have at least one BN(O) parent to apply to the route independently of their BN(O) parent.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>This cohort will still be required to meet all of the other suitability and eligibility requirements for the route, including six months maintenance funds and the requirement for the applicant to be ordinarily resident in Hong Kong, the UK, or the Crown Dependencies. Applicants will also need to pay the existing application fees for the route (&#163;180 if applying for 30 months leave or &#163;250 if applying for five years leave) as well as the immigration health surcharge. They will be able to be joined in the UK by their partner and children under the age of 18. After five years in the UK those on the BN(O) route will be able to apply for settlement, followed by citizenship after a further twelve months.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We intend to lay the changes to the Immigration Rules in September with the changes expected to go live in October.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring those planning to make the UK their home feel fully supported and welcomed when starting their lives here. As with those who have already come to the UK on the BN(O) route, this additional cohort will have access to the provisions available through the UK-wide Welcome Programme led by the Department for Levelling-Up, Housing and Communities, which consists of a package of support with up to &#163;43.1 million made available so far.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We look forward to welcoming applications from those individuals who wish to make the UK their home.<\/p>",

They include Saudi Arabia, because of its involvement in Yemen. In fact, I have organised demonstrations when there were visits from various representatives from Saudi Arabia to this country. I have argued that I do not want my pension invested in China because of the treatment of the Uyghurs. Again, I have engaged in demonstrations on that, and also on the moral ground that a number of trade union friends I have worked with over the years are currently in prison as a result of the operation undertaken by the Chinese state in Hong Kong. Yes, I have argued against investments going into Colombia because of the murder of trade unionists, and I have also argued against investments going into Israel because I do believe&#8212;according to the Amnesty human rights report, and many Jewish institutions&#8212;that it is an apartheid state in the way it treats the Palestinians.<\/p><p pid=\"b221.1\/3\">That is my position: on moral grounds, I want to be able to influence the investments. I do not want my pension invested in armaments or fossil fuels either, and I believe that that is my right. I do not believe it is the role of the state to ride roughshod over my moral choices without extremely good reason. Given the threat of climate change and other matters, there may well be, in extremis, reasons for the state to act, but I do not think that this new clause is in that context.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c1981.0\/1\">I thank noble Lords who have spoken in this debate and express my admiration for the noble Lord, Lord Oates, on this subject. He is not going to give up on it. He mentioned the QR code, and I totally agree; the QR code has worked brilliantly throughout the pandemic for certain things such as updating your Covid vaccination status. I will take that back to the Home Office and report back on any progress. I know it is not that simple, but we have said that we are considering it and I will report back to the House on its progress.<\/p><p pid=\"c1981.0\/2\">The noble Lord will not be surprised to hear any of my other arguments, though. When people are granted immigration status, they get a formal written notification of their grant in the form of a letter sent by post or email, which sets out their immigration status in the UK. They can retain it for their own personal records and use it, if they want, when contacting the Home Office about their status. Those issued with a biometric residence permit or an e-visa can use the online services to share that status online with other individuals or organisations, such as employers and landlords. Holders of an e-visa can also print off a copy of their immigration status, which is shown on their online profile, and store it with their personal records.<\/p><p pid=\"c1981.0\/3\">I know the hour is late, but I will touch on a couple of the other advantages of the e-visa. It puts individuals in control of their own data, gives them direct access to information held by the Home Office about their status and, importantly, adheres to the principles of data minimisation, ensuring that only the information required by a checker, rather than all the information held on a physical card, is made available to the checker. Secondly, information on a physical document might be out of date if a person&#8217;s status has changed since it was issued, and a person&#8217;s digital status is always up to date.<\/p><p pid=\"c1981.0\/4\">The noble Baroness, Lady Lister, is going to cringe now, because we are developing a border and immigration service that is &#8220;digital by default&#8221;, which means that we will increasingly replace physical and paper-based products and services with accessible, easy-to-use online products. My parents were not at all digital by default, but they have become digital by default over time. I know it is difficult when you do not have a physical document in front of you, but it is more and more the way the world is going.<\/p><p pid=\"c1981.0\/5\">We started the rollout of e-visas in 2018, starting with EU citizens granted status under the beta phases of the EU settlement scheme and expanding to all EEA and Swiss EUSS applicants when the scheme first opened back in March last year, followed by the Hong Kong BNO route, the graduate route and, most recently, the student and skilled worker extension routes. We plan to continue to roll out e-visas incrementally. The Home Office&#8217;s ambition is to have biometric residence permits replaced by e-visas by the end of 2024, so that eventually all foreign nationals granted status will have e-visas that can be securely and easily accessed and shared online.<\/p><p pid=\"c1981.0\/6\">In response to what the noble Lord, Lord Oates, said, so far the online services have been positive. Individuals who struggle can contact the UKVI resolution centre, including by phone.<\/p><p pid=\"c1981.0\/7\">I will give the House an update on the QR code, but I support the whole principle of being able to use a QR code. With that, I hope the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.<\/p>",

However, such is the nature of amendments that you can have only four names on the top of them, which on this occasion omits any Liberal Democrat name. So I rise, genuinely briefly, to support the amendment on behalf of these Benches because, as both noble Lords have made so clear, it really plugs the hole in the life raft, as the noble Lord, Lord Patten of Barnes, pointed out.<\/p><p pid=\"c1973.0\/2\">We are talking about a relatively small amendment and a relatively small number of people.

This is an important amendment and I very much hope the noble Lord, Lord Patten of Barnes, is right that it brings together both wings of the Conservative Party. The last time I remember something similar happening right across your Lordships&#8217; House was on the rights of the 3 million EU nationals resident in the United Kingdom in the wake of the referendum, when all parts of your Lordships&#8217; House and of the Conservative Party, apart from the Government Front Bench, agreed. I hope that on this occasion those on the Government Front Bench might be able to agree with the two wings of their own party, and with everybody else.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c1964.1\/1\">I very much thank all noble Lords for participating in this debate. In particular, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, and the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, for their amendments.<\/p><p pid=\"c1964.1\/2\">Before I start, the noble Lord, Lord Alton, alluded to the fact that I have some experience in Hong Kong. I must declare an interest: I have marched to that pipe band. In fact, my noble friend Lord Patten was briefly my boss, which he probably did not know and probably horrifies him. I have worked closely with the Hong Kong Military Service Corps, as both the noble and  gallant Lord, Lord Craig, and the noble Lord, Lord Alton, know. I hold those men&#8212;they were all men&#8212;in extremely high regard. I come at this speech with that in mind and wish to put it on the record.<\/p><p pid=\"c1964.1\/3\">The Government highly value the service of all members of the Armed Forces, including Commonwealth nationals and Gurkhas from Nepal. They have a long and distinguished history of service to the UK both here and overseas. We also remain extremely grateful for the contribution made by former British Hong Kong service personnel, which is why the Government announced on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-12-07\">7 December<\/phrase> last year that the Home Secretary has identified an option that will enable our Government to treat this group of personnel in a similar way to other non-UK service personnel who were based in Hong Kong before handover. It was announced by Kevin Foster, the Minister for Safe and Legal Migration in the House of Commons.<\/p><p pid=\"c1964.1\/4\">I appreciate that, in tabling Amendment 185, the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, wants reassurance that the Government are taking concrete steps to further support British Hong Kong veterans where possible. I can confirm that the Government will update Parliament as soon as we have more details that can be shared, with the aim of implementing any changes by the end of this calendar year. I am probably going too far here but that is not an &#8220;in due course&#8221;, in response to a comment made in an earlier debate; it is a concrete commitment to making the relevant announcement soon. However, once again, I agree with the noble and gallant Lord that they are loyal veterans; I also commend him on his long work on this particular subject. That is all I can say for now.<\/p><p pid=\"c1964.1\/5\">Before I address the detail of Amendment 178, I want to say a few words about the process for setting administration fees. For a number of years, application fees for immigration and nationality applications have been charged under powers set out under Section 68 of the Immigration Act 2014. They play a vital role in our country&#8217;s ability to run a sustainable migration and borders system, reducing the burden on taxpayers. Sitting beneath the Immigration Act is an affirmative procedure fees order, which is scrutinised by both Houses before coming into effect, and beneath that are negative resolution fees regulations, which are laid before both Houses prior to coming into force. In addition, all fees are set with the consent of HM Treasury. This system ensures that there are checks and balances within the system, and maintains the coherence of the immigration fees framework as it is set out in legislation. I will come back to this subject in a moment.<\/p><p pid=\"c1964.1\/6\">When non-UK service personnel, including Commonwealth citizens and Gurkhas from Nepal, enlist in the regular Armed Forces, they are granted &#8220;exempt from immigration control&#8221; status for the duration of their service to allow them to come and go without restriction. They are therefore free from any requirements to make visa applications or pay fees while they serve, unlike almost every other category of migrant coming to work in the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"c1964.1\/7\">Those who have served at least four years or been medically discharged as a result of their service can choose to settle in the UK after their service and pay the relevant fee. The time before discharge that such  settlement applications may be submitted was extended this year from 10 to 18 weeks, providing ample time to plan and make the application. Those applying for themselves do not have to meet an income requirement, be sponsored by an employer or meet any requirements regarding skills, knowledge of the English language or knowledge of life in the UK, again putting them in a favourable position compared to other migrants wishing to settle here. I stress that this a personal choice. We should bear in mind that not all countries allow dual citizenship. Indeed, not all Commonwealth citizens who are members of our Armed Forces choose to take up this option.<\/p><p pid=\"c1964.1\/8\">Of course, we recognise that settlement fees may place a financial burden on non-UK serving personnel wishing to remain in the UK after their discharge and the strength of feeling from parliamentarians, service charities and the public about this issue is very strong. That is why the Ministry of Defence, together with the Home Office, ran a public consultation between <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-05-26\">26 May<\/phrase> and <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2022-07-07\">7 July<\/phrase> 2021 on a policy proposal to waive settlement fees for non-UK service personnel in HM Armed Forces. The results of the consultation have been analysed and, once collective agreement has been secured for a final policy, the Government will publish their response and make any associated changes to fees through fees regulations at the earliest opportunity. I know those are warm words, but I am also aware of the strength of feeling in this House and the other place, so noble Lords should draw the appropriate conclusion as to what &#8220;earliest opportunity&#8221; means in practice. We are also exploring what options there are to assist non-UK veterans of HM Armed Forces who do not have settled status in the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"c1964.1\/9\">In conclusion, I understand the strength of feeling expressed in the House in relation to this issue and I emphasise again my gratitude to all individuals who have served this country. However, as I have explained, there is an existing legal framework in place for immigration fees which already enables proper consideration to be given by government and Parliament to the full range of issues in setting those fees. The issue raised by this amendment is already subject to a review, which is entering its final stages.<\/p><p pid=\"c1964.1\/10\">To answer the question from the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, about how much it would cost, the best we can do is about &#163;210,000 a year. There are other issues to be considered as well, which centre on things such as recruitment and retention. Those are part of the reason why the consultation has not yet been completely closed off. To give some more detail about the consultation, 6,398 responses were received and the results have been used to advise Ministers.

That was a lovely finish to the speech by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Owen Thompson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25278\">the hon. Member for Midlothian (Owen Thompson)<\/phrase>, and I am sure we could all practise our Mandarin.<\/p><p pid=\"b1148.0\/2\">A big thank you&#8212;a big xi&#232;xie&#8212;to <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Alicia Kearns\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25906\">the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alicia Kearns)<\/phrase> for, once again, securing an excellent Thursday debate that shows the importance of our Parliament to the Taiwanese Parliament and the Taiwanese people by putting on record our friendship. Our voices come from different political parties, but we are saying broadly the same thing about the importance of the deep and rich friendship between the UK and Taiwan.<\/p><p pid=\"b1148.0\/3\">Although the UK has no formal diplomatic relationship with Taiwan, we can be proud of the people-to-people relationships, of which we have heard, from people&#8217;s different trips according to different themes. Those relationships will transcend politics and diplomacy. We have heard that British and Taiwanese students engage in fruitful and mutually beneficial exchange programmes. As my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Stephen Kinnock\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25297\">the Member for Aberavon (Stephen Kinnock)<\/phrase> said, our businesses work closely to invest in the technologies of the future. Our doctors and scientists co-operate on how to learn and treat illnesses such as covid, which Taiwan has done so well to handle without the level of death and disruption experienced by so many other countries across the globe.<\/p><p pid=\"b1148.0\/4\">On a broader level, we can say with some confidence that Taiwan is a beacon of liberty in the Asia-Pacific. It was the first Asian country to recognise same-sex marriage. It is a vibrant and functioning multi-party liberal democracy with a booming tech sector and a free press. It is a recognised global leader in health and education. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Bob Neill\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/13736\">The hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Sir Robert Neill)<\/phrase> gave us an important lesson in the progress that has been made from the days of the Kuomintang all the way through to today and the exchange that we can now have on the legal practices in the UK and in Taiwan. We also think about the sadness that we all share that, unfortunately, things could be going in reverse in Hong Kong, which is usually such a beacon of legal practice.<\/p><p pid=\"b1148.0\/5\">There are, however, clear and present challenges facing the people of Taiwan. The Chinese Government have made no attempt to disguise their willingness to use force to occupy Taipei if their persuasion on reunification fails. It is crucial that we use opportunities such as today to underline our resolve to stand with the people of Taiwan in the face of threats to their liberty and way of life, and to put on record our concern regarding the increase in military activity around the waters of Taiwan. We in this House should say with one voice that Taiwan&#8217;s future should never be settled by force or coercion.<\/p><p pid=\"b1148.0\/6\">Members from across the House have given examples of their connections with Taiwan and their friendships, including my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Virendra Sharma\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/13934\">the Member for Ealing, Southall (Mr Sharma)<\/phrase>. I know that the Minister will want to respond in some depth to what has been raised. In particular, will she respond to the points that were made eloquently by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Thomas Tugendhat\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25374\">the hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Tom Tugendhat)<\/phrase> about the lack of an overarching strategy for the region? That is really what he was laying out, including the way in which this relates not just to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office,  but goes across education, business and investment and the trade piece, so that we can have a genuinely cohesive strategy in future.<\/p><p pid=\"b1148.0\/7\">I have four quick questions for the Minister. The first is on Taiwan&#8217;s membership of international organisations. We have all mentioned that because when we have a global pandemic, such as the one we have all been through, it is crucial that we can learn from one another. We would all be the first to say that this goes beyond politics or diplomacy: to save lives, we must hear about best practice. That is what we have seen in the health system and the public health approach in Taiwan because of the experience of SARS&#8212; severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8212;and other public health challenges. It is terrible that it was frozen out of the World Health Assembly and other similar international bodies. Next time it will be a different challenge, but this is my first challenge to the Minister: will she outline the UK&#8217;s position on Taiwan&#8217;s membership of the World Health Assembly and other organisations? I urge her to join our allies in pressing for Taiwan&#8217;s inclusion.<\/p><p pid=\"b1148.0\/8\">Secondly, on the intimidation and threats facing Taiwan, I welcome the Government&#8217;s commitment to standing up for our allies that have a relationship with Taiwan&#8212;Lithuania was mentioned. There is a wider issue, however, of Chinese Government aggression aimed at Taiwan and its international relationships. Will the Minister outline the UK&#8217;s continued commitment to stand by our allies and protect their trading relationships with Taiwan?<\/p><p pid=\"b1148.0\/9\">Thirdly, as I have already highlighted, there is Taiwan&#8217;s status as a thriving high-tech economy. As the hon. Member for Midlothian commented, much of this somehow links in with Scotland, which is lovely to see: we have heard a lot about whisky but there are also wind farms and other things. Will the Minister outline what steps are being taken to deepen and strengthen these mutually beneficial economic ties? I put on record our support for the Government&#8217;s continued desire to link trade with democracy and freedom, which is much more straightforward because we do not have to have difficult conversations about human rights issues.<\/p><p pid=\"b1148.0\/10\">Finally, will the Minister outline what positive steps are being taken to reaffirm and expand the welcome person-to-person links we have with Taiwan in education, science and business? For example, is the Turing scheme, the Government&#8217;s new post-Brexit education push, enjoying much linkage there? Within the strategy that the Government no doubt have, is there a link with Taiwanese universities and education, because clearly education plays a key role in reaffirming our friendship?<\/p><p pid=\"b1148.0\/11\">Today we have a strong chance to put on record that we stand in friendship with Taiwanese people. Many across the House have visited and have friends there, but even without having visited we can stand on the principle of friendship and an ongoing relationship with a fellow democracy.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a989.0\/1\">My Lords, as expectations of privacy are lower in public places than at home, overt surveillance, such as by street cameras, is generally seen as a lesser intrusion into our liberties than either covert surveillance by intelligence agencies&#8212;the subject of my 2015 report, A Question of Trust&#8212;or so-called surveillance capitalism, the monitoring and monetising of our personal data by big tech. However, that assessment has been cast into doubt by automatic facial recognition and similar technologies, which potentially enable their users to put a name to every person picked up by a camera, to track their movements and to store images of them on vast databases that can be efficiently searched using AI-driven analytics.<\/p><p pid=\"a989.0\/2\">Those databases are not all owned by the police: the company Clearview AI has taken more than 10 billion facial images from public-only web sources and boasts on its website that its database is available to US law enforcement on a commercial basis. This technology, part of the information revolution in whose early stages we now find ourselves, can now more be stopped  than, two centuries ago, could the steam engine, but, as has been said, the abuses of overt surveillance are already obvious in the streets of China and Hong Kong. To show the world that we are better, we must construct for those who wish to use these powers, as our forebears did in the Industrial Revolution, a democratic licence to operate.<\/p><p pid=\"a989.0\/3\">We start in this country with a number of advantages. We have a strong tradition of citizen engagement and, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said, a culture of policing by consent. We inherited strong data protection laws from the EU and we still have legislation that gives real protection to human rights. We even had&#8212;almost uniquely in the world&#8212;a Surveillance Camera Commissioner, Tony Porter. I pay tribute to the extraordinary work that he did, on a part-time basis and without any powers of inspection, audit or sanction, including the issue of a 70-page document with detailed recommendations for police users of this technology.<\/p><p pid=\"a989.0\/4\">I regret that the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice is, by comparison, a slim and highly general document. It is not comparable to the detailed codes of practice issued under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 and overseen by the world-leading Investigatory Powers Commissioner&#8217;s Office. The designated bodies which must have regard to it are confined to local authorities and policing bodies; they do not include, as the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said, health, education or transport providers, private operators or, indeed, the Government themselves. Consultation on the latest version made no attempt to involve the public but was limited to statutory consultees.<\/p><p pid=\"a989.0\/5\">The recent annual report of Tony Porter&#8217;s impressively qualified but thinly spread successor, the Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner, Fraser Sampson, commented that his formal suggestions for the code were largely dismissed as being &#8220;out of scope&#8221;. He added:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a989.0\/6\">&#8220;That my best endeavours to get even a sentence reminding relevant authorities of the ethical considerations were rejected on the grounds that it would be too burdensome is perhaps an indication of just how restrictive this scope&#8212;wherever it is to be found&#8212;must have been.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a989.0\/7\">I do not know whether the highly general provisions of the code will be effective to improve local policies on the ground and ensure the consistency between them that my noble and learned friend Lord Etherton and his colleagues gently pointed out was desirable in their judgment in the Bridges case. In the absence of an IPCO-style inspection regime, perhaps we never will know. I suspect that the need not to stifle innovation, advanced in the code as a justification for its brevity, is a less than adequate excuse for the failure to do more to develop the code itself against a changing legal and technological background.<\/p><p pid=\"a989.0\/8\">The words of the Motion are harsher than I would have chosen but, as the Snowden episode a few years ago showed, public trust in these increasingly intrusive technologies can be suddenly lost and requires huge effort to regain. I hope that the next revision of this code will be more energetic and ambitious than the last.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a833.3\/1\">My Lords, I would like to speak to my Amendment 41. It is a very specific amendment relating to Clause 11 as it currently stands. Before I turn to that, however, I will take up the words of my noble and learned friend Lord Brown in relation to providing a legal structure for our discussion here. The first thing, which has been emphasised by a number of noble Lords, though not all, is that Article 31 is central to the discussion. This is because it is obvious  that the Government, in relation to Clause 11 and the following clauses, are seeking to interpret and apply their view of Article 31.<\/p><p pid=\"a833.3\/2\">It has been suggested that we can ignore the convention because we must have regard to what people think today, but I am afraid that we cannot do that. We are a party to this convention: if we do not like it, the Government will have to recuse themselves from it and try to get other countries to change it. At the moment, however, the convention applies.<\/p><p pid=\"a833.3\/3\">Article 31 says that no penalty shall be imposed on account of illegal entry or presence on a refugee who satisfies three requirements. These are the three requirements set out in Clause 11. The first is that the refugee comes directly from the territory of persecution. The second is that the refugee presents themselves without delay to the authorities. The third is that the refugee shows good cause for their illegal entry or presence. That is what Clause 11 is about. However, you cannot read Clause 11 on its own because the subsequent clauses all have some impact on it. In particular, Clause 36 is critical because it seeks to give a definition of coming directly from the territory of persecution.<\/p><p pid=\"a833.3\/4\">Noble Lords will see from what I have just described that, although Article 31 says what the Government cannot do&#8212;that is, they cannot impose a penalty if those three requirements are satisfied&#8212;it does not go on to say that, if they are not satisfied, you can have a differentiation such as that in Clause 11. That is a matter of policy, and I can certainly see the force of the argument for saying that this division that has taken place in Clause 11 is sufficiently inconsistent with the definition of a refugee to make it improper.<\/p><p pid=\"a833.3\/5\">There is a more fundamental point: Clause 36, referred to by my noble and learned friend, in seeking to define &#8220;coming directly from another country,&#8221; says that the requirement is not to be taken as satisfied if the refugee stopped in another country outside the UK, unless they can show that they could not have reasonably been expected to have sought protection under the convention in that country. There is no such qualification in Article 31, and it appears that the Government believe they can, through legislation, elaborate on the meaning of Article 31 in whatever way would best suit the current asylum policy of the day. This, I am afraid, is entirely misguided as a matter of law.<\/p><p pid=\"a833.3\/6\">As an international treaty, the convention has the same meaning for each and every member state that signed up to it. It cannot bear different meanings for each member state, according to the policy of the Government of the state for the time being. In England and Wales, the court has, pursuant to its constitutional role of interpreting legislation and written law, held that a refugee may still come directly to a member state, within the meaning of Article 31, even if the refugee passes through one or more intermediate countries, if the final destination of the refugee has always been the state in which the asylum is finally claimed and the halts in the intermediate country or countries are no more than short-term stopovers. My noble and learned friend Lord Brown referred to his judgment in the Adimi case, which decided that very point.<\/p><p pid=\"a833.3\/7\">On the global picture, to cut matters short&#8212;before I turn to the particular amendment&#8212;I am against the division, the separation, between group 1 and group 2 in Clause 11 because it depends on a requirement, or the failure to meet a requirement, which is directly contrary to the convention. Therefore, I certainly object to the division between group 1 and group 2 so long as Clause 36 stays in its present form, with its present definition of coming &#8220;directly&#8221;, on both logical and legal grounds&#8212;quite apart from the matter of general principle, which other noble Lords have mentioned, about the demeaning nature of distinguishing between two different categories.<\/p><p pid=\"a833.3\/8\">On another requirement, that of presenting directly to the authorities, I think the right reverend Prelate already referred to the fact that in many of these cases&#8212;for example, wives who have fled from abusive marriages in a conservative religious country such as Pakistan&#8212;people have to flee in a clandestine way. That was the word used before. The idea that they can present themselves straightaway&#8212;for example, to a male representative of authority&#8212;and describe their situation seems unrealistic in many of these cases. Yes, it is true that we welcome large numbers of people under resettlement schemes&#8212;Afghanistan and Hong Kong are examples of those&#8212;but when we are talking about these other refugees, whom I would describe as the genuine refugees seeking one by one to escape from persecution, it seems to me that Clauses 11 and 36 as currently worded are inconsistent with the convention. For that reason, like my noble and learned friend Lord Brown, I would object to them.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a808.0\/1\">I thank all noble Lords who participated in this wide-ranging and powerful debate. We did perhaps stray slightly off the subject of the amendments, and some of the debate has bled into the next group and was, I suppose, more philosophical, about the Bill in general. I will confine my remarks to the amendments, if I may, because I know that many of the matters debated will come up again&#8212;not in their &#8220;proper place&#8221;, because that would be to demean the arguments, but in their more appropriate context.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/2\">I will begin with Amendment 36, a new clause proposed to be inserted before Clause 11 on the issue of smuggling, from the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Paddick. I will then address the amendment put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, on advertising illegal routes to the UK. As I said, I thank all noble Lords for their contributions.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/3\">The UK takes smuggling and illegal migration extremely seriously. We are absolutely committed to tackling organised immigration crime, or OIC, in all its forms. We work closely with near-neighbour countries such as France, Belgium and the Netherlands, and key international partners beyond Europe to address this exploitative crime and tackle smuggling networks. To tackle this threat, we have in place a multi-agency OIC taskforce which brings together law enforcement, border guards, immigration officials and prosecutors to tackle organised crime groups involved in people smuggling. This taskforce is currently working with partners in some 17 source and transit countries.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/4\">In addition, there are already agreements in place to tackle smuggling and illegal migration. For example, in November 2021 the Prime Minister signed an agreement with Belgium reaffirming the two countries&#8217; close partnership and commitment to tackling shared threats such as serious and organised crime, including human smuggling. The two countries are committed to strengthening the legal framework for co-operation between our law enforcement agendas with a co-operation agreement and a focus on information exchange. The UK is committed to working with France to maintain the security of our shared border and to tackle illegal migration. This relationship is long-standing, supported by the Sandhurst Treaty.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/5\">Most recently, in 2021 a bilateral arrangement was reached between the UK and France. The UK pledged to make a further financial investment of approximately &#163;54 million in 2021-22. Last year&#8217;s investment saw the French doubling the numbers of officers patrolling beaches.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/6\">Addressing the organised crime groups that facilitate illegal migration to the UK remains a UK priority. In July 2020, the Home Secretary and the French Minister of the Interior signed an agreement to create a joint intelligence cell to crack down on people-smuggling gangs. In 2021, over 23,000 crossing attempts were prevented by French law enforcement, to which the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, referred. Since the UK-France JIC was established, along with France we have dismantled 17 small-boat organised criminal groups and secured over 400 arrests.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/7\">I stress that the UK has a strong stance on smuggling and illegal migration and has agreements in place with near neighbours to reflect this. This amendment will  not be helpful in the Government&#8217;s continued efforts to tackle these crimes. It may hinder the fruitful and open dialogue on these issues between the UK and its international partners, many of which would not agree to their discussions and domestic activity aimed at reducing people smuggling to be published to a domestic UK audience.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/8\">I cannot support Amendment 36 because it is not appropriate to provide a running commentary on the actions that are being taken to tackle people smugglers, much of which will be sensitive activity, particularly from an operational point of view, and based on intelligence sharing with the aim of protecting vulnerable people.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/9\">If I may be permitted a personal anecdote, I have some experience in operational sensitivities. When I served in the Royal Hong Kong Police Force, I spent much of my time on the border and was heavily involved in matters of migration. Some of it was profoundly harrowing, particularly the Vietnamese boat people, who were helped by Hong Kong and the Royal Hong Kong Police Force, but much of it was organised by criminal gangs. This was not a multinational but a multi-agency approach. However, the principles remain the same. If the smugglers, who in colloquial Cantonese were known as snakeheads, got wind of our countermeasures, they changed their methods, and changed them very quickly. Unfortunately, these people may be evil and prey on others&#8217; vulnerability but they are not stupid.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/10\">During the debate we discussed safe and legal routes, and my noble friend the Minister sent a letter to the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, outlining some of them recently. If more detail is required, we will write again. Without going into all the detail, I shall highlight the headlines of the various safe and legal routes that are available. It is slightly off-topic but, given the tone of the debate, it is worth doing.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/11\">Obviously, there is a UK resettlement scheme, which commenced in February 2021 and prioritises the resettlement of refugees. There is a community sponsorship scheme and a mandate resettlement scheme. There is a refugee family reunion scheme, which many noble Lords referred to. The Bill does not cut down on family reunion. On the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, we have granted over 39,000 refugee family reunion visas since 2015. There is the well-known Afghan citizens&#8217; resettlement scheme, the Afghan relocations and assistance policy and the immigration route for British national overseas status holders from Hong Kong. As I said, that is slightly off-topic with regard to these amendments, but I hope that noble Lords appreciate that brief digression.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/12\">Turning to Amendment 129, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, for raising this important topic. We agree unreservedly with the need to target those who assist unlawful immigration to the UK. It is imperative that we take action to prevent and prosecute people smuggling. We are taking steps to combat illegal migration and the activities associated with people smuggling by increasing the maximum penalty for facilitation from 14 years&#8217; imprisonment to life imprisonment. This aligns with the maximum penalty for human trafficking as contained in the Modern  Slavery Act. By doing so, we are emphasising to the courts the gravity with which the most serious offenders should be treated.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/13\">We have also turned our attention to Section 25A of the Immigration Act 1971. Currently, Section 25A relates to helping the arrival or entry for gain&#8212;I stress that&#8212;of an asylum seeker into the UK. Clause 40 removes the current requirement for the facilitation to be &#8220;for gain&#8221;. Removing the &#8220;for gain&#8221; element from Section 25A will allow for successful prosecution of those facilitating the arrival or entry into the UK of asylum seekers where the &#8220;for gain&#8221; element cannot be proven beyond reasonable doubt.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/14\">To be absolutely clear, the focus of Clause 40 is on criminals who act to exploit and endanger people. We have made it clear that persons do not commit an offence of facilitation if the act is done by, on behalf of, or co-ordinated by, Her Majesty&#8217;s coastguard or overseas equivalent. This provides protection not only for organisations such as the RNLI, but for individual seafarers who respond to mayday relays.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/15\">Separately, we have also provided defences for persons who show that they had to assist an individual in danger or distress at sea between the time that the individual was first in danger and being delivered to a place of safety on land. There is a defence for masters of vessels bringing stowaways into the UK, if they discover them on board after the ship has left port and reported it to immigration authorities. Finally, there is a defence for ship crew members or passengers who provide humanitarian assistance to the stowaway, as long as the presence of the stowaway is reported. This means that seafarers will be protected if they are unable to contact the coastguard for a good reason.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/16\">These defences mean that it is extremely unlikely for someone to be charged unless the authorities have concrete evidence to the contrary, such as intelligence suggesting that they are linked to people-smuggling gangs or where the same person launches multiple rescues over several days and has no good reason for being at that location.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/17\">As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, suggested, the conduct which the offence outlined in the amendment seeks to capture may already amount to an offence under Section 25 of the Immigration Act 1971. Section 25 deals with facilitation of a breach of immigration law which may include behaviour linked to<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a808.0\/18\">&#8220;recruiting, transporting, transferring, harbouring or receiving or exchanging control over another person.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/19\">Section 25(4) already provides that the offence applies to things done whether inside or outside the United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/20\">In addition to this provision, we also have the benefit of Section 44 of the Serious Crime Act 2007. It is already an offence intentionally to encourage or assist another person to commit an offence, including pursuant to Section 25 of the 1971 Act.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/21\">Whether placing an advert would be captured by these provisions would depend on the exact circumstances of the case, including the precise wording of the advert. The overlap with existing statutory provisions would need to be carefully considered to see what value&#8212;if any&#8212;an additional offence would add.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/22\">There are complications around prosecutions in this area more generally. A key issue is the difficulty in identifying the defendant and the added complexity of the extra-jurisdictional nature of the problem.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/23\">In addition to the legislative measures I have already mentioned, we continue to work with partner agencies to combat illegal migration. We liaise with the French authorities and provide financial resources to aid and boost their operations. All this needs to be seen in the context of other liaison&#8212;for instance, the online safety Bill, led by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. The online safety Bill will consider user-generated content and focus on examining the harms associated with paid-for online advertising and the role of platforms in disseminating harmful advertising content. I hope this will please the noble Lord, Lord Coaker&#8212;he is quite right.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/24\">In addition, DCMS is seeking to introduce online advertising programmes which aim to reduce harms for consumers, businesses and society as a whole. The programmes will review illegal, as well as legal but harmful, content and the placement of advertising online across all actors involved. Consultation will be launched shortly, inviting views on how the Government might best build on the regulatory framework to improve transparency and accountability in the system, with the goal of reducing harm.<\/p><p pid=\"a808.0\/25\">To reiterate, we do not agree with the broad intent behind the proposed new clause, which is to prevent and prosecute people smuggling. Resistance to the amendment is based on the effectiveness of the offence in achieving our common aim of targeting those who assist unlawful immigration to the UK. For these reasons, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.<\/p>",

I want to speak to the amendments in my name in this group. I look forward to hearing the thrust of Amendment 13 from the noble Baroness, Lady Lister. At the outset, I declare that my mother was a naturalised Brit through marriage, under an earlier incarnation of this Act. I am also a non-practising member of the Faculty of Advocates.<\/p><p pid=\"b458.4\/2\">I shall move Amendment 3 and speak to Amendments 4, 5, 6, 7, 18 and 22. I am enormously grateful to Michael Clancy of the Law Society of Scotland for his expertise and briefing in preparing these amendments, which concern the fees to be charged under Clauses 1, 2, 3 and 7 of the Bill. The amendments are the work of the Law Society of Scotland, and in particular I pay tribute to its immigration and asylum sub-committee, which has considered this part of the Bill in some detail.<\/p><p pid=\"b458.4\/3\">The Law Society of Scotland states that it agrees with Clause 1, subject to the registration process being free. There is no clarity around that in Clauses 1, 2, 3 and 7. This is a cause of concern and which is why I have tabled these amendments. In this connection, the  Law Society acknowledges and agrees with the 2020 report by British Future, Barriers to Britishness. At pages 10 and 11, it recommends:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b458.4\/4\">&#8220;Citizenship by registration should be free for those who become British by this route. This group mostly comprises children and those with subsidiary categories of British nationality, such as British Overseas Territories Citizens and British National (Overseas) passport holders from Hong Kong who now have a route to citizenship through the bespoke British National (Overseas) visa.<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b458.4\/5\">Nationality law should be amended to allow children born in the UK to be British citizens automatically, restoring a policy that applied before 1983.<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b458.4\/6\">Vulnerable groups of people should be encouraged to take legal advice, which should be affordable and widely available in all parts of the UK.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b458.4\/7\">The Law Society looked particularly at the case of PRCBC and O v Secretary of State for the Home Department&#8212;reported in &#8220;[2021] EWCA Civ 193&#8221;&#8212;where the Court of Appeal held that the fee of &#163;1,012 for certain applications by children to register was unlawfully high. An appeal to the United Kingdom Supreme Court has recently been heard. We await the decision in due course.<\/p><p pid=\"b458.4\/8\">I also want to refer to the extremely helpful report from the Constitution Committee of this House about the Bill. Paragraph 16 concludes:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b458.4\/9\">&#8220;The Government should clarify its intentions on the amount of fees to be charged under Clauses 1, 2, 3 and 7.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b458.4\/10\">The committee sought clarity as to what fees will be charged for registration applications under this clause and under similar provisions in Clauses 2, 3 and 7, referred to earlier. The committee also referred to the forthcoming appeal decision of the Supreme Court.<\/p><p pid=\"b458.4\/11\">I urge my noble friend, when summing up on this little group of amendments, to come forward and say whether fees are going to be applied and at what level they will be set. It is inappropriate to discuss the Bill at this stage and not to have any idea as to what fees will be charged during the process. With those few remarks, I beg to move.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1039.0\/1\">I start by declaring my interests. Much of my previous career was spent in the cyber-security industry, and in the four years before being elected to Parliament, I led commercial strategy and public policy for BT&#8217;s cyber-security team. BT was one of the companies that helped to design the Secure by Design code of practice, some of which we are putting into law through the Bill. Also, I have recently undertaken cyber-security work for MHR, which is set out in my entry in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests, although the company does not produce consumer devices, connected or otherwise.<\/p><p pid=\"b1039.0\/2\">In some ways, cyber-security was good preparation for politics&#8212;for example, waking up to nightmare headlines such as,<\/p><p pid=\"b1039.0\/3\">&#8220;Attack of the refrigerators! The cyber-threats lurking in your home&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b1039.0\/4\">and<\/p><p pid=\"b1039.0\/5\">&#8220;Is your smart TV too wise? The FBI warns your screen is watching you&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b1039.0\/6\">and<\/p><p pid=\"b1039.0\/7\">&#8220;HACKED IN THE HOME: Your entire home could be HACKED with these simple mistakes, cyber-experts warn&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b1039.0\/8\">Perhaps the most disturbing one I have seen is:<\/p><p pid=\"b1039.0\/9\">&#8220;Hacker who stole nude self-portraits of George W. Bush jailed for four years&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b1039.0\/10\">I am all for being tough on crime, but surely in that case the perpetrator had already suffered enough.<\/p><p pid=\"b1039.0\/11\">Alarmist headlines aside, the Bill is very much needed to protect our constituents. The average UK household has nine connected devices, and the security on most of them will be poor. Information about how secure the devices are, or how long they will receive security updates  for, is unlikely to have been provided when they were sold. What are the risks? There is a huge impact on our constituents&#8217; privacy. Your TV really could be watching you. Two years ago, footage stolen by hackers from home security cameras in Hong Kong was sold to pornographic websites&#8212;a huge invasion of people&#8217;s intimate private moments. There are numerous reports of baby monitors being hacked by paedophiles.<\/p><p pid=\"b1039.0\/12\">There is also the danger of hackers using a fairly innocuous connected device as a gateway to jump to other devices and steal valuable information. An infamous example from the business world is the attack in 2013 on Target, one of the top five retailers in the US. Criminals gained access to its network through a supplier connected to an external vendor portal. They then stole the details of 40 million customer credit and debit cards. The supplier just provided air-conditioning. The total cost of the cyber-attack was more than $200 million. That is one hell of an expensive air-conditioning bill. There was also an attack on a casino, where hackers gained entry to the network through the thermometer of a fish tank.<\/p><p pid=\"b1039.0\/13\">Once they have a foothold in the home, hackers can access other devices that are not properly secured. There is a real danger that sensitive information relating to a constituent&#8217;s health or their financial information could be compromised, but how common is that really? Is it just a case of a few alarmist headlines? The consumer watchdog Which? ran an interesting experiment last year. It set up a smart home with a range of consumer devices, from kettles to thermostats, televisions and security devices, all connected to the internet. It experienced 12,000 hacking or scanning attempts in a week. At one stage, it experienced up to 14 hacking attempts an hour. We have a problem, therefore, but not a problem of which many people are aware. A recent report that surveyed 2,000 UK consumers found that people were largely unaware of the risks. Some 48% of respondents were not aware that hackers could hijack their connected devices.<\/p><p pid=\"b1039.0\/14\">Unsecured consumer devices are also a real risk to our digital infrastructure. Hackers who control connected devices can harness their collective power into a botnet&#8212;a network of devices that can be used to launch denial of service attacks on our digital infrastructure. The Secretary of State referred earlier to the Mirai botnet. What is interesting is that it is thought to be the first botnet to harness the power of insecure consumer devices or the internet of things. At its peak, it had about 600,000 devices&#8212;baby monitors, radios, cameras&#8212;at its beck and call. You and I would not necessarily have noticed it, Mr Deputy Speaker, until the day it launched an attack on the domain name service provider Dyn in 2016. In doing so, it took out Netflix, PayPal, Amazon, Visa, Reddit and Airbnb for the best part of a day.<\/p><p pid=\"b1039.0\/15\">Contrary to some of the claims we have heard from those on the Opposition Benches, the UK has always been a world-leading cyber-power. Back in 2011, we were one of the first countries in the world to publish a cyber-security strategy. It recognised the risks and opportunities that cyber-security brought to nation state relationships, critical infrastructure, business, consumers and society as a whole. We have always been out in front when it comes to protecting people, businesses and critical infrastructure.<\/p><p pid=\"b1039.0\/16\">In the 2016 refresh of the national cyber-security strategy, the Government moved from relying on a market-based approach to protect consumers, to a more active role through the UK&#8217;s active cyber defence programme, which makes the infrastructure of the UK&#8217;s internet more difficult for cyber-criminals to exploit. It does that through measures such as improving the security of internet protocols&#8212;the method by which data is sent from one computer to another&#8212;and domain name system filtering that blocks access to sites known to host malware, such as phishing sites. The 2016 strategy also committed to publishing guidance on how to improve the default security of consumer products. There are three measures on that in the Bill. As we know, it forms the basis of similar codes used in India and Australia, but it also forms the basis of the first global technical standard for consumer cyber-security products. So far from being behind, the UK is the leading country in the world on this issue.<\/p><p pid=\"b1039.0\/17\">As has been set out, the three measures put forward are: banning default passwords; implementing a vulnerability reporting scheme; and informing consumers how long a product will receive security updates for at the point of sale. They are really necessary because, I am sorry to say, we have not seen the response from industry that we should have. Too many manufacturers are still not taking responsibility for ensuring their products have the basic security that our constituents need. Too many still shunt their security responsibilities on to the users of their products.<\/p><p pid=\"b1039.0\/18\">We need to call time on this. The digital economy is growing and holds huge opportunities, but those who benefit from its growth should also be investing in the safety and security of its users. We are still, in my view, only on the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution, the fusing of our digital and physical worlds. Cyber-security needs to be a part of that revolution to ensure that the inevitable risks are outweighed by the opportunities.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b598.0\/1\">I begin by congratulating my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"David Davis\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10162\">the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis)<\/phrase> and <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Liam Byrne\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11360\">the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Liam Byrne)<\/phrase> on securing this important debate, and the Backbench Business Committee on raising the profile of this important subject.<\/p><p pid=\"b598.0\/2\">I will make two points about the sub judice ruling. First, as the Minister for the courts in the Ministry of Justice, I would not want to comment on any live or recent cases, for obvious reasons, including the case of <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Apsana Begum\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25914\">the hon. Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Apsana Begum)<\/phrase>, although like the SNP Front-Bench spokesperson, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Richard Thomson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25919\">the hon. Member for Gordon (Richard Thomson)<\/phrase>, I pay tribute to her bravery and courage in talking as she did on her experience of domestic abuse. The other point concerns the 17th century, where the shadow spokesman, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Andrew Slaughter\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11559\">the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Andy Slaughter)<\/phrase>, lingered briefly. My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Aaron Bell\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25916\">the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Aaron Bell)<\/phrase> made the point that we are all incredibly privileged, under article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689, to have the right to stand up in this House under parliamentary privilege, knowing that we cannot be taken to court for what is said. That means we all enjoy the freedom to speak out without fear of those powers and those rich people we have been talking about. It is important that we have been able to put that on the record. It shows Parliament at its best when we have these sorts of debates, with colleagues showing what I think is consensus on these matters and speaking with great passion. I pay tribute to all the speeches we have heard.<\/p><p pid=\"b598.0\/3\">Let me set out our position. All of us can be proud of the respect that the UK judiciary and legal profession attract around the globe. One of this country&#8217;s great exports is the common law system and rule of law principles which are fundamental aspects of our constitutional arrangement. My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Bob Seely\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25645\">the Member for Isle of Wight (Bob Seely)<\/phrase> spoke about the value of legal services and he is absolutely right. In 2019, the sector contributed over &#163;29.6 billion gross value added to the economy and generated revenue of over &#163;36 billion&#8212;that is many jobs in our constituencies.<\/p><p pid=\"b598.0\/4\">Transparency and integrity are key to the proper functioning of the courts and to the law. Those values underpin public scrutiny of the powerful and maintain  confidence in our laws. Let me be clear: today&#8217;s speakers are right to highlight the rare instances where the law is being weaponised as lawfare. SLAPPs represent an abuse of the legal system&#8212;let me be clear about that&#8212;as they rely upon threatening tactics to silence free speech advocates who act in the public interest. Public participation enriches all our lives and our democracy.<\/p><p pid=\"b598.0\/5\">Having said that, I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden, who, towards the end of his speech, spoke about the question of balance. We do have to approach this in a balanced way. We must be cautious to respond to SLAPPs in a proportionate way that continues our tradition of balancing individual rights with the public good.<\/p><p pid=\"b598.0\/6\">Let me talk about actions we have taken and are taking at home and abroad in this area. I want to reassure the House of the Government&#8217;s commitment to act whenever the rule of law is under attack. We acted decisively in 2013 to introduce reforms to the Defamation Act 2013 to curb the practice of what is called libel tourism, which had allowed a number of overseas claimants to use our courts to challenge publications with small circulations in this country. A number of colleagues, including the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill, spoke about how England and London in particular had become a centre for international libel, but under section 9 of the Act the courts must now be satisfied that England and Wales is the most appropriate jurisdiction in which to hear a claim. The courts have robustly interpreted this test, notably in the Court of Appeal case of Wright v. Ver. While these reforms have succeeded in tempering international libel litigation in the UK, we are now exploring further whether further reform may be necessary when litigation targets public participation specifically.<\/p><p pid=\"b598.0\/7\">I note that, according to the most recent Royal Courts of Justice statistics, defamation cases in the High Court in 2020 were in line with the average number for the past decade, at 152. That suggests we must not be premature in launching a response to SLAPPs but instead grow our evidence base through careful monitoring, as Lord Wolfson, my ministerial colleague in the Ministry of Justice, undertook to do in the House of Lords last June.<\/p><p pid=\"b598.0\/8\">I want to commend the UK Anti-SLAPP Coalition for its support and advocacy in this field. Ministry of Justice officials are monitoring anti-SLAPP efforts in neighbouring nations. This is a fast-evolving jurisdiction which none the less warrants a considered response.<\/p><p pid=\"b598.0\/9\">Open justice and free speech must be a core feature of any democracy. The Ministry of Justice recently launched the Bill of Rights consultation with an explicit aim to strengthen protection of the key British value of free speech. Our proposals intend to provide statutory guidance to the courts on the utmost importance attached to the right to freedom of expression. This is particularly important when considering whether an interference with the right to freedom of expression is proportionate<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b598.0\/10\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b598.0\/11\">or when set against the wider public interest.<\/p><p pid=\"b598.0\/12\">The right to freedom of expression is protected by article 10 of the European convention on human rights, which is given effect in domestic courts by the Human  Rights Act 1998. We are signatories to the ECHR and I can assure colleagues we will remain so. Our proposals for a Bill of Rights will go even further to promote this country&#8217;s proud tradition of freedom and reinforce the democratic prerogatives of elected Members in this House over the legislative process in respect of the expansion of human rights.<\/p><p pid=\"b598.0\/13\">It must be said that free expression is not an absolute right. There is a delicate interplay involving the need to protect security, the right to a private life, keeping citizens safe and taking steps to protect against harm to individuals. Our ongoing human rights consultation closes in March 2022, after which we will set out detailed plans to reinforce our great tradition of free speech.<\/p><p pid=\"b598.0\/14\">A number of colleagues spoke about investigative journalism. We recognise that it plays an important part in keeping us all informed and promoting accountability where there is wrongdoing. Officials from my Department are monitoring threats against journalists in the form of SLAPPs, working closely with civil society stakeholders who tirelessly support journalists under threat to understand the immense financial and psychological burden that a few have endured when faced with these actions. Where journalists face physical threats, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport&#8217;s national action plan for the safety of journalists exists to support their security and wellbeing.<\/p><p pid=\"b598.0\/15\">We are not alone in combating SLAPPs. The Ministry of Justice is collaborating with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office to ensure a united stance on international engagement and media freedom around the world. I am pleased to announce that the UK will be a member of the Council of Europe&#8217;s inaugural working group on SLAPPs thanks to our diplomatic collaboration. The working group is comprised of experts in law and media policy who will begin working this year on an anti-SLAPP draft recommendation for member states due in December 2023.<\/p><p pid=\"b598.0\/16\">We have also met the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe&#8217;s representative on freedom of the media&#8217;s team to discuss common objectives in addressing SLAPPs. Meanwhile, the Media Freedom Coalition has continued to expand since its foundation in 2019 and consists of 50 members who have pledged to improve media freedom at home and abroad. It has also issued 20 statements on the deteriorating situations for media freedom concerns in various countries, including Yemen, the Philippines, Belarus, Egypt, China, Hong Kong, Myanmar and Russia.<\/p><p pid=\"b598.0\/17\">The Government recognise that global media freedom increases security and prosperity for all, which is why that was a cornerstone of our G7 presidency. Misinformation can undermine public order and even health, particularly during the covid-19 pandemic. To that end, the UK has supported UNESCO&#8217;s global media defence fund by committing &#163;3 million over five years and encouraging contributions from others.<\/p><p pid=\"b598.0\/18\">Further, the UK has provided more than &#163;400 million in official development assistance to the media and free flow of information in the past five years. We are consistently in the top five aid donors to the media sector globally. I recognise the strength of feeling in the House today, given the importance of the principles at play. In the light of the evidence provided in today&#8217;s debate, I will be giving SLAPPs in UK courts urgent consideration.<\/p>",

Members across the House have been very clear from the outset that we stand with the Chinese people, and it is with systematic abuse that we have an issue.<\/p><p pid=\"b558.0\/2\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Nusrat Ghani\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25354\">The hon. Member for Wealden (Ms Ghani)<\/phrase> has surpassed herself in her speech today, underlining her empathy particularly for women but for all those affected by the regime in the Xinjiang region. Her leadership on this question is unparalleled. I am so sorry that the wrong diplomatic move was taken to sanction her, but I know that, in a funny way, it has emboldened her and all those others who have experienced that same sanction.<\/p><p pid=\"b558.0\/3\">Debates such as this bring out the best about our Parliament because this is where we have so much cross-party agreement and where we, as a Parliament, can inform the direction of the UK&#8217;s foreign policy. We know that, in a week&#8217;s time, we will be talking about Holocaust Memorial Day, with which there are so many strong parallels. I know that the Minister has an eye to that awful but important and crucial commemoration next week, where we will talk about those in our communities who are still so affected by that dreadful holocaust from 1939 to 1944.<\/p><p pid=\"b558.0\/4\">As we know, there is an extensive and growing body of evidence of the systematic persecution of the Uyghur minority, including detailed reports of more than 1 million people subject to arbitrary detention; forced labour; the enforced separation of children from parents; denial of the right to practise religion or speak one&#8217;s own language; and the rape, torture and forced sterilisation of women. That has all been laid out so clearly by the tribunal. I know that the Minister has a copy of the tribunal findings and I am sure that she has read that. We know also that the Uyghur people in Xinjiang province in north-west China have suffered enormously. The question is now, what will we do about it? We know that the tribunal itself is<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b558.0\/5\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the People&#8217;s Republic of China, by the imposition of measures to prevent births intended to destroy a significant part of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang as such, has committed genocide&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"b558.0\/6\">Today&#8217;s debate follows our vote in this Parliament in April 2021, ably contributed to by my predecessor, my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Stephen Kinnock\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25297\">the Member for Aberavon (Stephen Kinnock)<\/phrase>, who spoke so eloquently today about the need for the Government to have an overarching China strategy and to implement it as soon as possible. In that vote in this House, which was supported across the House, we  recognised the plight of the Uyghur people and we called on the Government to take urgent steps in response. This does feel a bit as though we have raised this before and we are challenging the Government again over what practical action they will take. Will they inject some urgency into their response?<\/p><p pid=\"b558.0\/7\">Many of us are disappointed that the Government rejected the excellent recommendations of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee last summer. When I visited Primark in my constituency, I was pleased to see that, since the report, it had begun to make different decisions relating to its supply chains, and I know that Marks and Spencer has as well. If the private sector has already begun to make those changes, there is no excuse for the Government not to look at their own record on the matter.<\/p><p pid=\"b558.0\/8\">The Government also failed to incorporate the concerns of both Houses when we discussed what we called then the genocide amendment. I hope that the Minister will speak to that and tell us whether she believes that the right decision was taken on that amendment to the Trade Bill. We have this new fresh evidence. If the Government assess that it is correct, will we need to review that element of the Trade Act, which of course has completed its passage here? What does the Minister make of all this fresh evidence and do we need to look at that again?<\/p><p pid=\"b558.0\/9\">I want briefly to draw out a couple of conclusions before allowing the Minister to come back because there is a lot of red meat, let us say, in this that she will want to get her teeth into. My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Siobhain McDonagh\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10381\">the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh)<\/phrase> raised a specific challenge around the pensions of members of staff in this House. Some of the pension companies may well be unwittingly supporting poor practice and human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region. What is the Minister&#8217;s response to that? My hon. Friend also raised the question of HSBC, the UK&#8217;s biggest bank.<\/p><p pid=\"b558.0\/10\">My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Afzal Khan\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25662\">the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Afzal Khan)<\/phrase> mentioned the support of the Board of Deputies of British Jews for this particular body of findings. That adds another strand of civil society support for that important work. He also mentioned that he is a great friend of Rahima Mahmut, who has gone through so much but is now the leader of the World Uyghur Congress.<\/p><p pid=\"b558.0\/11\">My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Marie Rimmer\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25321\">the Member for St Helens South and Whiston (Ms Rimmer)<\/phrase> has raised in this House on a number of occasions the issue of the harvesting of organs, but her question today was whether there has been, to use one of the descriptions, the destruction of a way of life of the Uyghur people in Xinjiang. My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Janet Daby\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25727\">the Member for Lewisham East (Janet Daby)<\/phrase> encouraged the Government to inject urgency into their work.<\/p><p pid=\"b558.0\/12\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Brendan O'Hara\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25370\">The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Brendan O'Hara)<\/phrase>, who spoke for the SNP, issued several challenges, in a similar vein to ours. The fact that so many of us are saying the same things lends weight to our arguments. First, will the Minister commit Government resources to assessing the situation in Xinjiang and undertake to look carefully at the evidence from the tribunal and to come back to this House as soon as possible to say what further action the Government need to take? Secondly, and once again as a matter of urgency, will she work  with colleagues across Government to look again at Magnitsky sanctions on any senior officials involved in abuses who have so far escaped UK sanctions so that we can come into line with the US Government sanctions and there is not a cigarette paper between us and our partners? Specifically the name Chen Quanguo appears to be coming up in a number of briefings and evidence pieces we have heard about today. What is her view of that individual?<\/p><p pid=\"b558.0\/13\">Will the Minister look at the wider issue of supply chains, as per the excellent recommendations from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, the investments of firms and state pension funds to ensure that any company with any links to the situation in Xinjiang is held to account, while boosting the legislation necessary to bring businesses into line with their moral obligations? As I mentioned earlier, in some regards, some companies are ahead of the game. How do we catch up? The Committee&#8217;s report includes a specific recommendation on the question of financial companies. What view does she take of that? What assessment has she and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office made of that?<\/p><p pid=\"b558.0\/14\">On the role of the international community, my hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon mentioned the role of the International Labour Organisation. Does she support that? We are high-profile members of the ILO and have talked in this House on a number of occasions about the conventions that have come out of the ILO. What are we doing to apply those international conventions to this situation? Will she support the call for the correct UN individuals, such as Michelle Bachelet, to lead a delegation in the Xinjiang region to check whether what we have heard in London from the tribunal is correct and therefore could inform our foreign policy on China?<\/p><p pid=\"b558.0\/15\">The brutal campaign of oppression in Xinjiang is a scar on the conscience of the world and the Labour party stands shoulder to shoulder with the Uyghur people. We want to work hand in hand with the Government and our Parliament to bring forward the urgent action that is required.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c157.0\/1\">Thank you very much for calling me to speak, Mr Bone.<\/p><p pid=\"c157.0\/2\">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Carla Lockhart\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25562\">the Member for Upper Bann (Carla Lockhart)<\/phrase> for setting the scene so well, and I thank others for their contributions. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Alistair Carmichael\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10785\">The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)<\/phrase> also hit the nail on the head, which is that small businesses will be affected. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Greg Knight\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11026\">The right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Sir Greg Knight)<\/phrase> intervened on the issue that I want to talk about on behalf of constituents who have contacted me, who are not involved in construction as such but are involved in that sector.<\/p><p pid=\"c157.0\/3\">I will give two examples of that. Just after Christmas, I wrote to the Chancellor about this very matter, which is of some importance. My constituents are clearly perplexed to find themselves in a position where the cost factor may push them to the stage where they have to make a decision about the survival of their businesses. When I make these pleas to the Minister, I do so because I hope to get a consideration or concession for one of the firms, and the other has told me clearly what its problems will be.<\/p><p pid=\"c157.0\/4\">It is great to be here to support my hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann. This issue is imperative for Northern Ireland businesses. The new legislation coming into force from April 2022 will have a significant impact on our economy&#8212;in particular on our construction industry and, as mentioned by the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire in his intervention, those involved in clearing up afterwards. There are huge concerns about this issue throughout Northern Ireland.<\/p><p pid=\"c157.0\/5\">It is great to speak on behalf of the businesses in my constituency. There are many contributing factors making the move to white diesel unsustainable at this time. First, the cost is a primary factor for most of my constituents affected by this issue. I have given two examples, but it will actually affect a much greater number. It is like a stone hitting the water; the ripples go out well beyond that. We will feel the impact in many sectors.<\/p><p pid=\"c157.0\/6\">Construction businesses across Northern Ireland have stated that, unfortunately, the added cost will be passed on to the customer&#8212;in some cases, that means the UK Government, who own and operate some forms of construction work. According to the Civil Engineering Contractors Association, losing the red diesel rebate would cost the UK construction industry between &#163;280 million and &#163;490 million a year. As my hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann said, in Northern Ireland alone the additional cost will be between &#163;20 million and &#163;25 million.<\/p><p pid=\"c157.0\/7\">I recently visited Conexpo, a family business based in my constituency in Northern Ireland. The right hon. Member for East Yorkshire mentioned quarries in his intervention&#8212;Conexpo has three, located in Ballygowan, Carryduff and Ballynahinch, all of which are in my constituency of Strangford. Conexpo produces highly polished stone value aggregates for export markets. Every one of the roads around London is built on stone from the quarries in my constituency; the same stone from Northern Ireland is used in Hong Kong. Conexpo is a lucrative business, because people very much want to have that stone. However, at the same time, there is a cost factor.<\/p><p pid=\"c157.0\/8\">Conexpo has raised some important points explaining why the current policy on red diesel is not sustainable. My hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann spoke about phasing in the policy in order to give businesses time to come up with new ideas and innovation. However, for Conexpo, there is no alternative. There are no hydrogen lorries sitting by to take over because they have not been perfected yet. Conexpo has worked extremely hard to reduce its carbon footprint, and it has succeeding in doing that. It is probably doing more for its carbon footprint than most people. Unfortunately, there are currently no alternatives to diesel engines to power the machines it requires. It is a big business&#8212;stone goes from its three quarries to Belfast harbour and then across the world.<\/p><p pid=\"c157.0\/9\">Conexpo stated that it<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c157.0\/10\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;would welcome some clarity to the practical issues of how the red diesel rebate removal will happen. We believe it would be vitally important to retain the utilization of red diesel and a phased increase of the duty levied by HMRC would be charged by the fuel supplier.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c157.0\/11\">Another example is Cooke Brothers, which is run and owned by Ken Cooke in Newtownards. He has also voiced concerns on the red diesel rebate. He has stated that the Government must provide more clarity in regard to red diesel for generators. His engineering business does instrumental work for shipyards and sewerage works. The lack of information around generators is causing major anxiety for construction businesses.<\/p><p pid=\"c157.0\/12\">Can the Minister say if there could be an exemption or some help for the people who depend on generators? Red diesel is important first for lorry movements and secondly for the generators used in engineering.<\/p><p pid=\"c157.0\/13\">The legislation will cost the average business an extra &#163;50,000 a year. It will also potentially mean that jobs are on the line. The Government have a proud record of creating jobs&#8212;the unemployment rate is down to 4.5% today, which gives us an indication of their polices&#8212;but if they want to be progressive and reduce that more, we cannot lose the jobs we have. The Government must recognise that, at this moment in time, there is no suitable alternative for most users, and that discretion must be given to construction businesses that simply cannot afford this change.<\/p><p pid=\"c157.0\/14\">I will conclude within the timescale you set, Mr Bone. In my humble opinion, my constituents need help. I look to the Minister for that. Northern Irish businesses have suffered all too much in recent years, from the horrific impact of the protocol to the pandemic, and now our construction employers face extortionate costs relating to the red diesel change. I encourage the Minister to step in now and answer the questions of our constituents. Give us the help needed, give us the reassurance we  seek, give us the phasing in. There is undoubtedly confusion surrounding the new legislation. Assurances, as presented by my hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann and replicated, must be given to ensure the success of our construction businesses.<\/p>",

I understand the key issue is that he has been contacted by MI5, and is now warning Members of Parliament that an agent of the Chinese Government has been active here in Parliament&#8212;working with a Member of Parliament&#8212;obviously to subvert the processes here. As a Member of Parliament who was sanctioned by the Chinese Government, as others were, this is a matter of grave concern to me. I therefore rise to make three important points.<\/p><p pid=\"d693.1\/2\">First, will this now lead to a serious overhaul of the accreditation procedures here in the House of Commons? They are clearly too slack if these people get in, either through all-party parliamentary groups or with individuals.<\/p><p pid=\"d693.1\/3\">Is it possible that we will have a statement from Mr Speaker, from the Chair, about the risks? I am one of those who has done a lot to try to help Hong Kong Chinese who are fleeing the Communist regime. We have the names and numbers of people here in the UK, which leaves me worrying that some of them have been accessed by such an individual. That would put their lives and families at risk, and I am deeply concerned, because my activities may well have been traced, as well as those of my colleagues and friends.<\/p><p pid=\"d693.1\/4\">I understand the latest news is that this individual is not to be deported and no further action is to be taken. How can a foreign, despotic and despicable power, which is hellbent on reducing many people to penury, put somebody into this mother of Parliaments and that individual have nothing done to them other than not being allowed into Parliament? That is surely not good enough. Could there be a statement from the Government on what they plan to do and, with respect, a statement from Mr Speaker from the Chair?<\/p>",

In my brief comments, I will cover just one small matter. Before I do, I draw attention to my register of interests and the matters declared there.<\/p><p pid=\"c703.0\/2\">I want to look not at government but, as was indicated in an article in the Guardian on Monday, at the involvement of major corporations and businesses&#8212;in this case, Coca-Cola. I cited Coca-Cola as sponsor of the Beijing Games next month and asked what it is doing there. Why is it there? Should it be there? I think I am correctly interpreting the comments that I have received about my proposal that those who consume Coca-Cola&#8212;and I happen to&#8212;should not consume it  for the next two months. I am pleased that people such as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, the noble Baroness, Lady Bennett, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of St Albans have indicated that they take the same view on that intervention.<\/p><p pid=\"c703.0\/3\">Sporting events go to a particular location because they know they will get the finance. That comes, in large part, not from individuals but from sponsors. Coca-Cola is pouring tens of millions, possibly $100 million or more, into the Beijing Olympics. It therefore has questions to answer, and they have to come from the top, from Atlanta, where Coca-Cola is based. I am asking a question of what is probably the most centralised company with which I have ever worked, Coca-Cola, and of its chief executive, who happens to be a British national. Will he answer the question of what it is doing in Beijing?<\/p><p pid=\"c703.0\/4\">Last night, I went on to the web page of the Coca- Cola Company in Atlanta. It has six headings; one is &#8220;Better Shared Future&#8221;. How ironic that one of the five items it identifies is human rights. It says:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c703.0\/5\">&#8220;Respect for human rights is a fundamental value of ours.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c703.0\/6\">Tell that to the Uighurs and to the people in Hong Kong, who are losing their security on a daily, or hourly, basis. On the same page of the Coca-Cola corporation&#8217;s main website, it says:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c703.0\/7\">&#8220;Dedicated to using our voice and position to support equality, justice and universal values across various diverse groups.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c703.0\/8\">Tell that to the Uighurs and the people of Hong Kong. Mr Quincey, as chief executive of the Coca-Cola corporation, could you please explain to the public at large why those phrases are on your web page? Can you make them stand up?<\/p><p pid=\"c703.0\/9\">I ask that question of Mr Quincey, who, as I say, is a British national. He spent part of his youth at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. He was educated at King Edward&#8217;s School in Birmingham. Some time in the next two months, I would like him to provide one hour to a panel of students from Dartmouth and King Edward&#8217;s explaining what Coca-Cola is doing to protect the fundamental rights of individuals in China.<\/p><p pid=\"c703.0\/10\">In conclusion, a phrase that Coca-Cola uses is about achieving &#8220;share of throat&#8221;. The throats of the Uighurs and the residents of Hong Kong are silent. I would like Mr Quincey to explain to the students of Dartmouth and King Edward&#8217;s in Birmingham why.<\/p>",

He said on Monday  &#8212;after I landed on Tuesday I saw the message&#8212;that they are coming to the end of their fourth wave. Are we learning the lessons from South Africa, where there are three-day hospital stays for omicron versus stays of between seven and eight days for beta and delta? There is far less use of ventilators and ICUs. Are the Government aware of the report of Professor Ravi Gupta of Cambridge, as well as a report from Hong Kong, showing that omicron is not as severe because it does not affect the lungs as much? If that is the case, can we try to reduce the isolation period as much as possible using testing? Can testing be made free, right up to spring? Finally, given the good news about the MHRA approving the Pfizer antiviral, which in trials has shown an 89% reduction in hospitalisation and deaths, how soon can we get 2.5 million treatments? That will be a game-changer. Will it be before March?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c664.1\/1\">I thank the noble Baroness, and I know she would not have made that suggestion.<\/p><p pid=\"c664.1\/2\">We are talking today not about the lawful migration which has so enriched our country, but about illegal migration, which only makes it harder for us to do what we all want, which is to protect those in greatest need of our help.<\/p><p pid=\"c664.1\/3\">As I said, I cannot touch on every point that was made, but I hope to touch on some of the key issues. To quote my noble friend Lord Wolfson again, we have to start with the basic reality that the current system is not working. We need real, practical solutions, not just another outline of the problems, so I offer particular thanks to noble Lords who have today shared some suggestions of what we can do. Reform is desperately needed, and the Bill will enable us to deliver it.<\/p><p pid=\"c664.1\/4\">I turn first to the deprivation of citizenship, because that has been so widely mentioned, including by the noble Lords, Lord Rosser, Lord Paddick, Lord Blunkett, Lord Anderson of Ipswich, Lord Dubs, Lord Kirkhope of Harrogate and Lord Hannay of Chiswick; the noble Baronesses, Lady Fox of Buckley, Lady Chakrabarti, Lady Jones of Moulsecoomb, Lady Lister and Lady Uddin; and my noble friends Lord Balfe and Lady Warsi. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Woolley, that, irrespective of his name&#8212;mine also starts with a &#8220;W&#8221;, so I know where I stand&#8212;I listened to his concerns on the clause very carefully. I assure him of the Government&#8217;s continuing commitment to righting the wrongs of Windrush. We have been very clear on that, so, to echo what was said explicitly in the other place, the Bill does not widen the reasons for which a person can be deprived of their British citizenship. The change is about the process of notifying the individual.<\/p><p pid=\"c664.1\/5\">Picking up on some of the questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Anderson of Ipswich, in particular, the clause is necessary to ensure that we avoid a situation where we could never deprive a person of their British citizenship just because there is no way of  communicating with them, or where to make contact would disclose sensitive intelligence sources, including a last known address&#8212;if we even have one. This is vital to protect the security of the UK from those who would wish to do us harm.<\/p><p pid=\"c664.1\/6\">Rightly, this power is reserved for those who pose a threat to the UK and those who obtain their citizenship by fraudulent means. Decisions are made following careful consideration of advice from officials and lawyers, and in accordance with international law. It always comes with an appeal right. The Government do not seek to extend deprivation powers&#8212;I want to make that absolutely clear. The grounds on which a person can be deprived of their citizenship will remain unchanged. We also do not want to deny a person their statutory right of appeal where we have made a decision to deprive, and the Bill preserves that right. The change is simply intended to ensure that existing powers can be used effectively in all appropriate circumstances and in no way represents a policy change in this important area of work. Instead, the scaremongering that we have seen around this clause from some quarters is unacceptable, irresponsible and highly regrettable.<\/p><p pid=\"c664.1\/7\">The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, and the noble Baroness, Lady Jolly, made some thoughtful contributions on the importance of organisations such as the RNLI, and I share their sentiments about them. I want to reassure noble Lords that the Bill does not change the Government&#8217;s approach to existing obligations under international maritime law, including that first duty to protect lives at sea. I might say that I am delighted that the RNLI has received additional contributions, because I see the work that it does down in Cornwall. The Government tabled an amendment to the Bill in the Commons on Report to make absolutely clear that organisations such as HM Coastguard and RNLI will be able to continue to rescue those in distress at sea, as they do now.<\/p><p pid=\"c664.1\/8\">Perhaps I may move on to differentiation. The noble Baronesses, Lady Chakrabarti, Lady Ludford, Lady Kennedy of the Shaws and Lady Uddin, the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham spoke about provisions that differentiate between groups of asylum seekers. I know that there is a difference of opinion about these provisions, but I do not make excuses for doing everything possible to deter people from making these dangerous crossings. I should like to provide reassurance that family reunion, which I know is an issue of particular concern, will be permitted for those in group two where refusal would breach our international obligations under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p><p pid=\"c664.1\/9\">I should also like to pick up specifically on the comment from the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, on female judges from Afghanistan. She and I have talked about that and how they will be considered under the new differentiated asylum policy. As she set out, in August we announced the Afghan citizens&#8217; resettlement scheme, one of the most generous schemes in our country&#8217;s history, with up to 20,000 people at risk being given a new life in the UK. The scheme will explicitly prioritise those who have assisted the UK&#8217;s efforts in Afghanistan and stood up for values such as democracy, women&#8217;s rights and freedom of speech or  the rule of law. I hope, therefore, that I can assure the noble Baroness on that. The scheme includes women&#8217;s rights activists, journalists and prosecutors.<\/p><p pid=\"c664.1\/10\">Individuals granted settlement under the ACRS will not be subject to any differential treatment and will be granted indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom. That sits alongside our other safe and legal routes, including the UK resettlement scheme and community sponsorship, which I am delighted the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford mentioned, because it is a scheme that I am very keen on and I hope to have more discussions with her on it. Other safe and legal routes include the mandate resettlement scheme, the Afghan relocations and assistance policy and the immigration route for BNO status holders from Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"c664.1\/11\">I move on to modern slavery. Many noble Lords, including my noble friend Lord McColl, the noble Lords, Lord Alton of Liverpool, Lord Rooker and Lord Morrow, the noble Baroness, Lady Hollins, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of London asked about Part 5, which relates to modern slavery. The Government are totally committed to tackling this terrible crime, one that seeks to exploit and do harm. This requires active prosecution of the modern slavery perpetrators.<\/p><p pid=\"c664.1\/12\">Noble Lords asked why we are legislating for modern slavery in this Bill. The fact is that there is an overlap between some individuals who enter the immigration system and the national referral mechanism, so it is right that we make sure that those individuals have their full set of circumstances considered together. We also want to make sure that vulnerable individuals are identified as early as possible so that we can ensure that they have access to the right support.<\/p><p pid=\"c664.1\/13\">That is why this Bill makes clear, for the first time in primary legislation, that where a public authority, such as the police, is pursuing an investigation or criminal proceedings, confirmed victims who are co-operating in this activity and need to remain in the UK in order to do so will be granted temporary leave to remain. The legislation also makes it clear that leave will be granted where it is necessary to assist an individual in their recovery from any physical or psychological harm arising from the relevant exploitation, or where it is necessary to enable them to seek compensation in respect of the relevant exploitation. It is right that leave is granted only to those who need it. This is both firm and fair.<\/p><p pid=\"c664.1\/14\">Additionally, as part of our ongoing commitment to victims, we will continue to explore opportunities to enhance our support for victims through the criminal justice system through our review of the modern slavery strategy. Having as clear a definition as possible of the relevant eligibility criteria is the best way to give victims the clarity and certainty they need.<\/p><p pid=\"c664.1\/15\">I assure noble Lords that we remain in line with our international obligations and will continue to support, via a grant of temporary leave to remain, those who have a need to be in the UK to assist with their recovery from physical and psychological harm caused by their exploitation. All those who receive a positive conclusive grounds decision and are in need of tailored  support will receive appropriate individualised support for a minimum of 12 months. We will set out further details in guidance in due course.<\/p><p pid=\"c664.1\/16\">I turn to the concerns about the steps we are taking regarding the wording of the reasonable grounds threshold in the Modern Slavery Act 2015. Our purpose here is to ensure that this mirrors our obligation under the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. We remain committed to ensuring that the NRM effectively identifies and supports genuine victims to recover.<\/p><p pid=\"c664.1\/17\">Lastly, I turn to the specific questions raised by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, on the recent joint statement of the Independent Anti-slavery Commissioner and the Victims&#8217; Commissioner. I assure him that we are fully considering the issues raised and that we are currently engaging with both commissioners on these important issues.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a80.1\/1\">My hon. Friend makes his point strongly on the record. I will move on to the treatment of family members of non-UK service personnel and particularly whether any fee waivers should apply to them as well as to the principal applicant. As I said, I am not in a position to announce the revised policy, but the consultation did not include proposals to waive fees for family members. Offering fee waivers to family members of non-UK service personnel would put them in a more favourable position than UK nationals serving in the armed forces. While we could debate what the provisions for family members should be, we do not believe it is sensible to have a difference in this area, or for it to be an advantage to serve in the armed forces as a non-UK national rather than as a UK national.<\/p><p pid=\"a80.1\/2\">Colleagues will be aware that the minimum income requirement is standard across immigration routes for settled persons wishing to sponsor family members and is mostly set at levels at which people would not generally be eligible for income-related benefits. Most armed forces personnel, regardless of their nationality, are single when they enlist. The salary in all three services once basic training is completed would enable them to sponsor a partner to come to, or remain in, the UK. Where personnel have children who are subject to immigration control, noting the provisions I outlined earlier, we recognise that it may take longer for junior-ranked personnel to meet the higher thresholds that apply. That is why the Home Secretary agrees with the recommendations of the review by my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Andrew Selous\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11216\">the Member for South West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)<\/phrase>, &#8220;Living in our shoes&#8221;, published in June 2020, and has committed to a medium-term review of the impact of the minimum income requirement on armed forces personnel and their families.<\/p><p pid=\"a80.1\/3\">In previous debates, the issue of Hong Kong Military Service Corps veterans has been raised. It is probably worth putting on the record again what I confirmed during the passage of the Nationality and Borders Bill. We have identified a potential solution to this issue and are currently investigating proposals that could see that cohort treated similarly to other non-UK service personnel with potential links to the former colony. That would be in addition to other pathways that they may already be eligible for, such as the British national overseas visa, which provides a path to settlement. There is considerable work to be done to fully scope the ramifications and impacts of this policy. However, I aim to provide further details to the House later this year.<\/p><p pid=\"a80.1\/4\">Let me again offer my thanks to the hon. Member for Barnsley Central for securing this debate. As we have seen today and in the debate last month on the proposed  amendment to the Nationality and Borders Bill, this issue rightly arouses strong feelings among individual Members and across the House&#8212;understandably so, given that it covers those who have served our nation. The hon. Members present are committed and passionate advocates for this topic, and I commend them and others for raising this hugely important issue. The discussion that we have had today has exposed the significant and understandable strength of feeling that there is about it.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>This has been a really interesting debate, describing an issue that has been at the heart of Scottish politics for over a century: the tension in our economy between landlordism and tenants&#8217; rights. That perpetual struggle for power has run for decades, it is at the heart of why the Parliament was established and we need to confront it boldly and with imagination. In that spirit, Scottish Labour welcomes the publication of the draft rental sector strategy. We will seek to drive it forward with encouragement and support, and our amendment proposes to inject some pace. I hope that the minister will meet that in the spirit with which it was intended. It was good to have that insight at the start of the debate.<\/p><p>We have had some very good speeches. We are working against the clock. The pressure on tenants is rising daily and, over the past decade, we have seen rent increases in Edinburgh of 46 per cent and in Glasgow of 41 per cent. We know that the longer any bill takes, the more pressure people are under. As incomes continue to stagnate and people experience continued cost pressures, something has to give. It is often the security and fundamental ability of people to live their lives with a sense of mental wellbeing. As many members have said, we have to act urgently to address the housing crisis in our midst.<\/p><p>We have seen the symptoms of the crisis increasing in the past few years because of the pandemic. Once the temporary ban on evictions was removed, we saw social rental evictions due to arrears increase by 975 per cent&#8212;that is explosive growth. We have heard estimates that the total of social and private sector rental arrears has climbed to more than &#163;300 million. That is a major pressure.<\/p><p>As Ms Villalba, who represents North East Scotland said, we cannot wait for the crisis point to address the issue. My colleague from Glasgow, Pauline McNeill, addressed the point about short-term measures that can be implemented, such as protecting renters&#8217; rights under the Coronavirus (Scotland) Act 2020, alongside extending powers to end evictions in circumstances where there are no issues related to anti-social, disruptive or criminal behaviour. It is unreasonable for the community to see people being displaced from their homes and ratcheted out of accommodation, resulting in their homelessness, because of private landlordism. That is not something that society can accept; the cost of homelessness is not priced in. It is not something that the community as a whole should bear for the sake of private profit.<\/p><p>The Scottish Government is proposing rent controls and we welcome those in principle. However, our amendment calls on the Government to move faster and to agree framework legislation in the second year of the parliamentary session. I understand that the minister is prepared to accept our amendment; I welcome that and I hope that we can work constructively to deliver that framework at pace, being mindful of the pressures that renters are under.<\/p><p>We have heard about the extent to which insecure tenancies affect people&#8217;s lives. Members who have personal experience of that have offered some pretty stirring testimony. We can also understand that there are other pressures in the discussion on rent controls. We have to understand what we mean by rent controls: rent control already exists, but the control lies with the landlord and not with the tenant. The strategy is an effort to try to redress the balance of control. Control is constant, but the question is, who has that control? That is what rent controls seek to address.<\/p><p>I noted that there was a question about dogmatism. Let us look at the evidence. I know that one of the Conservative members for the Lothians raised that point. Yes, we are dogmatic about ending poverty and income-related issues that push people into homelessness and other distress as a result of housing costs that are completely out of control because of landlordism. We have to address that issue in our society urgently.<\/p><p>We know that it can work because there are practical examples, although some models have been flawed. In Scotland, there were rent controls in Glasgow from 1915 to 1989, which resulted in significant issues in the city. We have learned from that and there are international models that we can benchmark against. I hope that that is what the proposed legislation will seek to achieve.<\/p><p>In New York, for example, there have been rent controls since the 1940s, and they have not resulted in the sort of calamitous effects that were described by Conservative members. There is an issue in San Francisco, where pre-1980 properties are subject to rent controls but those built after 1980 are not, which creates a perversity in the market that causes distortions. That can be addressed; what has been described is a false equivalence. It is not a constant that all rent controls are bad. As ever, the devil is in the detail, and we hope to address all that in the course of considering the legislation. That is why Labour supports it.<\/p><p>We broadly support the principles behind the living rent campaign around democratic accountability, which I think was mentioned by the member for East Lothian, referring in particular to the legacy of the right-to-buy scheme causing distortions in the market. At one point, Scotland had the highest level of social tenancies in the world. In Glasgow, it was second only to Hong Kong worldwide for social rented tenancies. We have seen a massive disruption and change in the marketplace over the past 40 years, which we must address.<\/p><p>Things are out of control and we have heard numerous descriptions from members today about the impact that that has had: the lack of control on tenancies, including from the public rented sector, and rampaging profiteering in the market must be addressed. We hope to work constructively as we proceed in the coming months and years to address that with urgency, boldly and with imagination. Let us redress the power of rent controls from the landlord to the tenant.<\/p>",

Few have played a more important role than our emergency service workers and I put on record my particular thanks to the police officers and firefighters who have continued selflessly to serve the public in sometimes trying circumstances, as well as all Home Office staff and Border Force officers who have played their part in the fight against Covid-19.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Despite Covid-19, the Home Office has continued to deliver on the people&#8217;s priorities and as we recover from the pandemic, we will continue to build back safer in 2022.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Cutting crime and law enforcement<\/strong><\/p><p> <\/p><p>We are delivering our manifesto commitment for new police officer recruitment, having recruited more than 11,000 of the 20,000 new police officers we have pledged for England and Wales to help cut crime and protect our communities. Every region in the country has more police officers keeping our streets and communities safer day and night &#8211; both beating crime and preventing crime.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The College of Policing has continued to connect all those working in the police and law enforcement, with the chair of its board, Lord Herbert of South Downs, launching a fundamental review of the College&#8217;s work. This is important if we are to ensure that it continues to meet its potential and that its work and role within policing is valued across the service.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We have published several landmark strategies on the safety and security of our nation.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Our Beating Crime Plan establishes how the Government will ensure the public is better protected across all parts of the country, with each neighbourhood having contactable, named police officers who know their area and are best placed to ensure that persistent crime and anti-social behaviour is tackled.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Our Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy set out plans to increase support for victims and survivors, increase the number of perpetrators brought to justice and reduce the prevalence of violence against women and girls in the long term. The need for the strategy became all the more stark following the tragic murder of Sarah Everard and immediate measures taken included the creation of the new online tool &#8216;StreetSafe&#8217;. This provides women and girls with a way to anonymously and quickly pinpoint areas where they have felt unsafe and say why &#8211; an innovative crime prevention tool. The appointment in September of Deputy Chief Constable Maggie Blyth as the National Police Lead for Violence Against Women and Girls means that police action in this vital area is now being coordinated across England and Wales.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In June we published the end-to-end rape review report on findings and actions, in which we committed to deliver lasting improvements to the way we investigate and prosecute rape so that victims are properly<\/p><p>supported and they - and the public - can have confidence that perpetrators of this sickening crime will feel the full force of the law.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Domestic Abuse Act, which gained Royal Assent this year, provides for the first time in history a wide-ranging legal definition of domestic abuse and delivers important new protections and support for victims, such as ensuring that abusers can no longer directly cross-examine their victims in the family and civil courts. It also gives police new powers, including Domestic Abuse Protection Notices which provide victims with immediate protection from abusers.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We also published our Tackling Child Sexual Abuse Strategy - a first-of-its-kind national strategy to protect children from all forms of child sexual abuse in which we set out how the government will use new legislation and enhanced technology to stop offenders in their tracks and bring the perpetrators of these heinous crimes to justice.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We have also enhanced our work tackling the scourge of drugs with a new cross-government 10-year strategy which includes pursuing and closing down the ruthless gangs who exploit and threaten the most vulnerable in society for financial gain through the illegal drugs trade. We have already closed down 1,500 county lines and this new crackdown aims to dismantle a further 2,000, as we seek to continue driving down crime and delivering safer streets for all.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>During the course of this year, we have also expanded Project ADDER, the programme which seeks to ensure that more drug users get effective treatment, with enhanced treatment and recovery provision. Its overarching aim is to reduce drug-related deaths, reduce drug-related offending and reduce the prevalence of drug use while disrupting high-harm criminals and networks involved in the supply and importation of drugs. Having launched the programme in January 2021 in Blackpool, Hastings, Middlesbrough, Norwich and Swansea Bay, in July 2021 it expanded to take in Bristol, Newcastle, Wakefield, the London boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Hackney, and three local authorities in Liverpool City Region.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Meanwhile, the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill &#8211; legislation to restore confidence in the criminal justice system &#8211; is approaching its concluding stages in the House of Lords. Once enacted, this will give our police officers more of the powers and tools they need to keep themselves and all of us safe, while introducing tougher sentencing for the worst offenders and ending automatic halfway release from prison for serious crimes. Following recent antisocial protests which have caused misery and disruption for countless road users and citizens going about their lawful business, the legislation will give the police the power to stop and search people in order to seize items such as glue and chains intended to cause serious disruption by &#8216;locking-on&#8217;. It will also introduce mandatory life sentences for those who kill an emergency worker in the course of their duty.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Following the mass shooting in Plymouth in August, a review of police firearms licensing procedures was completed, including a review of licences which had been surrendered, seized, revoked or refused, only then to be returned following further checks or appeals. Following this review, eight of these returned licences were either re-surrendered or revoked, providing further reassurance to the public that their safety remains our priority.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We have also continued to establish what needs to be done to protect people from being exposed to harmful content online, whether that be publishing incitement to terrorism or images of the sexual abuse of children. I will continue to hold technology companies to account for the harmful content they host on their platforms and if they neglect public safety when designing products; and in due course our Online Safety Bill will place on those technology companies a binding duty of care to their users &#8211; and end-to-end encryption will not release them from that duty. This is fundamental to ensuring public safety and keeping people safe from evil.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Figures published last month show a 14% decrease in total crime (excluding fraud and computer misuse) across England and Wales for the year ending June 2021, compared with the year ending June 2019. This includes an 11% decrease in the number of homicides, a 6% decrease in the number of police recorded offences involving firearms and an 8% decrease in offences involving knives or sharp instruments.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Controlling our borders<\/strong><\/p><p> <\/p><p>Following the UK&#8217;s exit from the European Union we have been able to take back control of our borders by ending free movement and introducing our new Points-Based Immigration System, which has now been in operation for over a year. We have also created new routes to attract the most talented and highly-skilled workers and global leaders in their fields to the UK.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>These include the Graduate route, which will allow talented international graduates who have been awarded their degree from a UK university to stay in the UK and work, or look for work, at any skill level for at least two years, and the new fast-track International Sportsperson route, which will make it easier for professional athletes across sports to work in the country.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Additionally, we have improved the employer sponsorship system to enable UK businesses and educational institutions to become sponsors and attract global talent faster, while adding more illustrious prizes to the Global Talent Visa, making it simpler for more of the world&#8217;s most gifted minds to come to the country.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We have also created an immigration route for British Nationals Overseas status holders in Hong Kong, reflecting our historic&#8239;and&#8239;moral commitment to the people of Hong Kong who have had their rights and freedoms restricted. As of 30 September, since the route launched on 31 January 2021 there had been 67,300 applications with 57,300 successful grants.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Recognising the considerable public concerns about illegal migration, the Nationality and Borders Bill is a critical piece of legislation whose aim is to deter illegal entry into the UK and reduce the pull factors. It was given its Third Reading in the House of Commons by a majority of 67 earlier this month.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>This legislation will deliver long-overdue reform to our broken asylum and immigration system and will be critical in making unviable the business model of the people smugglers who threaten the lives of every person from whom they take money to then place in unseaworthy vessels to cross the English Channel.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Once enacted, this legislation will: make the system fairer and more effective so that we can better protect and support those in genuine need of asylum; deter illegal entry into the UK and save lives by breaking the business model of those criminal trafficking networks; and remove from the UK those with no right to be here.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We have also continued to work closely with our international partners on tackling this shared problem emanating from the global migration crisis and specifically signed a new agreement with the French government to strengthen UK-France cooperation on tackling illegal immigration across the Channel.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The tireless work of the National Crime Agency tackling organised immigration crime has also played an important role in helping bring to justice people smugglers, having been involved in more than 140 arrests in the first eleven months of this year and with around 50 ongoing investigations linked to organised immigration crime. (The NCA has also played a critical role in other areas, such as keeping children safe online throughout the pandemic and disrupting high risk offenders.)<\/p><p><strong> <\/strong><\/p><p>We have also signed a new agreement with the Albanian government to remove Albanian nationals who have no right to be in the UK, and established a new Migration and Mobility Partnership with the Indian government, supporting people coming to the UK through legal routes, while stopping the abuse of the system and speeding up the removal of those who have no right to be in the UK.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Protecting the homeland<\/strong><\/p><p> <\/p><p>Most of the work of our counter-terrorism police and security agencies is done out of public sight for good reasons, but they play an essential role in keeping the public safe.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>They constantly review where threats exist and take the necessary action to clamp down on those with malign intent. To that end, this year Parliament has proscribed the entirety of Hamas, the militant Islamist terrorist movement, as a terrorist organisation, as well as Atomwaffen Division and The Base, predominantly US-based white supremacist groups.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>During the year, the Counter-Terrorism and Sentencing Act received Royal Assent, further protecting the public by completely ending the prospect of early release for anyone convicted of a serious terror offence and forcing them to spend their whole term in jail. It also enhances the tools available to counter-terrorism police and the security services to manage the risk posed by terrorist offenders and individuals of concern outside of custody.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Covert Human Intelligence Sources Act was also given Royal Assent, providing a clear and consistent statutory basis so that our intelligence and enforcement agencies and public bodies have the right tools to keep us safe. This longstanding critical capability supports the work of undercover agents in preventing and safeguarding victims from serious crimes, including terrorism, by ensuring they can gain the trust of those under investigation.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>This year also saw the unveiling of the first elements of the new Counter Terrorism Operations Centre in London, including a cutting-edge counter terrorism operations suite which is now fully operational and helping to keep the public safe.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>During the summer, the Home Office stepped up to help in the evacuation of people from Kabul airport &#8211; the largest evacuation mission undertaken since the Second World War, which involved getting more than 16,000 people out of the Afghan capital. The Home Office&#8217;s dual priorities during this evacuation were to save as many lives as possible while keeping the British public safe and I&#8217;m very proud of all who worked on that immense response.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Likewise, I was proud of all the Home Office teams, police and our partner agencies who were involved in safely delivering the COP26 conference in Glasgow in November &#8211; the largest international event the UK has hosted since the 2012 Olympics &#8211; as well as the G7 summit earlier this year. UKVI staff and Border Force officers efficiently processed and welcomed tens of thousands of visiting delegates from around the world; meanwhile, police officers from across the UK and our security agencies kept attendees and the public safe throughout &#8211; as they do without fanfare across the UK every day of the year. We owe them a huge debt of gratitude.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>International engagement<\/strong><\/p><p> <\/p><p>In September I chaired the G7 interior ministers in London, showing how the UK is taking a lead on the international stage in the spheres of Counter Terrorism and illegal migration, as well as tackling Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation online. We agreed to work together to take action to prevent and combat violent extremism and terrorism; to protect people against harms enabled or exacerbated by the internet; to ensure security is not undermined by the threat of serious and organised crime; to support global action to confront emerging issues for national and border security; and to strengthen international action against corruption and kleptocracies.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Throughout the year I and ministerial colleagues have engaged with numerous counterparts from around the world. In November I visited Washington, where I met with senior members of the US administration, and it was agreed that the UK and US security services will undertake joint work to further strengthen the vital counter terrorism relationship between our two nations.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>EU Settlement Scheme<\/strong><\/p><p> <\/p><p>Following the UK&#8217;s departure from the European Union, a considerable number of our EU friends and neighbours decided to make the UK their home and secure the status to which they are entitled through the hugely successful EU Settlement Scheme. By the end of November 2021, more than 6.3 million applications had been received, with over 5.9 million (94%) applications concluded. We have continued to work as quickly as possible to conclude applications, as well as supporting people with late applications, and the scheme remains opens indefinitely for late applications.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Windrush<\/strong><\/p><p> <\/p><p>Finally, this year, we have continued to put right the wrongs suffered by the Windrush generation under successive governments. Following the overhaul of the Compensation Scheme I announced in December 2020, it is now easier for people to get higher payments more quickly, and as a result of my changes, more than &#163;38 million has been paid or offered in compensation.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We simplified the application process, including changes to the primary claim form, designed in consultation with stakeholders, to make it easier to complete and easier for caseworkers to process; and for those who need support, we have funded an organisation to provide free, independent claimant assistance to individuals for the duration of the Scheme.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We have also worked at pace to implement the recommendations of the Windrush Lessons Learned review, with Wendy Williams having recently returned to the Home Office to undertake a progress review on delivery of her recommendations.<\/p>",

She will recognise that the amendment last week required a report from the Secretary of State about why he, and so central government, should not have statutory authority or due regard. As the Government have stated in both Houses that they have reached the view that legislation is not necessary, it should not have been unduly onerous or difficult for them to explain why in a report to both Houses in the six-month timeframe. Now, however, I sense a changing view and the need for a longer period before making a report.<\/p><p pid=\"b149.0\/2\">This change of view is most welcome. It has effectively been demonstrated since Report by the decision of the MoD to refer the case of the Hong Kong Military Service Corps to the Home Office, from one central department to another, dealing with a veterans issue that could not be gripped at devolved or local authority level. However, the MoD must continue to discharge its responsibilities to those veterans. It must continue to take an active interest in their plight until the Home Office responds. Will the Minister give that undertaking now? It should not need to wait for further consideration under the Nationality and Borders Bill when it comes to this House. My hope is that the Government will take &#8220;nonne&#8221; or a &#8220;ne&#8221; rather than a &#8220;num&#8221; approach in answering the request and reporting on why central government must have a legal covenant duty of due regard.<\/p><p pid=\"b149.0\/3\">I am very conscious that time is pressing to gain Royal Assent, without which the Government have no statutory right to military forces. I was also somewhat reassured by the Minister&#8217;s statement in the other place, so I have not moved any further amendment. I thank the Government for conceding that the role of central government must be considered and reported upon to Parliament.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c2159.0\/1\">My Lords, I am very grateful to the most reverend Primate for giving us this important and, if I may say so, enjoyable debate. As he said, this is a return to tradition for your Lordships&#8217; House&#8212;a tradition which, as a relative newcomer, I have not had the privilege of participating in before.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/2\">This debate is on a fundamental issue. Without freedom of speech and open debate, no other question can be adequately settled. It is a debate that is both ancient and timely. These are age-old questions, and noble Lords have pointed to many examples down the ages where society has grappled with them. However, we are beset by contemporary challenges, as the most  reverend Primate&#8217;s Motion draws our attention to. He outlined three threats in particular: the fear of reprisal, the distortion of truth and the dehumanisation of those with whom we disagree. All seem to be growing.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/3\">Free speech seems to be more complicated than ever. Many more people are involved in the conversation, and debates seem to happen with the fast-forward button on. Previously, they were curated in fora such as this, with parliamentary privilege and the mandate of election or a Writ of Summons, in academia with challenge from examiners or peer review, and in books and newspapers with selection by publishers or editors and rights of reply. Social media has changed that; as the most reverend Primate said, we are increasingly our own curators, editors and publishers.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/4\">Anyone with an opinion, however crass or simplistic, can express it, and anyone can engage with it. Those with fringe opinions can find like-minded people and caucus to amplify their voices. The powerful and mighty can be challenged and mocked in full public view. I have tried to state these changes neutrally, for they have both good and bad consequences, but they have changed the way we engage in public discourse&#8212;as have the algorithms which funnel us into silos and echo chambers and the fiat of online platforms over the content they do and do not allow, as the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, mentioned.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/5\">The most reverend Primate cited Timothy Garton Ash&#8217;s three vetoes: that of the heckler, the offensiveness veto, and that of the assassin. To begin with, I might say something about our work as a Government to overcome each of these.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/6\">The voices of the heckler are heard most loud online, and the online safety Bill, which has been mentioned by many noble Lords, will tackle abuse while upholding the right to free speech. As noble Lords reminded us, it is before a Joint Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, that today&#8217;s debate, particularly the speech of the most reverend Primate, is essential reading for the members of the Joint Committee.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/7\">That Bill will usher in a new era of accountability for tech companies, upholding free expression and pluralism online. All platforms in the scope of the Bill will need to consider and implement safeguards for freedom of expression when fulfilling their duties. Although companies must take robust action to tackle criminal activity, in order to protect free speech regulation will not require the removal of legal content, nor prevent adults accessing or posting legal content. Platforms will therefore not be able arbitrarily to remove harmful content. They will need to be clear what content is acceptable on their services and to enforce the rules consistently. Services that are high risk and high reach will have additional duties to protect democratic and journalistic content, and must consider whether the public interest in such content outweighs the potential harm it can cause.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/8\">The noble Baroness, Lady Kidron, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford and others spoke about our particular duty to the most vulnerable and to children. The strongest protections in the Bill will be for children. Our aim is to make the United Kingdom the safest place in the world to be a child online.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/9\">I also agree with the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, about the challenges of the disappearing record of the internet. The historian in me worries about the archives of the future and the material that will not be available to those who look back on our era. It also has an impact on the way we conduct ourselves and post such content: if we think our comments are ephemeral then perhaps we do not give them the weight and consideration they deserve. I would be very happy to speak to him about that further.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/10\">The second veto is that of offensiveness. There is no right not to be offended. Increasingly, we hear people asking for views not to be aired because they make them feel unsafe or uncomfortable. As the most reverend Primate says, a duty lies on the speaker to be fitting in what they say, but that is, in the most part, a moral duty rather than a legal one. There is a duty on the listener too to understand that the offence they take may not be shared by everybody and to allow a range of views to be heard.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/11\">History is littered with examples of what happens when we do not air dangerous views in the open and confront them head on. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Merron, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, and others in their comments about the evils of anti-Semitism. Dangerous views fester in the darkness and grow more dangerous still.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/12\">I was very glad that the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth, pointed to the statue by Martin Jennings of George Orwell outside the BBC&#8217;s Broadcasting House and the quotation from that author, which is worthy of repeating:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c2159.0\/13\">&#8220;If liberty means anything at all it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/14\">Perhaps nowhere is that more important than in the academy. Many noble Lords spoke of free speech in higher education, citing a number of instances; I hope they will forgive me if, under the pressure of time, I do not dwell on each one.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/15\">I certainly agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner of Margravine, that one of the important roles of our universities is to build resilience, so that people are equipped to engage with ideas in later life, including those with which they disagree, if people feel unsafe listening to certain speakers, reading broadsheet newspapers, or even listening to debates in your Lordships&#8217; House and in Parliament. That is why the Government have brought forward the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Bill. We are clear that higher education providers in England must have a duty to ensure that freedom of speech within the law is secured for students, staff and visiting speakers. Academic staff must feel safe to question and test received wisdom, and to put forward new ideas and controversial or unpopular opinions without the risk of losing their jobs, their privileges or their chances of promotion. The noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, cited the list in Prospect magazine of the many academics who pointed to the treatment they received and the fears they have as evidence that this is, I fear, a growing problem on campus.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/16\">My noble friend Lord Sandhurst alluded to the proposed new code at the University of Cambridge, which was rightly amended following a campaign by  many members of that university, including the noble Baroness, Lady Smith of Newnham. We should tolerate the views of others, but while we should always endeavour to engage respectfully, we should not be forced to respect views with which we disagree. A key sentiment that has come through in noble Lords&#8217; speeches today is that we must be free to disagree well. Following on from the comments of my noble friend Lord Hannan, I disagree with many of my friends&#8212;they certainly disagree with me&#8212;but it is important that we can maintain friendship and respectful debate while disagreeing.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/17\">I must briefly pick up on the comments of my noble friend Lord Sandhurst. He mentioned the row about Andrew Graham-Dixon. That was actually at the Cambridge Union, not the Oxford Union, an older and more distinguished society and one where, I am happy to say, the issue was quickly overcome.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/18\">The third area of veto is that of the assassin, whether literal or the challenges of violence that so many face. We see that in those who defend our open media at home and around the world, as the noble Baroness, Lady D&#8217;Souza, highlighted in her contribution. It can be seen in the award of this year&#8217;s Nobel Peace Prize to Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov, the first journalists to receive it since 1935. Their recognition also served to underline that many jurisdictions have taken the opportunity of the pandemic to strengthen their already repressive machinery to reduce freedom of speech and critical voices.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/19\">The UK has a long and proud history of promoting freedom of expression globally, underpinned by our commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was signed, as noble Lords have rightly noted, 73 years ago today. We remain a co-chair, with Canada, of the Media Freedom Coalition, which is taking action to defend media freedom, including through statements on the deteriorating situation for organisations in Egypt, Belarus, Hong Kong and Russia. Ensuring that the global news industry not only survives but thrives is an essential part of our development work. The UK has provided more than &#163;400 million of official development assistance to support global media outlets in the past five years, and we are proud of our commitments there.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/20\">These reflect our long-standing commitment to freedom of the press at a domestic level. The UK is rightly proud of its fine global reputation, underpinned by a common recognition across society that freedom of the press is fundamental to a healthy democracy. The Government do not&#8212;and will not&#8212;intervene in what the press can and cannot publish, as long as it abides by the law of the land. What we can and must do is support the efforts of those who hold the powerful to account. To that end, the UK has set up the National Committee for the Safety of Journalists, and we have published a National Action Plan for the Safety of Journalists, setting out concrete initiatives which will provide genuine support to journalists facing both abuse and threats to their personal safety as well as encroachments on their freedom of expression.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/21\">Another area in which we are tackling violence and intimidation is through the Elections Bill, which is guided by the Government&#8217;s determination to ensure  that our democracy remains secure, fair and transparent. We are the stewards of a fantastic democratic heritage which we must secure and cherish in our age. British democracy has always been robust and oppositional. Critical debate is a fundamental part of it, but a line is crossed when disagreement mutates into intimidation and abuse. In particular, intimidating someone into changing their vote or abstaining from voting is unacceptable and strikes at the very heart of our democracy. That is why a new electoral sanction against intimidation, effective all year round, will protect candidates, aspirant candidates, campaigners and elected officeholders from intimidation on and offline.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/22\">When I first saw it, I thought there might be an omission in the most reverend Primate&#8217;s Motion, although I am glad to say that there was not one in his speech. He talks of the role of public, private and civil society sectors in overcoming the challenges to freedom of speech, but there is a role for individuals too&#8212;for each and every one of us. Free speech, as he says, should be fitting speech: we must choose carefully the words we use. We cannot legislate ourselves, as he says, to good behaviour. The most reverend Primate rightly paid tribute to the way we do that in your Lordships&#8217; House. Today&#8217;s exchanges have been a case in point.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/23\">I will take the opportunity to speak a little about my portfolio and talk about the arts as another vital means of free expression&#8212;for art is about ideas, emotions and identity. It is a way of seeing the world through others&#8217; eyes, down the ages and across the globe. Because of this, art is often controversial, and rightly: it should provoke us, confront us and challenge us to think anew. Politicians are often asked their views on these controversies, and of course they have a right to engage in the debates that artists provoke as much as anyone else. My approach so far, which I hope to maintain, is to try to see the work of art in question before commenting on it. Context and nuance are essential, and dialogue and debate rely on both sides to engage faithfully and with open minds.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/24\">Art can illuminate the big questions that face us, such as the one that we are debating today. The Turner Prize was awarded earlier this month in Coventry, City of Culture. The winner was the Array Collective, a Belfast-based group, which won with an installation of a pub, bedecked with banners and placards representing some of the most thorny and emotively charged debates of our age: on abortion, gay rights, race and gender. But perhaps the most important message was conveyed in the list of pub rules inside that pop-up pub. These included the entreaty that, while debating these issues, you must have a laugh. In a part of our country that knows all too well the dangers of sectarianism and what happens when open debate is replaced by the violence of the bomb and the gun, how powerful and necessary it was to see a work of art that champions the shared spaces where we can talk and disagree in an open, welcoming and good-humoured way. I congratulate them on their win.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/25\">Last night, I had the privilege of attending the opening night of &#8220;Best of Enemies&#8221;, the new play by James Graham&#8212;a shrewd and sensitive chronicler of our age&#8212;at the Young Vic. It concerns the televised debates in 1968 between Gore Vidal and William F  Buckley Jr. It contains so many of the themes that we have touched on in our debate today: the polarisation of political debate; the role of the media in shaping and mis-shaping that; questions of race, sexuality and national identity; and the role and challenges of political protest&#8212;in this case, the clashes on the streets of Chicago during the Democratic National Convention. Half a century on from the events in that play, the questions that it poses us are as arresting and important as ever. I warmly encourage noble Lords to go and  see it.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/26\">Like every aspect of public discourse, art benefits from a wide and diverse range of voices and views. That is why it is so important that previously marginalised groups are given the chance to tell their stories and make their voices heard. That is why we must all have the humility and open-mindedness to re-examine our convictions, however long or earnestly held, in the light of new insights and perspectives. That is why we must also protect those who express heterodox views as well as those who defend or reflect old orthodoxies. I was especially pleased to hear my noble friend Lady Sanderson of Welton drawing attention to the concerns expressed by Dame Rose Tremain and Sir Kazuo Ishiguro, who have done so much to understand and increase our wider understanding of people with experiences far removed from their own.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/27\">I have already had some illuminating and thought-provoking discussions with people working in different parts of the arts, for this is a growing and impassioned area of debate. Just a few days ago, I saw that Eddie Redmayne wondered, with great care and reflection, whether he would play the role of a trans woman today, as he did in &#8220;The Danish Girl&#8221;. For my part, I am glad he did, for I thought that he did so with great sincerity and brought to wider attention the experience faced by trans people. Like the noble Lord, Lord Cashman, I think that we benefit from trying to walk in the shoes of others. But what matters is not just who tells the story but how they tell it&#8212;the research that they do and the spirit in which they do it&#8212;and I agree with my noble friend Lady Sanderson that we need to hear more voices and an ever more diverse range. The answer lies in addition, not subtraction.<\/p><p pid=\"c2159.0\/28\">If there is any institution that knows the difficulties and the importance of championing the orthodox and the unorthodox, it is the Christian Church. As I say, today&#8217;s debate is part of an Advent tradition&#8212;the season in which we await the arrival of that great disruptor, the child who would go on to rebuke the Pharisees, draw the ire of the Roman Empire, and inspire the devotion of new followers for more than two millennia. We have heard from noble Lords of all faiths and none but, because that is the reason that the most reverend Primate is here in your Lordships&#8217; House and has been able to give us this debate, this is an appropriate point with which to conclude my remarks. I thank all noble Lords who have taken part in this debate.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b626.1\/1\">It is an honour and a privilege to follow the two speeches from my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Anthony Browne\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25850\">the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Anthony Browne)<\/phrase> and <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Angela Eagle\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10182\">the hon. Member for Wallasey (Dame Angela Eagle)<\/phrase>. Both of them gave us philosophical, intelligent and really interesting speeches, and I noted that both of them made the point that financial services as an industry perhaps do not get the respect or the renown they probably should have.<\/p><p pid=\"b626.1\/2\">I was reflecting on that when I heard the remark my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire made about the German who said financial services are not recognised. Why is that? I think it is probably for three particular reasons, yet when we look at the contribution to the UK economy, we should really be shouting out against that. The first point is that, for all too many, when we say financial services, they think of banking. They forget all the related professional services, notwithstanding the subdivisions&#8212;indeed, financial services themselves are more tightly defined&#8212;and just concentrate on banking. They think back to the financial crisis and all the attendant problems that my hon. Friend so rightly pointed out.<\/p><p pid=\"b626.1\/3\">The second point is that, when we say financial services, people may expect the hon. Member for Wimbledon to stand up, but they should expect the hon. Member for Wallasey to stand up as well. Although, understandably, financial services account for 16% of London&#8217;s total gross value added, the reality is that in the north-west the industry is 6% of the regional economy, in the south-west it is 6%, in the west midlands it is 6% and in Yorkshire and Humberside it is 6%. The smallest contribution of financial services anywhere in the country is actually the east midlands, and that is 3%, but it is none the less 3% of that regional economy. So we should be standing up and saying that this is a UK-wide industry.<\/p><p pid=\"b626.1\/4\">The third point&#8212;with complete respect to my hon. Friend on the Front Bench, who is establishing his reputation for being perhaps the best City Minister we have ever had&#8212;is that there are one or two at the top of this Government who have occasionally thought that fishing was more important than financial services. If one says that the total contribution to the UK economy of financial services was &#163;67.4 billion last year, and for fishing the number is so small it is not worth talking about, correcting that and looking to that in the future would underline the point about the power of financial services. As has already been stated, there is a huge trade surplus.<\/p><p pid=\"b626.1\/5\">My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire talked about the opportunities and the hon. Member for Wallasey talked about the threats from the EU. It is none the less true that during our membership of the EU we established ourselves as the world&#8217;s global financial centre, and whether we like it or not 40% of UK financial services exports still go there. So my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury will know that in those very complex negotiations&#8212;I will not repeat what has already been said about them&#8212;we must have a sensible, diplomatic and economically viable dialogue with our nearest and dearest neighbours.<\/p><p pid=\"b626.1\/6\">The tax contribution has already been mentioned several times, and the hon. Lady made the point that PwC estimates that &#163;75.5 billion, or 11% of Government receipts, come from the wider financial and associated professional services sector, including insurance and legal. So there cannot be any doubt that this is a hugely important industry and a powerful industry for the UK, and if we want a globally successful Britain we need a globally successful, renowned and well-regulated industry. It is noticeable that in the last few years we have very slightly slipped in the global financial centres index to second place and we must recognise that there are threats as well as opportunities from leaving the EU. It is of significance that on the first trading day of this year we lost &#163;6 billion of activity out of London, and that is a continual threat. So I say yet again not only that we need those important negotiations to be conducted in a manner that is to London&#8217;s benefit but that we equally need to recognise of course that the threat is also now once again from New York, Switzerland, Singapore and Hong Kong. In the global alliances that we strike in financial services it is perfectly possible to recognise that, with some economic diplomacy put into deepening regulatory engagement, we could find ourselves in a powerful international regulatory alliance with the Americans, the Swiss and some of the far-east countries. Andrew Bailey some years ago when I was serving on the Treasury Committee raised this as an opportunity we should consider. Building those new trade and investment ties, and underpinning international agreements with financial services, is key to a globally successful Britain.<\/p><p pid=\"b626.1\/7\">I want to briefly talk about two other points. First, as has been said, there is a difference between wholesale regulation and retail regulation. The Financial Services Act 2021 says that the Financial Conduct Authority must have regard to the relevant international standards and the effect of the rules on the UK&#8217;s international standing. That is hugely important, particularly in wholesale regulation where we hope to ensure that the UK is an international powerhouse. I accept that that will always be a secondary objective of the rules and the obligations on the regulator, but it must not be deviated from. I hope that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will set that in place. In terms of the history of regulation in the UK, a large number of people think the system, while rightly seeking to ensure extensive consumer protection, has come at the cost of overspecification for the wholesale markets to no benefit at all and to the diminution of our standing.<\/p><p pid=\"b626.1\/8\">The other point has also been raised, but it is important. The 2021 Act has given a huge increase in power to the regulators in a way that we have seen with very few  other regulators, by which I mean the lack of scrutiny in this House. I note that the financial services document &#8220;Future Regulatory Framework (FRP) review&#8221; has come out and it talks about this, and my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire referred to evidence to the Treasury Committee. Because of the importance of this industry to the country, I urge the House to consider very carefully establishing a Select Committee of both Houses or indeed a standing sub-committee of the Treasury Committee. I do not accept the argument that several have put that there is not the expertise or capability within this House, or that this House is not able to get the necessary resources and capability brought into it to undertake that proper and appropriate parliamentary scrutiny.<\/p><p pid=\"b626.1\/9\">Finally, in the last minute of my speech I want to talk about two other matters. We have talked a lot about the past and what financial services has done, but it could do a lot more to help in what this Government and this country want to achieve. If levelling up means anything, it means bringing opportunity to the regions of this country. Financial services is already a powerful industry in the regions of this country, and bringing in those high-paid, high-value jobs also brings in skills. We should be doing all sorts of things to encourage that, not necessarily just within Government; universities should specialise in master&#8217;s degrees in financial capabilities and regulation. We should be focusing heavily on developing the UK as a centre of financial skills. That way we would not only drive UK levelling up but bring the talent to make London and the other global centres of this country into the powerhouse of financial services.<\/p><p pid=\"b626.1\/10\">Finally, the Government have done a huge amount of good work already in delivering the net-zero economy from financial services. Financial services can do much more in that area; all sorts of things, particularly using the tax system, have been done already, but we can do much more, and the financial services sector must play its role to deliver that objective.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b173.2\/1\">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairpersonship, Mrs Miller. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Chris Bryant\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10761\">the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)<\/phrase>, everyone in the all-party  parliamentary group and all Members who have contributed to the debate on the many serious issues that they have raised, and on the work that they are doing to highlight individuals who they believe should be sanctioned under the Magnitsky regime. I reiterate the official Opposition&#8217;s previous welcome to the Government&#8217;s implementation of the regime, which many in this House had long called for, including some in this room and the Opposition. I put on the record again our heartfelt condolences to the family of Sergei Magnitsky and I salute all those who have campaigned in his honour.<\/p><p pid=\"b173.2\/2\">Tragically, human rights abuses are on the rise globally. Unfortunately, as we have seen, the pandemic has exacerbated such abuses around the world: criminals have been using the global disarray as a vessel to broaden their operations and corruption, and dictators have been using the pandemic as an excuse to crush political dissent. Indeed, 70% of the countries covered by the Economist Intelligence Unit&#8217;s democracy index have recorded a decline in their overall democracy scores, with the lowest scores since 2006. The Opposition have pledged to put human rights at the heart of our international policies with consistency and with a commitment and resolve to act to defend liberties, the rights of all around the world and our international obligations. This debate is therefore very welcome.<\/p><p pid=\"b173.2\/3\">The Magnitsky sanctions have given us the power to stop violations against civilians without subjecting them to the consequences of broader-brush sanctions, which could harm them. They provide accountability, a deterrent against carrying out gross violations of human rights, compliance with international human rights law, respect for human rights, and respect for democracy, the rule of law and good governance.<\/p><p pid=\"b173.2\/4\">We know that sanctions work and have a significant impact, especially if we adopt them in further partnership with allies. They have little impact if they are just used unilaterally, but when we work in concert with our allies, such as the United States and European Union, they can have a huge impact. Together, the UK, the US, the EU and Canada represent one third of global GDP, yet they are also the locations where billions of pounds&#8217; worth of dirty blood money passes through. The potential to have an impact on individuals responsible for human rights abuses and corruption is at our fingertips, not least those who use London as their bolthole, as has been referred to.<\/p><p pid=\"b173.2\/5\">It is welcome that corruption has been included in the regime of offences for which sanctions can be applied under the 2021 regulations. We hope that will act as a huge deterrent to the activity that sees &#163;100 billion illegally flowing through the UK every year, according to the National Crime Agency. We have seen the FCDO designate 49 individuals with sanctions, including visa restrictions and asset freezes: Saudis involved in the death of Jamal Khashoggi, Russians involved in the murder of Sergei Magnitsky, Myanmar generals involved in genocide against the Rohingya and those involved in North Korean concentration camps.<\/p><p pid=\"b173.2\/6\">A year later, we saw 78 designations identified by Redress, with 24 sanctions specifically on the basis of corruption. They included those in Russia, the Guptas in relation to South Africa, Sudanese businessmen and Latin Americans involved in bribery. I understand that the FCDO will not publish the list of individuals it is investigating to designate for sanctions. I appreciate the  reasons for that but I agree with Members that the sanctions regime is not going far enough with the individuals designated. There is a great contrast between the UK, which has applied only 78 designations this year, and the US, which has designated 340 individuals. As <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Tim Loughton\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10371\">the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)<\/phrase> said, the UK sanctioned only 24% individuals and entities already sanctioned by the United States Magnitsky regime. We must go further.<\/p><p pid=\"b173.2\/7\">Many important examples have been raised today; I hope the Minister will listen to them all. I want to draw attention to a few others. My former brief related to sub-Saharan Africa; my understanding is that sanctions have been issued only relating to South Africa and Gambia, when of course there are many other individuals who should be dealt with. We heard of Sudan; I want to draw the Minister&#8217;s attention to the situation of Eritrea and the horrific human rights abuses, including horrific sexual violence and sexual human rights abuses taking place in Ethiopia. I hope the Minister will actively consider individuals who have been involved in perpetrating crimes there and, of course, the wider crimes by the Eritrean regime against its own citizens.<\/p><p pid=\"b173.2\/8\">We have heard about Sudan and Rwanda, and we should be considering locations from Cameroon to Zimbabwe when it comes to individuals responsible for heinous acts, as well as Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. We have rightly heard a huge amount of attention on China and Hong Kong; there have only been three designations against officials in the Chinese regime, despite horrific abuses against the Uyghur population. I agree with colleagues who raised the situation of Chen Quanguo&#8212;a prime example of an individual who should face sanctions. It is absurd that the US has designated that individual but we have not.<\/p><p pid=\"b173.2\/9\">I hope the Minister will listen closely. We have heard excellent contributions about Sri Lanka. I have raised in this place other regimes, including Bahrain in the middle east. We also heard today of Iran. We need consistency in policies. If we are to apply sanctions, we cannot cosy up to regimes in other ways. Let us look at the situation of Saudi Arabia, which the former shadow Foreign Secretary, my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Lisa Nandy\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24831\">the Member for Wigan (Lisa Nandy)<\/phrase>, raised in relation to Saudi acquisition of assets here. I also want to raise concern about parliamentary scrutiny. They have that in the United States Congress; we should have it here.<\/p><p pid=\"b173.2\/10\">I hope the Minister can outline the practical ways in which we can provide information confidentially&#8212;not just in debates such as this, with due regard to privilege&#8212;and how we will work across Government to ensure that information is fed in from all Government Departments, not just the FCDO.<\/p>",

I do not propose to speak to that in any detail, because they have already made the case, as did the Member for Wrexham, Sarah Atherton, in the other place.<\/p><p pid=\"a1919.0\/3\">If there was only one Minister who was keen to keep service justice the way it is and for issues of murder, manslaughter, domestic violence, and so on, to be kept in the courts martial system, that suggests, as my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford pointed  out, that the Minister perhaps does not share the same views as the Secretary of State. Clearly, it is not the job of your Lordships&#8217; House to persuade the Minister to come clean on her personal view; she is clearly speaking for the Government. However, if there is perhaps some difference of opinion within the MoD, might it be possible for the Minister to think again and for her to persuade Members of the other place to think again? The cases that have been put forward&#8212;the words of Johnny Mercer MP and the report brought forward by the Defence Committee of the House of Commons&#8212;are compelling.<\/p><p pid=\"a1919.0\/4\">I suggest that Motion B1 is in some way superior to what the Government are asking us not to agree with&#8212;that we do not go with the amendment that we voted on and approved on Report. At that stage, the amendment just talked about the Secretary of State, but that is slightly ambiguous. Which Secretary of State? The assumption implicit in that amendment was that it was the Secretary of State for Defence. However, on Report, the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, pointed out that the situation was vital in Northern Ireland, and there it would not be necessarily be the Secretary of State for Defence that mattered so much as the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The new amendment makes clear the import of what we had intended in the first place, all the way back at Second Reading and in Committee, that central government should be brought within the purview of the Bill.<\/p><p pid=\"a1919.0\/5\">The Minister says that this is about ensuring that key policymakers have the right information. She seemed to imply that this related only to local government, housing associations, local health providers&#8212;that is, people providing health, education and welfare support that come under the Bill. But surely that relates also to central government. In particular, it relates to all parts of central government. It does not just relate to the Secretary of State for Defence, particularly if he is caught up some blind alley. It also relates to the Home Secretary. We have already heard about some aspects of what might appear to be issues related to the military being passed over to the Home Office. Surely it is not adequate for the Secretary of State for Defence to report annually to the other place if what we need is the Home Secretary to bear in mind the needs of veterans and service personnel, particularly those who served in Hong Kong, or maybe the Gurkhas.<\/p><p pid=\"a1919.0\/6\">There is a need for the Bill to apply to central government as well as to local government and other authorities. I urge the House to support Motion B1 as well as Motion A1.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c258.1\/1\">I am pleased the right hon. Gentleman did not throw a book at the Dispatch Box this time. Let me repeat what I just said: no one extra in scope, no change in criteria, and judicial oversight still there for an appeal. Let us be clear that we cannot simply allow someone who could cause high harm to this country, or who has gained citizenship via fraud, to avoid these provisions simply by hiding away&#8212;for example, in one of the repressive regimes that some Opposition Members seem far too supportive of&#8212;where we cannot reasonably issue them with a notice. We cannot be in a position where we could never deprive someone of citizenship just because it is not practical to pop a letter in the post to them.<\/p><p pid=\"c258.1\/2\">I turn now to new clause 2, which I am afraid would undermine a long-standing principle of British nationality law dating back to 1915, under which nationality or entitlement to nationality is not passed on to the second and subsequent generations born and settled outside the UK and its territories, creating quite a major precedent. However, I do hear the strong point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Henry Smith\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24802\">the Member for Crawley (Henry Smith)<\/phrase> and, to be fair, by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10133\">the right hon. Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)<\/phrase>. We will continue to consider what more we could do, particularly given the low uptake of the &#163;40 million Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office fund designed to assist this diaspora community, and we will certainly be keen to look at that and, potentially, at how it could allow those people to settle here in the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"c258.1\/3\">My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Andrew Rosindell\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11199\">the Member for Romford (Andrew Rosindell)<\/phrase> spoke powerfully to new clause 4. The Government remain extremely grateful to former British Hong Kong service personnel. He will be aware that under the British nationality selection scheme a limited number of personnel who were settled in Hong Kong could apply to register as British citizens. Additionally, because they were all adults at the time, all such veterans would have been eligible to acquire BNO status between 1986 and 1987. We therefore believe that most should hold BNO status and be eligible for the BNO route.<\/p><p pid=\"c258.1\/4\">Granting the right of abode would set quite a precedent. However, I am pleased to confirm that the Home Secretary has identified an option that will enable our Government to treat this group of personnel in a similar way to other non-UK service personnel who were based in Hong Kong before handover. To be clear, that would be on top of the existing pathways they are already eligible for, including the BNO visa route and any other route. There is considerable work to be done to fully scope the impacts of this policy and the practicalities of its delivery, and I will aim to provide further details to the House as  soon as I am able to, with a view to a solution being provided before the end of the next calendar year. I hope that that is of reassurance to my hon. Friend, whose regular challenge to us is that it is not just about having an idea; it is also about having a timeline to deliver it.<\/p><p pid=\"c258.1\/5\">My right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Damian Green\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10241\">the Member for Ashford (Damian Green)<\/phrase> and others spoke powerfully about new clause 5, which raises issues about eligibility for the BNO route and particularly about those who were too young to obtain BNO status before the handover to China and whose BNO parents or grandparents, with whom they form a household, do not wish to apply for that route&#8212;effectively, they do not wish to move from Hong Kong. There are issues with the new clause as it is drafted, given that it does not contain an age limit and its scope could extend even to those who have never set foot in Hong Kong. However, we hear the very strong points that have been made, and we very much recognise the importance of our close ties to the people of Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"c258.1\/6\">I emphasise that those who are not eligible for the BNO route have a number of other UK immigration routes available to them, not least the very expanded skilled worker route. Individuals from Hong Kong can also apply to come, for example, as a student. As my right hon. Friend referred to, there is the existing youth mobility scheme, which is open to those aged between 18 and 30 and which offers a two-year grant of leave in the UK, with scope to switch, once people are here, to routes that lead to permanent settlement. There are currently 1,000 places available each year, and the scheme is substantially under-subscribed.<\/p><p pid=\"c258.1\/7\">We believe that those existing measures allow a lot of people to come, and we expect one or two of the new routes being created next year to also open up a pathway to this age group in Hong Kong, alongside others. However, my right hon. Friend asked me about two specific points. First, if the other side unilaterally enacted its provision, that would not automatically change the immigration rules here in the United Kingdom. That would be something we would have to do to close the route for applications by Hong Kong nationals. I must be clear that if unilateral action happened that further damaged the rights and abilities of people in Hong Kong, the Government would look closely at whether to maintain the scheme, to put something else in its place or to continue to allow it to go forward. I point out that we have a number of successful YMS schemes.<\/p><p pid=\"c258.1\/8\">On the timeline for applications, whatever route we put in place&#8212;I would not want to disabuse my right hon. Friend&#8212;there would be a period of time between applying and getting a decision. In the context of our simplification process and the fact that we have moved to create, in some cases, wholly digital pathways for application to the BNO route by Hong Kong citizens, we are certainly happy to look again at whether some of those principles could be applied to the YMS in Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"c258.1\/9\">I noted the comments from <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Rob Roberts\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25852\">the hon. Member for Delyn (Rob Roberts)<\/phrase>. We very much welcome and value the contribution of overseas workers in the NHS; that is why we introduced the health and care worker visa. However, making changes in one area would potentially require changes in others, including to routes that some other NHS staff are on. I should also point out that new clause 7 itself would see the applicant, if they left  NHS employment within three years, having to pay the fee. I can understand why he sought to put his provision into the Bill, but it would be quite a novel approach that would be difficult for the Home Office to operationalise and would inevitably require enforcement. That is why we do not think it is the right approach.<\/p><p pid=\"c258.1\/10\">I am grateful for the opportunity to debate children registered as British citizens under new clause 8. However, I must be clear that we are still waiting for the Supreme Court to give its judgment on this issue, and we will then look to respond.<\/p><p pid=\"c258.1\/11\">We do not believe we can accept new clause 33, as we believe all applicants for UK nationality should be treated the same in the tests applied, but we are considering how the issue could be picked up as part of our work on simplification&#8212;applying it not only to those who hold settled status under the EU settlement scheme, but potentially to ILR holders more broadly. Although we will not accept the new clause today, I hope the hon. Member for Glasgow North East will be pleased to hear that we are looking closely at that work. I emphasise again, as I have said many times before, that no one has been refused British citizenship purely on the basis of the CSI requirement in free movement regulations.<\/p><p pid=\"c258.1\/12\">Turning to amendment 2 in the name of <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Alistair Carmichael\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10785\">the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)<\/phrase>, which would remove clause 10, unfortunately we are seeing an increasing trend of applications for children whose parents did not take the step of registering their child&#8217;s birth with their embassy or high commission, leaving their child without a nationality. Given the request for data, concerns about the use of that route were confirmed by Home Office sampling.<\/p><p pid=\"c258.1\/13\">Of more than 200 cases sampled, 96% of parents were Indian or Sri Lankan. Crucially, a child born in the UK to a parent from those countries can only access their citizenship if the parent registers the birth at the relevant high commission. To register the child&#8217;s birth they would need to comply with the requirements set. Within the sample, 90% of Indian and Sri Lankan parents had chosen to contact the high commission to obtain letters to show their child was in fact not a citizen, and so clearly had no problem in approaching their authorities. In many cases, the parents had, I think it is safe to say, a chequered immigration record, with only 16% of parents having permission to be in the UK at the time of the child&#8217;s birth. In 67% of the cases, the parents had obtained leave to remain in the UK as a result of the child&#8217;s applications. That points to why we believe this is a clear concern.<\/p><p pid=\"c258.1\/14\">To deal quickly with amendments 110 and 111, amendment 110 would mean in practical terms that parents who had chosen not to register their child&#8217;s birth could argue it was not in their child&#8217;s best interest to have their nationality. That could raise some obvious issues and concerns and create quite an argument, when in reality that is not something they should be doing&#8212;certainly not for an immigration benefit.<\/p><p pid=\"c258.1\/15\">Overall, the package of measures in the Bill is fair and proportionate. Again, I say, as many Members have done in their interventions, that the scaremongering about some of the provisions in the Bill and about people who would never be in the scope of the tight criteria for deprivation of citizenship is nothing less than shocking. The criteria applies to those who have committed the worst offences or who are literally overseas committing  war crimes. This will never apply in the way that Opposition Members have suggested. I urge the House to reject some of the nonsense that we have heard and vote to support these measures, which will transform our migration system and make sure that we have a nationality system that is fit for purpose.<\/p><p pid=\"c258.1\/16\">Question put, That the clause be read a Second time.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>Diolch yn fawr, Dirprwy Lywydd. Thank you very much for the opportunity to update Members about the latest and very serious development in this fast-moving pandemic. At the end of last week, the World Health Organization advised countries around the world to take a series of measures following the identification of a new variant of concern of coronavirus. The variant, now called omicron, was first reported to the World Health Organization from South Africa six days ago. In less than a week, cases of omicron have been identified in countries as far apart as Australia, Hong Kong, Belgium, Israel and Canada. It has also reached the UK. And, I'm afraid, it will only be a matter of time, despite all the measures we have put in place, before the first cases are confirmed in Wales.<\/p><p>I want to share with you what we know so far, and what we are doing to respond to slow the inevitable and to keep Wales safe. We are taking the emergence of omicron seriously. It has a larger number of mutations than any of the variants seen previously&#8212;more than 50 overall. If we look at the part of the virus that makes first contact with our body's cells, there are 10 mutations in the omicron variant. The delta variant, which quickly became the most dominant strain last winter, had only two.<\/p><p>The evidence from South Africa so far suggests this variant may move quickly and be capable of re-infecting people who have already had coronavirus or have been double vaccinated. But there&#8217;s a lot we still don&#8217;t know, and won&#8217;t know for a while. This includes whether it leads to a more severe form of illness.<\/p><p>Yesterday, the First Minister and the First Minister of Scotland wrote to the Prime Minister requesting a COBRA meeting to discuss a co-ordinated four-nations response to this variant. Disappointingly, the Prime Minister&#8217;s spokesman has declined this request. A joined-up, four-nations approach would be the most effective response to this new variant.<\/p><p>Over the course of the weekend, we've been able to move together with the rest of United Kingdom, however. We have all put 10 southern African countries linked to the omicron variant on the red list for international travel. This means that anyone returning to the UK from these countries will have to complete 10 days of quarantine in a managed quarantine hotel. In addition, vaccinated travellers coming back to the UK from a non-red list country will have to self-isolate and take a PCR test on day two of their return. They can leave isolation if and when they have a negative result.&#160;If their test is positive, they will need to isolate for 10 days. People they live with will also need to isolate until they've had a negative test. These new rules replace the requirement to have a lateral flow test when returning from overseas, and is another step to prevent the variant from spreading in our communities. We will retain the option of introducing a PCR test at day 8 at a later date.<\/p><p>Last night, the education Minister strengthened the use of face coverings in secondary schools, colleges and universities for the rest of the winter term. All staff and learners should wear face coverings while indoors where physical distancing cannot be maintained. And we'll change our self-isolation rules so that everyone identified as a close contact of a confirmed or even a suspected omicron case in Wales will need to isolate for 10 days, regardless of their vaccination status or age. And we hope these actions, when taken together with all the other protections in place in Wales, will help to slow the spread of this variant.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1212.0\/1\">My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement from today and for the Statement from Friday. I add my thanks to the scientists in South Africa for their prompt sharing of this information, as unwelcome as it may be.<\/p><p pid=\"b1212.0\/2\">We understand that scientists believe that it will take two to three weeks before they can establish whether the omicron Covid variant is more transmissible, causes more severe disease or can make vaccines less effective than was the case with delta, or all three. We support the Government&#8217;s strategy of tougher travel restrictions and mandatory face masks, as far as it goes. It seems that there is already real-world evidence from South Africa and Hong Kong that omicron is highly infectious, which begs the first question: why are the Government limiting the mandating of mask wearing to travel and to shops, and not extending it to indoor meetings and social events? Mask wearing is the single most effective public health measure in tackling Covid according to the first global study of its kind, which found that the measure was linked to a 53% fall in the incidence of the disease. As Dr David Nabarro said recently:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1212.0\/3\">&#8220;We know that wearing a face mask reduces the risk. We know that maintaining physical distance reduces the risk. We know that hygiene by regular hand washing and coughing into your elbow reduces the risk. We should do it all, and we should not rely on any one intervention like vaccination on its own.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b1212.0\/4\">On these Benches, we support taking swift action and the inclusion of new countries on the red list. We do not want a repeat of the inertia that saw the delta variant run rampant through the country and, as the Minister said, we must protect the progress that we have made. We welcome an increase in the availability of the booster jabs. The only question that I would ask him is about the capacity of the NHS to deliver the massive increase that the Government have reported today.<\/p><p pid=\"b1212.0\/5\">We support the move to PCR testing, but there are still holes in the testing programme. Ministers have not introduced pre-departure testing and there is little, if any, follow-up on PCR test results, so we need action on this if we are to take it seriously.<\/p><p pid=\"b1212.0\/6\">The Government could, of course, go further to keep people safe. Fixing sick pay, improving ventilation and properly utilising antivirals remain crucial to ensuring that we reduce the spread of this deadly disease. Do any of these feature in the Government&#8217;s plans?<\/p><p pid=\"b1212.0\/7\">I agreed with my right honourable friend the former Prime Minister Gordon Brown when he said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1212.0\/8\">&#8220;Whatever happens to this particular variant, we&#8217;ve got to realise our failure to vaccinate the rest of world &#8230; is going to come back to haunt us.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b1212.0\/9\">He said that the new variant was a &#8220;wake up call&#8221; for rich nations with surplus vaccines. There seem to be surplus vaccines which will expire within the next month. How many vaccines in the UK will pass their use-by dates before Christmas, and will these be destroyed? I am afraid that Ministers have not met the commitments made at this summer&#8217;s G7 to roll out the vaccine to other parts of the globe. There is now sufficient vaccine to reach almost every adult in the world. I agree with the Minister that we need to play our part in ensuring that everyone around the globe has access to vaccines to stop the emergence of new variants.<\/p><p pid=\"b1212.0\/10\">This variant is indeed a wake-up call. The pandemic is not over. We need to act with speed to bolster our defences to keep the virus at bay. In that context, I ask the Minister about preparedness for new Covid variants in general. Both Clive Dix and Kate Bingham, former chairs of the Vaccine Taskforce, have expressed worries about our preparedness for dealing with new variants. Mr Dix has said of a paper that he sent to No. 10 in May:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1212.0\/11\">&#8220;I wrote a very specific proposal on what we should put in place right now for the emergence of any new virus that escaped the vaccine.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b1212.0\/12\">It seems that, thus far, No. 10 has not responded, so perhaps I can ask on Mr Dix&#8217;s behalf what the Government&#8217;s plan is for an escape variant? What is the plan for resistance for the future? The country needs to know. He suggested that a strategy should involve a co-ordinating team to seek out new vaccines and give the company involved a fast track to a swift trial, access to the data and regulatory approval in return for early access to vaccines. If that sounds familiar, it is exactly what the Government did at the start of the pandemic, and it needs to be repeated. Is this in the Government&#8217;s plan?<\/p><p pid=\"b1212.0\/13\">Reports from South Africa and other places indicate that the new infection seems to manifest itself with nausea, headaches, fatigue and a high pulse rate, but not the original and distinguishing features of loss of taste or smell, nor the headaches, sore throat, runny nose, fever and persistent cough which have been the most common in the delta variant. Will the NHS stick to the old symptom guide or will it update it to allow those running test and trace to recognise that they are not necessarily looking for things like loss of taste and smell but for other symptoms?<\/p><p pid=\"b1212.0\/14\">If the Government intend to report again in three weeks&#8217; time, if not before, it takes us into the Recess, so I would like the Minister to ensure that colleagues will be briefed appropriately. On Saturday evening, the Secretary of State held a Zoom call to brief MPs about the new world that we now entering. I hope that the Minister will do the same for all Members of your Lordships&#8217; House.<\/p><p pid=\"b1212.0\/15\">We must all be concerned that any spike in serious cases from this new variant could coincide with the NHS&#8217;s peak winter period, particularly given that the service is already at full stretch. We all want to enjoy Christmas but, most of all, we all want to stay safe.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a596.1\/1\">With permission, I would like to update the House on covid-19. Before I begin, I wish the shadow Secretary of State, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jon Ashworth\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25120\">the right hon. Member for Leicester South (Jonathan Ashworth)<\/phrase>, well as he recovers from covid-19.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.1\/2\">Over the past 48 hours, a small number of cases of a new variant have been detected on our international genomic database. I want to reassure the House that there are no detected cases of this variant in the UK at this time, but this new variant is of huge international concern. The World Health Organisation has called a special meeting this morning, and that meeting is taking place right now. I want to update the House on what we know so far, why we are concerned and the action that we are taking, although I must stress that this is a fast-moving situation and there remains a high degree of uncertainty.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.1\/3\">The sequence of this variant, currently called B.1.1.529, was first uploaded by Hong Kong from a case of someone travelling from South Africa. The UK was the first country to identify the potential threat of this new variant and to alert international partners. Further cases have been identified in South Africa and Botswana, and it is highly likely that it has now spread to other countries. Yesterday, the South African Government held a press conference where they provided an update on what they know so far. I want to put on the record my thanks to South Africa not only for its rigorous scientific response but for the openness and transparency with which it has acted, much as we did here in the United Kingdom when we first detected what is now known as the alpha variant.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.1\/4\">We are concerned that this new variant may pose substantial risk to public health. The variant has an unusually large number of mutations. Yesterday, the UK Health Security Agency classified B.1.1.529 as a new variant under investigation, and the variant technical group has designated it as a variant under investigation with very high priority. It is the only variant with this designation, making it higher priority than beta. It shares many of the features of the alpha, beta and delta variants. Early indications show that this variant may be more transmissible than the delta variant, and current vaccines may be less effective against it. It may also impact the effectiveness of one of our major treatments, Ronapreve.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.1\/5\">We are also worried about the rise in cases in countries in southern Africa, especially as these populations should have significant natural immunity. In South Africa in particular, there has been exponential growth, with cases increasing fourfold over the last two weeks. In Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg and Pretoria, some 80% of cases, when tested with a PCR test, have shown something known as the S-gene drop-out, which we associate with this variant. While we do not yet know definitively whether the exponential growth in South Africa is directly associated with this new variant, this PCR test analysis does indicate that there could be many more cases of this new variant than just those that have been sequenced so far.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.1\/6\">Even as we continue to learn more about this new variant, one of the lessons of this pandemic has been that we must move quickly and at the earliest possible moment. The UK remains in a strong position. We have made tremendous gains as a result of the decisions that we took over the summer and the initial success of our booster programme, but we are heading into winter and our booster programme is still ongoing so we must act with caution. We are therefore taking the following steps. Yesterday, I announced that from midday today, we are placing six countries in southern Africa on the travel red list. These countries are: South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Namibia and Zimbabwe.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.1\/7\">Anyone who is not a UK or Irish resident who has been in one of these countries in the past 10 days will be denied entry into England. UK and Irish residents arriving from these countries from 4 am on Sunday will enter hotel quarantine. Anyone arriving before those dates should take PCR tests on day 2 and day 8, even if they are vaccinated, and isolate at home along with the rest of their household. If you have arrived from any of these countries in the past 10 days, NHS Test and Trace will be contacting you and asking you to take PCR tests, but please, do not wait to be contacted; you should take PCR tests right away. We have been working closely with the devolved Administrations on this, and they will be aligning their response. In recent hours, Israel has also taken similar precautions.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.1\/8\">I wish to stress that we are working quickly and with a high degree of uncertainty. We are continuing to make assessments, including about those countries with strong travel links to South Africa, and we are working with our international partners, including South Africa and the European Union, to ensure an aligned response. This variant is a reminder for us all that this pandemic is far from over. We must continue to act with caution and do all we can to keep this virus at bay, including, once you are eligible, getting your booster shot. We have already given more than 16 million booster shots. The booster jab was already important before we knew about this variant, but now it could not be more important. Please, if you are eligible, get your booster shot. Do not delay.<\/p><p pid=\"a596.1\/9\">We have made great progress against this virus&#8212;progress that we are determined to hold on to. This Government will continue to do whatever is necessary to keep us safe, and we all have our part to play. I commend this statement to the House.<\/p>",

It is important because the reluctance of parliamentarians to understand the public&#8217;s dismay at the flagrant loss of control of national borders is a democratic problem.<\/p><p pid=\"c1084.0\/2\">This discussion comes a day after a tragedy of unspeakable horror, but that horrendous incident must not be used to chill a frank national discussion, reviewing all sides of the debate and all opinions. Why has this issue of record numbers crossing the channel by boat led to popular fury and frustration? It is not, as some assume, proof of widespread anti-immigrant sentiment. Let us note that 99.9% of the British public have a track record of humane generosity in, for example,  welcoming any number of Hong Kong citizens fleeing authoritarianism. There are many examples, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hoey, explained.<\/p><p pid=\"c1084.0\/3\">I remember when some at the Home Office crassly interpreted the Brexit vote through the prism of racism and thought the hostile environment policy would be popular. Instead, leavers and remainers united in rejecting the cruel consequences meted out on the Windrush generation&#8212;still a top-down, shameful scandal&#8212;so let us not think this is racism. No, what is infuriating citizens about these channel crossings is not numbers or migrants. It is because they are told by too many in power that there is no alternative.<\/p><p pid=\"c1084.0\/4\">Over the last 20 months, the Border Force has looked helpless before a ceaseless flow of boats arriving on the shores of Kent, throwing up its hands with a series of &#8220;What can we do?&#8221; excuses. The Home Secretary talks tough, and tougher, but the public can see no change. This just seems like an abandonment of even the pretence of border control. It also makes a mockery of Brexit voters&#8217; very firm expression of popular sovereignty&#8212;to take back control&#8212;if you cannot take control even of your national borders.<\/p><p pid=\"c1084.0\/5\">I do not pretend that practical solutions are easy but nothing should be off the table. I was impressed by an article by Sherelle Jacobs earlier in the week which weighed up a range of options. What we cannot conclude is that no matter what we do, nothing can stop the ceaseless crossings. I noted that a lot of people said today that nothing can be done unless we work with the EU&#8212;not happening. This fatalism and lack of choice make a mockery of politics, legislation and democracy.<\/p><p pid=\"c1084.0\/6\">Some here, and I might sympathise with this, think that the UK should offer to take greater numbers of asylum seekers legally. But then we need to convince the majority of our fellow citizens about this policy, not impose it on them as a humanitarian fait accompli. Priti Patel accuses would-be economic migrants of disguising themselves as asylum seekers. Perhaps that is true, by the way, as many pro-refugee NGOs have moralised migration so much that the only way you can justify it now is on the basis of suffering. This narrative where the only valid migrants are ones who show their scars and say they are fleeing persecution does them no favours. There is a valid case for economic migration; I am the daughter of economic migrants, in fact.<\/p><p pid=\"c1084.0\/7\">Those boats are not full of an indistinguishable mass of people. Some are economic migrants, some are good people and some are bad people&#8212;and some might be terrorists. It is naive to dismiss any worries about security by making them all out to be angels; it is actually condescending. Those nuances and the disputes get buried, if we moralise this discussion.<\/p><p pid=\"c1084.0\/8\">Controlling our borders is not interchangeable with closing our borders, but democratic decision-making is dependent on the borders that are secure. The problem is that those charged with controlling our borders seem to have given up on the mission. In his valedictory speech, the outgoing head of the UK Border Force, Paul Lincoln, declared:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1084.0\/9\">&#8220;Bloody borders are just such a pain in the bloody ass.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1084.0\/10\">This seeming indifference to borders by a senior civil servant reminded me of the famous description by the noble Lord, Lord Reid, of the border agency as &#8220;not  fit for purpose&#8221;. Now it seems that we are worse off, because we have a Border Force chief who lacks purpose altogether. If Mr Lincoln does not believe that enforcing the integrity of Britain&#8217;s borders is crucial, just thinks that it is a nuisance, and does not understand why borders matter, we are in trouble.<\/p><p pid=\"c1084.0\/11\">Let me state here: borders matter, because they are the basis on which national sovereignty&#8212;that is, democratic accountability&#8212;is realised. Maintaining the integrity of a community&#8217;s borders is essential for the conduct of democratic life. Borders are not just barriers; they delineate the geographic space within which a political community is constituted. It is where citizenship is forged and our rights are afforded. In our role as equal citizens&#8212;whether from different migrant backgrounds or not&#8212;we, as voters, control politicians, and that is realised through citizenship. We take on board our duties and responsibilities for our country and our fellow citizens that way. To quote the anti-fascist philosopher, Hannah Arendt,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1084.0\/12\">&#8220;rights and duties must be defined and limited, not only by &#8230; fellow citizens, but also by the boundaries of a territory&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"c1084.0\/13\">Those bonds of citizenship, in which we take responsibility for the society in which we live, become stripped of meaning if there is no distinction between citizens and non-citizens. Citizenship becomes meaningless if you do not even know how many citizens live in a country.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c1052.0\/1\">My Lords, sometimes the word &#8220;remarkable&#8221; is overused in the context of our debates in your Lordships&#8217; House, but I do not think it would be overstating it to say that this has been a remarkable debate and I am truly grateful to all noble Lords who have contributed to it. My noble friend Lord Purvis talked about the importance of open parliamentary democracy. He said that it was the greatest rebuke that we could give to those who would silence other opinions.<\/p><p pid=\"c1052.0\/2\">A number of us have referred to one another as &#8220;noble friends&#8221; today even though we are from different places in the House. That is because many of us are friends. It has struck me that this has been a united response and the Minister is right to say that we have stood in solidarity on the fundamental freedoms. I cannot think of any better Minister to have answered the debate in your Lordships&#8217; House today.<\/p><p pid=\"c1052.0\/3\">The noble Lord, Lord Ahmad, and I go back a long way. I have never ceased to be impressed by his diligent approach to his portfolio and the commitment he has made to human rights and fundamental freedoms. I was very struck by his saying that he will be seeing a number of people in the future, including the Ambassador of the People&#8217;s Republic of China. I hope that whenever he has the opportunity, he will share the Hansard from today&#8217;s remarkable debate so that people will know the opinions that have been so freely expressed in your Lordships&#8217; House today.<\/p><p pid=\"c1052.0\/4\">The noble Lord, Lord Desai&#8212;who again is a noble friend&#8212;expressed an opinion that was different from those expressed in the mainstream of the debate, but that is the whole point of your Lordships&#8217; House. He remarked that often, silence was the reason why some of the terrible atrocities of the past occurred. There is some truth in what he said, and I was struck by how Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the Protestant theologian, and Edith Stein, a Catholic nun, both said no to the Nazis and both were executed. Indeed, Bonhoeffer said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1052.0\/5\">&#8220;Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1052.0\/6\">I think all of us have to bear in mind the privileges we enjoy in your Lordships&#8217; House&#8212;the truth-telling that my noble friend Lord Hastings enjoined upon us&#8212;and that we have a duty to use those privileges, liberties and freedoms whenever we have the chance.<\/p><p pid=\"c1052.0\/7\">The Minister gave some clarity to the questions that my noble friend asked, but the specific question of competent courts that are able to determine these matters&#8212;the point that the noble Lord, Lord Collins, made so effectively from the Opposition Front Bench&#8212;is still unresolved and lies at the heart of this debate. A voice that has not been heard today&#8212;but all the arguments have been listened to by him throughout&#8212;is that of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. If anyone can convince people of the merits of the amendments that he voted for during the passage of the Trade Bill, I know it is him.<\/p><p pid=\"c1052.0\/8\">Now that Mr Dominic Raab is the Lord Chancellor, he is in a very good position to do something about the circular argument whereby this issue is only for a competent court to address. Given his background, I know that this will be something close to his own heart. I have written to him about this essential issue and I hope that the Minister, whom I copied in, will ask him to share the reply with all who have participated during the debate today.<\/p><p pid=\"c1052.0\/9\">I cannot go point by point on everything that has been said&#8212;your Lordships would not want me to&#8212;but I particularly endorse what the Minister said about the roles of AUKUS and the United Nations. Here, again, I rather dissent from the slight pessimism of my noble friend Lord Desai. We were very blessed today to hear from my noble friend Lord Hannay, with his huge experience of the United Nations&#8212;in what was described  rightly as a moving and powerful speech&#8212;when he talked about his own experiences at the United Nations with Rwanda and Bosnia. We must remind ourselves of what he did when he was our ambassador at the United Nations, what the noble Lord does as our Minister responsible for the United Nations, and what most of us in your Lordships&#8217; House believe in, which is internationalism and the importance of nations standing together.<\/p><p pid=\"c1052.0\/10\">Dag Hammarskj&#246;ld, perhaps the greatest of the Secretaries-General, said that:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1052.0\/11\">&#8220;The United Nations was not created to take mankind to heaven, but to save humanity from hell.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1052.0\/12\">If anything, today, I think we have a glimpse of what hell may look like. My noble friend Lady Kennedy gave an analysis of the use of slave labour in Xinjiang and said that a genocide was in progress. My noble friend Lady Smith of Newnham said that following the Bosnia judgment, we have a duty to prevent at the instant&#8212;from that moment onwards&#8212;we come to know what is under way. The noble Lord, Lord Anderson of Ipswich, with his enormous experience of the law, gave us a forensic examination of atrocity crimes but he also referred to Nineteen Eighty-Four and the hollowing out of humanity. That phrase will stay with me.<\/p><p pid=\"c1052.0\/13\">My noble friend Lord Polak reminded us of the contribution of the late Lord Sacks to your Lordships&#8217; House. His books, The Dignity of Difference and The Home We Build Together, sit on my bookshelves and I look at them again and again, because that is what we have to crack: we have to find ways of learning to live together. He reminded us of the hope that Hanukkah holds out and, like the Minister, I wish him a great festival and celebration. I thank him for reminding us what hope looks like&#8212;as did the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of St Albans, who has done so much on this issue over such a long period. He asked us, &#8220;Are we going to be a force for good? Are we going to balance this with trade?&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1052.0\/14\">The noble Lord, Lord Cormack, referred to the way that William Wilberforce persisted over 40 years when ending the slave trade. But I am struck that people such as Richard Cobden, that great proponent of free trade, stood with Wilberforce as he did on the Opium Wars, which have been referred to. Not everyone went with these things and it is to the credit of parliamentarians that some said no and, in the end, the public changed their minds. The noble Lord reminded us that even when Wilberforce was on his deathbed&#8212;his book on the subject is well worth reading&#8212;the message was brought from Parliament to say that the law was being changed.<\/p><p pid=\"c1052.0\/15\">My noble friend Lady Finlay gave us horrific evidence of forced organ harvesting. She reminded us in her peroration about the dangers of unacceptable silence. I hope that when the Minister goes to Geneva, to talk again to the World Health Organization, he will take my noble friend with him.<\/p><p pid=\"c1052.0\/16\">We have heard speeches from the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, and my noble friend Lady Grey-Thompson about politics and sport. The very first speech I made in my student union in 1970&#8212;I remember trembling at the time&#8212;was on the Stop the Seventy Tour campaign. Why? It was because I opposed apartheid. Again, that  was a remarkable example of cross-party co-operation, of people standing together and ultimately changing the laws in South Africa, and people&#8217;s attitudes as well.<\/p><p pid=\"c1052.0\/17\">My noble friend Lady D&#8217;Souza talked about the insatiable need for cotton. She is right that we have to look, as the noble Lord, Lord Purvis, said, even at the ties we wear and ask ourselves where these things come from. During the campaign against slavery, there was a rising up of people through the sugar boycotts and suchlike which made parliamentarians say, &#8220;The public are behind us&#8212;let&#8217;s do something about it&#8221;. She also talked to us, as did my noble friend Lady O&#8217;Loan, about the wider consequences. The fearful harbinger of Hong Kong, as my noble friend reminded us, is held out in the context of Taiwan. The Minister was right to talk about the dangers that lurk in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, and how we have to stand with our natural allies&#8212;in Five Eyes, but specifically in AUKUS as well&#8212;in confronting these dangers.<\/p><p pid=\"c1052.0\/18\">My noble friend Lord Shinkwin reminded us of the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission and its admirable report, chaired by the noble Baroness, Lady Hodgson of Abinger. That report deserves to be read by every Member of your Lordships&#8217; House. He told us about the importance of dealing with supply chains; the recommendations in that report looked at ways of trying to sort out where commodities come from.<\/p><p pid=\"c1052.0\/19\">My noble friend Lady O&#8217;Loan told us about the things that have been happening to other groups of people. Yesterday was Red Wednesday, and the Minister reminded us all of the importance of freedom of religion or belief. Article 18 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights specifically says that everyone has the right to believe, not to believe or to change their belief; it is violated every day. One of your Lordships&#8217; parliamentary committees said that it is an orphaned right. We should take it out of the orphanage, and no one does more to do that than the Minister.<\/p><p pid=\"c1052.0\/20\">In the context of China, what is happening to the underground churches and Falun Gong, as referred to by my noble friend Lady Finlay? What is happening to Mongolians and people of many different extracts, religions and politics? We must deal with that.<\/p><p pid=\"c1052.0\/21\">My noble friend Lord Sandwich and others have made great contributions to your Lordships&#8217; House during this debate. I am conscious that there is another debate to follow. I think I was told that we have until 2.45 pm but I do not think I should trespass any longer on your Lordships&#8217; time, other than to say thank you to everyone who has taken part. We will not be silenced on this issue. All of us who have spoken today will return to it again and again, until this injustice is properly recognised and put right.<\/p><p class=\"italic\" pid=\"c1052.0\/22\">Motion agreed.<\/p>",

The equipment did not quite work and the greatest adventure anyone had was probably going to Northern Ireland every two years&#8212;that was about as far as it went. Hong Kong had closed and there was a lack of sense of purpose and a lack of a clearly identified adversary that we were setting ourselves against. That is really important.<\/p><p pid=\"a492.3\/2\">This Army will be more exciting, more rewarding and more enabling for young people to grow their skills. It will be more fluid with the integration of the reserves, which will allow reserves and regulars to be much more able to move from one to the other, depending on their personal circumstances. There is the investment in the different models for family accommodation and single living accommodation, and a determination to be out and about around the world. The one thing that soldiers do not want is to be stuck in a barracks in the UK doing not very much. They want to be out. I was in Oman only the other week seeing soldiers exercising with the Omanis, and they could not stop talking about how exciting and fun it was. I was in Poland last week watching the United Kingdom forces doing a live-firing exercise in Poland alongside Polish, United States and Croatian forces. That is what I want our Army to do.<\/p><p pid=\"a492.3\/3\">When we are thinking about soldiers&#8217; careers, we have to have a system that is much more enabling to them to move up and down the different functions of, for example, the infantry. By ensuring that we have these infantry divisions, young officers and young soldiers can, if there is not enough space in their own battalion to be a sergeant or a colour sergeant, move to promotions in such a function in a similar battalion in a similar division. A young officer who does not want to do armoured warfare, but wants to be with a security force assistance battalion abroad, they have such opportunities to move up and down. I think that will be exciting and flexible, and it will be an Army that will retain people because it will give them an exciting career and make sure that their families are properly looked after.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b765.0\/1\">My Lords, I thank all noble Lords for a genuinely interesting and thoughtful debate. I will focus on the amendments that comprise the grouping: Amendments 3 to 7 and Amendment 17. To that end, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, for tabling his well-intended&#8212;I know that that is what they are&#8212;Amendments 3, 5, 6 and 7, and I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Brinton, for supporting them.<\/p><p pid=\"b765.0\/2\">I was aware during the debate that some contributors made fairly wide-ranging speeches, not least focusing on citizens of Hong Kong and former Hong Kong military service personnel. These are important issues, but I would rather deal with them under Amendment 26, which seems more relevant to that particular area of concern. So, in addressing the amendments in group 2, I will confine my remarks to the issues covered by them.<\/p><p pid=\"b765.0\/3\">The purpose of these amendments is to widen the scope of the new covenant duty to the areas of employment, pensions, compensation, social care, criminal justice and immigration in all four home nations. As I made clear in Committee, the new duty created by the Bill is designed to initially focus on the three core functions of healthcare, education and housing. This quite simply reflects those already in statute that are the most commonly raised areas and where variation of service delivery across localities can inadvertently cause disadvantage to the Armed Forces community.<\/p><p pid=\"b765.0\/4\">Importantly, future areas of concern can be addressed as and when they arise through the powers in the Bill that allow the Government to widen the scope of the covenant duty, if needed, through secondary legislation. We are working with key stakeholders to establish an open and transparent process by which the scope of the legislation can successfully adapt to address the changing needs of the Armed Forces community.<\/p><p pid=\"b765.0\/5\">As a number of your Lordship have indicated, our plan is to use the covenant reference group as the focus of this work. It has a broad representation from the Armed Forces community, service charities, families&#8217; federations, the Local Government Association and senior officials from both central government departments in Westminster and the devolved Administrations. I suggest that the covenant reference group is therefore ideally placed to be closely involved in the future development and running of this process. It will bring the necessary expertise and representation together to best consider suitable additions to the scope of the duty.<\/p><p pid=\"b765.0\/6\">I wish to make clear&#8212;I am not being evasive or trying to elude or escape responsibility&#8212;that we have to be very careful about what we are creating with the Bill, understand how it will work in practice, make assessments, and then have a clearer sense of what may be needed and may require to be added in the future. This will also provide an opportunity for areas of concern to emerge and be highlighted, and it may be possible that these can be addressed through other means.<\/p><p pid=\"b765.0\/7\">In adopting this approach, we considered the practicalities of extending the covenant duty to further policy areas, and the timelines involved. Any addition to the scope of the duty will require extensive consultation with stakeholders and the devolved Administrations in order to identify the appropriate bodies and functions to bring into scope and to work through any issues arising as a result of different procedures and legal frameworks in devolved policy areas.<\/p><p pid=\"b765.0\/8\">I suggest that a better way forward lies in first working through and resolving any practical implications arising as the new covenant duty in the Bill is implemented. This will give us a good indication of where amendments may be required to better meet the changing needs of our Armed Forces community in the future.<\/p><p pid=\"b765.0\/9\">By retaining the flexible nature of the legislation, the Government hope to establish a firm legal foundation for the covenant while avoiding any unnecessary administrative burden. The new duty builds on the existing widespread commitment to the covenant, thereby contributing to a further strengthening of covenant delivery across the entire United Kingdom. That is not in any way dodging the bullet. I am not trying to be evasive; I am trying to explain why I think this a sensible and cautious way to proceed, and I therefore ask the noble Lord not to press these amendments.<\/p><p pid=\"b765.0\/10\">I turn to Amendment 4, tabled by my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern, and supported by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, and the noble Baroness, Lady Smith of Newnham. The purpose of Amendment 4 is to make central government departments subject to the new covenant duty. This new duty arises when a specified public body exercises a relevant function. Those functions, which are specified in the Bill, are exercised by local authorities and other public bodies, and are not matters for which central government has day-to-day responsibility.<\/p><p pid=\"b765.0\/11\">The problem with the amendment as drafted is that it would not, as I far as I can see, serve any identifiable meaningful purpose. I can understand the enthusiasm among opposition Members of this House to land anything they possibly can on the Government. I know that my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay is not motivated by these sentiments and that he genuinely believes that there is an omission here that should be addressed, but I am trying to explain that I am not quite clear what the omission is, and I am certainly not clear how the amendment would address it.<\/p><p pid=\"b765.0\/12\">It occurred to me that, in addressing the principle of this amendment, it would be useful to explain the Government&#8217;s thinking behind the design of the new covenant duty and how we see it establishing a firm foundation from which to build into the future. I hope noble Lords will indulge me: I will go into this in some detail because my noble and learned friend raises an important issue, and I believe it merits serious discussion and a considered response. I will attempt to give due attention to his amendment.<\/p><p pid=\"b765.0\/13\">As I have outlined before, in considering how to take forward our commitment to further strengthen the covenant in law, we looked first at what the covenant has already achieved without being brought into any statutory provision. The considerable number of successful covenant initiatives across many different policy areas shows how the covenant provides a framework through which the widespread admiration and support for our Armed Forces community can flourish, allows scope for innovation and permits future growth. That is why we designed the new covenant duty around the principle of &#8220;due regard&#8221; as a means of building greater awareness and understanding of the lives of the Armed Forces community, which will bolster, rather than weaken, this support.<\/p><p pid=\"b765.0\/14\">We considered carefully which functions and policy areas the covenant duty should encompass, including those that are the responsibility of central government. This required an assessment of the benefits arising from their inclusion, focusing on the purpose of the duty: to raise awareness among providers of public  services of how service life can disadvantage the Armed Forces community, and so encourage a more consistent approach across the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"b765.0\/15\">We were mindful that central government is responsible for the overall strategic direction for national policy, whereas the responsibility for the delivery of front-line services and their impact generally rests at local level. The Government are fully aware of issues impacting on the Armed Forces community. Indeed, we work with other departments and organisations to raise awareness across all service providers. The inclusion of central government in the scope of the duty was therefore not seen as necessary.<\/p><p pid=\"b765.0\/16\">The noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, raised a particular issue with reference to Northern Ireland. The key front-line services we wish to target are generally devolved issues. They are not the responsibility of the Westminster Government, so any additions to the scope of the duty in respect of central government would not address the concern he has but would cause a greater disparity in covenant delivery if the&#8212;<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a656.0\/1\">My Lords, when I was a young solicitor in north Wales, I recall a knock on the door at about 6 o&#8217;clock in the evening. There was an agitated man of Polish extraction on the doorstep saying, &#8220;Please come quickly. My friend is dying in hospital and he wants to make a will.&#8221; I went to the hospital, which was just around the corner, and discovered that the patient spoke only Polish. I said to the first man, &#8220;What are we going to do?&#8221; He said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t need an interpreter. I&#8217;ll do it. He wants to leave everything to me.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a656.0\/2\">I eventually found a Polish hospital porter who could confirm that the dying man did indeed wish to leave his estate to my new client&#8212;I hope he was not in collusion with him&#8212;and the porter and I witnessed the signing of the will, with the testator dying two hours later. I learned the importance then of having an interpreter.<\/p><p pid=\"a656.0\/3\">In Wales, of course, we had people involved in court proceedings who required Welsh interpreters as a matter of principle. I only ever once came across a monolingual Welsh speaker. In one case in Caernarfon&#8212;arson of a country cottage&#8212;the defendant insisted on an interpreter for every word of the proceedings, although he could speak English perfectly well, so everything was translated into Welsh. Then there came a moment, two weeks into the trial, when he asked the judge, the formidable Mr Justice Mars-Jones, in English, &#8220;Can I use the toilet, your Lordship?&#8221;, to which the judge wearily turned to the interpreter and said, &#8220;Translate into Welsh&#8221;, which was done.<\/p><p pid=\"a656.0\/4\">The NRPSI is an organisation concerned with the need for public protection. When an interpreter is working in a public service setting, possibly in a potentially life-changing interview situation, they are the only person who understands what both the parties are saying, so it is a crucial role. Of course, there is potential for abuse. The organisation was set up after a report in 1994, with help from the Home Office and the Nuffield Foundation. It is still a voluntary organisation with nearly 2,000 registrants offering more than 100 languages. Of course, it provides a selection of highly experienced professionals.<\/p><p pid=\"a656.0\/5\">However, interpreters who are not registered may still be employed. What is really needed is statutory regulation of the public service interpreting profession. In the past, things were different. I remember a man turning up at a Denbighshire quarter sessions claiming to be a Russian interpreter. When it turned out that his knowledge of Russian amounted to no more than putting &#8220;ski&#8221; on the back of every English word, he was locked up for contempt of court. I trust that has never happened to the right reverend Prelate with his interpretations.<\/p><p pid=\"a656.0\/6\">In Hong Kong, where I had considerable experience, the court interpreters were highly expert. They had to deal with a variety of languages from Putonghua, Cantonese to Mandarin, and a variety of regional languages in a court in which, prior to 1997, the proceedings were conducted in English, although English was spoken by only 4% of the population of Hong Kong. I recall on one occasion one of them took me aside and told me that my English grammar was wrong&#8212;the trouble was, he was right.<\/p><p pid=\"a656.0\/7\">I wish that that quality of interpretation existed in the courts of this country, so the noble Baroness will not be surprised to know that I wholeheartedly support this attempt to professionalise and recognise minimum standards for court interpreters.<\/p>",

That is what the Nationality and Borders Bill does and why we are creating safe and legal routes. My right hon. Friend will be familiar with much of our work that has taken place thus far with, for example, British nationals overseas&#8212;people from Hong Kong&#8212;and the work that is taking place on Afghanistan.<\/p><p pid=\"b28.3\/2\">The removal of people with no legal right to be in the United Kingdom and all rights exhausted is at the heart of the new plan for immigration and the Nationality and Borders Bill, because too many last-minute claims come through immigration courts and tribunals and prevent the Government from removing people who have no legal right to be here. They include foreign national offenders, including rapists and murderers&#8212;people who have committed awful and abhorrent crimes on the streets of the United Kingdom. I have to say it is quite telling that there is a great deal of lobbying from the Labour party to actually stand by many of these foreign national offenders and keep them in our country.<\/p>",

Friend raised.<\/p><p pid=\"d431.0\/2\">This continues to be the most concerning period in Hong Kong&#8217;s post-handover history. I acknowledge and share the deep concern of this House. The Chinese and Hong Kong authorities have taken a number of actions to stifle dissent and to suppress the expression of alternative political views in Hong Kong. Those include the imposition of the national security law in June last year, the mass arrest of politicians and activists, the disqualification of electoral candidates, and changes to Hong Kong&#8217;s own election processes.<\/p><p pid=\"d431.0\/3\">On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-10-25\">25 October<\/phrase>, Amnesty International announced that it would withdraw from Hong Kong by the end of this year. Amnesty says that the national security law is making it impossible to work freely without fear of Government reprisals. We have also seen the enforced closure of other non-governmental organisations and prosecution of their members under that law. Mainland Chinese and Hong Kong authorities have used the law to curtail freedoms, to punish dissent and to shrink the space for opposition, free press and civil society.<\/p><p pid=\"d431.0\/4\">Since 2016, the UK has declared four breaches of the Sino-British joint declaration in response to Beijing&#8217;s actions. The joint declaration was registered with the UN on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-06-12\">12 June<\/phrase> 1985. It is a legally binding international treaty that remains in force today. The joint declaration made it clear that Hong Kong&#8217;s high degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms would remain unchanged for 50 years from 1997. China undertook to uphold those freedoms of speech, of the press and of assembly, but the mainland Chinese authorities have shown an increasing propensity to breach their obligations in relation to Hong Kong. The national security law imposed on Hong Kong by Beijing in June 2020 contains a slew of measures that directly undermine those rights and freedoms. China&#8217;s own basic law for Hong Kong makes it clear that the territory should put forward and enact its own security legislation, but the direct imposition of the national security law clearly contravenes that.<\/p><p pid=\"d431.0\/5\">Last year, China&#8217;s National People&#8217;s Congress Standing Committee imposed new rules to disqualify elected legislators in Hong Kong. Last March, the National People&#8217;s Congress unilaterally decided to change Hong Kong&#8217;s election system. The changes give Chinese authorities greater control over who stands for elected office. Last month, 55 district councillors were disqualified and over 250 were pressured to resign for political reasons. This is a systematic and determined effort by Beijing to bring Hong Kong under its control, erasing the space for alternative political views and for legitimate political debate.<\/p><p pid=\"d431.0\/6\">The UK Government are committed to holding China to account. We responded quickly and decisively to the enactment of the national security law. Following its introduction, the UK declared China to be in breach of the joint declaration, and we have declared two further breaches since then&#8212;that is three breaches in the space of just nine months. The UK now believes that China is in an ongoing state of non-compliance with the joint declaration.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1403.0\/1\">My Lords, we should all be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, for introducing this important subject for debate. It is certainly timely but, although I share many of the concerns expressed by the noble Lord and others in this debate, I do not quite subscribe to his fears that this could be a step towards a surveillance state.<\/p><p pid=\"a1403.0\/2\">With schools beginning to investigate the possible use of biometric recognition technology, it is important that the Government make their position clear. This is not an area with which the Government are unfamiliar; the Department for Education issued 12 pages of advice as long ago as March 2018. Prior to this debate I was not aware of that, so it has not been given much publicity. I note that the document is termed &#8220;advice&#8221; rather than &#8220;guidance&#8221;. I do not know what the difference is but it seems to be a downgrade from guidance, and I think it is appropriate to ask the Minister to explain what she understands the difference between the two to be, if indeed there is one.<\/p><p pid=\"a1403.0\/3\">Publicity has been attracted to the introduction by a small number of schools in Ayrshire of facial recognition technology. Last week, it was announced that they had paused their use of it following concerns expressed by the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office. At the same time, I understand that a school in Greater Manchester has decided to abandon its planned rollout of a facial recognition system. It is not difficult to understand the rationale advanced by the company that supplied and installed systems in schools in Ayrshire: that facial recognition technology can speed up the delivery of school lunches. However, it might have been thought that simply staggering lunch-breaks could have been equally effective, if that was the main aim.<\/p><p pid=\"a1403.0\/4\">The National Education Union says no concerns have been brought to its notice thus far but that the overview of biometric facial recognition is the same as that concerning the use of fingerprint technology in schools, which is primarily around consultation and consent. However, I suspect that one difference is that children are now familiar with using fingerprint technology to access their smartphones so it is not perceived as being intrusive in the way that facial recognition often is.<\/p><p pid=\"a1403.0\/5\">There is also the issue of the security of information once it has been taken and is then stored. As noble Lords may have seen in recent news reports, we in the Labour Party have received a painful reminder in the past week that sensitive information can be illegally accessed by malign forces even when it is assumed to be held securely. So wider worries in that regard over biometric data need to be addressed.<\/p><p pid=\"a1403.0\/6\">There is general acceptance of the growing and practical uses to which biometric technology may be put, but further concerns exist over what that technology actually involves. It is important to differentiate between facial recognition technology, which appears to be what was trialled in the schools in Scotland, and live facial recognition, to which the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, referred, which is altogether more sinister. Whereas facial recognition technology involves a single process where the individual concerned is aware of the process and has consented to it, or consent has been  given on the person&#8217;s behalf, live facial recognition is typically directed surreptitiously towards groups of people to identify individuals indiscriminately. We understand that the latter sort of system has been used against protesters in Hong Kong, and it is possible that widespread deployment should be a matter of grave concern.<\/p><p pid=\"a1403.0\/7\">Fortunately, that is not what we are talking about today. It is a matter for each school governing body to determine whether facial recognition technology should be used in their school, although I suspect that the recent experiences mean that we do not get many more schools seeking to push that boat out at the moment, at least until the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office has issued further pronouncements. However, the DfE&#8217;s 2018 advice notes quite rightly that:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1403.0\/8\">&#8220;There are no circumstances in which a school or college can lawfully process a pupil&#8217;s biometric data without having notified each parent of a child and received the necessary consent.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1403.0\/9\">For the most part, the advice appears reassuring to pupils and parents, but one issue that may not meet the latter criterion concerns the section headed, &#8220;The pupil&#8217;s right to refuse&#8221;. This makes the legal position clear, stating that:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1403.0\/10\">&#8220;A pupil&#8217;s objection or refusal overrides any parental consent to the processing.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1403.0\/11\">This is an issue that has arisen recently in another context, regarding the offer of Covid vaccinations to children aged 12 and above. However, the difference between Covid vaccination and the use of biometric data is that the current minimum age for the former is 12 but there appears to be no minimum age for the latter in the advice issued in 2018, which suggests, at least in theory, that biometric data could be applied to children as young as four in reception year. I do not believe for one moment that that would happen, but there is no lower limit. I hope the Minister is able to clarify the position because I am sure I would not be alone in my concern that there may be no age at which a child would be deemed to be too young. That age should not be lower than 12, which was mentioned earlier in relation to Covid vaccinations.<\/p><p pid=\"a1403.0\/12\">The guidance also has a section, under the heading &#8220;Notification and parental consent&#8221;, concerning looked-after children. It would be helpful to have clarity from the Minister on the position of a child&#8217;s carer, whether or not it is a local authority. Would a birth parent have the right to object while their child had looked-after status?<\/p><p pid=\"a1403.0\/13\">Finally, the advice document states that it will be kept under review and updated as necessary. I feel sure that the Minister will agree that the speed at which artificial intelligence advances requires such an update, approaching four years after the advice was issued.<\/p><p pid=\"a1403.0\/14\">It is unrealistic to believe that biometric recognition technology can be delayed for long, but it must surely be subject to assurances that individual privacy will not be undermined and that consent in all circumstances must be received before it is introduced. I suspect that this is just one stage on a journey towards artificial intelligence assuming functions that have hitherto relied on human intelligence and consequent actions. That is a journey that in many ways is rather scary to contemplate, but it must be subject to the checks and balances that I have referred to. We know that the Government are  planning a White Paper on AI governance, and I hope that the Minister will be able to say when it is likely to appear, as it will be necessary to begin to allay the fears that noble Lords have rightly outlined in this debate.<\/p>",

Under the British nationality selection scheme, a limited number of personnel who were settled in Hong Kong could apply to register as British citizens.

Those who hold BNO status may be eligible for the BNO visa that was launched in January this year and which provides a route to settlement in the UK, meaning that many former British-Hong Kong service personnel, their spouses and dependants will already have, or be on the path to having, settlement and subsequently British citizenship, which would confer on them a right of abode in the UK.<\/p><p>We must consider the impact on public services both of increased usage generated by the right of access granted by expanded citizenship, and of the additional costs in granting such rights, such as casework resource and resettlement resulting in lost income that is not budgeted for and is therefore not affordable. Additionally, although I recognise the significant contribution made by this group, it may be difficult to justify why this specific cohort should be granted the right of abode  when others from former colonial garrisons are not. For these reasons, I ask the hon. Member to withdraw the new clause.<\/p>",

There is significant concern that these clauses will prevent people from joining refugees in the UK through the family reunion route. Let us consider the countries cited  in The Daily Telegraph again: Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Eritrea and the Philippines. Since the start of 2019, 8,480 people from Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Eritrea have been granted refugee family reunion visas to join loved ones in the UK. That equates to just over half&#8212;53%&#8212;of all family visas granted over that period. Some 3,584 of those visas were for children and 5,771 for women or girls.

            "body": "<p pid=\"c801.1\/1\">I thank the hon. Member for that intervention, which pre-empts something I will come to. In effect, I will make the same point later in my speech. The truth is that next year we will underspend on social care, because we cannot recruit the staff to pay them, even if we had the money. In children&#8217;s services, demand is growing exponentially. The complexities and costs are becoming increasingly difficult. There are also significant additional needs for school places for children coming from Hong Kong, and significant care issues for asylum-seeking children. The children&#8217;s budget of every council in the land is overspent.<\/p><p pid=\"c801.1\/2\">I therefore welcome measures focused on early intervention. I would love to talk to Ministers about supporting the transition towards a set of more preventive services. I welcome the announcement in the Budget, but we must continue the trend of having a better attitude to risk management and how we support families in their homes before we get to that acute stage. That change of approach and culture will save money in the end, but it will require more up-front resource.<\/p><p pid=\"c801.1\/3\">The Government could support Nottinghamshire and the whole country by letting us pilot new proposals and ideas in the space through a county deal. We have thoughts about how we might like to do that, working  with organisations such as the National Youth Agency, the charitable sector and our great Nottinghamshire universities to change the game and learn some lessons. I would welcome conversations with Ministers about that.<\/p><p pid=\"c801.1\/4\">On social care, and the point made by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Emma Hardy\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25646\">the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Emma Hardy)<\/phrase>, councils need teeth to get the money. More funding is welcome, but at the minute that funding is going to the NHS, whose backlog is in large parts due to the limits of social care. We cannot get people out of hospital and into appropriate homes or care packages, and we cannot offer sufficient preventive interventions. People end up in hospital, which is not the best place for them, because social care does not have the resources to provide emergency support or to fetch Mrs Miggins and put in place a care plan for her; instead, she ends up going off in an ambulance.<\/p><p pid=\"c801.1\/5\">The Government could help tackle the NHS backlog by backing social care. As it stands, it appears that we must go with our begging bowl to the integrated care system to ask for funding from the national insurance rise for services such as supporting hospital discharge or response teams that can offer care in the home rather than an emergency response. The funding is aimed at the NHS backlog and, although it needs to fund those social care interventions to be successful, we seem to be at the NHS&#8217;s mercy on whether it gives us that funding. I hope that Ministers will tackle that imbalance in the White Paper. It is hugely important to the transition and new approach to social care that we get that right, because the two are not separate services; they interlink closely.<\/p><p pid=\"c801.1\/6\">We will meet a cliff edge in a few weeks, when the requirement for care staff to be vaccinated begins. I have raised that issue a few times. In Nottinghamshire alone, 1,000 staff or more could be no longer eligible to work in a sector that already has a 12% vacancy rate. Is it riskier to have an unvaccinated care worker or not to have a care worker? We may face that challenge. I know that there are financial mitigations to try to help, but, as I have said, we cannot recruit. We do not set the wages&#8212;largely, services are commissioned from private providers&#8212;and people can get &#163;1.50 an hour more at Amazon than working in the care sector. I have said to Ministers before that we need to consider carefully whether it is right in effect to force a lot of people out of a profession that is already struggling with recruitment and with getting the right staff in the right places.<\/p><p pid=\"c801.1\/7\">That said, there are many fantastic interventions in the Budget. I touched on many of them. However, those challenges will not go away. I therefore look forward to conversations about them with Ministers across various Departments in due course. There are real positives to take, with the Government continuing to support jobs and individuals. The OBR tells us that the interventions throughout the pandemic made a huge impact on protecting people and keeping them in work over the last 18 months. The plan for jobs has been incredibly successful so far, and I trust that that will continue. I welcome the many measures in the Budget that will impact positively on my constituents and look forward in due course to discussing in more detail with Ministers some of the challenges that I raised.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a273.2\/1\">Madam Deputy Speaker, I have heard your words and those of Mr Speaker. I have the greatest respect for you both and want to assure you that I have listened very carefully to what you have said. May I also send my best wishes to the Leader of the Opposition? I know that the whole House will join me in doing that.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/2\">With your permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, let me turn to today&#8217;s Budget. Employment is up, investment is growing, public services are improving, the public finances are stabilising and wages are rising. Today&#8217;s  Budget delivers a stronger economy for the British people: stronger growth, with the UK recovering faster than our major competitors; stronger public finances, with our debt under control; and stronger employment, with fewer people out of work and more people in work. Growth is up, jobs are up and debt is down. Let there be no doubt: our plan is working.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/3\">This Budget is about what this Government are about: investment in a more innovative, high-skilled economy, because that is the only sustainable path to individual prosperity; world-class public services, because they are the common goods from which we all benefit; backing business, because our future cannot be built by the Government alone but must come from the imagination and drive of our entrepreneurs; help for working families with the cost of living, because we will always give people the support they need and the tools to build a better life for themselves; and levelling up, because for too long&#8212;far too long&#8212;the location of your birth has determined too much of your future, and because the awesome power of opportunity should not be available only to a wealthy few but be the birthright of every child in an independent and prosperous United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/4\">Today&#8217;s Budget does not draw a line under covid; we have challenging months ahead, and I encourage everyone eligible to get their booster jabs as soon as possible. But today&#8217;s Budget does begin the work of preparing for a new economy post covid: the Prime Minister&#8217;s economy of higher wages, higher skills and rising productivity, and of strong public services, vibrant communities and safer streets&#8212;an economy fit for a new age of optimism, where the only limit to our potential is the effort we are prepared to put in and the sacrifices we are prepared to make. That is the stronger economy of the future, and this Budget is the foundation.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/5\">The House will recognise the challenging backdrop of rising inflation. Let me begin by carefully explaining what is happening in our economy and why. Inflation in September was 3.1% and is likely to rise further, with the Office for Budget Responsibility expecting the consumer prices index to average 4% over the next year. The majority of this rise in inflation can be explained by two global forces. First, as economies around the world reopen, demand for goods has increased more quickly than supply chains can meet. Having been shut down for almost a year, it takes time for factories to scale up production, for container ships to move goods to where demand is and for businesses to hire the people they need.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/6\">Secondly, global demand for energy has surged at a time when supplies have already been disrupted, putting a strain on prices. In the year to September, the global wholesale price of oil, coal and gas combined has more than doubled.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/7\">The pressures caused by supply chains and energy prices will take months to ease. It would be irresponsible for anyone to pretend that we can solve this overnight. I am in regular communication with Finance Ministers around the world and it is clear that these are shared global problems, neither unique to the UK nor possible for us to address on our own. But where the Government can ease these pressures, we will act. To address the driver shortage, the Transport Secretary is introducing temporary visas, tackling testing backlogs and changing cabotage requirements, and is today announcing new funding to improve lorry park facilities. We have already  suspended the HGV levy until August, and I can do more today, extending it for a further year until 2023 and freezing vehicle excise duty for heavy goods vehicles.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/8\">To help with the cost of living, we have introduced a new &#163;500 million household support fund, and today&#8217;s Budget will support working families further.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/9\">On our fiscal policy, we will meet our commitments on public services and capital investment, but we will do so keeping in mind the need to control inflation.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/10\">Finally, I have written to the Governor of the Bank of England today to reaffirm the Bank&#8217;s remit to achieve low and stable inflation. People should be reassured: it has a strong track record in doing so.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/11\">I understand that people are concerned about global inflation, but they have a Government here at home ready and willing to act. In a period of global uncertainty, we need to work hard to maintain a strong economy and be responsible with the public finances, and that is what we are doing. I am grateful to the OBR for its work, and I am pleased to say that it now expects our recovery to be quicker. Thanks to this Government&#8217;s actions, it forecasts the economy to return to its pre-covid level at the turn of the year&#8212;earlier than it thought in March.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/12\">Growth this year is revised up from 4% to 6.5%. The OBR then expects the economy to grow by 6% in 2022, and 2.1 %, 1.3% and 1.6% over the next three years. In July last year, at the height of the pandemic, unemployment was expected to peak at 12%.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/13\">Today, the OBR expects unemployment to peak at just 5.2%. That means more than 2 million fewer people out of work than previously feared. Wages are rising: compared with those in February 2020, they have grown in real terms by almost 3.5%. I can confirm for the House that the OBR&#8217;s forecast for business investment has been revised up over the next five years.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/14\">Because of the actions that we took to support our economy, we have been more successful than previously feared in preventing the long-term economic damage of covid.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/15\">The OBR has today revised down its scarring assumption from 3% to 2%. In the depths of the worst economic crisis on record, we set out a plan for jobs. It is a plan that was backed by business groups and trade bodies; a plan that has helped millions of people and saved millions of jobs; and a plan that the OBR has today described as &#8220;remarkably successful&#8221;. Today&#8217;s forecasts confirm beyond doubt that our plan for jobs is working.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/16\">Disruption in the global economy highlights the importance of strong public finances. Coronavirus left us with borrowing higher than at any time since the second world war. As the Prime Minister reminded us in his conference speech: higher borrowing today is just higher interest rates and even higher taxes tomorrow. We need to strengthen our public finances so that when the next crisis comes, we have the fiscal space to act. Today I am publishing a new charter for budget responsibility. The charter sets out two fiscal rules that will keep this Government on the path of discipline and responsibility. First, underlying public sector net debt, excluding the impact of the Bank of England, must, as a percentage of GDP, be falling. Secondly, in normal times the state should only borrow to invest in our  future growth and prosperity. Everyday spending must be paid for through taxation. Both rules must be met by the third year of every forecast period, giving us the flexibility to respond to crises while credibly keeping the public finances under control. These rules are supplemented by targets to spend up to 3% of GDP on capital investment and to keep welfare spending on a sustainable path.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/17\">The House will be asked to vote on our charter, giving Members a simple choice&#8212;to abandon our fiscal anchor and leave our economy adrift with reckless unfunded pledges, or to vote for what we on the Government side of the House know is the right course: sound public finances and a stronger economy for the British people.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/18\">Important as the charter is, our credibility comes as much from what we do as what we say, so I am pleased to tell the House that, because our plan is delivering a stronger economy and because we have taken tough but responsible decisions on the public finances, the OBR reports today that all our fiscal rules have been met. Underlying debt is forecast to be 85.2% of GDP this year, then 85.4% in 2022-23, before peaking at 85.7% in 2023-24. It then falls in the final three years of the forecast, from 85.1% to 83.3%. Borrowing as a percentage of GDP is forecast to fall in every single year, from 7.9% this year to 3.3% next year, then 2.4%, 1.7%, 1.7% and 1.5% in the following years. Borrowing down, debt down: proving once again it is the Conservatives, and only the Conservatives, who can be trusted with taxpayers&#8217; money.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/19\">I have made four fiscal judgements in this Budget. First, we will meet our fiscal rules with a margin to protect ourselves against economic risks. That is the responsible decision at a time of increasing global economic uncertainty, when our public finances are twice as sensitive to changes in interest rates as they were before the pandemic and six times as sensitive as they were before the financial crisis. Just a one percentage point increase in inflation and interest rates would cost us around &#163;23 billion. My second judgment today is to continue to support working families.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/20\">Thirdly, as well as helping people at home, our improving fiscal position means that we will meet our obligations to the world&#8217;s poorest. I told the House that when we met our fiscal tests, we would return to spending 0.7% of our national income on overseas aid. Some people said this was a trick or a device. I told this House that it was no such thing, and based on the tests that I set out, today&#8217;s forecasts show that we are, in fact, scheduled to return to 0.7% in 2024-25&#8212;before the end of this Parliament.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/21\">My fourth fiscal judgment is this: today&#8217;s Budget increases total departmental spending over this Parliament by &#163;150 billion. That is the largest increase this century, with spending growing by 3.8% a year in real terms. As a result of this spending review, and contrary to speculation, there will be a real-terms rise in overall spending for every single Department, and public sector net investment as a share of GDP will be at the highest sustained level for nearly half a century. If anyone still doubts it, today&#8217;s Budget confirms it: the Conservatives are the real party of public services.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/22\">Our stronger economy lays the foundation for everything that we want to achieve in today&#8217;s Budget: world class public services and more investment in our future growth.  Before I turn to the details, I would like to thank the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Simon Clarke\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25657\">the Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland (Mr Clarke)<\/phrase>. Completing the spending review in such challenging circumstances was a tall order&#8212;and thankfully we had just the man for the job.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/23\">At the start of this Parliament, resource spending on healthcare was &#163;133 billion. Today&#8217;s spending review confirms that by the end of this Parliament it will increase by &#163;44 billion to over &#163;177 billion; and the extra revenue we are forecast to raise from the health and social care levy is going direct to the NHS and social care as promised. The health capital budget will be the largest since 2010: record investment in health R&amp;D, including better newborn screening, as campaigned for by my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Nickie Aiken\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25817\">the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Nickie Aiken)<\/phrase>; 40 new hospitals; 70 hospital upgrades; more operating theatres to tackle the backlog; and 100 community diagnostic centres, all staffed by a bigger, better-trained workforce, with 50,000 more nurses and 50 million more primary care appointments. As well as funding to deliver the Prime Minister&#8217;s historic reforms to social care, we are providing local government with new grant funding over the next three years of &#163;4.8 billion&#8212;the largest increase in core funding for over a decade.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/24\">We are investing more in housing and home ownership too, with a multi-year housing settlement totalling nearly &#163;24 billion&#8212;&#163;11.5 billion to build up to 180,000 new affordable homes, the largest cash investment in a decade, 20% more than the previous programme. We are investing an extra &#163;1.8 billion&#8212;enough to bring 1,500 hectares of brownfield land into use, meet our commitment to invest &#163;10 billion in new housing, and unlock 1 million new homes. We are also confirming &#163;5 billion to remove unsafe cladding from the highest risk buildings, partly funded by the residential property developers tax, which I can confirm will be levied on developers with profits over &#163;25 million at a rate of 4%. We have already reduced rough sleeping by over a third, but we will go further, with &#163;640 million a year for rough sleeping and homelessness&#8212;an 85% increase in funding compared to 2019.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/25\">Today&#8217;s Budget funds our ambition to recruit 20,000 new police officers; provides an extra &#163;2.2 billion for courts, prisons and probation services, including &#163;0.5 billion to reduce the courts backlog; pays for programmes to tackle neighbourhood crime, reoffending, county lines, violence against women and girls, victims&#8217; services and improved responses to rape cases; and, over the next three years, commits &#163;3.8 billion to the largest prison-building programme in a generation.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/26\">All Governments should aspire to provide greater life chances for future generations, but few Governments can match our ambition. So let me now turn to what this Budget does to support children. The evidence is compelling that the first 1,001 days of a child&#8217;s life are the most important. My right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Andrea Leadsom\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24829\">the Member for South Northamptonshire (Dame Andrea Leadsom)<\/phrase> has recognised this with her inspirational report. We are responding today with &#163;300 million for a start for life offer for families; high-quality parenting programmes; tailored services to help with perinatal mental health; and, I am pleased to tell my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Fiona Bruce\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24857\">the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce)<\/phrase>, funding to create a network of family hubs around the country too. To improve the  quality of childcare, we are going to pay providers more, with today&#8217;s spending review providing an extra &#163;170 million by 2024-25. We are confirming &#163;150 million to support training and development for the entire early years workforce. To help up to 300,000 more families facing multiple needs, we are investing an extra &#163;200 million in the supporting families programme, and we will provide over &#163;200 million a year to continue the holiday activities and food programme.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/27\">Today&#8217;s spending review also delivers our commitment to schools, with an extra &#163;4.7 billion by 2024-25, which, combined with the ambitious plans we announced at spending review 2019, will restore per-pupil funding to 2010 levels in real terms, equivalent to a cash increase for every pupil of more than &#163;1,500. For children with special educational needs and disabilities, we are more than tripling the amount we invest to create 30,000 new school places. We know that the pandemic caused significant disruption to children&#8217;s learning. We have already announced &#163;3.1 billion to help education recovery. Today, as promised by the Prime Minister and the Education Secretary, we will go further, with just under &#163;2 billion of new funding to help schools and colleges, bringing this Government&#8217;s total support for education recovery to almost &#163;5 billion.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/28\">As we level up public services, we are also levelling up communities, restoring the pride people feel in the places they call home. To do that, we are providing &#163;560 million for youth services, enough to fund up to 300 youth clubs in England; over &#163;200 million to build or transform up to 8,000 state-of-the-art community football pitches across the UK; and funding to turn over 100 areas of derelict land into new &#8220;pocket parks&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/29\">I am allocating the first round of bids from the levelling up fund&#8212;&#163;1.7 billion to invest in the infrastructure of everyday life in over 100 local areas. With &#163;170 million in Scotland, &#163;120 million in Wales, and &#163;50 million in Northern Ireland&#8212;more than their Barnett shares&#8212;this will benefit the whole United Kingdom. We are backing projects in Aberdeen, Bury, Burnley, Lewes, Clwyd South, and not one, not two, but three successful projects for the great city of Stoke-on-Trent. But that is not all. We are also going to fund projects in Ashton-under-Lyne, Doncaster, South Leicester, Sunderland and West Leeds. We are so committed to levelling up, we are even levelling up the Opposition Front Bench.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/30\">Levelling up is also about protecting our unique culture and heritage. The British Museum; Tate Liverpool; the York Railway Museum: we are investing &#163;850 million to protect museums, galleries, libraries, and local culture. Thanks to the Culture Secretary, over 100 regional museums and libraries will be renovated, restored and revived; and she has secured up to &#163;2 million to start work on a new Beatles attraction on the Liverpool waterfront. We are also going to review our museum freedoms and make our creative tax reliefs more generous. On current plans, the tax relief for museums and galleries is due to end in March next year, just as exhibitions are starting to tour again, so I have decided to extend it for two years to March 2024. To support theatres, orchestras, museums and galleries to recover from covid, the tax reliefs for all those sectors, from today until April 2023, will be doubled, and they will not return to the normal rate until April 2024. That is a tax relief for culture worth almost a quarter of a billion pounds.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/31\">This is a Budget for the whole United Kingdom. Through the Barnett formula, today&#8217;s decisions increase Scottish Government funding, in each year, by an average of &#163;4.6 billion, Welsh Government funding by &#163;2.5 billion, and &#163;1.6 billion for the Northern Ireland Executive. This delivers, in real terms, the largest block grants for the devolved Administrations since the devolution settlements of 1998. The whole of the United Kingdom will benefit from the UK shared prosperity fund, and over time we will ramp up funding so that total domestic UK-wide funding will match EU receipts, averaging around &#163;1.5 billion a year. We will fund projects across the UK, including funding for the Extreme E race in Scotland&#8212;the 2022 Hebrides X-Prix&#8212;accelerating funding for the Cardiff city region deal in Wales, and funding in Northern Ireland for community cohesion. While today demonstrates the indisputable fiscal benefit of being part of the United Kingdom, this is and always will be secondary to the simple truth that we are bound together by more than transactional benefit. It is our collective history, our culture and our security. We are, and always will be, one family and one United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/32\">While today&#8217;s Budget delivers historically high levels of public spending, its success will be measured not by the billions we spend, but by the outcomes we achieve and the difference we make to people&#8217;s lives. The budgets are set; the plans are in place; the task is clear. Now we must deliver because this is not the Government&#8217;s money&#8212;it is taxpayer&#8217;s money.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/33\">Our stronger economy allows us to fund world-class public services&#8212;the people&#8217;s priority&#8212;but over the long-term, the only way to pay for higher spending is economic growth. If we want to see higher growth, we have to tackle the problem that has been holding back this country for far too long: our uneven economic geography. As we come out of the worst economic shock we have ever seen, we have a choice&#8212;to retrench, or to invest. This Government choose to invest: to invest in our economic infrastructure, to invest in innovation, to invest in skills and to invest in a plan for growth that builds a stronger economy for the future. That is what this Budget is about and that is what this Government are about.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/34\">Infrastructure connects our country, drives productivity and levels up. That is why our national infrastructure strategy invests in economic infrastructure such as roads, railways, broadband and mobile&#8212;over &#163;130 billion. To connect our towns and cities, we are investing &#163;21 billion on roads and &#163;46 billion on railways. Our integrated rail plan will be published soon, dramatically improving journey times between our towns and cities. Today, we are providing &#163;5.7 billion for London-style transport settlements in Greater Manchester, the Liverpool city region, the Tees Valley, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, the west midlands and the west of England. We are helping local transport everywhere with &#163;2.6 billion for a long-term pipeline of more than 50 local roads upgrades, over &#163;5 billion for local roads maintenance&#8212;enough to fill 1 million more potholes a year&#8212;and funding for buses, cycling and walking totalling more than &#163;5 billion. The Prime Minister promised an infrastructure revolution. This Budget delivers an infrastructure revolution.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/35\">Investment in our infrastructure is just the first step. We need to do what the people of this country have always done: invent, discover, and create the ideas and  technologies that will change the world. So we will also invest more in innovation. The UK is already a world leader. With less than 1% of the world&#8217;s population, we have four of the world&#8217;s top 20 universities, 14% of the world&#8217;s most impactful research and the second most Nobel laureates. We want to go further. I can confirm we will maintain our target to increase research and development investment to &#163;22 billion. But in order to get there, and deliver on our other priorities, we will reach the target in 2026-27, spending, by the end of this Parliament, &#163;20 billion a year on R&amp;D. That is a cash increase of 50%&#8212;the fastest increase ever. I can confirm for the House that this &#163;20 billion is in addition to the cost of our R&amp;D tax reliefs. Combined with those tax reliefs, total public investment in R&amp;D is increasing from 0.7% of GDP in 2018 to 1.1% of GDP by the end of the Parliament.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/36\">How does 1.1% compare internationally? Well, the latest available data shows an OECD average of just 0.7%. Germany is investing 0.9%, France 1% and the United States just 0.7%. This unprecedented funding will: increase core science funding to &#163;5.9 billion a year by 2024-25, a cash increase of 37%; meet the full costs of associating with Horizon Europe; establish the new Advanced Research and Invention Agency with &#163;800 million by 2025-26; and strengthen our focus on late-stage innovation, increasing Innovate UK&#8217;s annual core budget to &#163;1 billion, double what it was at the start of the Parliament.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/37\">There is more to becoming a science superpower than just what the Government spend on R&amp;D. Our ambitious net zero strategy is also an innovation strategy, investing &#163;30 billion to create the new green industries of the future. We have just issued our second green bond, making us the third-largest issuer of sovereign green bonds anywhere in the world. London last week was named the best place in the world for green finance. On Monday, the new UK Infrastructure Bank announced its first ever investment: &#163;107 million to support offshore wind in Teesside. To build on this work, one week today I will be hosting global finance ministers and businesses at COP26.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/38\">Innovation comes from the imagination, drive and risk-taking of business. That is why we have launched Help to Grow to turbocharge SME productivity and started a new co-investment venture capital fund, Future Fund: Breakthrough. It is why I am announcing today that we will consult on further changes to the regulatory charge cap for pensions schemes, unlocking institutional investment while protecting savers. It is why we are introducing a new &#163;1.4 billion global Britain investment fund, supporting transformative economic activity in our world-leading sectors, such as life sciences. It is why today&#8217;s Budget increases the British Business Bank&#8217;s regional financing programmes to &#163;1.6 billion, expanding their coverage and helping innovative businesses get access to the finance they need, across the whole United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/39\">A third of our science Nobel laureates have been immigrants. Half of our fastest growing companies have a foreign-born founder. So an economy built on innovation must be open and attractive to the best and brightest minds. Thanks to our brilliant Home Secretary, today&#8217;s Budget confirms the eligibility criteria for our new scale-up visa, making it quicker and easier for fast-growing businesses to bring in highly skilled individuals.  The Trade Secretary&#8217;s new global talent network, launching initially in the Bay Area, Boston and Bangalore, will identify, attract and relocate the best global talent in science and tech sectors. It is all part of our plan to make our visa system for international talent the most competitive in the world.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/40\">If we want greater private sector innovation, we need to make our research and development tax reliefs fit for purpose. The latest figures show the UK has the second highest spending on R&amp;D tax reliefs in the OECD. Yet it is not working as well as it should; UK business investment in R&amp;D is less than half the OECD average. We have reviewed the reliefs and identified two issues we are solving today. First, the reliefs need to reflect how businesses conduct research in the modern world. So, as many companies have called for, I am expanding the scope of the reliefs to include cloud computing and data costs.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/41\">The second problem is this: companies claimed UK tax relief on &#163;48 billion of R&amp;D spending, yet UK business investment was around half of that, at just &#163;26 billion. We are subsidising billions of pounds of R&amp;D that is not even happening here in the United Kingdom. That is unfair on British taxpayers and it puts us out of step with places like Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland and the USA, which have all focused their R&amp;D tax reliefs on domestic activity. So from April 2023, we are going to do the same, and incentivise greater investment here at home. So a &#163;22-billion investment in R&amp;D, the net zero strategy, the future fund, Help to Grow, more regional finance, unlocking institutional capital, a more competitive visa system and a modernised R&amp;D tax credits regime&#8212;enough action to prove the hypothesis that we are making this country a science and technology superpower.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/42\">As well as investing in infrastructure and innovation, there is one further part of our plan for growth that is crucial: providing a world-class education to all our people. Higher skills lead to higher regional productivity and higher productivity leads to higher wages. With 80% of the UK&#8217;s 2030 workforce already in work, our future success depends on not just the schooling we give our children but the lifelong learning we offer to adults.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/43\">We have already done a lot. Our plan for jobs invested in apprenticeships, traineeships and the kickstart scheme, but we need to go further. Today&#8217;s Budget invests in the most wide-ranging skills agenda this country has seen in decades. We are increasing skills spending over the Parliament by &#163;3.8 billion&#8212;an increase of 42%. We are expanding T-levels, building institutes of technology, rolling out the Prime Minister&#8217;s lifetime skills guarantee, upgrading our further education college estate, quadrupling the number of places on skills bootcamps and significantly increasing funding for apprenticeships.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/44\">We are also going to tackle a tragic fact: millions of adults in our country have numeracy skills lower than those expected of a nine-year-old. According to the leading charity National Numeracy, this costs individuals with poor numeracy up to &#163;1,600 a year in lost earnings. People with poor numeracy skills are more than twice as likely to be unemployed as their peers. So today, I can announce a new UK-wide numeracy programme: Multiply. With &#163;560 million, Multiply will improve basic maths skills and help to change people&#8217;s lives across the whole United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/45\">So we are building our infrastructure with new roads, railways and broadband; cementing our status as a science and technology superpower; and strengthening the skills of our people, the country&#8217;s greatest asset. That is a real plan for growth and that is how this Government are building a stronger economy for the British people.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/46\">World class public services are the people&#8217;s priority. Investment in infrastructure, innovation and skills will create the growth that we need to pay for them. But as Conservatives, we know that Government action alone will not be enough to create a stronger economy. We want this country to be the most exciting and dynamic place in the world for business. Now that we have left the EU, we have the freedom to do things differently and deliver a simpler, fairer tax system.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/47\">I want to begin with one of our smallest taxes, but a tax that plays an important role in one of our pre-eminent industries: shipping. Now that we have left the EU, today we start reforming our tonnage tax regime to make it simpler and more competitive. And we are also making it fairer for UK taxpayers.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/48\">When we were in the old EU system, ships in the tonnage tax regime were required to fly the flag of an EU state, but that does not make sense for an independent nation. So I can announce today that our tonnage tax will, for the first time ever, reward companies for adopting the UK&#8217;s merchant shipping flag, the red ensign. That is entirely fitting for a country with such a proud maritime history as ours. I am sure that the Opposition will be delighted that red flags are still flying somewhere in this country, even if they are all at sea.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/49\">Let me turn now to air passenger duty. Right now, people pay more for return flights within and between the four nations of the United Kingdom than they do when flying home from abroad. We used to have a return-leg exemption for domestic flights, but we were required to remove it in 2001. But today I can announce that flights between airports in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will, from April 2023, be subject to a new lower rate of air passenger duty. This will help to cut the cost of living, with 9 million passengers seeing their duty cut by half; it will bring people together across the United Kingdom; and because they tend to have a greater proportion of domestic passengers, it is a boost to regional airports like Aberdeen, Belfast, Inverness and Southampton.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/50\">Airports are major regional employers, so to help them get through the winter I am also extending our support for English airports for a further six months. We are also making changes to reduce carbon emissions from aviation. Most emissions come from international rather than domestic aviation, so we are introducing, from April 2023, a new ultra-long-haul band in air passenger duty covering flights of over 5,500 miles, with an economy rate of &#163;91. Less than 5% of passengers will pay more, but those who fly furthest will pay the most.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/51\">Our approach to corporate taxation strikes a responsible balance between funding public services and encouraging the investment we need for a stronger economy. At the March Budget, we took the difficult but necessary decision to increase the rate of corporation tax to 25% from 2023, which is still the lowest rate in the G7 and the fifth lowest rate in the G20. Alongside, I introduced the new super deduction&#8212;the biggest business tax cut  in modern British history&#8212;and extended, to the end of this year, the annual investment allowance at its higher level of &#163;1 million. Now is not the time to remove tax breaks on investment, so I can confirm today that the &#163;1 million annual investment allowance will not end in December as planned. It will be extended all the way to March 2023.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/52\">I also said in March that I would review the bank surcharge within corporation tax to maintain the competitiveness of our financial services industry. We will retain a surcharge of 3%. The overall rate for corporation tax on banks will, in 2023, increase from 27% to 28% and will remain higher than the rate paid by other companies. Small challenger banks are improving banking competition, which is good for the sector and good for consumers, so to help them, I will also raise the annual allowance to &#163;100 million.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/53\">Our manifesto promised to review business rates. We are publishing our conclusions today. Before I set out our plans, let me say this: we on the Conservative Benches are clear that reckless, unfunded promises to abolish a tax that raises &#163;25 billion every year are completely irresponsible. It would be wrong to find &#163;25 billion a year in extra borrowing, cuts to public services or tax rises elsewhere, so we will retain business rates, but with key reforms to ease the burden and create stronger high streets.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/54\">First, we will make the business rates system fairer and timelier with more frequent revaluations every three years. The new revaluation cycle will be delivered from 2023. Secondly, as called for by the Federation of Small Businesses and the British Property Federation, we are introducing a new investment relief to encourage businesses to adopt green technologies such as solar panels.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/55\">I am announcing today that we will accept the CBI and the British Retail Consortium&#8217;s recommendation to introduce a new business rates improvement relief. From 2023, every single business will be able to make property improvements and, for 12 months, pay no extra business rates. That means that a hotel adding extra rooms, a manufacturer expanding their factory, and an office adding new air conditioning, CCTV or bike shelters will all pay no extra rates.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/56\">Together with the new green investment relief, we are introducing investment incentives totalling &#163;750 million. This will make a difference, but without action, millions of businesses would see their tax bills going up next year because of inflation. I want to help those businesses right now, so our third step is that next year&#8217;s planned increase in the multiplier will be cancelled. That is a tax cut for businesses worth, over the next five years, &#163;4.6 billion.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/57\">I have one final measure to help those businesses hardest hit by the pandemic. I am announcing today, for one year, a new 50% business rates discount for businesses in the retail, hospitality, and leisure sectors: pubs, music venues, cinemas, restaurants, hotels, theatres and gyms. Any eligible business can claim a discount on their bills of 50%, up to a maximum of &#163;110,000. That is a business tax cut worth almost &#163;1.7 billion. Together with small business rates relief, this means that over 90% of all retail, hospitality and leisure businesses will see a discount of at least 50%. Apart from the covid reliefs, this is the biggest single-year cut to business rates in over 30 years. Taken together, today&#8217;s Budget cuts business rates by &#163;7 billion.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/58\">We are unleashing the dynamism and creativity of British businesses with a simpler, fairer and more competitive tax system: the biggest business tax cut in modern British history; the biggest single-year cut to business rates for 30 years; a &#163;1 million investment allowance; tonnage tax reformed; air passenger duty cut. That is the way to back business and build a stronger economy.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/59\">Let me turn now to alcohol duties. First introduced in 1643 to help pay for the civil war, our alcohol duty system is outdated, complex and full of historical anomalies. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has called it &#8220;a mess&#8221;; the Institute of Economic Affairs said that it &#8220;defies common sense&#8221;; and the World Health Organisation has warned that countries such as the UK which follow the EU rules are:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a273.2\/60\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;unable to implement tax systems that are optimal from the perspective of public health.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/61\">So today, we are taking advantage of leaving the EU to announce the most radical simplification of alcohol duties for over 140 years. We are taking five steps today to create a system that is simpler, fairer, and healthier.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/62\">First, to radically simplify the system, we are slashing the number of main duty rates from 15 to just six. Our new system will be designed around a common-sense principle: the stronger the drink, the higher the rate. This means that some drinks, like stronger red wines, fortified wines and high-strength white ciders will see a small increase in their rates because they are currently undertaxed, given their strength. That is the right thing to do, and it will help to end the era of cheap, high-strength drinks which can harm public health and enable problem drinking. Because this is a more rational system, the converse is also true: many lower-alcohol drinks are currently overtaxed&#8212;and have been for many decades. Ros&#233;, fruit ciders, liqueurs, lower strength beers and wines&#8212;today&#8217;s changes mean that they will pay less.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/63\">The second step I am taking today will encourage small, innovative craft producers: I am announcing proposals for a new small producer relief. This will extend the principle of the small brewers relief to include for the first time ever small cider makers and other producers making alcoholic drinks of less strength  than 8.5%.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/64\">Thirdly, I am going to modernise the system to reflect the way people drink today. Over the last decade, consumption of sparkling wines like prosecco has doubled. English sparkling wine alone has increased almost tenfold. It is clear they are no longer the preserve of wealthy elites, and they are no stronger than still wines. So I am going to end the irrational duty premium of 28% that they currently pay. Sparkling wines, wherever they are produced, will now pay the same duty as still wines of equivalent strength. Because growing conditions in the UK typically favour lower-strength and sparkling wines, this means English and Welsh wines, compared with stronger imported wines, will now pay less. Sales of fruit cider have increased from one in a thousand ciders sold in 2005 to one in four today, but they can pay two or three times as much duty as cider made with apples or pears, so we are cutting the duty on them too.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/65\">The fourth step I am taking today would directly support the home of British community life for centuries: our pubs. Even before the pandemic, pubs were struggling: between 2000 and 2019, consumption in the on-trade  fell by 40%. Many public health bodies recognise that pubs are often safer drinking environments than being at home. As my hon. Friends the Members for Dudley South (Mike Wood) and for North West Durham (Mr Holden) will agree, a fairer, healthier system supports pubs, so I can announce today draught relief.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/66\">Draught relief will apply a new lower rate of duty on draught beer and cider. It will apply to drinks served from draught containers over 40 litres. It will particularly benefit community pubs that do 75% of their trade on draught. Let me tell the House the new rate: draught relief will cut duty by 5%. That is the biggest cut to cider duty since 1923; the biggest cut to fruit ciders in a generation; the biggest cut to beer duty for 50 years. This is not temporary. It is a long-term investment in British pubs of &#163;100 million a year and a permanent cut in the cost of a pint of 3p. I cannot wait for the Opposition to accuse me tomorrow of beer-barrel politics.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/67\">These much needed reforms will come into effect in February 2023, but I want to help the hospitality industry right now, so for my final announcement on alcohol duties today, I can confirm that the planned increases in duty on spirits like Scotch whisky, wine, cider and beer will all, from midnight tonight, be cancelled. That is a tax cut worth &#163;3 billion.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/68\">Our reforms make the alcohol duty system simpler, fairer and healthier; they help with the cost of living while tackling problem drinking; they support innovative entrepreneurs and craft producers; they back pubs and public health; and they are only possible because we have left the European Union.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/69\">World-class public services; investment in infrastructure, innovation, and skills; simpler, fairer taxes to support businesses and consumers: all built on the foundation of a stronger economy and responsible public finances. That is our vision for the future and that is what this Budget delivers.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/70\">This Budget also supports working families. With fuel prices at the highest level in eight years, I am not prepared to add to the squeeze on families and small businesses, so I can confirm today that the planned rise in fuel duty will be cancelled. That is a saving over the next five years of almost &#163;8 billion. Compared to pre-2010 plans, today&#8217;s freeze means the average tank of fuel will cost around &#163;15 less per car; &#163;30 less for vans; and &#163;130 less for HGVs. After 12 consecutive years of frozen rates, the average car driver will now save a total of &#163;1,900.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/71\">I can also announce today that public sector workers will see fair and affordable pay rises across the whole spending review period as we return to the normal, independent pay-setting process, and I can take action to help the lowest paid as well. It was a Conservative Government who introduced the national living wage in 2016, a Conservative Government who, according to statistics published just yesterday, have overseen the proportion of people in low-paid work falling to its lowest level since 1997, and it is a Conservative Government who are increasing the wage floor again today. The independent Low Pay Commission brings together economists, business groups and trade unions. The Government are accepting its recommendation to increase the national living wage next year by 6.6%, to &#163;9.50 an hour. For a full-time worker that is a pay rise worth over &#163;1,000. It will benefit over 2 million of the lowest paid workers in the country, it is broadly consistent with  previous increases, it keeps us on track for our target of two thirds of median earnings by 2024, and it is a major commitment to the high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity economy of the future.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/72\">As we build this stronger economy, we are doing so at the end of an extraordinary 18 months. Covid was not just a public health challenge and an economic challenge&#8212;it was a moral challenge, too. We had to show we could pull together as a country, and we did. We had to put aside questions of ideology and orthodoxy to do whatever it took to care for our people and each other, and we did.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/73\">There is a different moral dimension to the economic challenge we face now. Last year, the state grew to be over half the size of the total economy, and taxes are rising to their highest level as a percentage of GDP since the 1950s. I do not like it, but I cannot apologise for it: it is the result of the unprecedented crisis we faced and the extraordinary action we took in response. But now we have a choice: do we want to live in a country where the response to every question is &#8220;What are the Government going to do about it?&#8221;, where every time prices rise, every time a company gets in trouble, every time some new challenge emerges, the answer is always that the taxpayer must pay? Or do we choose to recognise that Government has limits?<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/74\">Government should have limits. If this seems a controversial statement to make, then I am all the more glad for saying it because that means it needed saying. And it is what we believe. There is a reason we talk about the importance of family, community and personal responsibility. We do so not because these are an alternative to the market or the state, but because they are more important than the market or the state. The moments that make life worth living are not created by Government, are not announced by Government, are not granted by Government: they come from us as people&#8212;our choices, our sacrifices, our efforts&#8212;and we believe people should keep more of the rewards of those efforts. Yes, we have taken some corrective action to fund the NHS and get our debt under control, but as we look towards the future I want to say this simple thing to the House and the British people: my goal is to reduce taxes. By the end of this Parliament, I want taxes to be going down, not up. I want this to be a society that rewards energy, ingenuity and inventiveness, a society that rewards work. That is what we believe on this side of the House. That is my mission over the remainder of this Parliament.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/75\">The final announcement in today&#8217;s Budget takes a first step. For many of the lowest paid in society there is a hidden tax on work: the universal credit taper withdraws support as people work more hours. The rate is currently 63%, so for every &#163;1 someone earns, their universal credit is reduced by 63p. Let us be in no doubt: this is a tax on work&#8212;and a high rate of tax at that. Organisations as varied as the Trades Union Congress, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the Resolution Foundation, the Centre for Policy Studies, and the Centre for Social Justice have all said it is too high. So, to make sure work pays and help some of the lowest-income families in our country to keep more of their hard-earned money, I have decided to cut this rate, not by 1%, not by 2%, but by 8%. This&#8212;[Hon. Members: &#8220;Hear, hear.&#8221;] This is a tax on working people and we are cutting it from 63% to 55%, the rate originally envisaged by my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Iain Duncan Smith\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10180\">the Member for Chingford and Woodford  Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith)<\/phrase>. And because I am also increasing the work allowances by &#163;500, this is a tax cut next year worth over &#163;2 billion. Nearly 2 million families will keep on average an extra &#163;1,000 a year. Changes like this normally take effect at the start of the new tax year in April, but we want to help people right now, so we will introduce this within weeks and no later than <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-12-01\">1 December<\/phrase>.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/76\">Let me tell the House what these changes mean. A single mother of two renting and working full-time on the national living wage will be better off by around &#163;1,200. A couple renting a home with their two children, one parent working full-time, the other working part-time, will be better off every single year by &#163;1,800. This is a &#163;2 billion tax cut for the lowest paid workers in our country. It supports working families, it helps with the cost of living and it rewards work.<\/p><p pid=\"a273.2\/77\">So, fuel duty cut, air passenger duty cut, alcohol duty cut, the biggest cut to business rates in 30 years, growth up, jobs up, wages up, public finances back in a better place, more investment in infrastructure, innovation and skills, a pay rise for over 2 million people, and a &#163;2 billion tax cut for the lowest paid. This Budget helps with the cost of living. This Budget levels up to a higher-wage, higher-skill, higher-productivity economy. This Budget builds a stronger economy for the British people. I commend it to the House.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a217.1\/1\">My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, for explaining his amendment. Before I get on to dealing with this amendment, I want to say that I was very moved by the noble Lord&#8217;s earlier comments. In the interests of full disclosure, I should declare that I was an inspector in the Royal Hong Kong Police. That is where I started out; I can confirm that one never forgets the smell of a mortuary.<\/p><p pid=\"a217.1\/2\">Amendment 12 effectively seeks to dispense with the need for Clause 3 by ensuring that, for all purposes, special constables are treated in law as members of a police force. Our professional and dedicated special constables increasingly carry out a range of specialised and front-line roles in their mission to keep us and our communities safe, as the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, noted. He also made some very relevant points about the technical skills that they can bring. They often face the same risks as regular officers while on duty; they deserve the same protection and support as regular officers where appropriate. That is why, through the Bill, we are enabling special constables to become members of the Police Federation, should they wish to do so.<\/p><p pid=\"a217.1\/3\">Having been subject to long-standing separate regulation in England and Wales, the distinct nature of special constables is recognised in law with clearly defined benefits that result directly from this separate  status. In contrast, legislation in Scotland has long included special constables as &#8220;members of police forces&#8221; and has been drafted to take this into account. It would not be appropriate for special constables to have access to the same conditions of service, or indeed face the same restrictions, that legislation confers on regular officers. Including special constables in the existing definition of &#8220;members of police forces&#8221; would have that effect. Legislation on the pay and pensions of &#8220;members of police forces&#8221;, for example, is not relevant to special constables, who are unpaid volunteers, choosing to give up their free time to help strengthen our police forces. As warranted officers, special constables in England and Wales hold the office of constable and are therefore already included in the term &#8220;constable&#8221;. This means that, where legislation confers powers on a constable, they will also be exercisable by a special constable.<\/p><p pid=\"a217.1\/4\">The noble Lord, Lord Coaker, mentioned how we value special constables, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Harris. I will digress briefly to set out what the Home Office is doing to recognise and support the special constabulary. The Home Office has raised  the profile and status of the annual Lord Ferrers Awards, which recognise the outstanding contribution of volunteers in policing. We have consulted on proposals to extend the eligibility of the Queen&#8217;s Police Medal to special constables, along with proposals to lower the service threshold for bars to the Special Constabulary Long Service Medal from 10 to five years. Those proposals could support the retention of highly committed volunteers who may, for example, be incentivised by an award that recognises more realistically the length of service volunteers are able to provide and their ongoing commitment to public service. I hope that this also answers something of the question from the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, about recruitment.<\/p><p pid=\"a217.1\/5\">The noble Lord, Lord Coaker, referred to John Apter, chair of the Police Federation. I note that he started out as a special constable, which I suppose, by implication, suggests that that is a route into becoming a regular police officer.<\/p><p pid=\"a217.1\/6\">For those reasons, we consider that this amendment is not necessary and could cause confusion to the status of special constables, which the law recognises as distinct from regular officers. Further, this amendment could have unwelcome, unintended consequences, for example by applying pay provisions to volunteers. I hope that, in light of my explanation and assurance, the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, will be content to withdraw his amendment.<\/p>",

Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham time at the end.<\/p><p pid=\"a322.1\/2\">We are clear that the numerous Chinese military flights in recent weeks near Taiwan are not conducive to peace and stability in the region. We need a peaceful resolution through constructive dialogue by the people on both sides of the Taiwan strait. We have no diplomatic relations with Taiwan but a strong unofficial relationship based on dynamic commercial, education and cultural ties. We support Taiwan&#8217;s participation in international organisations where statehood is not a prerequisite. We are also committed to defending the UN convention on the law of the sea in the South China sea. In September 2020, my predecessor set out our legal analysis on the South China sea in full to Parliament for the first time. We objected to Chinese claims that we consider inconsistent with UNCLOS, which we have reiterated in subsequent statements.<\/p><p pid=\"a322.1\/3\">I will turn briefly to UK-France relations, which was mentioned by both Front-Bench speakers. We have a long-standing security and defence relationship with France. We are close NATO allies and have an excellent history of operational co-operation. The Defence Secretary spoke to his French counterpart before the announcement. We will continue to consult each other daily on international defence and security arrangements.<\/p><p pid=\"a322.1\/4\">Turning to China, as the integrated review made clear, China&#8217;s increasing power and international assertiveness is likely to be the most significant geopolitical factor of the 2020s. As G20 members with permanent  seats on the UN Security Council, we must work together, from increasing trade and rebuilding the global economy to co-operation in science innovation. Co-operation with China will be vital to tackle transnational challenges, particularly climate change and biodiversity loss. But as we engage, we will not sacrifice our values or national security. China is an authoritarian state with different values from the UK. The Government consistently take action to hold China to its international obligations and commitments, including responding robustly to its human rights violations in Xinjiang and its breach of the Sino-British joint declaration in Hong Kong. We will continue to speak and take action to promote our values and protect our national security. Working with international partners, we have imposed sanctions in respect of Xinjiang and led joint action at the United Nations, while continuing to build our domestic resilience.<\/p><p pid=\"a322.1\/5\">I am conscious of time, as I want to give my hon.

The Devolved Administrations have also aligned on this policy.<\/li><\/ul><p>We have also made the follow changes in respect of international travel:<\/p><p>Lateral Flow Devices for Arrival Tests<br\/><br\/>From 4am on 24 October, arrivals into England who are considered fully vaccinated, along with most under 18s, who have not been in a red list country in the last 10 days will be able to take a lateral flow test on or before day 2 of their arrival, instead of a PCR test. This change will cut the costs of tests in time for travellers returning from half-term breaks and these tests can be booked from 22 October. <br\/><br\/>Passengers will need to take a photo of their lateral flow test result and send it back to their private testing provider for verification. Anyone who tests positive will need to self-isolate and take a free NHS confirmatory PCR test. <br\/><br\/>Red List Review<\/p><p>The Government has conducted the first review of the red list under our new and simplified system of international travel. As of 4am on Monday 11 October, 47 countries including South Africa, Brazil, Mexico and Thailand were removed from the red list.<\/p><p>Given the success of the vaccination programme in the UK and the latest evidence of variants across the world, including the fact that the Delta variant is now dominant in many countries as it is in the UK, we have been able to significantly reduce the red list. However, we remain concerned about the presence of Mu and Lambda variants in the small number of countries we have kept on the red list. We will keep this list under review.<\/p><p>The following 7 countries and territories now make up the red list:<\/p><table><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Colombia<\/li><li>Dominican Republic<\/li><li>Ecuador<\/li><li>Haiti<\/li><\/ul><\/td><td><ul><li>Panama<\/li><li>Peru<\/li><li>Venezuela<\/li><\/ul><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p>All passengers arriving into England from a red list country, or those who have been in a red list country or territory in the last 10 days, will have to quarantine at a Managed Quarantine Service facility for 10 days upon their arrival in England.<\/p><p>Expansion of the Inbound Vaccination Policy<\/p><p>As of 4am on Monday 11 October, we also expanded our inbound vaccination policy to include eligible fully vaccinated passengers who have not been in a red list country in the ten days before their arrival into England, to the below countries:<\/p><p> <\/p><table><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Albania<\/li><li>Bahamas<\/li><li>Bangladesh<\/li><li>Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina<\/li><li>Colombia<\/li><li>Egypt<\/li><li>Ghana<\/li><li>Grenada<\/li><li>Hong Kong<\/li><li>India<\/li><li>Jamaica<\/li><li>Jordan<\/li><li>Kenya<\/li><li>Kosovo<\/li><\/ul><\/td><td><ul><li>Maldives<\/li><li>Moldova<\/li><li>Morocco<\/li><li>Nigeria<\/li><li>North Macedonia<\/li><li>Oman<\/li><li>Pakistan<\/li><li>Serbia<\/li><li>St Kitts &amp; Nevis<\/li><li>St Lucia<\/li><li>St Vincent &amp; The Grenadines<\/li><li>Turkey<\/li><li>Ukraine<\/li><li>Vietnam<\/li><\/ul><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><p> <\/p><p>In addition, we have expanded the policy to a further set of countries and territories which were removed from the red list at this review:<\/p><table><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Brazil<\/li><li>Chile<\/li><li>Georgia<\/li><li>Indonesia<\/li><li>Montenegro<\/li><\/ul><\/td><td><ul><li>Namibia<\/li><li>The Philippines<\/li><li>South Africa<\/li><li>Thailand<\/li><\/ul><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Our inbound vaccination policy now covers over 100 countries and territories, and eligible fully vaccinated passengers will be treated the same as those vaccinated in the UK. Eligible fully vaccinated passengers who have not been in a red list country in the ten days before their arrival into England will no longer need to take a pre-departure test before their departure, a post-arrival test on day 8 or self-isolate upon their arrival. This now includes UN staff and volunteers vaccinated as part of the United Nations vaccine rollout.<\/p><p>Clinical Trial Participants<\/p><p>From the end of October, we will also recognise as fully vaccinated people participating in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials from countries and territories including Japan, Canada, Australia and the EU, provided they can supply adequate proof of their participation. This is in recognition of their vital work in helping to tackle the virus and builds on the agreements made at the meetings with G7 counterparts that I chaired in May and September this year.<\/p><p>Acceptance of UK Pre-departure Test Certification via the EU Digital Covid Certificate (DCC)<\/p><p>As of 4am on Monday 11 October, non-vaccinated passengers arriving into England are allowed to present proof of a negative pre-departure test via the EU Digital Covid Certificate, in either paper or digital formats.<\/p><p>Changes to FCDO Travel Advice<\/p><p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) has lifted its advice against all but essential travel for over 80 countries and territories. The change means people will be able to travel to a larger number of destinations with greater ease.<\/p><p>The FCDO will no longer advise against travel to non-red list countries on COVID-19 grounds, except in exceptional circumstances such as if the local healthcare system is overwhelmed. Many travel insurance companies use FCDO travel advice as a reference point in their policies &#8211; typically excluding cover for places where government advises against essential travel, however people will now be able to purchase travel insurance for a wider range of destinations across the globe.<\/p><p>The FCDO will continue to advise against all but essential travel for all red list countries and territories, where the risk to British travellers is &#8220;unacceptably high&#8221;.<\/p><p>Whilst public health is a devolved matter, the Government works closely with the devolved administrations on any changes to international travel and aims to ensure a whole UK approach.<\/p>",

The Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Eligibility) (Wales) Regulations 2014, known as 'the 2014 regulations', prescribe classes of persons who, despite being subject to immigration control, are classed as eligible for housing accommodation and housing assistance. They also prescribe classes of persons who, despite not being subject to immigration control, would nevertheless be ineligible; for example, if they were not habitually resident here and only recently returned.<\/p><p>The draft Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Eligibility) (Wales) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2021&#8212;these regulations&#8212;will provide two new classes of people subject to immigration control with eligibility to an allocation of housing and access to housing assistance. These are people with a Hong Kong British National (Overseas), or BNO, visa who become destitute and have obtained a change to their immigration status enabling them to access public funds, and people entering the UK from Afghanistan under certain Home Office schemes or policies who have recently left Afghanistan due to the collapse of the Afghan Government. However, those who are subject to a maintenance or sponsorship undertaking would not be made eligible. These regulations will also provide that those who are arriving from Afghanistan and are not subject to immigration control, but would be excluded for lack of habitual residence, are instead eligible for assistance. For convenience, we describe those arriving or returning from Afghanistan and covered by these regulations as the Afghan arrivals\/returnees cohort.<\/p><p>Members will be aware that the UK Government created a new pathway for people from Hong Kong to come to the UK because of the Chinese Government&#8217;s national security legislation and the affect it will have on the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. Members will also be acutely aware of the impact and harm that has resulted from the toppling of the Afghan Government by the Taliban regime and how this is also affecting the rights and freedoms of the people of Afghanistan, in particular those Afghans who supported the work of the UK in their country, as well as women and girls, which has led to the creation of an immigration route for some of the Afghan arrivals or returnees cohort. These regulations will ensure that the cohort will be eligible for assistance from day one, rather than having to habitually be resident here.<\/p><p>Though the ties that exist between Hong Kong and Afghanistan with the UK, and, by extension, Wales, are very different, they are nonetheless deep and long-standing. Those relationships mean that we have a commitment to the people of Hong Kong and Afghanistan, and this is why we wish to support those coming here and who require help. Many of the BNO visa holders and the Afghan arrivals\/returnees cohort are already in the country, so I hope Members will understand the need for us to amend the 2014 regulations in case those who have made Wales their new home have need of housing or housing assistance.<\/p><p>If Members support the motion, local authorities in Wales, working with their partners, will now be able to provide the support that will make it easier for people from Hong Kong and the Afghan arrivals\/returnees cohort to settle within Wales.

            "body": "<p>I am delighted to take part in this members&#8217; business debate to emphasise the importance of community wealth building. It is as important in urban areas as it is in rural areas, because the exploitation that is experienced is common to both.<\/p><p>Across our country, we see widening inequality and increasing poverty among working-class communities, and an astronomical rise in the levels of wealth being hoarded by the super-rich. Against that backdrop, the premise of community wealth building is more important than ever before. It is a concept that brings a people-centred approach to local economic development, redirecting wealth back into local economies and putting control back in the hands of local people.<\/p><p>We know that it works. We can look at communities such as North Ayrshire, where the council&#8217;s Labour administration, led by Joe Cullinane, puts the model of community wealth building at the heart of everything that the local authority does. That approach means that more social housing is built, publicly owned energy generating facilities are developed and democratic ownership models are prioritised&#8212;all to the benefit of the community.<\/p><p>That is in stark contrast to what we have seen across Scotland in recent years. Local authorities have been faced with significant financial distress as their budgets have been disproportionately cut, and they seek an easy capital receipt with land disposals.<\/p><p>We know that, of the hundreds of millions of pounds of public land that the Scottish Government and Scottish public authorities have disposed of in recent years, at least 12 per cent has been purchased by one volume house builder, CALA Homes. A good example is the former Boroughmuir high school, in Edinburgh. It was sold for &#163;14.5 million in 2015, and it has recently been redeveloped as more than 100 luxury apartments. CALA Homes advises prospective buyers that, at more than &#163;800,000 per property, they will get a handsome return on their investment. Why was that return on investment not achieved by the community? Instead, it is achieved by anonymous landlords and land holders from all over the world. No one knows who those people are, but they are siphoning our communities&#8217; wealth away from the city of Edinburgh, and that example is replicated across Scotland.<\/p><p>There is an alternative. North Ayrshire is one example, and Preston is yet another. Glasgow could benefit from such a model. Where Preston is reopening libraries and building new ones, Glasgow is closing its libraries because it is facing severe financial problems. At one time, Glasgow led the world in municipal socialism. As a city authority, it owned its tramways, its electric and telephone systems and its entire structure of public transport, and it was the biggest social landlord in the world apart from Hong Kong. However, over the past 30 years, all that social infrastructure has been rapidly dismantled and sold to private interests, where it does not serve the people, and where the profits are extracted.<\/p><p>The Scottish Government has indicated that it is exploring the idea of rolling out a nationwide community wealth building strategy. I would welcome that, but I place on record that it must be done not as a mere sticking plaster to mask the continued local authority budget cuts that are handed down from this place. Those cuts are compounded all the more by the insulting greenwashing that we see in Glasgow in the run-up to the 26th United Nations climate change conference of the parties&#8212;COP26&#8212;with myriad corporate interests sponsoring pathetic interventions in the city&#8217;s built environment while there is broad decline and decay in its urban infrastructure as a result of decades of disproportionate budget cuts.<\/p><p>If we are to adopt the community wealth building model, that must be done alongside the creation of an industrial strategy that puts people and communities at its heart. I encourage the Scottish Government to revisit its proposed compulsory sale order policy, which it quietly dispensed with in the previous session of Parliament. There is an urgent requirement to bring that sort of power back to the forefront of our agenda to ensure that community wealth building is put back in the hands of communities. We must do that in order to take action in communities that have long been blighted by deindustrialisation and the disinvestment caused by budget cuts. I truly hope that the Government embraces the opportunities that community wealth building brings, and does not squander such opportunities as it has done so often in the past.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c46.0\/1\">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Dame Angela. I welcome this timely and important debate, which has been secured by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Miriam Cates\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25897\">the hon. Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Miriam Cates)<\/phrase>.<\/p><p pid=\"c46.0\/2\">My Labour and I colleagues strongly welcome the fact that children aged between 12 and 15 are now being offered their first dose of a covid vaccine, following advice from all four of the UK&#8217;s chief medical officers. That is something we have been calling for since June. It will have both direct and indirect health benefits for children, and it will help to keep them in school, which is vital after all the face-to-face learning they have missed out on and the impact that it could have on their long-term life chances. Vaccinating 12 to 15-year-olds will also help their families and the wider community by helping to keep infection rates down.<\/p><p pid=\"c46.0\/3\">The latest figures show that there were 36,000 new infections in the last 24 hours. There are 7,847 people in hospital with covid-19. The average number of daily deaths over the last week has risen to a tragic 142. In my own city of Leicester, rates remain highest among 11 to 16-year-olds, with a considerable increase over the last month, so there is not a moment to waste.<\/p><p pid=\"c46.0\/4\">We have been calling on the Government since the start of the summer to press ahead with a vaccination programme for children. Back in June, the shadow Minister for Schools, my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Peter Kyle\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25418\">the Member for Hove (Peter Kyle)<\/phrase>, argued that if covid vaccinations for children were found to be safe, as the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency clearly says they are, they should be rolled out over the summer holidays, before the beginning of the new academic year, to help to keep disruption in schools to a minimum.<\/p><p pid=\"c46.0\/5\">In July, the shadow Health Secretary, my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jon Ashworth\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25120\">the Member for Leicester South (Jonathan Ashworth)<\/phrase>, pressed the Health Secretary on why covid-19 vaccinations were being given to children in the United States, Canada, Israel, France, Austria, Spain and Hong Kong, but not here in the UK. I am sad to say that, at that stage, the Government failed to act. Although we are rightly proud of the amazing vaccination programme delivered by our NHS, the truth is that we are now being overtaken by other countries, and that is due in no small part to the vaccination of children.<\/p><p pid=\"c46.0\/6\">France was one of the first to offer vaccines to children, back in June, and now 68% of children aged 12 to 18 have received a single dose. In Italy, the figure is 62% and in Spain 79%. Israel, the United States, Canada, Sweden, Poland and Switzerland have also raced ahead. While our Government spent months delaying on this vital issue, countries across the world acted, and they are now streets ahead of us in protecting children, their education and the wider community. It is vital that we catch up.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1329.0\/1\">My Lords, I welcome the chance to contribute to this debate. I welcome the noble Lord, Lord Sandhurst. I did not actually notice him in Putney. I spent a lot of time canvassing in Putney; perhaps we were in different parts of the constituency. Anyway, it was a good result for us, so I can boast about that.<\/p><p pid=\"a1329.0\/2\">Perhaps I should also say&#8212;I do not know whether I am going to boast or confess&#8212;that I am trying to think of how many demos and events like that I have been on. It is quite a large number. I think the first one I went to was a demonstration against apartheid around South Africa House and the most recent was in Parliament Square on behalf of refugees. I may have been on the wrong side of this new legislation, if it goes through unamended, on a number of occasions, just simply by demonstrating for causes which I believed in, and often with a lot of noise. We often shouted on demos, because that is what one does on a demo&#8212;that is the way demos work. However, enough of that.<\/p><p pid=\"a1329.0\/3\">I am privileged to be on the Joint Committee on Human Rights, and we have had a look at this Bill. I would like to talk about some aspects of the Bill based on the work of the committee, particularly public order and the criminalisation of unauthorised encampments, and to say a brief word about the children of mothers in prison.<\/p><p pid=\"a1329.0\/4\">We must surely protect the right to peaceful protest. We must accept that crime is best tackled when there is co-operation between the police and local communities, and we must never put the police in an impossible position by asking them to enforce a law which works against the right to peaceful protest. Surely that puts the police against local communities, which is the last thing we want to happen. The right to peaceful protest is fundamental. We have seen what happens in countries where peaceful protest rights are denied, most recently in Hong Kong, Belarus and Afghanistan. I do not want those countries to look at us and say that we are taking a leaf out of their behaviour. So we must be concerned about a power that would allow the police to move the location of a demonstration, limit its numbers or duration, or even try to limit the noise. The police already have powers to ensure that demos are lawful and safe. They do not need these extra powers relating to &#8220;intensity&#8221; or &#8220;serious unease&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a1329.0\/5\">These powers could make it difficult for organisers of demos; they will not know how many people are going to join them. If one is on a demo, one does not know how many thousands of people will be there and how they will behave. The organisers of the demo surely cannot be responsible for that. So these conditions will represent a restriction on the right to protest that is not necessary or justified in a democratic society. On protests around Parliament, while it is right that parliamentarians must have free access to Parliament, we do not want Parliament Square to become what I think somebody called a &#8220;dissent-free zone&#8221;. The noise factor seems to have been drafted by people who have never seen a demo&#8212;or been on one.<\/p><p pid=\"a1329.0\/6\">As for one-person protests, I just cannot believe this can be part of the Bill. One-person protests, somebody standing there&#8212;good gracious me. There used to be a man who demonstrated against tobacco. I saw him everywhere: one chap waving a little placard.<\/p><p pid=\"a1329.0\/7\">What worries me about the Bill is that so many of the powers are given to the Government by regulation. Surely these should be defined in the Bill itself. It is not right that Ministers can be given such enormous powers and we do not even know what they are. If they cannot be on the face of the Bill, at the very least the regulations should be published so that Parliament and the JCHR can consider them before scrutiny of the Bill has been completed.<\/p><p pid=\"a1329.0\/8\">Then of course there is a lack of information about conditions attached to demos which makes it harder to judge the effectiveness of existing laws. We should also make sure that conditions imposed at protests are recorded and collected so we can see what has been applied.<\/p><p pid=\"a1329.0\/9\">I turn briefly to the criminalisation of unauthorised encampments. V&#225;clav Havel, one of my heroes, said that the litmus test of a civil society is the way it treats its Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities. That is absolutely crucial. I do not think the Government  should use the criminal law to address what is essentially a planning issue; instead, there should be a statutory duty on local authorities to make adequate site provision for Traveller communities. The idea of seizing a Traveller&#8217;s vehicle&#8212;which is essentially their home&#8212;is just appalling.<\/p><p pid=\"a1329.0\/10\">My noble friend Lord Rooker referred to another important issue: what happens to families where the mother is put in prison and the children are left? As the human rights committee said, the Government still do not know how many mothers of dependent children are in prison. There should surely be a requirement that what will happen in a family if the mother is put in prison is taken into account.<\/p><p pid=\"a1329.0\/11\">I will leave everything else&#8212;except to say to the Minister that she is going to have a jolly tough time in Committee and on Report.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1115.0\/1\">I too extend my congratulations to the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, on her Bill and her powerful contribution in speaking to it. She reminded us that it is timely in the light of events in Afghanistan, which she and others have said have led to families being separated, including children.<\/p><p pid=\"a1115.0\/2\">The noble Baroness addressed a number of points and I certainly cannot refer to them all, but she made a comment about the provision that the Government usually refer to on exceptional cases. However, as we all know, by definition, that when you say &#8220;exceptional cases&#8221; they are few and far between and very limited, and certainly do not address the issue.<\/p><p pid=\"a1115.0\/3\">The noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, and many others also referred to the argument, which will no doubt be trotted out again today, about unaccompanied child refugees being sent over to settle here purely to be able to sponsor family members to come and join them. There is no evidence to substantiate that argument and I wait to see whether it will be brought it out again today in the Government&#8217;s response. My noble friend Lord Dubs addressed the Government&#8217;s claim that you must claim asylum in the first safe country reached. Like him, I wonder whether that one will be mentioned again today, incorrect though it is.<\/p><p pid=\"a1115.0\/4\">I will refer to specific points made in other contributions. I think my noble friend Lady Chakrabarti said that she would like to hear one convincing argument   as to why one should object to the provisions in the Bill on legal aid for family reunion applications. If I understood her correctly, I can say only that I too will wait to hear one convincing argument as to why the provisions in the Bill on legal aid are unacceptable.<\/p><p pid=\"a1115.0\/5\">My noble friend Lord Griffiths of Burry Port made a powerful speech that has been commented on by other noble Lords and which will not be quickly forgotten.<\/p><p pid=\"a1115.0\/6\">The noble Lord, Lord Kerr, let us know that the Refugee Council meets in Alf Dubs House&#8212;I take it that is not literally his house but the name of the building. As he said, it is a very fitting tribute to all the work that my noble friend has done over a great many years.<\/p><p pid=\"a1115.0\/7\">As we know, this Bill would change the present Immigration Rules to allow unaccompanied child refugees who settle here to sponsor family members to come and join them. It would allow a parent settled here to sponsor dependent children over the age of 18 up to the age of 25, and, as we have heard, it would amend existing provisions to allow legal aid for family reunion applications. The Bill is about the family, and particularly children, in the asylum and refugee system, and bringing families torn apart together again at a time of great stress, uncertainty, fear and difficulty. That stress, uncertainty, fear and difficulty have arisen from war, violence and persecution, the threat and reality of murder and rape, having to flee home and country  to find safety and sanctuary elsewhere, and facing exploitation, trafficking and abuse on the way. In the process, the family gets split up at a time when family relationships and support are needed more than ever&#8212;and not least by children.<\/p><p pid=\"a1115.0\/8\">The current system, the rules and how they are applied, does not bring refugee families together again in far too many cases. Previously, the argument has been advanced that going down the road of this Bill would act as a pull factor, encouraging greater numbers to come, but the provisions of the Bill can be exercised only by those who have already met all the criteria for being refugees who have shown that they have fled persecution or conflict, and it is simply about the ability in those cases to reunite with their family.<\/p><p pid=\"a1115.0\/9\">The current arrangements, making family reunion difficult, if not impossible, in that situation, encourage trafficking, its dangers and exploitation&#8212;which surely we all want brought to an end. If there are no safe and legal routes to achieve family reunion, in many cases people will use illegal and dangerous routes out of a sense of desperation that there is no alternative.<\/p><p pid=\"a1115.0\/10\">When there is real hardship and hurt for families that have been torn apart and not reunited, they should not be made to suffer even more, so that their continuing separation will deter others, when there is no evidence that that will happen, as the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, said. Other countries have similar provisions to this Bill in respect of children and family reunion, and it does not appear to act as a major pull factor for them. We know, too, that if we do not have effective legal family reunion settlement routes, that is when we get people falling into the hands of traffickers. But, above that, surely we should be working to keep families together, particularly at their time of greatest  need and strain, as in the case of refugees, when the strength that family relationships bring is more vital and crucial than ever, particularly to children.<\/p><p pid=\"a1115.0\/11\">I hope that in their response, the Government will take a rather more positive stance towards the Bill, which we support, than they have when similar Bills and proposals have been discussed previously. This Government have given a commitment to accept potentially up to 3 million people from Hong Kong, should they decide they need to get out of Hong Kong and come to this country. So, particularly in the light of the situation in Afghanistan, it would seem odd if the Government now raised objections to this Bill, which addresses specific issues on family reunion, on the basis of any unsubstantiated argument that appears at heart to be related simply to numbers. Like all other noble Lords, I now await the Government&#8217;s response.<\/p>",

We therefore announced in October 2020 we would be phasing out the use of most EEA and Swiss national identity cards for entry to the UK.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The changes mean, from 1 October 2021, EEA and Swiss citizens outside of those with status under the EU Settlement Scheme or rights under the Withdrawal Agreements will, like other nationalities, need a passport to demonstrate nationality and identity at the UK border, rather than use a national identity card.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We have also made a change to the Immigration Rules which reflects the change in the security situation in Afghanistan, by making changes to allow current and former Afghan locally employed staff (LES) and their family members who are outside Afghanistan to relocate to the UK under the Afghan relocations and assistance policy and the ex gratia scheme. The schemes had previously only been available to those in Afghanistan.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Further to this we are also making a further change to grant indefinite leave to enter the UK to LES who are approved for relocation to the UK. This will replace the five years&#8217; limited leave they are currently granted. Those already in the UK will be able to apply for indefinite leave to remain before their limited leave expires if they choose to.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>These changes emphasise the UK commitment to supporting LES and their families to settle in the UK, and our gratitude for the support they provided to UK forces in Afghanistan.<\/p><p> <\/p>We are launching the new International Sportsperson visa category which will amalgamate and replace the Tier 2 and Tier 5 categories for professional sporting workers with simplified, dedicated visa arrangements.<p> <\/p><p>The Tier 5 visa routes are being rebranded to deliver a package of Temporary Work routes, providing a better service for customers through simplified Rules that are aligned with the new points-based system.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We are also launching a dedicated Temporary Worker &#8211; Creative Worker visa category, tailored to creative workers to better serve the needs of the sector.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Consequential amendments are being made to Appendix AR to provide a right of administrative review for eligible decisions under the new International Sportsperson route and the re-branded Temporary Worker routes.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Some changes are being made in respect of the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS), which enables EEA and Swiss citizens resident in the UK by the end of the transition period, and their family members, to obtain the UK immigration status they need to continue living in the UK.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The changes reflect in the Immigration Rules for the EUSS, in Appendix EU, the concession outside the Rules for applicants whose continuous residence in the UK has been affected by coronavirus (COVID-19) which was published in guidance on 10 June 2021. This will ensure , in a range of circumstances where, due to COVID-19, the applicant would have exceeded the permitted absence from the UK, and broken their period of continuous residence, they will continue to qualify for status under the EUSS.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The changes also allow a joining family member to apply to the EUSS whilst in the UK as a visitor, replacing the concession to this effect outside Appendix EU currently set out in guidance.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Technical changes are being made to reflect the passing of the 30 June 2021 deadline for applications to the EUSS by those resident in the UK by the end of the transition period (though a late application can still be made where there are reasonable grounds why the person missed that deadline), and to reflect the fact a person who is exempt from immigration control can, if they wish, apply to the EUSS whilst they remain exempt or they can apply once they have ceased to be exempt.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Changes are being made to the Youth Mobility Scheme (YMS) to re-brand the route from T5 (Temporary Worker) Youth Mobility Scheme to Youth Mobility Scheme.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>We are also expanding our YMS to include new arrangements with Iceland and India. This will deliver on international commitments made via a Memorandum of Understanding with Iceland and mobility agreements with India. Both schemes are expected to launch on 1 January 2022.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The YMS update will also allow citizens and nationals or the rightful holder of a passport issued by a territory, without Deemed Sponsorship Status to apply for this route from any post that accepts such applications worldwide.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The allocations for 2022 have also been updated in Appendix Youth Mobility Scheme: eligible nationals.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Finally, following a concession made outside the Rules to allow the partner and, if applicable, child under 18 of a British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) status holder to join the BN(O) status holder following a grant on the Hong Kong British National (Overseas) route, this has now been incorporated into the Immigration Rules for the BN(O) route.<\/p>",

I am, of course, a great respecter of English PEN and in my role&#8212;I guess I am principally appearing here as chair of Index on Censorship, which is the global freedom of expression advocate, 50 years old&#8212;we work rather closely with English PEN. Today we publish censored work in our quarterly magazine, build our &#8220;Banned by Beijing&#8221; campaign and fight for freedom of journalists, for example, in places such as Belarus.<\/p><p>The reason I make that point is that Index broadly supports the intention of the Bill, but coming to the specific question you asked me, from our point of view we look at this from the international perspective. Many of those who face censorship regard Britain as an exemplar and use us as a standard to aspire to. However, so do authoritarians of all political stripes. Any extension of the state&#8217;s power over speech at home can be used by those who want to as a means of, as an example, limiting freedom of expression. Your point about the regulator is an important one. To be honest, unless the regulator is actually a regulator of behaviour, there seems little point. Universities do not lack for advice of various kinds.<\/p><p>The important point about this post is that he or she should be a protector of the freedom of expression of students and academics&#8212;and indeed, by the way, those who are not academics. For example, there was a case in Cambridge where a porter essentially lost his job because of a view he expressed. In my view, if we are going to go down this road, that individual role has to be the role of a regulator and a protector of freedom of expression.<\/p><p>A very good example at the moment that is not much talked about is the position of international students. I welcome the presence of international students: I was one myself many moons ago. But we have concerns that certain countries&#8212;I am specifically thinking of China&#8212;covertly monitor and try to control the behaviour of  their students. That has been exacerbated by the introduction of security laws in Hong Kong. It seems to me that a regulator should have the will, the power and the capability to ensure that those students and their right to express their opinions are protected.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b553.1\/1\">My Lords, this has been a very interesting debate, and I add just two points. One is a warning note on military interventions and the other concerns the possible future scale of asylum claims from Afghanistan. First, I suggest that we must be much more careful in future about military interventions in foreign countries, especially in the Middle East. The liberation of Kuwait was certainly successful, perhaps because it was a relatively limited operation in both time and scope, and because it had full support from the people of that country. Since then, we have had Iraq, Libya and, I would add, Syria. All of them have largely failed. Having served for 15 years in the Arab and Muslim world, including as ambassador in Syria and Saudi Arabia, I have concluded that those outcomes were mainly because we fail to understand the internal dynamics of those very complex countries. I support the calls by other noble lords for a wide-ranging inquiry&#8212;and the sooner the better, so that lessons can be learned.<\/p><p pid=\"b553.1\/2\">Secondly, of course we should grant asylum to those who have worked directly for us, together with their families; the same should also apply to female judges and officials, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Judge, pointed out, but we need to be careful. The scale of further applications from Afghanistan could be huge. The Afghan population is now about 40 million, and there are a further 5 million who are refugees, mainly in neighbouring countries.<\/p><p pid=\"b553.1\/3\">The British Government recently made a promise of eventual settlement in the UK to 4.5 million people from Hong Kong. Meanwhile, our own society is already struggling to cope with massive levels of immigration, which has averaged 300,000 a year. That is despite 10 years of promises to reduce it. This has driven population growth of 7 million in the past 20 years, placing considerable strain on our social cohesion.<\/p><p pid=\"b553.1\/4\">The noble Baroness, Lady Casey, pointed out in a 2016 report that there are<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b553.1\/5\">&#8220;worrying levels of segregation and socio-economic exclusion in different&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b553.1\/6\">areas of the UK. She is right. The Government should be very careful about adding to our difficulties in this very delicate area.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1278.1\/1\">While the best still apply to join our Royal Navy, the Army, the Royal Marines and the Royal Air Force, we can have hope for the future. We weep for the losses; we acknowledge mistakes; we will remember them. When I, like other MPs, have visited our armed forces in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Falklands and the former Yugoslavia, I was with ordinary people, working together to achieve remarkable results, of significance to us and often of lifesaving importance to others.<\/p><p pid=\"a1278.1\/2\">Those who were here for the Saturday debate on the Falklands found, I think, a rather different style of debate, when people were united on what we ought to try to achieve. As Enoch Powell said, the reason to intervene in the Falklands was not that we were guaranteed to succeed, but that the mission was capable of success. That would not have been the case if we were trying to resist, say, China taking Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"a1278.1\/3\">Our experience in Afghanistan in the 19th century, and in the 20 years&#8217; conflict that has now come to an end, will make people think about whether what was aimed for in Afghanistan after the initial targets were achieved was going to have an end that could be happy or content. I do not think it was an example of trying to resist nationalism, because the forces within Afghanistan are multifarious and have their histories, which I will not go into now.<\/p><p pid=\"a1278.1\/4\">The second debate, which I have read up on a number of times during my parliamentary service, was the Norway debate, where again there were some speeches of most remarkable intelligence and experience, and others that, frankly, I think people should have been slightly ashamed of. We have to learn that what this Parliament can do is  not to be Government but to try to question Government, support Government where appropriate, and get them to change at times.<\/p><p pid=\"a1278.1\/5\">On the question whether there should be an inquiry, it would be interesting to hear the views of the Chairmen of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committees, either today or some other time, because I think that would be useful.<\/p><p pid=\"a1278.1\/6\">I do not want to spend too much time, because I want to make up some of the time that was used by my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Ian Blackford\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25361\">the Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Ian Blackford)<\/phrase>, who when he said he was concentrating seems to have lost his concentration once or twice, and when he said he was being wound up, some of us thought ought to have been wound down. [Laughter.]<\/p><p pid=\"a1278.1\/7\">The key issues are obvious: what is happening now, what happens now and then what lessons can be learned. On what is happening now, the reports given by Ministers both in this House and to Members of Parliament across the Chamber are important and valuable; please can those continue? What can happen will be determined in large part by those who are presently in command in Afghanistan&#8212;whether they control Afghanistan is a separate issue&#8212;but people may look back and say that the speed of transition, in the end, might have been better than a prolonged start to a civil war. But that is in the future; we cannot judge that and I will not try to do that.<\/p><p pid=\"a1278.1\/8\">I end by saying this. If we decide that we are not going to get involved in world affairs, the world will be worse. If we decide that we are going to have the capability to work with others when we can, and occasionally on our own, that is fine. But as a Parliament, we ought to be aware that we probably made a mistake in backing Government over one of the Iraq wars. In my view we certainly made a mistake in not backing Government over Syria. If we look at the number of people who have died in Syria and the number of refugees around the world and make the comparison with Afghanistan, I think we probably should be ashamed of our vote over Syria.<\/p><p pid=\"a1278.1\/9\">I stop now, as an example to others.<\/p>",

This coincides with a change in our advice, meaning that the do-not-travel rules for amber countries have now been relaxed, which will be a huge boost to our aviation and travel sectors ahead of the vital summer season.<\/p><p pid=\"a354.6\/2\">Also from today, children under the age of 18 will not have to self-isolate when returning to England, making family reunions and holidays far more accessible. Children aged four and under will continue to be exempt from any travel testing, while children aged five to 10 will only need to do a day two PCR. Eleven to 18 year-olds will need to take both a pre-departure test and a day two PCR, as is the case for arrivals from green list countries.<\/p><p pid=\"a354.6\/3\">I must reiterate that public health remains our priority, and with our measures on international travel we are safeguarding the gains made by our successful domestic vaccine programme. That is why, on Friday, the Government took the decision to exempt France  from the new arrangements for fully vaccinated people returning to England. This decision was taken after concerns were raised by the Joint Biosecurity Centre over the persistent presence of cases in France of the beta variant, which was first identified in South Africa. I understand that the Minister for Covid Vaccine Deployment, my honourable friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Nadhim Zahawi\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24822\">the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Nadhim Zahawi)<\/phrase>, will be able to answer questions on the data and the concerns raised by the JBC in a Statement shortly.<\/p><p pid=\"a354.6\/4\">I can also confirm to the House that, since 4 am this morning, there have been changes to the countries in the traffic-light system. Bulgaria, Croatia, Hong Kong and Taiwan have been added to the Government&#8217;s green list; Croatia and Taiwan have also been added to the green watchlist, signalling to passengers that these countries are potentially at risk of moving from green to amber at short notice should swift action be required to protect public health in England.<\/p><p pid=\"a354.6\/5\">The Balearic islands and the British Virgin Islands have been added to the amber list and, unfortunately, Cuba, Indonesia, Myanmar and Sierra Leone have been added to the red list.<\/p><p pid=\"a354.6\/6\">We keep all these measures under constant review to ensure that they remain necessary and proportionate. The system we have designed is adaptable to the evolving epidemiological picture, and the UK Government are prepared to take action at any time to protect public health.&#8221;<\/p>",

Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Kim Johnson)<\/phrase> on securing the debate, and on being such a passionate advocate on this issue. I am sure that we all wish her a swift recovery from the coronavirus, although, as we have just seen, covid does not seem to be having too much of an impact on her.<\/p><p pid=\"a1104.0\/2\">I also think it worth paying tribute to former Members, such as the former Member for Liverpool, Wavertree, Luciana Berger, and the former Member for Liverpool, West Derby, Stephen Twigg, who brought this issue to the attention of my predecessors. While it is right that we discuss it on the 75th anniversary of the deportations, I know this is not the first time it has been raised on the Floor of the House. The hon. Member&#8217;s predecessor, the indomitable Bessie Braddock, Member of Parliament for the wonderfully titled constituency Liverpool Exchange, first raised this with the then post-war Labour Government back in 1946. It was with great interest and admiration that I read about Mrs Marion Lee, who in August 1946 helped to create an organisation to campaign for the rights of Chinese seamen&#8217;s families, which must have been particularly brave given wider societal attitudes at  that time. I also pay tribute, as the hon. Member did, to Peter Foo and others in Liverpool who have campaigned long and hard on this issue in the search for answers about what happened.<\/p><p pid=\"a1104.0\/3\">I do recognise the strength of feeling on Merseyside about what happened during this post-war period. I hear the hon. Member&#8217;s concerns and I will come on to some next steps later. I am glad that she has had a further opportunity to place her views and what happened at that time on record. I am also pleased that our current immigration rules and equalities legislation would preclude this type of behaviour from occurring now. Furthermore, I will ensure that her letter to the Home Secretary is responded to as soon as possible.<\/p><p pid=\"a1104.0\/4\">The Chinese community have had such a wonderful and welcome impact on our culture and are integral to modern Britain. I am proud that so many Chinese nationals have now made Britain their choice of destination for study, with 1 million student visas issued since 2010; their choice of destination to work, with over 55,000 work visas issued since 2010; and, ultimately, their choice of home, with over 60,000 grants of settlement and over 45,000 grants of citizenship. Our British nationals overseas group reflects the UK&#8217;s historical moral commitment to the people of Hong Kong who chose to retain ties to the UK by taking up this status at the point of Hong Kong&#8217;s handover to China in 1997.<\/p><p pid=\"a1104.0\/5\">Turning to the background, back in 1946 there were some 15,000 to 20,000 Chinese seamen based in the city of Liverpool. Chinese seamen made up almost 15% of the entire manpower of the merchant fleet at that time. I understand that the seamen in question were subject to the wartime regulations, which included what we would now regard as strict disciplinary conditions to obey orders to join ship and contractual obligations to return to their home country. Sadly, that meant that they faced not only the perils of war, but the overt racism that was common at that time. All too often, they were the ones literally at the bottom of the ship, on the lower decks, and it is all too easy to work out what their fate would be if they were there when a torpedo struck their ship. That is why I am always proud that my own branch of the Royal British Legion, the Paignton branch, commemorates Merchant Navy Day each year, alongside the other commemorations to remember all those who serve, to include the men who gave their lives trying to keep this country fed and supplied at the height of world war two.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b326.0\/1\">I thank the Minister for this discussion on the Statement made on Monday in the Commons. In fact, even since Monday the world has moved on. The infection rate continues to rise. There are mixed messages from government Ministers about responses to the ping. For example, does the Minister share my concern that the Investment Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Grimstone, wrote to the car manufacturer Nissan, pointing out that isolating after being pinged by the app was only &#8220;advisory&#8221; and that there was no &#8220;legal duty&#8221; to isolate? I recall the noble Lord explaining this to the House some weeks ago at my prompting. Indeed, many noble Lords came to me afterwards and said that they had not realised that there was no legal obligation to isolate after the ping. There is huge confusion now about vaccine passports, and 1 million children are out of school as their term ends. Here in London, we still have some challenges about getting people vaccinated.<\/p><p pid=\"b326.0\/2\">So let us start with the issue of the vaccination of teenagers. The MHRA has approved the Pfizer jab for all 12 to 18 year-olds. Indeed, such countries as the United States, Canada, Israel, France, Austria, Spain, Hong Kong and others have started or soon will be vaccinating their 12 to 18 year-olds. Can the Minister tell us when we might start doing the same?<\/p><p pid=\"b326.0\/3\">The Prime Minister obviously took fright on Monday, because on Tuesday he made the announcements about vaccine passports in September. I think that even he could see that nightclubs were offering superspreader events, with music and strobe lights attached to them&#8212;talk about closing the door after the horse has bolted.<\/p><p pid=\"b326.0\/4\">The risk of death to children from Covid is mercifully very low, but they can become very sick and develop long-term conditions and long Covid. Indeed, according  to the Office for National Statistics, 14.5% of children aged 12 to 16 have symptoms lasting longer than five weeks. Will the Minister spell out in detail the clinical basis for why the JCVI has made its decision? Will he publish all the analysis and documents in the same way that SAGE has published its analysis, not just its advice? Will he guarantee that this decision was made on medical grounds, not on the grounds of vaccine supply?<\/p><p pid=\"b326.0\/5\">The Statement talks about infection among children being disruptive. We know that infection among children is highly disruptive for learning. We have seen hundreds of thousands of children out of school. We are not vaccinating all adolescents. Can the Minister tell the House what the Government&#8217;s plan for September is, when children return to school? For example, are the Government considering using this summer to install air filtration units in every classroom in every school?<\/p><p pid=\"b326.0\/6\">Testing is already stretched, with turnaround times lengthening, so can the Minister guarantee that through the summer, especially once contacts can be released from isolation on the back of a negative PCR test in August, and into September when schools return, there will be sufficient PCR testing capacity to meet demand? As we move into autumn and winter, we can anticipate more flu and respiratory viruses, so do we need multi-pathogen testing going forward? Is this being developed?<\/p><p pid=\"b326.0\/7\">It has been announced that critical workers such as food, health, utility and border staff with two Covid jabs will be able to avoid self-isolation. Many ambulance and acute hospital trusts have found themselves under extreme pressure because of the combination of very high demand and very high levels of staff absence due to self-isolation.<\/p><p pid=\"b326.0\/8\">Three weeks ago, the Health Secretary told us that unlocking would make us &#8220;healthier&#8221; and promised us it would be &#8220;irreversible&#8221;, but today we have some of the highest infection rates in the world. Can the Minister tell us what the experts say about the risk of reimposing new restrictions in future? Our already exhausted NHS staff face a summer crisis. Covid admissions are already running at about 550 a day, and hospitals are now all cancelling cancer surgery. For example, liver transplant operations were cancelled in Birmingham last week.<\/p><p pid=\"b326.0\/9\">It is clear that more infections mean more isolation. The NHS staff released from isolation if double-jabbed will still want to protect themselves and their patients, so will the Minister ensure that the standard of masks worn in NHS settings is upgraded to the FFP3 requirement that NHS staff have called for? What is his plan for keeping the economy and public services functioning through the summer, as more and more people are asked to isolate? Can the Minister confirm reports that SAGE scientists have advised that some measures, such as mandatory masks and working from home, should be reinstated at the beginning of August?<\/p><p pid=\"b326.0\/10\">Recent days have seen some of the lowest numbers getting first-time jabs on record, with the daily average now lower than at any point since the start of the programme&#8212;although I suspect the Prime Minister is hoping that his threat that you will need a vaccine passport to get into a nightclub might help in that direction. Unused vaccine doses are being sent back by GPs as demand for jabs slows to a fraction of  recent levels, yet we still have millions of unvaccinated adults. Does the Minister share my concern that falling demand, combined with emerging evidence of the effectiveness of vaccines beginning to wane over time, may mean that we in this country will be less protected in September?<\/p><p pid=\"b326.0\/11\">Finally, I understand that the &#8220;hands, face, space&#8221; slogan is about to be dropped in favour of a plea to &#8220;Keep life moving&#8221;, despite the fact that hundreds of thousands of people are still isolating. Can the Minister explain what this actually means?<\/p>",

Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Angela Eagle\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10182\">the Member for Wallasey (Dame Angela Eagle)<\/phrase> for securing this important debate. As broadcasters including Sir David Attenborough have warned, the privatisation of Channel 4 would have disastrous and far-reaching consequences for the film and television sector. The UK&#8217;s creative industries are one of the fastest growing sectors of the economy, widely admired across the world. Channel 4 sits at the heart, with its distinct remit to reinvest profits into commissioning. All that would be jeopardised by privatisation.<\/p><p pid=\"b374.0\/2\">The claim that the consultation now under way is a response to a changing broadcasting landscape is not believable. The Minister first advocated privatisation all the way back in 1996. His attempts to push through privatisation when he was Culture Secretary were frustrated only because David Cameron, the Prime Minister who sold off Royal Mail for a pittance, recognised the irreparable harm that would do to the wider cultural sector.<\/p><p pid=\"b374.0\/3\">In fact, despite all the challenges posed by the rise of the streaming giants, Channel 4 continues to thrive, both critically and commercially. Last year, the channel recorded a record &#163;74 million pre-tax surplus, while also bagging a prime-time Emmy for its coverage of the deteriorating situation in Hong Kong. Viewing figures for the terrestrial channels and All 4 continue to rise. The Minister is confecting a crisis where none is, in order to provide a flimsy pretext for privatisation.<\/p><p pid=\"b374.0\/4\">The Minister should come clean about the Government&#8217;s motivations. This is not about money; it is about ideology. He wants Channel 4 to be consigned to the dustbin of history because it is simply too good at doing what it is supposed to do. For four decades it has been a leading provider of innovative content that resonates, not just with communities across Britain but across the globe. It is a showcase of what is possible when things are run in the interests of the public good and not for private profit. Since its inception, &#8220;Channel 4 News&#8221; has spoken truth to power and exposed injustices and corruption at home and abroad. That is something that this Government and this Prime Minister simply cannot stand.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b914.1\/1\">The hon. Gentleman mentions Syrians fleeing war crimes. Our resettlement programme has principally focused on Syrians fleeing war crimes, who, via the UNHCR working in the region, have been able, safely and legally, to come to this country in greater numbers than are seen in any other European resettlement programme. That is quicker, safer and easier than illegally crossing the channel in a dinghy. We are not just running Europe&#8217;s resettlement programme; as we speak, we are bringing locally engaged staff from Afghanistan to the UK, and we have opened up a route for British nationals overseas from Hong Kong to come here, escaping the oppressive regime of the Chinese Communist party. In addition, 29,000 people have come in the past six years as part of refugees family reunions. So when the Opposition claim that we are not offering safe and legal routes, that is simply not true.<\/p><p pid=\"b914.1\/2\">The Scottish nationalists have been saying that Scotland would like to do more. I am very disappointed, as I said in my intervention, when I was able to get in, that out of the 32 local authorities in Scotland only one, Glasgow, takes dispersed asylum seekers. If Scotland wants to do more, they have the opportunity to do so. Moreover, when it comes to taking unaccompanied asylum seeking children under the national transfer scheme, Scotland took only a very small handful of the 600 or so who were transferred last year. Scottish National party Members cannot talk about money, because those children have more than &#163;50,000 a year of funding going with them. There are children right now in Dover who need to be looked after, so I call on the Scottish Government to put action behind their words and take some of those children on&#8212;tonight. They do not need independence to do that; they can do it now.<\/p><p pid=\"b914.1\/3\">Let me be clear: we will always play our part for those in genuine need, but we should choose who deserves our help. Illegal immigration undermines that choice. Instead of the UK being able to choose the children and families most in need, illegal immigration instead allows those who pay people smugglers or who are strong to push their way to the front of the queue.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a283.1\/1\">I will not, as I have less than five minutes and this has been a lengthy debate.<\/p><p pid=\"a283.1\/2\">The Government remain committed to an immigration policy that welcomes and celebrates people who are here legally but also deters illegal immigration. We want to encourage people with skills and potential from around the world to make the UK their home and help make the UK a dynamic global economy, but we must not reward those who exploit the system and break the rules. We must also prevent the abuse of benefits and services paid for by UK taxpayers and disrupt the criminals who exploit and profit from the vulnerable, who will be tempted to use dangerous and irregular routes to get here if they can see a clear reward at the end of it. That is right both for the British public who pay for welfare services and for those wishing to visit and settle in the UK who played by the rules.<\/p><p pid=\"a283.1\/3\">The Government recognise that we have a responsibility to help the vulnerable and have established several schemes and programmes to assist those most in need. One example is the work that we have done to resettle genuine refugees fleeing directly from regions of conflict and instability and to provide the necessary support to help them build a life in the UK and integrate as self-sufficient members of our society. In the past six years, the Government have offered protection to 25,000 people in this way&#8212;more than any other country in Europe in that period&#8212;through a planned resettlement scheme. That is in addition to welcoming a further  29,000 people through refugee family reunion between 2015 and 2019. We have also recently introduced a new pathway to citizenship for British national overseas status holders and their family members facing draconian new security laws in Hong Kong, with an estimated 5.4 million people potentially being eligible for the scheme.<\/p><p pid=\"a283.1\/4\">We believe that a fair and balanced system is about guaranteeing integrity in the UK&#8217;s immigration system. We must support those in need, but we must also make sure that there is a cost for those who intend to break the rules, as have Governments of all colours since the introduction of our modern immigration system, despite some of the comments we have heard today.<\/p><p pid=\"a283.1\/5\">The proposal to offer amnesty to all those without permission to be in the UK undermines the integrity and effective working of the UK immigration system. To recognise the stay of those who have wilfully and deliberately broken our laws is first and foremost an affront to those who have done the right thing and migrated here lawfully and contributed by paying visa fees and the immigration surcharge. An amnesty for those not playing by the rules could prove divisive for those groups who feel an injustice when they have complied with our policies, and it is safe to say that it is unlikely to build public confidence in the migration system. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich said, it would certainly be interesting to see the public reaction if such a policy were included in an election manifesto.<\/p><p pid=\"a283.1\/6\">The debate is about not just the impact of those ignoring our migration rules and refusing to leave but making sure that the public feel that there is confidence in the system. Why would someone bother to apply for status or renew their visa if they knew that they could just stay and be granted that status anyway? A point ignored by the petition and by some Members is the fact that the immigration routes already provide for undocumented migrants who have not broken the law except for by remaining in the UK without lawful immigration status.<\/p>",

Can he tell us how many and by when? The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency has approved the Pfizer jab for all 12 to 18-year-olds. Indeed, countries such as the United States, Canada, Israel, France, Austria, Spain, Hong Kong and others have started vaccinating, or soon will be, 12 to 18-year-olds, so why are we not?<\/p><p pid=\"d689.0\/4\">The Minister rightly said that the risk of death to children from covid is mercifully very low, but children can become very sick and they can develop long-term conditions and long covid. Indeed, according to the Office for National Statistics, 14.5% of children aged 12 to 16 have symptoms lasting longer than five weeks, so will he spell out in detail the clinical basis for why the JCVI has made this decision? Will he publish all its analysis and documents in the same way that the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies publishes its analysis&#8212;not just the advice&#8212;and can he guarantee that this decision was made on medical grounds and not on grounds of vaccine supply?<\/p><p pid=\"d689.0\/5\">The Minister talked about infection among children being disruptive, and we know that infection among children is highly disruptive for learning&#8212;we have seen hundreds of thousands of children out of school. If we are not vaccinating all adolescents, can he tell us what the Government&#8217;s plan is for September, when children return to school? For example, will he consider using this summer to install air filtration units in every classroom or in every school?<\/p><p pid=\"d689.0\/6\">Testing is already stretched, with turnaround times lengthening. Can the Minister guarantee that through the summer&#8212;and especially once contacts can be released from isolation on the back of a negative PCR test in August&#8212;and into September, when schools return, there will be sufficient PCR testing capacity to meet demand? As we move into autumn and winter, we anticipate more flu and respiratory viruses. Those are illnesses with symptoms that often overlap with covid, so will he also now invest in our testing capacity, so that alongside a covid test we can test for flu and respiratory syncytial virus this winter? We need multi-pathogen testing going forward.<\/p><p pid=\"d689.0\/7\">Three weeks ago, the Health Secretary told us that unlocking would make us healthier, and he promised us that it would be irreversible, but today we have some of the highest infection case rates in the world, and the mayor from &#8220;Jaws&#8221; has decided to reopen the beaches, recklessly throwing off all the restrictions with no safety precautions in place, such as mandatory mask wearing. It risks reimposing new restrictions in the future, and it means that the NHS is facing a summer crisis. Already, admissions for covid are running at around 550 a day, and hospitals are cancelling cancer surgery. Liver transplant operations were cancelled in Birmingham last week.<\/p><p pid=\"d689.0\/8\">Throwing off all restrictions like this will see thousands suffer serious long-term illness. The clinically vulnerable and scared are feeling shut out of society, and selection  pressure could see a new variant emerging that evades the success of the vaccine programme, setting us back and snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. It is reckless, and it does not have our support.<\/p><p pid=\"d689.0\/9\">More infections means more isolation. The NHS staff who will be released from isolation if double-jabbed will still want protection for themselves and their patients, so will the Minister ensure that the standard of masks worn in NHS settings is upgraded to the FFP3 requirement, as NHS staff have called for? What is his plan for keeping the economy and public services functioning throughout the summer as more and more people are asked to isolate?<\/p><p pid=\"d689.0\/10\">We know that the Prime Minister&#8217;s and the Chancellor&#8217;s plan was to dodge isolation, so can the Minister tell us how this &#8220;random&#8221; clinical trial, which so helpfully selected the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, was set up? Will he tell us what exactly happened between 8 am and 10.38 am on Sunday that persuaded the Prime Minister and the Chancellor to withdraw from this presumably valuable and random clinical study? Can he tell us how many other Ministers have participated in the trial? Did he participate? How many Government Departments and officials were involved, and why? If he cannot answer these questions sufficiently, our constituents will rightly conclude that it is one rule for Tory Ministers and another for the rest of us.<\/p>",

This coincides with a change in our advice, meaning that the do-not-travel rules for amber countries have now been relaxed, which will be a huge boost to our aviation and travel sectors ahead of the vital summer season.<\/p><p pid=\"d670.2\/2\">Also from today, children under the age of 18 will not have to self-isolate when returning to England, making family reunions and holidays far more accessible. Children aged four and under will continue to be exempt from any travel testing, while children aged five to 10 will only need to do a day two PCR. Eleven to 18-year-olds will need to take both a pre-departure test and a day two PCR, as is the case for arrivals from green list countries.<\/p><p pid=\"d670.2\/3\">I must reiterate that public health remains our priority, and with our measures on international travel we are safeguarding the gains made by our successful domestic vaccine programme. That is why, on Friday, the Government took the decision to exempt France from the new arrangements for fully vaccinated people returning to England. This decision was taken after concerns were raised by the Joint Biosecurity Centre over the persistent presence of cases in France of the beta variant, which was first identified in South Africa.

Bulgaria, Croatia, Hong Kong and Taiwan have been added to the Government&#8217;s green list; Croatia and Taiwan have also been added to the green watchlist, signalling to passengers that these countries are potentially at risk of moving from green to amber at short notice should swift action be required to protect public health in England.<\/p><p pid=\"d670.2\/5\">The Balearic islands and the British Virgin Islands have been added to the amber list and, unfortunately, Cuba, Indonesia, Myanmar and Sierra Leone have been added to the red list.<\/p><p pid=\"d670.2\/6\">We keep all these measures under constant review to ensure that they remain necessary and proportionate.

The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, has fearlessly shone a light on a practice that, even for the Chinese Communist Party, which is responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of its own people, plumbs new depths of depravity. His admirable Bill deserves our wholehearted support, and I fully endorse and agree with all the preceding speeches in the debate today.<\/p><p pid=\"a2116.1\/2\">The China Tribunal said that it was<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a2116.1\/3\">&#8220;certain&#8212;unanimously, and sure beyond reasonable doubt&#8212;that in China forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience has been practised for a substantial period of time involving a very substantial number of victims.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a2116.1\/4\">Dr Enver Tohti, a Uighur doctor, described to me how he had been required to remove organs and ordered to<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a2116.1\/5\">&#8220;cut deep and work fast&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a2116.1\/6\">on a victim who was still alive. The theft of organs has been described as an almost perfect crime, because no one survives.<\/p><p pid=\"a2116.1\/7\">However, the crime does not end there: there is a further twist to this infamy. Anonymous, plastinated corpses taken from Chinese prisons have been paraded in a carnival of horrors at money-making exhibitions&#8212;a final sneering insult to these victims. In 2018, after one such exhibition, I wrote to the Times, along with Professor Jo Martin, President of the Royal College of Pathologists, and 55 others, saying:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a2116.1\/8\">&#8220;We believe that the legislation requires reform&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a2116.1\/9\">The Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, now seeks to do precisely that, and he is to be commended warmly for bringing it before your Lordships&#8217; House.<\/p><p pid=\"a2116.1\/10\">However, we should go further still. The plastinated cadavers indicate that many are young people. The Minister should establish whether it is possible to extract DNA from these corpses to discover something of their origins and ethnic identity. The law did not require the coroner to determine how the corpses exhibited in Birmingham had died. It should.<\/p><p pid=\"a2116.1\/11\">What of the World Health Organization? Will the Minister tell us why the Government resisted my freedom of information request to publish their correspondence with the WHO on organ harvesting? They should press it hard to lead an international campaign for legislation like this to be enacted elsewhere, combating and ending these criminal practices.<\/p><p pid=\"a2116.1\/12\">On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-07-22\">22 July<\/phrase> it will be 22 years since the start of the persecution of Falun Gong. Jiang Zemin established the 610 Office to eradicate&#8212;his word&#8212;Falun Gong, practised at the time by 70 million Chinese people. In undercover phone calls recorded during investigations, Chinese doctors said that Jiang Zemin gave direct instructions to harvest organs from Falun Gong.

Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)<\/phrase> on bringing this very important debate before us today, and I thank the Backbench Business Committee for granting it. We have heard a lot of fantastic speeches with a lot of great points made, none more so than the closing remarks of <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Nusrat Ghani\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25354\">the hon. Member for Wealden (Ms Ghani)<\/phrase>. She was an extra speaker, and we were very grateful to hear from her because her closing remarks hit the nail on the head.<\/p><p pid=\"b629.1\/2\">We have heard a lot recently from many about how sport and politics do not mix, but with all due respect, that is rubbish. The international community came together &#8212;well, in the most part&#8212;and isolated apartheid South Africa from international sport until it gave full human rights to all its citizens. I say &#8220;in the most part&#8221; because there were still those who regurgitated the phrase &#8220;sport and politics don&#8217;t mix&#8221;, even while the rest of the world stood against obvious injustice and repression in South Africa. Of course, sport should be free of state interference and political parties or figures meddling in its day-to-day organisation, but that does not mean that we cannot apply political ideals such as human rights and liberal democracy to the governance of sport and to where governing bodies choose to hold events.<\/p><p pid=\"b629.1\/3\">Those ideals were thrown under a bus when the 2022 Winter Olympics were awarded to Beijing. We now know from leaked Chinese Communist party documents that, even before the games were awarded in 2015, the Uyghur people were the target of systematic and brutal repression. The party&#8217;s general secretary called for a period of painful interventional treatment, education and transformation.  That education and treatment has involved up to 2 million people being detained, used as slave labour and forcibly sterilised, and the Muslim population forced to drink alcohol and eat pork as part of their so-called education. That is undisguised, unmitigated barbarity at a scale we have not seen on this continent since the second world war. Those are crimes against humanity, which the rest of the world has a moral duty to stand up against. We must deny the Chinese Government&#8217;s attempts to bask in the warm glow of international sport.<\/p><p pid=\"b629.1\/4\">The SNP supports the calls for the UK Government to withhold support for the event by not sending any Government officials, politicians or members of the royal family. Of course, it is always solely for the Olympic associations to take decisions about the attendance of athletes themselves. We encourage the UK Government and the international community to call out the egregious human rights abuses being committed against the Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang. We note that the international community did that most recently at the UN Human Rights Council. The UN human rights commissioner or another independent fact-finding body must be given unfettered access to Xinjiang. The genocide in Xinjiang and the human rights abuses elsewhere must not escape an international response.<\/p><p pid=\"b629.1\/5\">In a report published last week, as has been referenced, the Foreign Affairs Committee called for big boy politics on China. Boycotting the games was one of the manifold recommendations it made to the UK Government, who have so far dragged their feet on robust action on China. Last week, Members of the European Parliament overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling on diplomatic officials to boycott the &#8217;22 Winter Olympics in response to continuing human rights abuses by the Chinese Government. It was passed by 578 votes to 29 and was supported by all of Europe&#8217;s mainstream political groups, including the centre-right European People&#8217;s Party&#8212;the group of the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel&#8212;and the centrists of France&#8217;s Emmanuel Macron. The resolution calls for EU officials and member states to decline all Government and diplomatic invitations to the Winter Olympics unless the Chinese Government demonstrate a verifiable improvement in the human rights situation in Hong Kong, the Xinjiang Uyghur region, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and elsewhere in China.<\/p><p pid=\"b629.1\/6\">The Prime Minister, when asked about a boycott, recently said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b629.1\/7\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;I am instinctively, and always have been, against sporting boycotts.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-07-07\">7 July<\/phrase> 2021; Vol. 698, c. 901.]<\/p><p pid=\"b629.1\/8\">That is not the question that was asked of him or what the motion before us seeks.<\/p><p pid=\"b629.1\/9\">As we saw during the back-and-forward with the genocide amendment to the Trade Act 2021, the Government cannot be trusted to stand up for human rights when push comes to shove. The global community has failed to stand up to human rights abuses in the past that have coincided in time and location with prominent sporting events, and that mistake should not and must not be repeated. The UK Government have a moral responsibility to diplomatically boycott the games, which in many ways will be used as a propaganda tool for a regime committing genocide. It must be remembered that the CCP is a master of propaganda.<\/p><p pid=\"b629.1\/10\">It seems pretty clear, from the speeches today and various other remarks outside this Chamber, that the Government are somewhat isolated in their thinking.  That being said, we support the UK&#8217;s action to sanction Chinese Government officials for crimes committed in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. The SNP welcomed the UK Government&#8217;s decision to begin to impose Magnitsky-style sanctions, but there are few Chinese leaders involved in abuses on the current list.<\/p><p pid=\"b629.1\/11\">A report by the Foreign Affairs Committee notes that the Government&#8217;s<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b629.1\/12\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;current framework of UK policy towards China reflects an unwillingness to face this reality&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b629.1\/13\">of widespread and merciless state-sanctioned abuse. Wider trade sanctions are necessary to avoid UK corporate and consumer complicity and to hit the Chinese economy.<\/p><p pid=\"b629.1\/14\">As the US has done, the Government should ban the import of all cotton products known to be produced in whole or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China, in line with WTO rules. We also believe the ban should be extended to other industries where abuses are known to be taking place: namely in tomato, protective personal equipment and solar panel production. The Department for International Trade should publish an urgent review of the export controls that apply to Xinjiang, because currently we have no import controls whatever in place to prevent goods from Xinjiang arriving on our shelves, despite the Prime Minister&#8217;s claim to the contrary.<\/p><p pid=\"b629.1\/15\">It is sad in a debate about the winter Olympics not to be concentrating on the sport itself, the athletic endeavour and the sheer hard work that athletes have put in over the previous four years in preparation for the competition. Of course this country has not had the success in the winter version of the games that it has had in the summer games, but growing up I well remember the exploits of Rhona Martin and her team on the curling rink and their gold in Salt Lake City, of Torvill and Dean&#8212;well, their comeback, because I am too young to remember  their initial &#8220;Bolero&#8221; dance in 1984&#8212;and of Eddie the Eagle and many others.<\/p><p pid=\"b629.1\/16\">Sadly, because of the abhorrent situation in Xinjiang, alongside the Chinese Government&#8217;s gradual erosion of civil liberties in Hong Kong and what we already know about the decades-long suppression of democracy and freedom of expression in China, and the incomprehensible decision by the IOC, we are talking about something far different and far darker. When the current IOC president says that his organisation must stay out of politics&#8212;an echo of his Francoist predecessor and all those who supported apartheid South Africa&#8217;s sporting links with other countries&#8212;we can see the challenges that those who support human rights and dignity are up against.<\/p><p pid=\"b629.1\/17\">The IOC website has the temerity to claim:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b629.1\/18\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;At all times, the IOC recognises and upholds human rights, as enshrined in both the Fundamental Principles of the Olympic Charter and the IOC Code of Ethics.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b629.1\/19\">Only an institutionally arrogant organisation can make those claims and yet award next year&#8217;s games to China, but this is not just an issue for the IOC. Too many international governing bodies have been happy to turn a blind eye to repression and state-sponsored violence when choosing who to host their latest event. One only has to remember the uproar when FIFA awarded World cups to Russia and Qatar.<\/p><p pid=\"b629.1\/20\">In conclusion, I fear that we or, rather, the IOC and sport&#8217;s governing bodies are too far down the track for next year&#8217;s winter Olympics to be moved, but that should  not stop future bids for Olympics and other major sporting events from being assessed not just on their stadia capacity or segregated car lanes for VIPs, but on their human rights record and their treatment of their own citizens. History shows that the IOC has not been fussy in the past about who leads them&#8212;installing a senior member of Franco&#8217;s Falangists as their president should still be a source of shame&#8212;but it has a chance in future games to properly incorporate human rights into any assessment of candidate cities in future and to put humanity, rather than cold hard cash, at the heart of sport.<\/p>",

Friend, who understands these issues very well, and had a better scheme of his own, which would have been called EVEN&#8212;English votes for English needs&#8212;rather than EVEL. We could be having a very different debate this evening had EVEN been adopted rather than EVEL.<\/p><p pid=\"c308.6\/2\">There is of course devolution within England, but it is different. It is not to England as a country, because England makes up 85% of the total of the United Kingdom. As far as I am aware, there is no federal system in the  world where one part makes up such a great proportion. The size of England&#8212;and of course the influence that comes from that&#8212;would unbalance any settlement we tried to create.<\/p><p pid=\"c308.6\/3\">It is not just the ability of this place to legislate effectively that has been constrained. More fundamentally, the EVEL procedure has undermined the role of Parliament as the Union Parliament in which all parts of the United Kingdom are represented equally. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Pete Wishart\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11333\">The hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)<\/phrase> has made that point very eloquently, and I greatly agree with him that there should be equal representation of all Members. I have spoken elsewhere about the ways in which the UK Parliament has become a more important place in our national life following the return of powers from the European Union. Since our departure, we have once again begun legislating properly in areas touching on devolved matters, including trade, health and safety, employment laws and state aid. All of these are now powers returned to the United Kingdom, and we are able to legislate properly because all MPs are equal once again in a Parliament that considers the matters put before it from the broadest possible Union perspective.<\/p><p pid=\"c308.6\/4\">Rather than returning to an unhappy, asymmetric answer to the devolution question, the evolving operation of this Parliament has made this much less of a black and white issue than it would have felt in 2014. That is good news, because it reflects the way in which Brexit has strengthened the Union. We have now restored authority in this Parliament to address the problems of voters in every part of the United Kingdom. That is in all of our interests, because our country is much more than the sum of its parts. Just as George III gloried in the name of Britain, so do I, for our global influence together is far greater. Take, for example, our security relationships; the nuclear deterrent, based in Scotland; our shared history as brothers in arms; the economic successes that we have had; or the global reach of the empire builders. One may visit Argyle Street in Hong Kong, the Glencairn suburb of Cape Town, the Aberdare national park in Kenya, or even sunny Cardiff-by-the-Sea in California to see our past shared influence writ large across the world.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c78.0\/1\">First, I declare my interest as vice-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on Durham University.<\/p><p pid=\"c78.0\/2\">A few years ago, when I was at the Department for Education as a special adviser, I started in a roughly similar position to that of Opposition Members today. I did not think this should be a priority for Government  either, but I have changed my views on that since I became a Member of Parliament. [Interruption.] Well, we will see how <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Kevan Jones\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11003\">the right hon. Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)<\/phrase> votes tonight and whether it will be along his party lines in defiance of an overwhelming argument from the Government Benches.<\/p><p pid=\"c78.0\/3\">My right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"John Hayes\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10265\">the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Sir John Hayes)<\/phrase> made some very clear and sensible points about cancel culture, my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Fiona Bruce\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24857\">the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce)<\/phrase> did the same on freedom of religion, and my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Danny Kruger\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25913\">the Member for Devizes (Danny Kruger)<\/phrase> had some interesting suggestions on where the Government should go further. I was particularly gladdened to hear from the hon. Members for Canterbury (Rosie Duffield) and for Gower (Tonia Antoniazzi), who spoke about issues surrounding women in academia and academic freedom. The argument from the Opposition Front Bench on this hate speech has clearly been knocked down by the Government. It is a Potemkin argument. We now argue about whether the Potemkin villages ever even existed. I think we will find that the Opposition Front Benchers&#8217; arguments do not really stand scrutiny when the Bill makes further progress through this House.<\/p><p pid=\"c78.0\/4\">What has changed my view is recent meetings I have had at the University of Durham. As I said earlier, this is not a sledgehammer to crack a nut, as Opposition Members have suggested. When a leading academic in the politics department told me that he had been castigated by colleagues for teaching about John Stuart Mill&#8217;s &#8220;On Liberty&#8221;, I found that absolutely astonishing. When I had cases where 18 and 19-year-old kids in my constituency were being cancelled within their own student societies for airing their pretty moderate views, it really surprised and worried me.<\/p><p pid=\"c78.0\/5\">I gave a speech at South College, Durham a few weeks ago on this subject of freedom of speech. What has really tipped me over is the concern&#8212;the right hon. Member for North Durham and I agree on many things, but we totally disagree on this&#8212;about the influence of certain Governments and their financial power within the UK&#8217;s university education system. Let us consider the example of a university with 10,000 students, 60% of whom are from the UK and 40% of whom are from overseas. In the UK today, we will often find that half of those overseas students come from the People&#8217;s Republic of China and the amount of money they pay in tuition fees is equal to the income from the 60% from the UK. There is a real issue with freedom of speech if our universities are so dependent on those foreign sources of income, and that issue is present on our campuses today. I know that because I have spoken to students and academics who have been affected by it.<\/p><p pid=\"c78.0\/6\">The key thing is that universities just wash their faces with the cash they get from UK students; the extra cash they get from overseas students allows them to do all the extra stuff they want to do. It pays for all the fancy new buildings we will have seen going up. It pays for the extra stuff universities want to be able to do, which allows them to push themselves up international league tables. That is what is really worrying me at the moment&#8212;we have a university system that is so reliant on that cash  that it cannot pursue academic freedom itself any more, without the Government standing up to tell it that it has to.<\/p><p pid=\"c78.0\/7\">That is one of the most important points about this legislation; it is there not just to protect freedom of speech, but to promote it. This addresses a point I made when I intervened on the Opposition Front Bencher, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Kate Green\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24896\">the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston (Kate Green)<\/phrase>. People will not put themselves forward to say things about the Uyghurs, or about Hong Kong, democracy and freedom, because they are petrified of the impact it will have on their career, faculties and students. That is why this Bill is so apposite and important. We have a duty in our academic institutions in this country, which are some of the most respected in the world, not only to protect free speech, but to promote it. That element is key, because it gives academics the freedom to challenge, and sometimes they will be challenging their own academic institutions. That is at the core of everything we have to do as we look forward.<\/p>",

Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East (Stuart C. McDonald)<\/phrase> on securing it. Before I pick up on some of the points that have been raised, I send my best wishes to my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"James Brokenshire\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11640\">the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (James Brokenshire)<\/phrase>. I hope he  makes a full recovery from his condition. I also express my concern about what my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Craig Williams\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25329\">the Member for Montgomeryshire (Craig Williams)<\/phrase> told the House about the attack on his constituency office, which is not something that any of us should have to endure.<\/p><p pid=\"b1014.0\/2\">I absolutely agree that language is important in this debate, and I agree with <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Christine Jardine\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25675\">the hon. Member for Edinburgh West (Christine Jardine)<\/phrase>, who reminded us that this is about people. Some sensible questions have been posed, and I will endeavour over the next seven minutes or so to respond to as many as I can&#8212;apologies if I am unable to reference everyone&#8212;and to do so in the spirit in which they have been raised.<\/p><p pid=\"b1014.0\/3\">I agree with the point that many hon. Members, including my hon. Friends the Members for Guildford (Angela Richardson) and for St Austell and Newquay (Steve Double), made&#8212;that we welcome and cherish the contributions that our friends, neighbours, colleagues and partners from other EU countries have made to our constituencies and to the country as a whole.<\/p><p pid=\"b1014.0\/4\">I also put on the record that I could not disagree more with the point that <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Kenny MacAskill\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/14031\">the hon. Member for East Lothian (Kenny MacAskill)<\/phrase> made&#8212;that Scotland&#8217;s and England&#8217;s views on immigration are somehow divergent. I absolutely refute that. I represent a very diverse constituency, with constituents from all parts of the world. To declare an interest, my partner is a Malaysian national, so I have every good reason to cherish immigrants to this country and the contribution that they make. I will not have this painting of Britain outside the EU as some insular place, hostile to immigration. I reference our bold and generous offer to British nationals in Hong Kong as evidence of our approach.<\/p><p pid=\"b1014.0\/5\">Contrary to what <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Claire Hanna\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25447\">the hon. Member for Belfast South (Claire Hanna)<\/phrase> said&#8212;I hope I picked her up correctly&#8212;I want to emphasise that Home Office caseworkers&#8217; priority is to look for reasons to grant status, not to find reasons not to, and refusals are a last resort. Where someone has not provided the necessary evidence, Home Office caseworkers will contact them to help them to provide the evidence required, and will exercise discretion in their favour, where appropriate, to minimise administrative burdens.<\/p><p pid=\"b1014.0\/6\">I assure the House that all options will be exhausted before refusing someone&#8217;s application. Those who have been refused but are now able to provide evidence to confirm their eligibility can simply apply to the scheme again, free of charge, and there is a range of support available online, and by email and telephone, for those who have questions or need help in applying. At this point, I wish to acknowledge the hard work that civil servants and employers have done to help applicants gain their status&#8212;a point powerfully made by my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Virginia Crosbie\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25843\">the Member for Ynys M&#244;n (Virginia Crosbie)<\/phrase>&#8212;and I thank them for that. It is also important to reinforce the message, which several Members raised during the debate, that those who applied before the deadline but have not yet had their response have their rights enshrined in law until the decision is made. We need to send that important message out from the House tonight.<\/p><p pid=\"b1014.0\/7\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Ian Murray\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24872\">The hon. Member for Edinburgh South (Ian Murray)<\/phrase> raised an important point about the support available to vulnerable and hard-to-reach groups, including adults and children in care settings. The Home Office has awarded &#163;21.5 million to 72 organisations across the  UK to provide face-to-face appointments and support online, over the telephone or by email to help vulnerable people apply. That work continues to be funded, and we are continuing to reach out to those vulnerable groups to make sure we capture everyone we can. Further assistance is available from the Home Office&#8217;s settlement resolution centre, which is open seven days a week for telephone and email inquiries.<\/p><p pid=\"b1014.0\/8\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Anne McLaughlin\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/14146\">The hon. Member for Glasgow North East (Anne McLaughlin)<\/phrase>, in replying to the debate, asked a perfectly fair question about other examples of what might be deemed a &#8220;reasonable ground&#8221; for a late application. I am happy to tell her that the Home Office has published a non-exhaustive list of 17 pages on its website, giving those reasons, with one being where someone is a victim of modern slavery or is in abusive relationship. If she needs more information on that, I am sure my colleagues in the Home Office would be happy to supply that to her.<\/p><p pid=\"b1014.0\/9\">A number of hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East, who moved the motion, and the hon. Members for North East Fife (Wendy Chamberlain) and for East Renfrewshire (Kirsten Oswald), raised the need for EU citizens to apply for status in the first instance. The Government&#8217;s view is that the constitution of the system, in the form of the settlement scheme, is the best way to deliver our commitment to European economic areas citizens who have made the UK their home&#8212;in fact, it is the best way to prevent another Windrush-type situation from happening. It provides citizens and their family members with clarity about what they need to apply for and by when, and about the secure evidence of their status that they need. It is also ensures that service providers such as employers and landlords have a way of confirming who has what status. On the other hand, a declaratory system could lead to a situation such as Windrush where EU nationals do not have sufficient evidence to prove their status and entitlements in the UK.<\/p>",

We, in the SDLP, are proudly committed to vibrancy, diversity, inclusion and pluralism in our education system and in our society. Given that integrated education has existed in the North for more than 30 years, it is surprising that fewer than one in 10 of our young people is educated in an integrated setting. The motivation behind bringing the Bill to the Assembly and the Executive is, therefore, understandable: it seeks to enhance and strengthen our integrated education sector.<\/p><p>All too often in this place, we focus on traditional community fault lines and on what divides us. The simple fact is that our young people are light years ahead of us when it comes to breaking down the barriers of the past and facilitating a truly shared society. The current state of play in our education system does not reflect the progressive and outward-looking world view of our young people. Continuing to segregate our children and our communities, particularly on the basis of religious background, serves only to perpetuate the divisions of the past and impede the progress that our society so desperately needs.<\/p><p>In contemplating the potential associated with the Bill, I pondered the possibilities that could flow from a more integrated education system. How cathartic and inspiring it would be to see the captain of a Royal School Armagh team hoist the MacRory cup, or a team from Abbey Grammar School in Newry mount a bid for the Schools' Cup. Our society has evolved enormously in recent years; it is time that our education system reflected that.<\/p><p>It would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to the incredible work being done by schools in my constituency. Newry and Armagh boasts some of the highest-ranked secondary education institutions in the North, where diversity and sporting programmes have offered opportunities for engagement among young people from divergent backgrounds. In addition to that, the four grammar schools in Newry all have a disproportionately high number of students in receipt of free school meals, which speaks to the socio-economic diversity in the student bodies of those schools. On that basis, I suggest that many lessons can be learned from the schools in my constituency in the context of academic excellence, community inclusion and diversity in socio-economic backgrounds.<\/p><p>We cannot and should not pursue a steamroller approach to this issue. We need to engage with relevant stakeholders strategically and with a listening ear. With that in mind, as the Bill progresses through Committee Stage, I will advocate for robust engagement with relevant stakeholders at all levels in the sector as well as for an approach that pursues a strategy of levelling up and one that seeks to emulate the successes of high-performing schools.<\/p><p>There are aspects of the Bill that need to be clarified. Many of those have already been mentioned, and I will not go through them all individually again. However, while there are mentions of monitoring targets and benchmarks throughout the Bill, one of my overarching questions is: how do we measure success? How do we measure success for the education of our young people?<\/p><p>As I said at the outset, my party and I are energetically committed to a fully inclusive education system that reflects our broader society, and, therefore, I will support the Bill in principle. As I said, there are issues that need to be worked out, and, for my part, I will fight to ensure that the good work of the schools across my constituency and beyond is held up as examples of best practice. To that end, I echo what my party colleague Daniel McCrossan said. I do not believe that abandoning our faith-based schools or our Irish-medium sector serves any of our young people. My experience of St Malachy's in Camlough and the Abbey in Newry &#8212; faith-based schools &#8212; is that they provided me with early exposure to young people from other backgrounds. I can fondly recall in the Abbey a collaborative project with Newry High School at Newry hockey pitch, where we played a cross-community sports match. In the first half, we played a game of hockey, and, in the second half, we played a game of Gaelic football. I was useless at the hockey, but I was quite good at the Gaelic football. I can never forget the joy that that brought to all of us involved &#8212; coaches, teachers and the pupils who participated. It was a really joyous occasion, and it was my first experience of interacting with a number of children from a different faith and background. As I said, wow, did we enjoy it. I have to thank Mr Aidan O'Rourke &#8212; \"Rookie\" &#8212; for giving us that experience.<\/p><p>I appreciate, however, that this early years grounding and exposure is not a common experience across the board. Recently, a former teammate of mine spoke about his experience of schooling. He shared the fact that he had not met a Protestant until the final years of his secondary education, when he started attending school in Armagh city. To my mind, that reaffirms the need to take a strategic and tailored approach, recognising that there are very valuable lessons to be learned from the many schools across the North that have been quietly and conscientiously doing the heavy lifting on inclusive education for many years.<\/p><p>Back to my own school. I sat beside Lawrence Wong from Malaysia, and Davy Lo from Hong Kong was in my class. Our school, ahead of its time, was integrating education in the best way that it could. We had a Protestant teacher and we had Protestants in the school, so there was integration in the Abbey in Newry. We need to see more of it.<\/p><p>There is a lot worth protecting and emulating in schools now. The Bill is a start. Forgive me for mixing my metaphors: it gets a shovel onto our very important issue, but we will need to drill down into the nuts and bolts. There are a lot of nuts and bolts that need to be drilled down into. Creating the framework for an integrated education system is a task that belongs to us all, and I look forward to working with colleagues from all parties to further scrutinise the Bill as it passes through Committee Stage. We must get this right.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b329.1\/1\">It is always a pleasure to take an intervention from my hon. Friend. He made two points. First, where should the cuts go? I say that the very first place cuts should be made is to foreign aid and the last place they should be made is anywhere that affects the people of Rother Valley and the people of all our seats. So, in the first place, it is correct that that is where the cuts should go.<\/p><p pid=\"b329.1\/2\">On my hon. Friend&#8217;s point about the Commonwealth, I completely agree. It is right that we are giving aid, and we should direct more of that in a better way to deepen our ties with the Commonwealth. For me, this debate should not just be about 0.5%, 0.7% or perhaps 0.3%; it should be more about where that percentage is actually going. I argue that it should go towards our friends in countries with which we have deep historical links&#8212;to the Commonwealth; to those who have stood by us in good times and bad through hundreds of years, rather than to a political union that was brought about post the second world war in Europe.<\/p><p pid=\"b329.1\/3\">It is clear to me that the best use of Foreign Office expenditure is investment in the Commonwealth rather than aid spending in countries outside the Commonwealth. This will allow Britain to maintain its place in the world, grow its footprint in the economies of the future and turbocharge global Britain post Brexit. Even more importantly, in the context of aid, our engagement with the Commonwealth can make the greatest difference to the most people in developing nations. Let me be clear about aid: by engaging with the Commonwealth we can help more people and more of the poorest people. That is very important.<\/p><p pid=\"b329.1\/4\">The Commonwealth citizens with whom we have so much in common need our support, and we must now prioritise them. Our neglect of the Commonwealth&#8212;and we have neglected the Commonwealth&#8212;has unfortunately seen us abdicate responsibility for encouraging good  governance and high standards in much of the world. If we reconnect now, it will allow us to speak up for the persecuted anglophone community in what was formerly the Southern Cameroons; to assist in the fight against Islamic extremists in east and west Africa; and to provide comprehensive support to the millions of British nationals in Hong Kong. Such issues must be front and centre as we pivot back towards the Commonwealth.<\/p><p pid=\"b329.1\/5\">As I draw my remarks to a close, I emphasise that a cut in the aid budget does not mean a smaller, less influential Britain; it is simply fiscal common sense, allowing us to reduce our borrowing while protecting our constituents from the impact of the cuts. We are still left with a huge Foreign Office and aid budget, which should be redirected to fully embrace the Commonwealth of nations. If we do that, we can spread the benefits of global Britain from Barbados to Botswana, from India to Fiji and from Kenya to Malaysia. That will be a better world for us all.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a744.0\/1\">My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who contributed to this rich debate for their contributions, for the warm welcome they offered the Bill, and for the way in which, in very different ways, they highlighted the importance of the issues which the Bill seeks to address.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/2\">Today&#8217;s debate has been wide-ranging. We have debated the principles and the practice of the Bill and we have touched on a number of issues that are beyond its scope. I shall start my closing remarks by focusing on those matters that speak directly to the Bill, as well as those that are closely adjacent to it,  such as diversification, before moving on, if, as I hope, time permits, to other matters raised in the debate. Some of the issues raised sit beyond my department&#8217;s remit, but I will do my best to respond to them and will write to all noble Lords on any matters that time does not permit me to address today. I stress that I and my officials are very open to continuing these discussions in more detail ahead of Committee.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/3\">As my right honourable friend the Secretary of State said at Second Reading in the other place, the Bill raises the security bar across the board and protects us against a whole range of threats. Although there may be disagreement on some points in the Bill, I welcome the fact that it clearly has strong support in this House and, as we saw, the other place. We are all committed to putting the UK&#8217;s national security interests first.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/4\">Before I go into the detail of the Bill, the noble Baroness, Lady Merron, rightly asked how it fits with wider regulation of critical national infrastructure. This is indeed one of a number of measures that the Government are taking to protect the security and integrity of that infrastructure. So, while this Bill focuses on telecoms security, there is already a range of regulations governing the security of other critical sectors, each tailored to different risks. The Bill will complement those pre-existing regulations by ensuring the security and resilience of the public telecoms networks on which our critical sectors rely.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/5\">The recently enacted National Security and Investment Act, to which the noble Baroness referred, empowers the Government to scrutinise, impose conditions on or, as a last resort, block foreign investment wherever there is an unacceptable risk to Britain&#8217;s national security. Rather than addressing investment, the Bill would enable the Government to protect our networks from risks posed by vendors who supply, provide or make available goods, services or facilities to public telecommunications providers. Once it is passed, the Bill will work alongside the National Security and Investment Act to protect our networks from threats, both now and in the future. My noble friend Lord Young of Cookham also asked how different government departments were co-ordinating their policy responses in this area. I will take up his kind invitation to write to him, and will of course copy other noble Lords into my response.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/6\">A number of your Lordships, including the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, my noble friends Lord Vaizey and Lady Stroud, the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Merron, all asked how we were managing the risk posed by Huawei in the interim, ahead of the Bill becoming law. The Government have always considered Huawei to pose a relatively high risk to the UK&#8217;s telecom networks compared with other vendors. There has been a risk mitigation strategy in place since Huawei first began to supply equipment to the UK&#8217;s public telecoms providers.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/7\">The Government have announced extensive advice to manage the security risk posed by Huawei, based on the analysis of our world-leading experts at the National Cyber Security Centre. The Secretary of State has announced advice that providers should remove all Huawei equipment from 5G networks by the end of 2027 and, in order to clearly set out the  pathway to zero, he also announced advice that providers should stop procuring new 5G equipment from Huawei after <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-12-31\">31 December<\/phrase> 2020 and stop installing Huawei equipment in 5G networks after September 2021. Together, all this advice will protect our networks from the risks posed by Huawei. Once passed, and subject to the relevant consultation requirements, the Bill will enable the Government to give legal effect to all this advice.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/8\">My noble friend Lady Stroud asked about other high-risk vendors. The Bill responds to the threats and risks that we outlined in the telecoms supply chain review. It gives us the ability to manage any high-risk vendor, both now and in future. We have named Huawei and ZTE as high-risk vendors, but we will continue to keep the presence of high-risk vendors under review.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/9\">A number of your Lordships, including the noble Baroness, Lady Merron, my noble friends Lord Vaizey and Lord Young of Cookham, and the noble Lord, Lord Fox, talked about the role, resources and capacity of Ofcom. We are confident that Ofcom will have the capability and resources to undertake its expanded role, although we recognise the competitive market for recruitment in this area. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the Bill places a new, general duty on Ofcom to ensure that providers comply with their new security duties. We are working closely with Ofcom to ensure that it has the required resources to meet its new responsibilities, and we will keep that under review.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/10\">I shall now cover the issues relating to scrutiny in the Bill. The first of these relates to the Secretary of State&#8217;s ability to issue designation notices and designated vendor directions. This issue was discussed at length in the other place throughout the passage of the Bill, and more recently was referred to by the Constitution Committee, and I will address the remarks of both that committee and the Intelligence and Security Committee.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/11\">The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, raised the recommendation from the Constitution Committee to increase oversight of the Bill&#8217;s powers by making them fall within the remit of the Investigatory Powers Commissioner. I can reassure noble Lords that the Secretary of State will use the power to issue designation notices and designated vendor directions only when it is necessary to do so in the interests of national security and where the requirements to be imposed are proportionate. The Bill already contains effective mechanisms for oversight of the Secretary of State&#8217;s use of the powers to give a designated vendor direction or designation notice.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/12\">The Bill requires the Secretary of State to lay copies of designation notices and designated vendor directions before Parliament. This will provide Parliament with the opportunity to scrutinise the use of these powers. On very rare occasions, the Secretary of State may choose not to lay a designation notice or direction before Parliament, because to do so would be contrary to the interests of national security. Where this is the case, the DCMS Select Committee will be able to view such directions and notices.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/13\">The Investigatory Powers Commissioner has responsibility for reviewing the use by public authorities, such as intelligence agencies, police and local authorities, of the powers in the Investigatory Powers Act. However,  the Investigatory Powers Act regime is not directly comparable with the new powers and framework set out by the Bill. Oversight of the Investigatory Powers Act regime by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner is considered appropriate because of the potential intrusion into the private lives of individuals as a result of the use of covert powers. The national security powers in this Bill are very different from those in the Investigatory Powers Act: they are focused on protecting public telecoms networks and services from the threats posed by high-risk vendors.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/14\">The noble Lord, Lord West, the noble Baronesses, Lady Merron and Lady Northover, the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, and others raised the issue of scrutiny by the Intelligence and Security Committee. I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord West, and all other members of the Intelligence and Security Committee for the important work they do. We recognise the importance of effective scrutiny of the use of the Bill&#8217;s powers, and I am happy to correct the impression that the noble Lord, Lord West, suggested&#8212;that the Government want to avoid scrutiny in the Bill. That is why, as I said, the Bill requires the Secretary of State to lay copies of designation notices and designated vendor directions before Parliament, unless doing so would be contrary to the interests of national security. I referred to circumstances where this might be possible in my remarks on the advice of the Constitution Committee.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/15\">As noble Lords are aware, the activities of DCMS are not within the remit of the Intelligence and Security Committee. That committee&#8217;s remit extends to the intelligence agencies and other government activities related to intelligence or security matters, as set out in its memorandum of understanding. But the advice of the intelligence agencies will not be the only factor that the Secretary of State will take into account when deciding what is proportionate to include in a designated vendor direction. As well as the advice of the National Cyber Security Centre, the Secretary of State will consider, among others, the economic impact, cost to industry and impact on connectivity of the requirements in any designated vendor direction.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/16\">The ISC does not have a remit to consider non-security issues, such as the economic and connectivity implications of the requirements in designated vendor directions, but the DCMS Select Committee can consider those wider impacts. That is why, despite my noble friend Lord Balfe&#8217;s caution in this regard, we believe the DCMS Select Committee is the correct and appropriate body to see copies of designation notices and designated vendor directions that are not laid before Parliament.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/17\">My noble friend Lord Young of Cookham asked whether a designation notice or designated vendor direction is justiciable. Designated vendor directions and designation notices are subject to ordinary judicial review principles. However, the Secretary of State will issue designation notices and designated vendor directions only where they are necessary in the interests of national security and where the requirements in the direction are proportionate. As I mentioned, there are exceptions, which we expect to be rare, where it could be harmful to national security to lay a direction before Parliament, for example where doing so would expose particular security vulnerabilities.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/18\">The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, asked about the delegated powers in the Bill and the recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, as did my noble friend Lord Young of Cookham. The committee has made one recommendation relating to the power to issue codes of practice about security measures. I am sure that the House will appreciate that we need some time to consider the recommendation. We will respond once we have done that.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/19\">A number of noble Lords, including the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, the noble Lord, Lord Fox, and my noble friends Lady Morgan and Lord Vaizey, raised issues about the Government&#8217;s work on diversification. Although this is not a matter that the Bill speaks to directly, as your Lordships pointed out, I am delighted to address it. The Government recognise the importance of a diverse supply chain for creating a resilient national telecoms network, which is why we published the 5G diversification strategy alongside this Bill. That takes forward the Government&#8217;s commitment in the telecoms supply chain review to respond to the lack of diversity in the supply chain. We are leading the way in solving this through our ambitious diversification strategy.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/20\">The diversification task force, led by my noble friend Lord Livingston of Parkhead, has now concluded its initial work. Its findings and recommendations were published on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-04-20\">20 April<\/phrase>. As my noble friend Lord Young pointed out, they raise the opportunity for our businesses in this area to win new markets through the creation of shared standards. The Government will respond to the task force&#8217;s findings and set out our next steps in this ambitious programme this summer. My noble friend Lord Holmes asked for an update on our UK telecoms lab. We will be able to say more on that later this year, but we plan to respond to all of the priorities raised in the very helpful report from the diversification task force.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/21\">The noble Lord, Lord Fox, asked for a definition of &#8220;incumbent suppliers&#8221;. The diversification strategy defines them as those present in the network that are not high-risk vendors, which therefore would include non-UK businesses such as Nokia and Ericsson.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/22\">The noble Baroness, Lady Northover, and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, asked about our engagement with business. We continue to engage regularly and closely with public telecom providers, including the largest companies, such as BT, and the trade bodies representing small businesses. Their feedback has been invaluable in our policy development. We will consult with them further on the draft code of practice after Royal Assent to ensure that all those affected can make their voices heard.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/23\">The noble Lord, Lord Maxton, asked about our international engagement. We have engaged with partner countries throughout the drafting of this Bill and will continue to do so once it has passed. As he rightly pointed out, our networks face similar challenges to those of networks in other countries. It therefore makes absolute sense to find international solutions to them.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/24\">The noble Lord, Lord Vaux of Harrowden, obviously has a similar social life to mine. I definitely get more fraudulent calls than I do any other type of communication. As I wrote to him, this Bill is not intended to address the extremely important issues  that he raised. The Government are exploring a range of different measures aimed at tackling criminal abuse of the telecommunications network, including fraud. This work is led by the Home Office. I am happy to meet with him to discuss it further if that is helpful or co-ordinates him being in touch with the right colleagues at the Home Office.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/25\">Turning to the issues of human rights, the noble Lord, Lord Alton, asked about the compliance of the ministerial statement on the face of the Bill with the Human Rights Act. As printed, I made a statement under Section 19 of that Act that:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a744.0\/26\">&#8220;In my view the provisions of the Telecommunications (Security) Bill are compatible with the Convention rights&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/27\">as defined by Section 1 of the Act. I stand by my statement. I do not think there are any provisions in this Bill that are incompatible with the convention rights. The statement is about the content of the Bill. The noble Lord has implied that actions of another country might bring the Bill&#8217;s compatibility into question, but I think that is a misunderstanding of the purpose of the statement.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/28\">Many of your Lordships rightly raised issues of human rights in China, including the noble Baronesses, Lady Northover and Lady Merron, the noble Lord, Lord Fox, and my noble friends Lady Stroud and Lord Balfe. I start by paying tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for his ongoing commitment to standing up for human rights around the world, including in Xinjiang. The Government stand in complete solidarity with him and the eight others who were sanctioned by China. This House has debated these issues at length and rightly so, as they are important. The Government share the noble Lord&#8217;s serious concern about the human rights situation in Xinjiang. Indeed, he recently secured a Question for Short Debate on this topic, to which my noble friend the Minister of State for South Asia and the Commonwealth responded.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/29\">It is because this issue is so important that we have, as a Government, taken a wide range of actions this year and I cannot accept his suggestion of complacency on the part of the Government. The UK Government have led international efforts to hold China to account for its human rights violations in Xinjiang. We led the first two statements on Xinjiang at the UN and have utilised our diplomatic network to raise the issue up the international agenda. Most recently, on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-06-22\">22 June<\/phrase>, the UK joined 43 other countries at the UN Human Rights Council to condemn China&#8217;s human rights violations in Xinjiang and Tibet, as well as the deterioration of fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Bennett, and others. On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-06-13\">13 June<\/phrase>, the G7 leaders&#8217; communiqu&#233; called on China to<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a744.0\/30\">&#8220;respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially in relation to Xinjiang&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/31\">Noble Lords will be aware that in January the Foreign Secretary announced a package of measures to help ensure UK businesses and the public sector are not complicit in human rights violations or abuses in Xinjiang. Those measures include robust and detailed new guidance to businesses, a review of export controls as they apply to China, a commitment to introduce financial penalties under the Modern Slavery Act and increasing support for UK government bodies to exclude suppliers complicit in violations.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/32\">I know the noble Lord is particularly interested in hearing more about the review of export controls. He will be aware that export controls are already applied to a range of goods which may be used for internal repression or to breach human rights, as set out in the Export Control Act 2002 and accompanying secondary legislation. The review announced by the Foreign Secretary in January will ensure that we have captured the full range of goods as applicable to the current situation in Xinjiang and will determine which additional specific products will in future be subject to export controls. The Government will report back to Parliament on the outcome of the review in due course.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/33\">I also note the Private Member&#8217;s Bill introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, regarding the duty on businesses to produce modern slavery statements. The Government have already committed to strengthening Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and I know that the noble Lord engages regularly with the Home Office on this matter. I can reassure all your Lordships that tackling modern slavery continues to be a priority for this Government. This is why the Government announced a review of our modern slavery strategy earlier this year.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/34\">A new strategy will cover our cross-government response, including how business and government can effect change through their supply chains. In September 2020, the Government committed to take forward an ambitious package of measures to strengthen the Act. As I have mentioned, this was followed in January 2021 by a commitment to introduce financial penalties for organisations that fail to meet their statutory obligations to publish modern slavery statements under the Act. Legislation to take these reforms forward will be introduced when parliamentary time allows.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/35\">The amendment tabled and adopted during the passage of the Trade Act further highlights that the Government take these issues seriously. The amendment ensures that a debate and vote in Parliament can happen in response to credible reports, expressed by a responsible Committee, about genocide in a country with which we are proposing a new free trade agreement. I can now confirm that the Foreign Affairs Select Committee in the other place has agreed to be charged with this role, subject to agreement by the House. Discussions are still ongoing in the other place and will begin in this House when there is a willing Committee.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/36\">This Bill, however, is focused on the security of the UK public telecoms network and services. It is not the right legislative vehicle to address concerns about human rights and modern slavery. Clause 16 makes it clear that designation notices can be issued to vendors only where the Secretary of State considers that it is necessary to do so in the interests of national security. The Government consider that the Secretary of State should be required to assess national security as strictly about the security of our nations.<\/p><p pid=\"a744.0\/37\">I apologise to noble Lords: I know that I have overrun but it was a rich debate. I hope noble Lords will accept that it was worth addressing some of the important points raised. I look forward very much to working with your Lordships across the House to pass this important legislation. As I have said, the Bill will create one of the toughest regimes for telecoms security in the world. It will enable us to protect our critical  national infrastructure and shield our networks for years to come. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup, gave the Government a helpful and powerful challenge: to be forward-looking as we think through this legislation; to recognise the need for a balance between cost, resilience and risk; and to adopt an approach that combines agility and adaptability. Again, I invite noble Lords who wish to talk about any particular issues related to the Bill to contact me or my officials, and I look forward to debating this further in Committee.<\/p><p class=\"italic\" pid=\"a744.0\/38\">Bill read a second time and committed to a Grand Committee.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a283.1\/1\">The hon. Lady makes the clear point that tourist attractions in central London, whether in her constituency or in mine, are suffering due to the lack of international visitors.<\/p><p pid=\"a283.1\/2\">Theatres in particular have a significant multiplier effect for the local economy. It is estimated that people who buy theatre tickets will spend up to five or six times more in the local economy, whether in restaurants, hotels or wherever. To remedy the situation, we should urgently address several areas in our recovery from covid-19, which will no doubt have a significant impact on the central London ecosystem.<\/p><p pid=\"a283.1\/3\">First, and in light of recent decisions, I ask the Government to give due consideration to a Government-backed insurance scheme to help event organisers plan for the risk of covid-19-related cancellations. Indeed, UK Theatre&#8217;s May 2021 survey of members&#8217; planned economic activity up until June next year on productions, both planned and currently running, was 67% of 2019 levels. Of that, 66% was planned for stage 4, which has now been delayed. Without a Government insurance package, theatres expect that proportion to fall to around 35% to 50%, which will be a devastating hit to both the sector and those who rely on its influence to draw in consumers.<\/p><p pid=\"a283.1\/4\">Secondly, UK Music noted that extending the 5% VAT freeze on cultural tickets until the end of the financial year 2021-22 would go a long way to incentivise activity in the capital and support investment. Indeed, by keeping VAT low the Government will be allowing more money to be invested into venues, recapitalising and paying off pandemic debt&#8212;we know how much pandemic debt many of these companies have.<\/p><p pid=\"a283.1\/5\">On another note, I am glad that the Government&#8217;s tourist recovery plan, launched this month, acknowledges that London is the gateway for international tourism and, as such, is an integral part of the wider UK  levelling-up agenda. Support and investment for central London must reflect that and help mitigate its reliance on high-volume footfall from tourists and workers. In central London, international visitors account for 50% of all spending, even though they make up only 25% of visitors. With the international travel market not likely to start growing again until early next year&#8212;possibly into spring next year&#8212;shops will open with the return of all the costs that entails, such as business rates, rents and employee costs, but they will not yet have the major customer footfall spending money in their premises. That will put new pressure on businesses that have already exhausted their reserves.<\/p><p pid=\"a283.1\/6\">How can we mitigate that? It could be as simple as allowing Sunday trading hours to be extended from 6 pm to 8 pm in the international centres of the west end and Knightsbridge in order to accommodate new patterns of opening hours. I raise this now because, prior to the pandemic, few theatre productions ran a Sunday matinee, for example. Now, however, theatres are increasingly looking at scheduling Sunday matinees and it is likely that Sundays could become as busy as Saturdays, and with that comes increased need for the consumer.<\/p><p pid=\"a283.1\/7\">With most other global international centres&#8212;New York, Dubai, Tokyo, Beijing, Hong Kong and even Edinburgh&#8212;having no restrictions, we are at a competitive disadvantage in London. Allowing longer Sunday trading in an international centre would have a localised impact of up to &#163;290 million net in additional sales, and 2,000 full-time jobs. That is not to be sniffed at. The support measures would cost the Government nothing but could mean the world to businesses in London.<\/p><p pid=\"a283.1\/8\">I also urge the Government to work with businesses to seek new ideas and encourage more visitors, especially high-spending ones, to our areas. Most experts estimate that international tourism will not return to 2019 levels until 2023 at the earliest. The Government should do all they can to accelerate tourists&#8217; safe return, with plans to promote London globally as a place to visit and do business.<\/p><p pid=\"a283.1\/9\">On a similar note, how office workers react post pandemic will be important for business recovery in the capital. The Government need to do all in their power to stimulate a safe return to the office. Right now, only about 10% of office workers have returned to full-time work in central London, which is woeful. Business representatives from across my constituency, and from multiple sectors, all concur that they do not expect to see any big return until at least September&#8212;that is three months from now, and costs will be increasing from next week.<\/p><p pid=\"a283.1\/10\">What I find most concerning about this situation is that the shortfall in workers returning to the office is due to a distinct lack of confidence in public transport and changing work practices. As we emerge from the pandemic, the Government must help by encouraging the return to work and encouraging confidence in the safe use of public transport. It is imperative for Government Ministers to encourage civil servants in their Departments to lead the charge and to come back to their desks. I appreciate that we will not see the same volume of office workers over the summer and into the autumn, but even seeing a return of working on a flexible basis&#8212;say, two or three days or week while we recover in the short term&#8212;would have a huge impact on the economy of  central London. For that reason, I welcome this week&#8217;s announcement by the Government of the new flexible season tickets. Within London, we need a robust transport system that commuters are confident to use again, with the Mayor working constructively with the Government to ensure that is the case.<\/p><p pid=\"a283.1\/11\">I will leave it there for now, because I am confident that London will recover from the covid-19 pandemic, as it has recovered from previous shocks, be they plagues, fires or world wars. I want to see London getting some recognition from central Government for the key role that it plays in supporting the UK&#8217;s economy, and we need that recognition to be married to a clear vision for business recovery in central London.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"d712.4\/1\">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. Indeed, he is right, and I will comment later on ways in which we can use our new freedoms to improve the output of the financial services sector.<\/p><p pid=\"d712.4\/2\">Some say that we should not speak too much about financial services, lest it upset certain people in the country or is alienating in some way. I suppose that is a hangover from the financial crisis, but I completely reject that view. We are at a new moment now. We have a fantastic financial services industry; it is world leading, and we need to be proud of it. Indeed, in the face of the unprecedented economic uncertainty created by the pandemic, our financial services industry stood up to the challenge. The financial system remained resilient and responded to customers&#8217; needs, demonstrating the central role that it plays in facilitating and protecting our economy.<\/p><p pid=\"d712.4\/3\">When corporates were strapped for cash, there was no liquidity failure in the banking system. Instead, bank lending surged. Working in partnership with the Government, the Treasury and the Bank of England, the sector was able to provide a comprehensive package of support, which included facilitating over &#163;75 billion in emergency finance to 1.6 million businesses. I am pleased to announce to the House that more than &#163;100 million of that support went to my constituency of Hitchin and Harpenden to support more than 2,400 fantastic local businesses through covid and the lockdown. That was on top of an array of forbearance measures for personal customers, including 2.75 million mortgage payment deferrals, 1.8 million credit card and loan payment holidays, and 27 million interest-free overdrafts to customers. In short, our financial system did its job. When there was a crisis, it provided a safety net for the constituents and businesses of Members on both sides of the House.<\/p><p pid=\"d712.4\/4\">However, now we need to look forward and build back better from coronavirus. Our financial services industry is at a crossroads. Brexit and the return of rule-making powers to the UK for the first time in decades has created a unique chance, as <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jim Shannon\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/13864\">the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)<\/phrase> remarked, to refit our financial services sector in a way that is better suited to our domestic needs and even more internationally competitive. Parliament, Government, regulators and the industry now have the opportunity to ask fresh questions about what the future of financial services in the UK should look like and how we should fine-tune the rules that govern the sector to provide the right conditions for it to thrive.<\/p><p pid=\"d712.4\/5\">At the same time, the UK faces huge international competition. Across the Atlantic, New York is cementing itself as a leading international financial centre. In Asia, financial hubs are catching up with us fast, whether it be Hong Kong, Singapore or other cities. The ambitions of our European friends and neighbours to create onshore financial centres within the European Union bloc at the expense of London&#8212;let us not kid ourselves about that&#8212;is becoming increasingly apparent. If we are to continue to reap the benefits from this world-leading sector based here in the UK, it is crucial that we get our regulatory changes right in the next period, ensuring that the UK remains an attractive location for both domestic and international firms in the years to come.<\/p><p pid=\"d712.4\/6\">Let me now turn to the steps on how we can achieve this. I am glad to say that the Government are wasting no time in realising their ambition to strengthen the UK&#8217;s position as a global financial hub. The Prime Minister met financial services leaders on this precise issue only a few weeks ago. Central to the Government&#8217;s ambition is the landmark Financial Services Act 2021, on which I spoke in this House and served in the Committee, as the Minister will remember. I once again commend him and his team for their hard work in achieving this vital piece of legislation, which already puts down much of the groundwork on which we can build. Alongside that, I commend the findings from the Government-commissioned reviews from Lord Hill and Ron Kalifa on, respectively, listings and FinTech. I appreciate the work the Government are doing to implement their recommendations without hesitation. I have been checking on this. When one engages with what the  Government are actually doing, it is clear that they are more than exceeding expectations in really looking at these reviews to see what can be done as quickly as possible.<\/p><p pid=\"d712.4\/7\">In the longer term, the Treasury is undertaking a wide-ranging review of the future regulatory framework for financial services. It is important to be clear that this is not&#8212;I repeat, not&#8212;a regulatory race to the bottom, as many would suggest. The Chancellor rightly stated, when setting out his vision for the sector in this House, that the UK will maintain the highest, most effective global standards as we look to shape the future of the industry. Indeed, there is no future of the industry with poor-quality, bargain-basement regulation; the future of the industry is high-quality, high global standards. However, we should take the opportunity to fine-tune this regulation, where it benefits the UK, to make it simpler and more responsive to the industry. The future framework should also be more proportionate, particularly to mid-tier providers&#8212;I have them in my own constituency in certain areas&#8212;that are currently saddled with disproportionate regulatory costs compared with many larger financial institutions that have armies of lawyers and accountants and various other people to help to deal with that regulation. Frankly, Brexit makes sense if we can take the opportunities available to us to do things better and more flexibly in areas where we have a real advantage. Financial services is one of the key areas in which we can do this.<\/p><p pid=\"d712.4\/8\">As our powers are returned from the European Union, we must strengthen the political accountability to which regulators will be subject given their enhanced responsibilities. We have given them enormous power to make rules that have a huge impact on the livelihoods of literally millions of people. That power needs to be properly scrutinised and checked by Parliament and indeed this House. However, this House is not currently best equipped to carry out this role in terms of our structures. Scrutiny of the sector currently lies with the Treasury Committee, but its remit is incredibly broad in dealing with everything that the Treasury deals with. Therefore, having sustained and detailed oversight of technical regulations and aspects of financial services is going to be difficult. I encourage the Minister to consider the conclusions of the recent report by the all-party parliamentary group on financial markets and services. Ah, there it is&#8212;he has it in his hand; he has read it, which is good. It calls for a new specialist Joint Committee of both Houses to be established with a specific remit for overseeing not the Treasury, which already has the Treasury Committee, but our regulators and the financial services sector in particular. That would ensure that Parliament could take a central role in helping guide and scrutinise regulators while balancing the needs of the sector with the wider public policy aims that we all know.<\/p><p pid=\"d712.4\/9\">Looking abroad, we need to promote international trade in financial services. As we review our framework, we need to understand that the Government&#8217;s work on trade agreements is vital but, frankly, whether it be within this House, outside this House or in the press or the media, too rarely do people think of trade as including services. I urge the Government to ensure that we apply the same level of focus in our trade agreements on services as we do on any goods. The Government must prioritise financial services in their trade deals and  their emerging trade agenda more broadly and be explicit about their key importance to our country. In economic terms, the opportunities for financial services with our international trade are huge.<\/p><p pid=\"d712.4\/10\">Promoting international trade is also about ensuring that we attract the best international talent to the UK. The new global talent visa and the new Office for Talent will be very important steps in helping achieve that ambition. I commend the Government on bringing them into force. It is also worth saying that, on the international agenda, our emerging partnership with Switzerland is very promising. I ask the Minister for his reflections on how that partnership could help really strengthen our financial services sector and, indeed, our industry.<\/p><p pid=\"d712.4\/11\">One key area in which the UK risks falling behind its international competition is getting the right levels of taxation for the banking sector. At present, the UK&#8217;s banking industry is burdened with a number of sector-specific taxes such as the bank levy and irrevocable VAT that are not dependent on profits and represent a fixed cost to firms each year. Indeed, almost half of total tax receipts are made up of such sector-specific payments, taking the UK&#8217;s taxation rate for banks well above financial centres such as New York and Frankfurt. I therefore agree with the Government&#8217;s view that the planned increase in the main corporation tax rate to 25% would make the UK&#8217;s bank taxation system uncompetitive. To help address that, I support the Chancellor in his Budget announcement of a review to the bank surcharge, which is an additional 8% charge that banks pay on their profits that dates from the aftermath of the financial crisis. It is my view that the time has come to get rid of that surcharge. This is not about giving tax cuts to bankers: it is about the UK remaining a competitive place for firms to do business so that the public can continue to benefit from the success of the sector in this country.<\/p><p pid=\"d712.4\/12\">I have already mentioned Ron Kalifa&#8217;s FinTech review. Without repeating all its requirements or recommendations, I bring the Minister&#8217;s attention to four key things about how we navigate the new world in which we find ourselves, the world of FinTech and how the Government should address them. First, in relation to policy and regulation, we need dynamic leadership that protects consumers yet nurtures FinTech activity and encourages competition. Secondly, on skills, we need to ensure that FinTech has a sufficient supply of domestic and international talent and the means to train and upskill our current and future workforce. My personal view is that we need to retrain and upskill adults in support of UK FinTech by ensuring access to short courses from high-quality providers at low cost. We should support the establishment of new coding schools all over the country, with two-year courses and admission on aptitude, raw ability and potential only. Such a measure could be a real benefit. Indeed, we need investment in FinTech. We need to help complete the funding ladder from start-ups right the way through to the initial public offering. Indeed, we also need national connectivity. We should not just accept where FinTechs are in the UK, whether it be in London or anywhere else. We need to strengthen their connections across all four nations.<\/p><p pid=\"d712.4\/13\">For domestic customers, saving and investing should be simplified. At a time when the complexities and choices facing consumers are ever more complex, we need to make it all much easier for people. It is currently  vastly easier to spend online today than it is to save and invest for tomorrow. We need to help harness technology to drive investment.<\/p><p pid=\"d712.4\/14\">Turning this picture round will require thinking about financial services regulation, and it is good to see a number of regulatory barriers to financial services customer journeys under scrutiny. The Financial Conduct Authority&#8217;s support for an open finance agenda is a key example of that, and more opportunities will become available to UK policy makers as we build our regulatory framework. In turn, that will enable us to bring the UK&#8217;s regulatory agenda closer to the saving and investment needs of UK citizens. For that to work, trust will be key. Existing brands such as Fidelity are already working hard in that space.<\/p><p pid=\"d712.4\/15\">I have considered a number of topics in this speech, but I will draw my remarks to a close. To echo the Chancellor&#8217;s words, financial services are a jewel in  the crown of the UK economy. The sector is one of the engines of Britain&#8217;s economic prosperity, and it should be put front and centre of any future trade deals, and in our regulatory changes. My specific questions to the Minister are these. First, will he update the House on the Treasury&#8217;s plans for the 8% surcharge and whether it can be scrapped?

Friends. However, it gives me no pleasure whatsoever to be standing here yet again calling for this Government to act to secure our borders against the threat of new variants of covid. The news that the Prime Minister has announced a delay in the reopening on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-06-21\">21 June<\/phrase> was a hammer blow to people across the country. Freedoms that have been denied us for so long seemed within our grasp, yet they have been snatched away. Let us be absolutely clear: the impact of what the Prime Minister announced last night is devastating, but it was not inevitable. That delay is happening because of the delta variant first identified in India, and the delta variant is here in such force because of lax Conservative border policy.<\/p><p pid=\"d187.1\/4\">The fallout from that chain of events is enormous for pubs and restaurants that were desperate to open up properly again; for friends planning group holidays that have been ruined; for our towns and city centres hoping to have been bustling with workers again; for concerts, sports stadiums, theatres and festivals that were supposed to be filling up; and for families looking forward to great big get-togethers, celebrating milestones, birthdays, children being born and marriages. I want my thoughts today to be with all those who have seen their wedding plans turned upside down. I realise of course that weddings are legally allowed, but with singing and dancing banned, I do not think they will look like the parties that many of us know weddings to be.<\/p><p pid=\"d187.1\/5\">This will be a desperate blow for so many people, and the cost of this delay will not just be felt in people&#8217;s disappointment and ruined plans. UKHospitality says that a delay of a month will cost its sector &#163;3 billion in sales, with warnings that 200,000 jobs in the sector could go. Some 5,000 gigs are set to be cancelled at a cost of &#163;500 million. Let us be absolutely clear: the responsibility for breaking the promise of freedom day lies squarely with this Conservative Government. The Prime Minister apparently says that his political hero is the mayor from &#8220;Jaws&#8221;, keeping the beaches open while swimmers were getting attacked. The truth is that he has let the shark take a huge chunk out of the British economy this week. People across the country have every right to be angry about being let down so badly.<\/p><p pid=\"d187.1\/6\">Madam Deputy Speaker, through you perhaps I can echo the strong words of Mr Speaker yesterday in condemning the shoddy way in which the Government have treated this House on an announcement of national  importance. Our role is to represent our constituents, and the Prime Minister failing to make the statement to this House or to offer himself for questioning was, frankly, an insult.<\/p><p pid=\"d187.1\/7\">Everyone knows that managing the pandemic is a huge challenge for Governments across the world, and of course the British public can forgive mistakes, but what is unforgivable is making the same mistakes time and time again, putting the health and prosperity of the British people at risk. As an island, our border protections should have been one of our strengths. Instead, they have been an Achilles heel. Time and again, I have stood here and warned that the UK Government&#8217;s border measures are far too weak, yet from the very outset of the pandemic, Government actions at the border have been too little, too late.<\/p><p pid=\"d187.1\/8\">At the outset of the pandemic, just 273 people out of the 18 million that arrived here by air were formally quarantined between <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-01-01\">1 January<\/phrase> and <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-03-23\">23 March<\/phrase> last year&#8212;just 273 people from four flights. In fact, on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-03-13\">13 March<\/phrase> last year, even the voluntary guidance that was in place on self-isolation when coming from parts of China and South Korea and from Iran and Italy was lifted. We have never had a credible explanation for that. All this came at a time when we saw the terrible scenes in northern Italy of hospitals being overwhelmed, when our constituents were contacting us and questioning why there were not better and more effective controls at airports, and when the Government&#8217;s own chief scientific adviser said that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"d187.1\/9\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;a lot of the cases in the UK didn&#8217;t come from China&#8230;they came from European imports and the high level of travel into the UK at that time.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"d187.1\/10\">There is no point in the Government claiming that they have the toughest border protections in the world. In that same month, March 2020, Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada and New Zealand restricted entry to residents and citizens and introduced a 14-day quarantine for all arrivals. It could be done, and it was done; it just was not done by this Government. I wrote to the Home Secretary in April 2020 to ask her to learn the lessons from that, but still the UK remained an international outlier. In May 2020, the UK stood with only Iran, Luxembourg and the US Virgin Islands in having no border protection measures in place, and that, I am afraid, has been the story of the pandemic at the borders.<\/p><p pid=\"d187.1\/11\">This Conservative Government have been late to formal quarantining. It was not introduced until June 2020, and even then only 3% of the people meant to be quarantining were successfully checked. The Government have been late to mandatory border testing, which was not introduced until January 2021, and late to start hotel quarantining, which started in February 2021 and even then covered only 1% of arrivals. They have been late and lacking in strategy, with no proper plan, just lurching from one position to another. It is no wonder that the border policy of this Government has been a tale of systematic failure. The Government did not so much leave the back door open to covid and its variants as leave the front door open the whole time.<\/p><p pid=\"d187.1\/12\">Let me pay tribute to Border Force, the police and our wider law enforcement community. They have worked heroically. The gaps in our defences that have existed and do exist are not their fault, but the fault of Ministers. That chronic failure has been crystallised in the utter  mess over hotel quarantining. On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-02-01\">1 February<\/phrase>, we on the Opposition Benches forced a debate and a vote on covid security at the borders. I said that day:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"d187.1\/13\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Labour is calling for decisive action today through a comprehensive hotel quarantine policy, and that would mean a policy of enforced quarantine restrictions on arrivals&#8230;Failing to adopt that policy risks undermining the huge gains that have been made by the vaccine roll-out, threatening life and hope.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-02-01\">1 February<\/phrase> 2021; Vol. 688, c. 753.]<\/p><p pid=\"d187.1\/14\">I then asked:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"d187.1\/15\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;How on earth can the Government be assured that the measures will prevent emerging strains from countries outside those on the red list? The truth is that the Government cannot answer that question. As a result, the policy is fatally flawed. A comprehensive quarantine policy would give us the best possible chance of preventing a new strain from undermining the astonishing collective sacrifice of the British people.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-02-01\">1 February<\/phrase> 2021; Vol. 688, c. 755.]<\/p><p pid=\"d187.1\/16\">It gives me no pleasure to say it, but that new strain is exactly what came to pass.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1776.0\/1\">I thank the Minister for this Statement. These Benches agree with Mr Speaker; in the statement he made prior to the Secretary of  State&#8217;s Statement last night, he expressed a deep frustration on behalf of all parliamentarians about the Government&#8217;s conduct. The announcement yesterday was both predictable and, sadly, predicted. I sigh, because the Prime Minister is now referring to <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-07-19\">19 July<\/phrase> as &#8220;terminus&#8221; day instead of freedom day, which has probably brought eye-rolls everywhere. When will the Prime Minister learn that caution and the use of data means also being cautious about how you express these matters?<\/p><p pid=\"b1776.0\/2\">The Minister will know that on these Benches we support the Government&#8217;s decision to delay the move to the next stage of the road map, but do so with a deep sense of anger, if not despair, that this should be necessary. Since the delta variant of coronavirus, first discovered in India, was detected in the UK in April, cases have surged across the country, with the variant now making up 96% of new infections. Experts confirmed last week that the variant is 60% more transmissible than the alpha variant, first discovered in Kent in 2020. Scientists at the Wellcome Sanger Institute have used genomic sequencing to produce maps which show how rapidly the delta variant has taken over in England, and I commend them to noble Lords. They are alarming in that they show the rapid spread to almost the whole country by the end of last week. It is doubling week by week&#8212;still with small numbers now, but that will change if this doubling continues.<\/p><p pid=\"b1776.0\/3\">There were warnings of a new variant in India on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-03-25\">25 March<\/phrase>. It is reported that Ministers first learned that the delta variant was in the UK on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-04-01\">1 April<\/phrase>. I must ask the Minister: is that true? The Government red-listed Pakistan and Bangladesh on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-04-09\">9 April<\/phrase>, but did not red- list India until <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-04-23\">23 April<\/phrase>, by which point 20,000 people had arrived from India. As my right honourable friend Jon Ashworth said yesterday in the Commons,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1776.0\/4\">&#8220;Our borders were as secure as a sieve, and all because the Prime Minister wanted a photo call with Prime Minister Modi.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Commons, 14\/6\/21; col. 77.]<\/p><p pid=\"b1776.0\/5\">On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-04-20\">20 April<\/phrase> I said to the Minister:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1776.0\/6\">&#8220;With regard to protecting our borders, this week Hong Kong identified 47 Covid cases on a single flight from Delhi.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b1776.0\/7\">We were closing our borders on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-04-23\">23 April<\/phrase>, and I asked him:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1776.0\/8\">&#8220;there will be hundreds of people arriving on flights from India. Is this not very risky?&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class=\"offrep\" id=\", 20\/4\/21; col. 1769.]\"><i>Official Report<\/i>, 20\/4\/21; col. 1769.]<\/phrase><\/p><p pid=\"b1776.0\/9\">I now return to that question. How many people arrived from India carrying the virus during the period from when the Government were aware of the variant at the beginning of April to <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-04-23\">23 April<\/phrase>, when India joined Pakistan and Bangladesh?<\/p><p pid=\"b1776.0\/10\">It is unforgiveable that Ministers have consistently promised to take control of our borders and conspicuously failed to do so, particularly at the very moment when it mattered most: when we were succeeding in the vaccination rollout and the gradual loosening up. The Prime Minister not only opened the back door to this variant; he failed to take measures to suppress it when he could.<\/p><p pid=\"b1776.0\/11\">There has been growing prevalence of this variant among school-age children, yet mandatory mask-wearing has been abandoned in secondary schools. I have raised this with the Minister at least once before. He has to explain why this has happened, despite being repeatedly asked in both Houses. We also know that  isolation is key to breaking transmission yet, 16 months on, people are still not paid adequate financial compensation to isolate themselves. When asked about this at the Select Committee last week, the Secretary of State claimed that people would game the system. Does the Minister believe that this is true? After all the sacrifices and rule-following of the public, does the Minister have the same low opinion of our fellow citizens as his boss?<\/p><p pid=\"b1776.0\/12\">Yesterday, the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State supported extending restrictions by pointing to plans to go further on vaccination. But even after extending the doses as outlined in the Statement, large proportions of the population will still be left unprotected &#8212;having had one dose or none&#8212;and exposed to a variant that, if left unchecked, will accelerate and double every week. That would mean more hospitalisations, more long Covid, more disruption to schools and more opportunities for variants to emerge. What will happen under these circumstances? Will the Prime Minister still lift the restrictions?<\/p><p pid=\"b1776.0\/13\">My reading of this announcement and the terms in which is it couched is that the science points to us being in a very dangerous position. We could lose the battle that is going on between the vaccine and the virus. Will there be vaccine surges to counter this in areas where the virus is most prevalent? What is the plan to bring down infections and extend vaccination rates in hotspot areas? We have learned that in some places&#8212;Leicester, Chorley, Tameside, Salford and Wigan &#8212;the dose numbers have gone down. Has vaccination surging been abandoned in those hotspot areas? Will the Government bring forward accelerated second doses, and how are they working further to overcome vaccine hesitancy?<\/p><p pid=\"b1776.0\/14\">The Chief Medical Officer said last night that we would be lifting restrictions were it not for the delta variant. The Prime Minister should have moved at lightning speed to prevent the delta variant reaching our shores. Instead he dithered, and today he is responsible.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c1221.0\/1\">In a way, today&#8217;s debate is slightly poignant for me, because I knew Rory Peck very well as a friend. He was a fantastic journalist, and he was also a bit of a rogue. Shortly before he died in 1993, he bet me a bottle of wine that he would have a little boy for his first child, and I bet him that he would have a little girl. He wrote down the name of the bottle of wine that was the bet, and when I lost it, I had to go and buy a bottle of Haut-Brion, which is one of the finest wines in the world and the most expensive bet I have ever lost. I have never, ever bet a bottle of wine since. That is to digress, but it is poignant for me.<\/p><p pid=\"c1221.0\/2\">I have several times in this House been a champion of the BBC. I really believe we have to get our own house in order, and I deplore some of the political attacks that we have seen on the BBC. I believe these political attacks undermine our own moral standing when it comes to criticising the arrests, as previous speakers have mentioned, of journalists in Belarus and pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong, and the whole awful Ryanair event. My view is that we ain&#8217;t got any room for grandstanding until we make ourselves absolutely beyond reproach. In doing so, we will have the moral high ground, and I think it is worth striving for.<\/p><p pid=\"c1221.0\/3\">Let us just remind ourselves that only last year our special envoy on media freedom quit due to what she saw as the Government&#8217;s intentional breaking of international law through the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020, saying that their actions threaten to<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1221.0\/4\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;embolden autocratic regimes that violate international law with devastating consequences all over the world.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1221.0\/5\">That shows us where we should not go. We have to do an awful lot more about reaffirming our existing commitments to media freedom, as other speakers have said.<\/p><p pid=\"c1221.0\/6\">In addition to protecting our journalists in their ability to speak truth, we have to protect those who help them to facilitate the truth being told. That is why I make no apologies for today reiterating my call to offer asylum to the interpreters in Afghanistan, for instance, who have helped British journalists with translation and have been absolutely invaluable to getting the media coverage out. We have a debt of honour to those interpreters.<\/p><p pid=\"c1221.0\/7\">If we rebuild and enhance our reputation, we will be striking a mighty blow for the truth being the truth in an age when there is so much that is not true.<\/p>",

Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)<\/phrase> observed, many other human rights abuses have been committed by China in the region. However, as my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Iain Duncan Smith\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10180\">the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith)<\/phrase> said, this is the issue of the moment. As my hon. Friend  <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Andrew Rosindell\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/11199\">the Member for Romford (Andrew Rosindell)<\/phrase> said, today we are discussing the decline of the most international of Asian cities.<\/p><p pid=\"a418.0\/3\">The speeches we have heard today have illustrated the breadth of China&#8217;s actions in Hong Kong&#8212;brazen actions, in the words of my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Alexander Stafford\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25864\">the Member for Rother Valley (Alexander Stafford)<\/phrase>. We have heard about the manipulation of election rules from the hon. Members for Lewisham East (Janet Daby) and for Vauxhall (Florence Eshalomi).<\/p><p pid=\"a418.0\/4\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"John Martin McDonnell\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10383\">The right hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)<\/phrase> has spoken passionately about his comrades in the trade union movement who have been affected, and <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Ian Paisley Jnr\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/13852\">the hon. Member for North Antrim (Ian Paisley)<\/phrase> has spoken about how even basic things like professing one&#8217;s faith have been hindered by the actions taken by the Chinese Government.<\/p><p pid=\"a418.0\/5\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Alistair Carmichael\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10785\">The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)<\/phrase> and <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"John Nicolson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25281\">the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire (John Nicolson)<\/phrase> spoke about media clampdowns. At one of the most interesting and distressing meetings that I attended while involved in this subject I listened to Hong Kong journalists who had to be identified as witnesses 1, 2 and 3 because of fear of persecution. They underlined well the issues that they faced.<\/p><p pid=\"a418.0\/6\">As <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Wera Hobhouse\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25648\">the hon. Member for Bath (Wera Hobhouse)<\/phrase> observed, democracies have to put on a united front. I am grateful to the Minister for his statement and what he said, and we would be encouraged if this matter were raised at the G7 this week. It is a matter that needs to be raised, and I am grateful for the clarification.<\/p><p pid=\"a418.0\/7\">I will conclude by quoting from the six-monthly report on Hong Kong that is produced by the Foreign Office. The latest one said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a418.0\/8\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;It is not too late for the authorities to reach out and start to heal divisions, however complicated and difficult that might be.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a418.0\/9\">Question put and agreed to.<\/p><p pid=\"a418.0\/10\">Resolved,<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a418.0\/11\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">That this House has considered human rights in Hong Kong.<\/p><p pid=\"a418.0\/12\">Sitting suspended.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1172.0\/1\">My Lords, I first thank the noble Lord, Lord Green, for securing this debate. To any noble Lord who thinks that this issue will not be debated time and again in your Lordships&#8217; House, I say that that is quite wrong. This House is very good at scrutinising all aspects of government policy, and I fully expect that, when we come to the sovereign borders debate, we will spend days on end discussing this issue.<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/2\">I welcome the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, to his place on the Front Bench. It is slightly strange to respond to him with my noble friend Lord Kennedy&#8212;he is my noble friend&#8212;sitting on the Front Bench, but I know from my brief chat with him that he will be a very good addition to it. Of course, the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, will be a great Chief Whip for the Labour group.<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/3\">I start with the substance of the debate. Our new plan for immigration is driven by three objectives. The first is to increase the fairness of our system so that we  can protect and support those in genuine need of asylum. The second is to deter illegal entry into the UK, breaking the awful business model of people smugglers&#8212;I do not think that any noble Lords have in any way tried to lessen the severity of what they do&#8212;and protecting those people whose lives are in danger. The third is to remove more easily from the UK those with no right to be here.<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/4\">We will continue to provide safe refuge to those in need and strengthen the support for those arriving through safe and legal routes. People coming to the UK through resettlement routes will be granted indefinite leave to remain, and they will receive more support to learn English, find work and integrate. The Government will also act to help those who have suffered injustices.<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/5\">I will pick up on the point that I think was made by the both the noble Lords, Lord Coaker and Lord Dubs, welcoming our attempts to expand community sponsorship, because I think that is a fantastic way of always being an advocate of it. I am sure we will have more discussions about that during the next few months. We will also amend British nationality law so that members of the Windrush generation, as mentioned by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark and others, will be able to obtain British citizenship more easily.<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/6\">The plan marks a step change in our approach as we toughen our stance to deter illegal entry and the criminals that endanger life by enabling it. For the first time, whether people enter the UK legally or illegally will have an impact on how their asylum claim progresses &#8212;I know some noble Lords are not happy about that, but it is to deter criminality&#8212;and on their status in the UK, if that claim is successful. We will deem their claim inadmissible and make every effort to remove those who enter the UK illegally, having travelled through a safe country first in which they could and should have claimed asylum. I do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, that this will be a good thing for people smugglers. We intend to really crack down on them.<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/7\">The noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, said that for the first time we will be opening the economy to the whole world in terms of applying for jobs. He also mentioned as a side issue&#8212;it is not a side issue at all, but a side issue to this debate&#8212;about international students getting vaccinated. I confirm that immigration status is not a bar to vaccination.<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/8\">I will go back to the first point made by the noble Lord, Lord Green of Deddington, which was also talked about by the noble Lords, Lord Coaker and Lord Paddick, about the complexity of these rules making parliamentary scrutiny very difficult. We do not agree with that. The October rules made essential changes which delivered on the Government&#8217;s people&#8217;s priorities commitment to introduce a new global immigration system. The new rules are shorter, are easier to read, in a predictable structure and written in plain English. We wholeheartedly welcome and support parliamentary scrutiny; I know we will be scrutinised on this at length. We published a detailed response to the Law Commission&#8217;s report in March 2020 and provided a lengthy and comprehensive Explanatory Memorandum to support the rules.<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/9\">The new rules, which, I might say to the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, were actually made in the same way as they were when he was a Home Office Minister, have been structured and written so that they are easier to understand and navigate. We are trying to strip back complexity and ensure that the requirements are clear to applicants, employers and other users. This an ongoing process and we will continue to improve and develop the rules. It includes consolidating immigration legislation in line with the Law Commission&#8217;s recommendation. It is not a process that can be completed overnight, but we are determined to make progress so that the system is easier to navigate and understand for all users.<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/10\">In response to the specific points in the 33rd report of the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee, which criticised the length of the rules change, it should be remembered that the introduction of the new points-based system at the end of free movement was an extremely significant milestone in this country&#8217;s approach to immigration. Those were important and wide-ranging reforms that had to be delivered before the end of the transition period. While the Immigration Rules are the technical underpinning of the immigration system, there is no expectation that applicants would need to understand them in minute detail, because they can find that clear and straightforward information on GOV.UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/11\">The noble Lords, Lord Dubs and Lord Paddick, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark talked about the new rules on inadmissibility. Those who fear persecution should claim asylum in the first safe country that they reach. Inadmissibility is a long-standing process designed to prevent secondary movement across Europe, and these measures have been introduced to support this principle now that the UK is no longer bound by the Dublin regulation.<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/12\">In answer to my noble friend Lord Balfe&#8217;s point on accepting claims made by those who enter the UK on small boats, it has to be said that too many people risk their lives to get to the UK using unseaworthy vessels, putting not only their lives but those of our Border Force and the people who rescue them at risk. We are determined to send a clear signal that it is completely unacceptable for individuals to travel through multiple safe countries to claim asylum in the UK. I have said time and again that the only people who benefit from this are the criminals, who have no regard for human life at all.<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/13\">The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark, and, I think, the noble Lords, Lord Paddick and Lord Coaker, asked how inadmissibility provisions can work without returns agreements. The inadmissibility provisions in the Immigration Rules give us the legal basis to declare an asylum claim as inadmissible where a person has a connection to or has passed through a safe country. As I have said, we are very determined to send that clear signal that people should not travel through multiple safe countries to claim asylum in the UK. Now we are outside the confines of the EU structures, we can be much more flexible about the evidence that we use to underpin a return.<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/14\">The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, as I knew he might, asked how we will return people to the EU without Dublin, and a number of other noble Lords asked how  some of the conversations are going with other countries. We are seeking to negotiate readmissions arrangements with key EU member states that have a mutual interest in protecting against secondary movements. Unlike Dublin, the new returns agreements we seek will return an individual to any safe country&#8212;I know that the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, said he objects to that&#8212;that they have a connection to or has been present in and could have claimed asylum in, making it much more straightforward. We have also made a political commitment to pursue new bilateral negotiations on post-transition migration issues with third countries with which we share a mutual interest. This includes new arrangements for the family reunion of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/15\">On our international commitments, which the noble Baroness, Lady Bennett of Manor Castle, the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark asked about, we are very clear that the new rules comply with our international obligations under the refugee convention. We will only ever return inadmissible claimants to countries that are safe. If we cannot return an inadmissible claimant to a safe country within a reasonable period of time, we will consider their claim in the UK.<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/16\">On the cap and the salary threshold that my noble friend Lord Horam and the noble Lord, Lord Green of Deddington, asked about, the MAC advised that the cap be abolished, as<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1172.0\/17\">&#8220;it creates uncertainty among employers and it makes little sense for a migrant to be perceived as of value one day and not the next which is what inevitably happens when the cap binds.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/18\">The MAC has said&#8212;I think I said this the other day&#8212; that if the Government want to reduce migration numbers it would make more economic sense to do so by varying the other aspects of the scheme criteria, such as salary thresholds and the level of the immigration surcharge. On the issue of numbers overall, the Government have been quite clear for a number of years now that it is not about numbers but about a fair system and people not taking illegal journeys to this country when it is dangerous to do so.<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/19\">The noble Lords, Lord Balfe and Lord Coaker, talked about BNOs. I will have to provide the noble Lord, Lord Coaker, with some more information, because he made so many points that I did not quite have a chance to write them all down. We are aware that a potentially significant number of individuals plan to move to the UK via this route. We have made available &#163;43 million of dedicated support for Hong Kong BNO status holders and their families who choose to settle in the UK. As for recourse to public funds, I am under the assumption that because they will have leave to settle in the UK, they will have recourse to public funds, but I will double check that.  I will also answer the noble Lord&#8217;s question on the Youth Mobility Scheme in writing, because I am not entirely certain of the answer.<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/20\">The noble Lord also asked about the shortage occupation list. As he knows, it contains skilled occupations where there is a national shortage of workers which can sensibly be filled, in part, through migration. The MAC recommends changes to the SOL where there are skilled jobs with an identified national shortage that it would be sensible to fill, at least in part, through immigration&#8212;these are set out in the shortage occupation list. The noble Lord mentioned senior health workers, and he is absolutely correct. Changes to the immigration rules in March of this year give workers in key health and care roles greater opportunity to come to the UK. Pharmacists, lab technicians, senior care workers and nursing assistants are among roles that were added to the shortage occupation list.<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/21\">The noble Lord, Lord Liddle, stated that we are opening up jobs to the whole of the world&#8212;I would have thought that might be quite in line with his EU free-movement credentials. I think it is fair that people who have the sufficient skills and salary to come to this country should be given the opportunity, across the piece, to do so.<\/p><p pid=\"a1172.0\/22\">The Government promised to take a common-sense approach to controlling immigration, both legal and illegal, and we will deliver on that promise. I look forward to further debates on this issue in the coming weeks and months. I thank all noble Lords, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Green, for taking part in this debate.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b204.0\/1\">It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Ms Ghani, and to follow what has been an excellent debate. In an unusual opening gambit for a shadow Minister, may I first pay tribute to the Minister who, in Opposition as well as in Government, has made this issue a priority? I know it is something that he really believes in.<\/p><p pid=\"b204.0\/2\">I also pay tribute to my good friend, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Damian Collins\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24744\">the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins)<\/phrase>, who gave a fantastic opening exposition. He spoke about news deserts, and other hon. Members also spoke about the problems of local news and media. He also mentioned the importance of not forgetting online news and disinformation, on which I know he has done so much work in the past. It was a fantastic introduction.<\/p><p pid=\"b204.0\/3\">Let me say first of all that we have to get our own house in order, starting here in this place, in Westminster. Too often, there is a tendency to attack journalism. It is still a matter of shame for me that four or five years ago, Laura Kuenssberg felt that she had to have a bodyguard to attend the Labour party conference. Once again, I send my apologies to her for that. More recently, a Conservative Minister caused the Twitter pile-on of a journalist who was asking perfectly innocent questions, and we have heard some unhelpful comments from the Prime Minister attacking all journalists. We have got SNP Members who attack the BBC because they do not like the way it covered the independence referendum. Plenty of Conservative MPs are always undermining the BBC and calling it for it to be defunded. We have Democratic Unionist party MPs who have a beef with Stephen Nolan and attack the BBC and its integrity. Those attacks need to stop. By all means complain about individual broadcasts, but stop undermining independent journalism.<\/p><p pid=\"b204.0\/4\">As my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Kim Johnson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25803\">the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Kim Johnson)<\/phrase> mentioned, the UK is ranked 33rd out of 180 countries in the 2021 World Press Freedom Index. Restrictions on freedom of information and active threats to the safety of journalists in Northern Ireland continue to mar the UK&#8217;s press freedom record. We heard about the murder of Lyra McKee and her search for the truth. She was shot in 2019 during the riots that took place in Derry. It is truly shocking that on our shores journalists still face such a hostile environment.<\/p><p pid=\"b204.0\/5\">The situation in Northern Ireland, incidentally, is becoming increasingly hostile. I heard recently the horrific story of Patricia Devlin, who has been subject to continuous and serious threats and abuse in recent years. In 2019, she reported receiving a Facebook message&#8212;I hesitate  to say this, but I will&#8212;that suggested threats of rape against her baby. That is to a journalist in the UK. In a case in Barrow-in-Furness, Amy Fenton was run out of town by far-right gangs. We still have something to do in the UK. We need to make that a priority.<\/p><p pid=\"b204.0\/6\">The focus of the debate is international. Numerous hon. Members referred to the disgraceful case of Roman Protasevich, which, frankly, was an act of piracy by the Belarusian Government. To those who would suggest that Mr Protasevich is not a journalist but merely a citizen blogger, when all the press in Belarus is so tightly controlled and not independent, citizen bloggers become the only source of independent information and, as has been mentioned, an essential independent voice.<\/p><p pid=\"b204.0\/7\">In the debate, we heard that the number of journalists being killed is at an all-time high, with 387 being detained and 50 journalists killed around the world in 2020. The hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe mentioned the gunning down of the three female media workers in Afghanistan. In fact, the past decade has been the deadliest one for the profession, with a total of 1,059 journalists killed in the past 10 years simply for doing their job. That has to stop. Every year, every statistic, has a human side&#8212;the death of a mother or father, a brother or sister, a community left without information, denied that human right to be properly informed.<\/p><p pid=\"b204.0\/8\">Let us not forget that the threat does not come only from authoritarian Governments. My right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10133\">the Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)<\/phrase> talked about Mexico, a country that he knows well. Journalists have been murdered for investigating powerful organised crime groups and drug cartels. Reference was made to the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia in Malta, with suggestions that elements of organised crime were working in concert with Governments. I ask the Minister for us to do more than simply condemn the detention and killing of journalists all around the world. More must be done to support those who are being silenced.<\/p><p pid=\"b204.0\/9\">The BBC World Service does a fantastic job of projecting and promoting not just British values, but truthful and honest journalism. That is known throughout the world. Given those who say that we need to cut the BBC licence fee, I remind hon. Members in the Chamber and elsewhere that 70% of World Service funding comes from the licence fee&#8212;be careful what you wish for.<\/p><p pid=\"b204.0\/10\">The BBC World Service is under threat. In China, the BBC World News TV channel has been banned by the Chinese authorities. In Hong Kong, the BBC World Service has been removed from the airwaves, after criticism of the BBC for its reporting on coronavirus and the persecution of the Uyghurs. World News distribution in mainland China was limited to international hotels; nevertheless, its loss is symbolically significant. John Sudworth, the BBC&#8217;s China correspondent whose reporting exposed truths about the Xinjiang detention camps, including sexual violence against Uyghur women, has now had to move to Taiwan, following pressure and threats from the Chinese authorities.<\/p><p pid=\"b204.0\/11\">In Myanmar, BBC Burmese correspondent Aung Thura was taken away and detained along with a colleague towards the end of March, while reporting outside the court in the capital. The licences of media companies have been revoked and nightly internet shutdowns  have been used to restrict news coverage and access  to information.<\/p><p pid=\"b204.0\/12\">Russia is also becoming an increasingly hostile environment for journalists. In recent years, many independent news organisations have closed down or curtailed their operations. Legislation governing the media is extensive and strict. The Russian authorities have made it clear that any action taken against the Russian state-backed TV channel RT in the UK will result in similar measures being taken against the BBC in Russia. Of course, there is the problem of the continuing harassment of BBC Persian staff, and their families, by Iran. It is deeply troubling and continues to escalate. The Iranian authorities have targeted Persian journalists, the BBC and their families since the service launched satellite television in 2009. Intimidation of the family members of BBC Persian staff in Iran is a regular occurrence. This takes various forms, including arrests, detention, questioning, threats that jobs or pensions will be lost, confiscation of passports and asset freezes. I ask the Minister to reflect on the situation of BBC Persian journalists, and ensure that they and their families in this country and abroad are safe.<\/p><p pid=\"b204.0\/13\">I refer briefly to the question on the bombing of the news premises in Gaza, mentioned by my hon. Friends the Members for Leicester East (Claudia Webbe) and for Liverpool, Riverside (Kim Johnson), my right hon. Friend the Member for Islington North and many others. What happened is an absolute outrage. The building was deliberately targeted and that cannot be allowed without massive criticism of the Israeli air force.<\/p><p pid=\"b204.0\/14\">Finally, I reflect on an increasingly problematic matter, mentioned by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Damian Collins\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24744\">the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins)<\/phrase>, the question of SLAPPs&#8212;an acronym that I think came first and the words to fill it after&#8212;strategic lawsuits against public participation. It is a real problem. Legal threats against journalists are far from a new phenomenon. Yet increasingly, media outlets and freelance journalists&#8212;even those with no links to the UK&#8212;report receiving letters from London law firms acting on behalf of the people they are investigating. The high costs and long time periods involved in fighting legal threats in the UK pile significant pressure on individual journalists or media outlets to withdraw or refrain from publishing their investigations, even if they believe them to be accurate and in the public interest. Taken usually by powerful or wealthy individuals and entities, the intention is not to address a genuine grievance, but to stifle investigations into matters of public interest through intimidation, and by consuming the target&#8217;s financial and psychological resources.<\/p><p pid=\"b204.0\/15\">These types of vexatious legal threats can also come hand in hand with orchestrated smear campaigns, offline surveillance and other forms of harassment against journalists. Some of the recent examples include lawsuits filed by Russian billionaires against Catherine Belton; by the allies of the Malaysian Prime Minister against Clare Rewcastle Brown; and a lawsuit filed against OCCRP and its co-founder Paul Radu, by an Azerbaijani politician. Perhaps even more shocking is the involvement of UK legal companies who actively advertise such services to their clients. The UK is the leading international source of these threats, almost equivalent to those stemming from EU countries and the US combined.<\/p><p pid=\"b204.0\/16\">To protect media freedom at home and abroad, the UK must take action to address two interlinked trends&#8212;first, the role that London continues to hold as an international libel capital, despite reforms to English  and Welsh law in 2013, and the impact of such legal action, or even the threat of it, in the UK on journalists around the world; and secondly, the impact that the UK&#8217;s facilitation through its financial and legal systems of illicit finance links to political elites in countries with poor democratic records has on media freedom there. It is not surprising that countries with higher rates of corruption tend to have the fewest protections for journalists and the media. The so-called SLAPPs damage the UK&#8217;s reputation as a haven for free speech, and I urge the Minister to look into that issue.<\/p><p pid=\"b204.0\/17\">It is clear that press and media freedoms are under threat around the world. For a country that is part of the global Media Freedom Coalition, there is a long way to go to promote and protect press freedom. I know that the National Union of Journalists advises that there should be a new convention, which is stronger than the demand solely for a special representative. A new convention would systemise and detail existing obligations, enhance the visibility of the journalists and the protection required for journalism, and codify multiple texts into one comprehensive document. We need to value journalists and their contribution, protect their livelihoods and stand up for universal rights and freedoms, democracy and the rule of law everywhere, and against violations wherever they take place. That must support freedom of expression, and specifically media freedoms.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b1044.0\/1\">My Lords, I am grateful to follow the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, who spoke so passionately, and for the opportunity to make my maiden speech. I begin in the traditional way by thanking the doorkeepers and the staff who have guided me more than once up and down the different corridors and made me feel so welcome. Black Rod, the Clerk of the Parliaments and officials here have all helped me to begin to understand how this place works. I also thank the Prime Minister for nominating me; my supporting Peers, my noble friends Lord Black of Brentwood and Lady Morgan of Cotes; and my mentors, my noble friends Lady Chisholm of Owlpen and Lady Sanderson of Welton.<\/p><p pid=\"b1044.0\/2\">I trust noble Lords will indulge me for a moment before I return to the business in hand. I would like to pay tribute to my ancestor Sir John Bowring. Although he left school at the age of 13, he became a prot&#233;g&#233; of Jeremy Bentham and was later elected MP for Bolton and, thanks to the patronage of Lord Palmerston, was appointed governor of Hong Kong. Sir John was well known for his progressive views on free trade, his ambition that the United Kingdom should have a decimal currency and his remarkable knowledge of languages. He spoke 12 fluently and understood 12 more. He also had an unfashionable enthusiasm for women&#8217;s participation in politics.<\/p><p pid=\"b1044.0\/3\">I hope that Sir John would have approved of my elevation to this House and perhaps also of my decision to take up a trade, for journalism is indeed a trade. Inspired by the formidable Clare Hollingworth, I headed for southern Africa, arriving shortly before the Soweto riots, and later I went to southern Sudan when it was on the brink of famine and civil war. As editor of the London Evening Standard, I too adopted unfashionable causes. In 2003, the newspaper backed London&#8217;s bid to host the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics. The view then was that Paris was bound to win and that even if we won we would not be able to build the facilities on time. Another unfashionable cause the Evening Standard supported was the wild-card Conservative candidate who wanted to become Mayor of London. The rest is history.<\/p><p pid=\"b1044.0\/4\">Music and music education now fills much of my life. During the pandemic, music has been a source of great joy and comfort to many. This last year has indeed been devastating, but the work of my noble friend Lord Mendoza as commissioner for cultural recovery and renewal has played a vital role in giving hope and funds to music and the arts. Teachers have valiantly persevered, maintaining music tuition wherever possible, often online. They recognise the important role that music plays in a child&#8217;s education, boosting mental health and self-esteem and improving cognitive ability to raise attainment in maths and English. Students from low-income families who take part in musical and creative activities are three times more likely to get a degree and a job. I live in hope that there will be renewed government support for music education, following the recent publication of the Department for Education&#8217;s Model Music Curriculum. I played a part as chair of the expert panel and believe that the document is an important step in helping our teachers  to ensure that every child can access high-quality music education. Concert halls and village halls across the country are ready to take up the challenge of being part of the national rebirth through music and the arts. Like all those for whom culture and the arts are so important, I take this opportunity to urge the Government to negotiate speedily amendments to the visa restrictions and work permits for the EU for all our musicians, actors and artists. They are critical to the livelihoods of tens of thousands of wonderful people and vital to global Britain.<\/p><p pid=\"b1044.0\/5\">I also take this opportunity to give my full support to the Government&#8217;s proposal further to extend the dormant assets scheme in the Bill. I congratulate the Minister on the success so far. It is a remarkable achievement. I am very proud to have been very involved with the voluntary sector, so I look forward to an active role in the debate. Expanding this scheme is crucial to maintaining its impact and to contributing to the levelling-up agenda. Additional funds would make a real difference to so many communities and to the cultural economy. Is this not the moment to level up music education and ensure that children from all backgrounds and all regions can benefit from the power of music?<\/p><p pid=\"b1044.0\/6\">I am immensely grateful to all those who have welcomed me today, and I look forward to the rest of the speeches in this debate and the many debates to come.<\/p>",

Friend when it is necessary that she only has to look in this direction and I give way to her&#8212;my apologies.<\/p><p pid=\"b291.1\/2\">What I was really trying to get to the bottom of is that I do not think that this is feasible any longer. The Bill illustrates the dichotomy that lies at the heart of the Government&#8217;s position. We are trying constantly to talk about these trade relationships, but at the same time we recognise that the country that we are discussing them with is a totalitarian state that is guilty of what many, including myself, believe is a genocide of a whole ethnic group&#8212;more than one ethnic group. It is a state that is intolerant, that is suppressing democracy and free speech in Hong Kong, that is threatening Taiwan and India, and that has said that it is in possession of the South China sea. I could go on with that list. We can recognise the compilation of all those things and that there is a security risk, and yet at the same time in the other place we are told, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. We are still trying to do trade deals.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"b291.1\/3\">It is quite interesting that we have reopened an economic and financial dialogue under a JETCO&#8212;a joint economic and trade committee&#8212;which was originally paused because of the imposition of the national security law in Hong Kong. The discussions have now restarted, although we did not hear much fanfare. We sort of discovered that they had restarted, but there was no announcement from the Dispatch Box that we were restarting them. There are no dates involved, but the discussions are restarting, despite the sanctions against individuals and so on, and despite our sanctions against Chinese officials&#8212;although I still wish that we could do more.<\/p><p pid=\"b291.1\/4\">I note also that the European Union was heading in the same direction with its agreement, only now, because of the sanctions on its MEPs and so on, it has decided that it is not going to do that. I simply raise the question: if we think that this country and this Government &#8212;the Chinese Communist party, the Government of China&#8212;are such a potential threat, should we really be trying to reopen those doors, despite the sanctions that we have in place, the sanctions that they have put in place, and the very clear threat that they now pose to our security?<\/p><p pid=\"b291.1\/5\">I simply say to my hon. Friend the Minister that I was going to move my amendment, which would have said that the Government should immediately declare many of these companies high-risk vendors by the very nature of the security law that exists in China. However, I would also say, in support of what has been said already, that the Government need to use the internal possibilities in our Parliament. We have a Committee that is cleared to the highest level of security in these areas, and it is important that we use that Committee. If the Government get private advice from the Committee about what it thinks is going wrong with their position, I think that will benefit and improve them.<\/p><p pid=\"b291.1\/6\">I therefore ask my hon. Friend to take my amendment into consideration and to answer that point, to think seriously about how we can strengthen the Bill further and, if he can, to make the reservations of this place felt to his colleagues in Government. We are deeply concerned about trying to ride two bicycles at the same time: recognising a deep and growing threat to democracy not just here but around the world from the Chinese Communist party, while trying to beg China to do trade deals with us, notwithstanding the fact that it behaves so badly.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"b129.0\/1\">First, I draw Members&#8217; attention to my entry in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests.<\/p><p pid=\"b129.0\/2\">I rise to support my colleagues on the Front Bench and new clause 24 about the surcharge on overseas buyers: the extra stamp duty that is charged. Although we are seeing a 2% uplift, it is not what was originally promised, and even that, I would say, is still not enough to prevent people from speculating, particularly in my constituency and elsewhere in London, on the expensive London housing market and overheating that housing market.<\/p><p pid=\"b129.0\/3\">I came across this level of investment in my early days in this place&#8212;I have now been here for 16 years&#8212;when I discovered that whole blocks of new developments were being bought up overnight. I could not work out who was doing it. I then managed to inveigle my way on to the distribution lists of some of the estate agents, which were advertising the properties in Hong Kong and Dubai, and they sold over a weekend.<\/p><p pid=\"b129.0\/4\">These were not homes for local people. They were often bought up by finance companies overseas and sold on. The original reason for the extra stamp duty surcharge was to try to curtail that to some extent, but I do not think it is enough. Foreign investors are buying homes, which are becoming commodities; they are advertised with yield&#8212;it is simply about increasing the rent. As the shadow Minister, my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Abena Oppong-Asare\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25846\">the Member for Erith and Thamesmead (Abena Oppong-Asare)<\/phrase>, highlighted, at least &#163;53 million and counting in revenue has been lost from the Exchequer at a time when we need it more than ever. The excuse is often that  developers need the money because they cannot operate without that cash-flow model. I think they would adapt pretty quickly. In my constituency, there are blocks that local people have kept their eye on, wanting to try to buy, only to find they have already been sold en masse overseas. A stamp duty increase would help a little bit.<\/p><p pid=\"b129.0\/5\">The stamp duty holiday has been helpful to many people, but all that contributes to fuelling demand for housing while the Government are not increasing supply. Those rising house prices put homeownership out of reach of so many of my constituents and people up and down the country. It is having a major dampening impact on people&#8217;s lives and livelihoods and on the economy in the long term. It does nothing for private renters and nothing for those in desperate need of affordable housing.<\/p><p pid=\"b129.0\/6\">We are now able to go out and do our normal roving surgeries on doorsteps, and I will give some examples of people I have met in the last week alone. Faisal works in the NHS. He has three children in a two-bedroom council flat, and he has been bidding to move to a bigger property for 10 years, but such is the demand in my constituency that someone in housing need does not get to move. If they are homeless, they now get stuck in a hostel room for years, whereas only five or so years ago it was for about six months. Jane&#8212;not her real name&#8212;and her husband live with two large teenage boys in a two-bedroom flat. I have known her for some years, having seen her at surgeries. I happened to be on her doorstep the other day, and she made sure that I saw how big her boys have become. She has been coming to see me since they were toddlers, yet she still cannot get rehoused. This is no criticism of Hackney Council, which is doing a fantastic job of trying to build, and is building, affordable social housing, but it cannot keep pace with the demand. In the last week alone, two women I knocked on the doors of were sharing beds with their 12 and 13-year-old sons respectively.<\/p><p pid=\"b129.0\/7\">One of the saddest cases is an NHS porter I met less than 10 days ago who shares a room in a private rented home with his 16-year-old daughter. He works. He could not qualify for affordable housing even if he wanted to, because he has no recourse to public funds, despite propping up our NHS in one of the most challenging years in its history. He is doing all the right things&#8212;working, trying to be a good father&#8212;but he cannot afford private rents. That is not surprising: it is at least &#163;1,500 a month to rent a two-bedroom flat in my constituency; &#163;750,000 to buy a two-bedroom flat; and rent for a three-bedroom house is not much shy of &#163;3,500 a month.<\/p><p pid=\"b129.0\/8\">We need to increase stamp duty immediately, while monitoring its effect, and we should increase it further for overseas purchasers. We should not have a housing market that has led to homes being owned by finance vehicles or absentee landlords who have no interest in it being a home but simply see it as an investment. Homes should be homes. Investment is all very well, but this is really damaging the future prospects of children in my constituency, some of whom will never have not only their own bedroom but maybe even their own bed between now and when they hopefully earn enough money to leave home, although frankly we are a long way off their earning enough money to buy a &#163;750,000 flat. The Government really need to step up. They talk about levelling up, but that is certainly not happening for many people in my constituency.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c666.0\/1\">My Lords, it is huge privilege for me to address your Lordships&#8217; House on this wide-ranging debate covering many areas. It was a tour of the world as we know it in terms of development and the role of the United Kingdom. I will immediately respond to the noble Lord, Lord Collins, by saying that it is not just the perception of the United Kingdom, but the reality. Our recent influence in standing up for the rule-based international system has been demonstrated by the strong level of support we have seen for British candidates for the prosecutor role at the ICC and for the election of Judge Korner. There are many other examples I could quote.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/2\">It would be remiss of me not to recognise the valuable contributions of all noble Lords. I single out my noble friend Lord Udny-Lister. I have known him for a couple of decades or more in different guises&#8212;perhaps that reflects our ages. One thing I know is that his devotion and dedication to public service is recognised at local level within London and internationally. I noted in particular his comment that he will hold the Government to account. As the Minister responsible for foreign affairs&#8212;and I am sure I reflect the sentiments of my noble friend Lady Goldie&#8212;I regard that comment with some trepidation. We look forward to his future contributions.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/3\">I also welcome my noble friend Lord Herbert to his new role. I cannot find him in his place. There he is&#8212;this is the challenge of an ever-evolving House. I hope we will get back to a degree of normality. I welcome my noble friend&#8217;s appointment; I wish him well in his new role, and look forward to working very closely with him on the important agenda for which he is responsible.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/4\">In thanking all noble Lords, I recognise the importance of this debate and the richness of the contributions. There was, of course, much challenge to the Government. I, as the Minister responsible for foreign affairs and development affairs in your Lordships&#8217; House, along with the Minister for Defence recognise not just the richness of this debate but the value, expertise and insight that your Lordships provide in challenging the Government and in shaping the future direction of our great country.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/5\">We have had recognition of the various issues. I made a particular note of the comments of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leeds. He spoke of his Church experience. A cleric&#8212;a priest or a vicar or a representative of any faith&#8212;has to make sure that what they say is reflected in their deeds. As a Minister in the Government, I assure him that I share some of those sentiments quite directly. I also recognise the importance of the role we are now playing on the world stage through the creation of the FCDO. I welcome the response from my noble friends Lord Northbrook and Lady Meyer who recognised the importance of this merger. It has brought together diplomacy and development in a way that has strengthened the role of the United Kingdom on the world stage.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/6\">On ODA, I recognise the important role my noble friend Lady Sugg has played. Questions were asked by the noble Lords, Lord Collins and Lord Purvis, the  noble Baroness, Lady Northover, and others. Of course it was regrettable that we had to reduce the commitment made in legislation by a Conservative-led Government from 0.7% of GNI but, as has been said before, it is our stated intent to return to that figure at the earliest opportunity. Notwithstanding the challenges and cuts that have had to be endured on programmes, we approached this in the FCDO by looking at core projects and ensuring that we retain equity and our leadership on the world stage. We will now be spending more than &#163;10 billion, which is still among the highest of our G7 partners, on the important area of development around the world.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/7\">As we continued through the debate, I made different notes. My noble friend Lady Hooper provided insights on Latin America, which are always well-recognised, and questions were asked about the importance of our relationships within the European Union by the noble Baroness, Lady Northover. I say to her that we value our relationship with key partners in the EU, as demonstrated by the attendance of the leading official from the European Commission on Foreign Affairs at the G7. We participate with the European Union quite directly on the key issues and challenges we are facing, including the Covid challenge and the environment. This is a year of global leadership, as has been recognised by several noble Lords, including my noble friend Lady Meyer, and we are putting at its heart the health response and the challenges around COP 26, and focusing attention on these important issues.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/8\">The integrated review has set out our Prime Minister&#8217;s vision for a stronger, more prosperous union in 2030 and outlined the actions we will take, at home and abroad, to realise that vision in a more competitive age. In this regard there are four key areas we will be focusing on.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/9\">I will now seek to address many of the questions raised by noble Lords. From the outset, as the Minister with responsibility for the Commonwealth, the United Nations and our multilateral policy, I will say that I recognise the important contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, among others, stressing the importance of the rules-based international system. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Collins, that we are putting it at the heart of our response in our support for international institutions, including the International Criminal Court. Whether it is at the United Nations, through our current role as Commonwealth Chair-in-Office, in NATO, or at the Human Rights Council, the G7 or COP 26, that underlines the strength of global Britain today.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/10\">We are focused on many different areas, but I will cover some of the issues and our relationships. My noble friend Lord Risby talked about the importance of our relationship with the US. The US remains a central and key partner to our relationships across the world, whether through multilateral organisations or by co-ordinating across a range of foreign policy issues, including on Iran, Russia, China and Myanmar. We also welcome the US reaffirming its commitment to NATO, re-joining the Paris Agreement on climate change and remaining in the World Health Organization, and the &#163;4 billion commitment to COVAX which has been made. I assure noble Lords that, at the very  highest level, through President Biden and my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and Secretary of State Blinken, and others, we are dealing with the US directly on a range of different priorities.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/11\">China was understandably raised by many noble Lords, including my noble friend Lord King, who spoke of the challenges around cyber, and my noble friends Lord Jopling and Lady Fall. I assure noble Lords that, yes, we have got a relationship with China; it is vital we establish a relationship with China. There are many issues we discuss within the context of our P5 membership of the UN Security Council. We face some challenges where, without China, we will not achieve our ambitions, including climate change.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/12\">We want to build a trade relationship in the medium to long term with China. However, that will not prevent us calling out the disagreements we have and the abuses of human rights we have seen in places such as Xinjiang. And it will not stop the steps we have taken to ensure the rights of BNOs within Hong Kong. As many noble Lords will know, we have taken specific actions through the global human rights sanctions regime against four Chinese Government officials and one entity responsible for serious human rights violations in Xinjiang. The noble Lord, Lord Collins, again asked about future sanctions policy with respect to Hong Kong and other areas. We keep the situation under review, but I am not going to suggest what may happen in the weeks and months ahead. My noble friend Lady Fall asked a specific question about the NSC subgroup on China. Our policy towards China, as my noble friend will be aware, is agreed by the NSC and is reviewed regularly.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/13\">The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, asked a question about security partnerships in the world and the recent statements made by New Zealand. It is of course for New Zealand to determine its own policy towards China, as we the UK Government have our own approach. Recently, the Foreign Minister of New Zealand has confirmed again that New Zealand is not hesitant but recognises the value of the Five Eyes partnership.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/14\">Looking further afield, my noble friend Lady Helic raised the issue of Russian activity in the Balkans and what we can do as a Government. I assure my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Collins, that I totally accept the point that civil society has a central role to play in building new sustainable societies, and the Balkans is no exception. The Government have played an important role&#8212;including on preventing sexual violence in conflict, an area I cover on behalf of the Prime Minister. We will continue to work with key partners, including NATO, the EU and civil society, in this respect.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/15\">I turn to science and technology. In his excellent maiden speech, my noble friend referred to the importance of cyber and technology. We seek to strengthen the UK&#8217;s place at the leading edge of science and technology, which is essential to our prosperity agenda, competitiveness and security.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/16\">The noble Lord, Lord St John, talked about the role of the Commonwealth. I assure noble Lords that we have taken specific action to strengthen the response  to cyber challenges and have invested quite directly in cybersecurity through the Commonwealth, particularly for smaller, vulnerable island states.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/17\">We are looking at strengthening open societies, human rights and free trade through our important relationship with the EU. I was delighted that we were joined by my noble friend Lord Frost earlier. To those&#8212;including the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford&#8212;who challenge that Europe is not important to us, I say that here we have a Minister appointed to the heart of government, in the Cabinet, responsible for our relations with the European Union. It comes back to those points. It is not just words but action.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/18\">We will deepen our ties in the Indo-Pacific, Africa and the Gulf. The noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, among others, raised the important role we will continue to play in Africa. Let us not forget that Africa has a number of important Commonwealth countries, and that relationship will be taken to new levels. We will work towards dialogue partner status at ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and are looking forward to early accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/19\">We will also lead action to reinforce and reshape the international order of the future to ensure that the United Kingdom is at the heart of areas such as space and cyberspace. I assure noble Lords that we will reaffirm our commitment to strengthening democracy and human rights across the piece. The noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, talked about some elements of this, particularly with regard to the situation in Belarus. We have called out the suppression of journalists. I note quite carefully some of the points that he raised, including the important work of my noble friend Lord Blencathra in this respect. I look forward to working with him specifically on some of the more sensitive issues, particularly on some of the individual cases.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/20\">On the current situation between Azerbaijan and Armenia, raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, we are well aware of the allegations from both sides that war crimes have been committed. We have urged relevant authorities to investigate and understand the situation on the ground. I know my colleague, Minister Morton, is working very hard in this respect and has visited the area directly and had discussions with all sides.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/21\">I have addressed the issue of the EU quite directly, and I hope my comments have provided some reassurance to both the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leeds and the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, about the importance we continue to attach to our relationship with the European Union. I am glad the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, recognised the diplomatic status we have extended to the EU representative to the United Kingdom. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary and others continue to work closely not just with the likes of France and Germany; we are committed to wider partnerships within the EU. My right honourable friend recently met Nordic and Baltic counterparts to see how we can strengthen our rights further. The noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, also asked about citizens&#8217; rights. In the interests of time, and that being more of a Home Office lead, I will write to her.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/22\">I assure my noble friend Lord Northbrook on the specific issue of the overseas territories and our preparation. They are part of the British family. We have helped them during the Covid challenge and supplied vaccines directly, and we stand ready for any challenges that may be faced by the overseas territories, and indeed the wider Caribbean, as the hurricane season comes forward.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/23\">The noble Lord, Lord Alton, again a great champion of human rights, talked rightly about the emerging situation in Tigray, particularly in respect of sexual violence. I assure him that only this week I have reviewed quite specifically the situation on the ground. We are looking to deploy our team of experts shortly to ensure that we can collect and start collating evidence to allow for successful prosecutions at the appropriate time.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/24\">The noble Lord, Lord Sharkey, talked of the situation in north Cyprus. I assure him directly that my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary is engaged very much on this agenda, and we work closely on the issue of Cyprus more generally with the United Nations.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/25\">The most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury rightly raised the important issue of conflict stabilisation and mediation. He used the word &#8220;reconciliation&#8221;; there is no better word. That is now very much structured within the work of the FCDO, and we will see how we can further strengthen our work in this respect. It is important that we bring communities together.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/26\">In this case, the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, talked about conflict management and resolution, supporting refugees within Africa. We will continue to work with key partners, including the African Union. My noble friend Lord Naseby talked about the importance of reconciliation with Sri Lanka, which I was due to visit in the coming few days&#8212;unfortunately, the national lockdown there has prevented me from making that visit next week. Nevertheless, I am engaging directly with the new Government&#8212;but we stand by the strength of our resolution, passed at the Human Rights Council.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/27\">In talking about conflict resolution, I come to the important issue of the Middle East and the current situation on the ground in Israel and Palestine. Of course we deplore the continuing cycle of violence; we have been at the forefront of stating this at the UN Security Council. I assure my noble friend Lord Polak and the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, that we will stand up and speak out strongly against anti-Semitism. Anyone who seeks to target any community in the United Kingdom should be called out: anti-Semitism has no place in the UK&#8212;indeed, no faith should be targeted, across the United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/28\">I also assure the noble Lord, Lord Hussain, and my noble friend Lady Warsi that we have called for an immediate ceasefire in this conflict. As he said, it is important that we recognise access in relation to humanitarian support. I am sure that we all have our personal reflections, and it is clear that the United Kingdom&#8217;s position has not changed. Settlements are illegal, and the only way to resolve this&#8212;for the long term, for a sustainable, peaceful solution&#8212;is a secure, safe Israel, living side by side with an independent,  sovereign Palestinian state. I assure all noble Lords, including my noble friend Lady Warsi, that that remains central to our work.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/29\">I turn briefly, in the very limited time left, to defence. I am sure that my noble friend Lady Goldie will reflect on the important contributions made. In this respect, I assure my noble friend Lady Anelay of our continued commitment to Afghanistan. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell, rightly raised the issue of our role, particularly in relation to demining. My noble friend Lady Hodgson and the noble Baroness, Lady D&#8217;Souza, spoke in support of the work that we have done to date&#8212;but it is a challenge, and, in the continuing negotiations that take place on the ground, it is important that we do not lose the gains that have been made. However, the Taliban&#8217;s continued co-operation is a key area of concern, and, as the Minister responsible for Afghanistan, I am engaging directly with key interlocutors, including President Ghani and Foreign Minister Atmar.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/30\">We will take a more robust approach to security; I assure all noble Lords in this respect. This includes the &#163;85 billion that we are spending on new defence equipment and support in the next four years alone, driving forward modernisation&#8212;my noble friend Lord Sterling in particular noted the importance of modernising our defence response&#8212;and investing in research and development and our cyber response in our state-of-the-art National Cyber Security Centre. We will continue to work closely with our key allies to further strengthen our response.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/31\">I note our commitments to rapid modernisation in shipbuilding and accelerated R&amp;D, and I appreciate the strong support that we have had from the noble Lord, Lord West, on the shipbuilding element. We will continue to reflect on our ambition for defence to be an important part of the global Britain brand.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/32\">I turn to some of the specific questions. The noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, asked about supply chains. The procurement reform Bill will slash the number of regulations governing public procurement and introduce a single uniform framework that can unleash the potential for public sector innovation and partnership. We are very much committed to the Armed Forces covenant legislation; it will continue to be a key focus of ours to secure a duty of due regard to its principles. I assure the noble Lord, Lord West, that we will invest in assets: our aim is to increase the number of frigates and destroyers beyond the 19 that we currently have by the end of the decade.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/33\">Defence modernisation was raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, and the noble Lord, Lord West, and my noble friend Lord Sterling raised the deployment of HMS &#8220;Queen Elizabeth&#8221;. We are leading the way in driving both capability and modernisation in developing new ways of operating more effectively.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/34\">The noble Baronesses, Lady Smith and Lady Northover, asked about Armed Forces numbers. I can do no more than point to the response of my noble friend Lord Lancaster. I draw all noble Lords&#8217; attention to his contribution, because it underscored the importance of broader elements of the forces and paid a real tribute to our reservists, who play a phenomenal role in the defence of our interests, across the world. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, that the lessons  to be learned should reflect our important duties and obligations to all who serve in the Armed Forces. I noted the points that he raised very carefully and am sure that our colleagues in the MoD will reflect on them.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/35\">The noble Lord, Lord Davies of Brixton, raised important questions about national insurance contributions and their impact on veterans. We are working to maximise the employability of veterans and, as we said in our manifesto, we are investing specifically to ensure that the skills invested in our veterans are there for the medium and long term.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/36\">The noble Baroness, Lady Smith, rightly raised the issue, championed by the noble Lord, Lord Dannatt, of duty of care, as did other noble Lords. She will know that my noble friend Lady Goldie is aware of and personally engaged in this issue.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/37\">If noble Lords will indulge me, in the short time I have I will briefly turn to some other key points on development. I assure noble Lords that I will continue to work in a co-operative manner across your Lordships&#8217; House in ensuring that our development priorities are communicated effectively to the House, in working through the impact of the challenging decisions we have had to make and in ensuring that we continue to fulfil our mandate and obligations on the global stage. Through our presidency, we will revitalise G7 co-operation and are putting women and girls at the heart of our approach. Earlier this month, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary hosted G7 Foreign and Development Ministers face to face for the first time in over two years. We are looking for an integrated approach to foreign policy and international development. The G7 has agreed to tackle pressing geopolitical challenges including, as a number of noble Lords mentioned, the destabilising issue of Russia and particularly its role in Ukraine, as my noble friend Lord Risby pointed out.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/38\">The challenge of Covid and the response to it was raised by a number of noble Lords: the noble Baroness, Lady Sheehan, the noble Lord, Lord Boateng, and my noble friend Lady Neville-Rolfe, among others. We are engaging directly in WTO discussions on the intellectual property waiver proposal. Waiving intellectual property rights would not, as my noble friend Lady Neville-Rolfe said, be an effective action to boost vaccine manufacturing. That comes directly from some of the manufacturers. We support voluntary partnerships and licensing. As the Minister responsible for India, I know that the work we did to strengthen the contractual relationship between AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute was part and parcel of that process, prior to it being discussed at the World Trade Organization.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/39\">We have also invested heavily in the COVAX facility, which is a clear and right decision. With over &#163;0.5 billion of British investment, the COVAX facility was set up so that the most vulnerable countries around the world could access the vaccine, and that is now happening. As of <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-05-05\">5 May<\/phrase>, COVAX has shipped over 53 million Covid-19 vaccines to more than 120 countries. One of the key practical issues that we need to look at is the logistical challenge in-country, to ensure that, once the vaccines arrive, they can be distributed. That remains  a key focus. We are also working closely with other key partners and are delighted by the commitment shown by the United States.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/40\">To those who say that the UK is withdrawing, on the contrary&#8212;we believe in reforming international institutions but, as our increased contribution to the World Health Organization demonstrates, we stand firmly behind these multilateral organisations. Issues of sexual and reproductive health and rights were raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone. I assure her that while we have had to make some challenging decisions, such issues will remain very much at the heart of our approach. I have seen the benefit of what they have delivered and argued the point personally within the context of the UN Security Council. As the Prime Minister&#8217;s lead on PSVI, that will remain a key area of my focus. I look forward to working with the noble Baroness directly to see how we can continue to sustain a focus on this important area.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/41\">In my closing remarks, I assure noble Lords that we will retain our leadership on international development. My noble friend Lady Sugg has pushed me a number of times on clarity, transparency and our obligations. I say to her: patience is a virtue. We have committed to being transparent and will certainly do so. I will seek to be clearer than I have been in ensuring that the impact of the reductions we have had to make are translated.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/42\">I hope my noble friend will respect me for saying this, as will the noble Lord, Lord Purvis, among others who I know care passionately about this issue, as many noble Lords do. I assure them that in the reductions we have made, we have sought to sustain the core elements of the programme so that, at the appropriate time, we can scale up and retain the important equities that we have on the ground. That will continue to be our approach. On when we will return to the figure of 0.7%, as I have said before, we will seek to do that at the earliest opportunity. I assure my noble friend that we remain very much committed t, and totally respect our obligations under the Act and to Parliament.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/43\">We are promoting the G7 outcomes, protecting freedoms with the OSCE, chairing the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and celebrating 75 years of the United Nations. These reflect our strength whether that is through defence, development or diplomacy. We have now agreed trade deals with 67 countries, including one with the EU. We have announced a new comprehensive strategic partnership with India and, as I said earlier, thanks to our friends in the Asia-Pacific region, we are on track for ASEAN dialogue partner status later this year.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/44\">We have also won elections at an international level and, notwithstanding the Covid-19 challenges, we have upped our commitments on issues such as COVAX and girls&#8217; education. We look forward, as I am sure all noble Lords do, to hosting the COP 26 conference on climate change in November this year, alongside Italy. In this respect, we have also acted according to our words by putting &#163;11.6 billion into international climate finance and setting an ambitious 10-point green plan to reach net zero by 2050.<\/p><p pid=\"c666.0\/45\">The integrated review has sent a clear message that we are very much joined-up in our thinking and strategic in our approach. The review has also sent a strong message about what we stand for as a country: as an independent actor on the global stage, an active European country but with a truly global perspective. It is a commitment to be more proactive and adaptable; to be more dynamic; to engage with partners and work with civil societies and key Governments. We will call out abuses of human rights through our sanctions policies but also through working with key partners. Whether it is on health, climate or human rights, we will continue to play our central and pivotal role as global Britain on the world stage. It is a commitment of global Britain to work with our allies, and as a force for good. It is a commitment of global Britain that we will proudly take forward in the years ahead.<\/p><p class=\"italic\" pid=\"c666.0\/46\">Motion agreed nemine dissentiente, and it was ordered that the Address be presented to Her Majesty by the Lord Chamberlain.<\/p><p class=\"italic\" pid=\"c666.0\/47\">House adjourned at 7.29 pm.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c548.0\/1\">My Lords, I too congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Fullbrook, on her eloquent maiden speech, and look forward to future debates with her. In winding up this wide-ranging and challenging debate, I will concentrate on the proposals on justice, with some points on home affairs, although I will not try to add to what my noble friends Lord Paddick, Lady Bonham-Carter and Lord Clement-Jones said on culture and digital media, and their great importance to our well-being and economy.<\/p><p pid=\"c548.0\/2\">Summarising the philosophy of our response to the Government&#8217;s proposals, today&#8217;s speeches from these Benches have been marked by a commitment to security and safety through freedom, the rule of law and compassion. As a society, we are more secure and safer if we respond to crime with a strong emphasis on prevention, real support for victims and the reform and rehabilitation of offenders. We are better governed if the Government are accountable in the courts for unlawful action; we are protected from abuse of power by our right to protest&#8212;witness Myanmar, Hong Kong and many others.<\/p><p pid=\"c548.0\/3\">This approach is at the heart of the widely applauded Domestic Abuse Act, and the draft victims Bill, ably introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Wolfson of Tredegar, has the potential for a similar achievement. We have long campaigned for the victims&#8217; code to be given the full force of law, and we are heartened by the commitment to address violence against women and girls.<\/p><p pid=\"c548.0\/4\">However, we do not approach the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill with the same confidence. Hostile reaction to date has largely focused on the proposed restrictions of the right to protest. Even the language of the government briefing has sinister overtones:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c548.0\/5\">&#8220;Balancing the rights of protesters with the rights of others to go about their business unhindered, by enabling the police to better manage highly disruptive protests.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c548.0\/6\">The danger is that passivity and compliance may be encouraged by a disciplinarian Government at the expense of legitimate, if noisy, protest against injustice or abuse of power. The noble Baroness, Lady Chakrabarti, forcefully supported this position. At best, the Bill is an overreaction to occasional unacceptable behaviour by protestors, which is probably illegal at present anyway&#8212;a point also made by the noble Baroness, Lady Fox of Buckley.<\/p><p pid=\"c548.0\/7\">In the Bill, the Government&#8217;s consistent emphasis on the so-called tough crackdown, longer sentences and increased police powers never falters. But there is nothing in the Bill to improve our national performance in preventing crime or on reform, rehabilitation and reducing reoffending, except for a dubious commitment to a new form of secure schools, which is unsupported by solid evidence or the necessary resources. There is also nothing to address the de facto discrimination against black and ethnic minorities, particularly young men. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Gloucester made these points eloquently, and my noble friends Lord Dholakia and Lord Paddick, the noble Lords, Lord Hastings of Scarisbrick and Lord Carlile of Berriew, and the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, all spoke of the inhumanity and overcrowding of our prisons and the disgraceful state they are in. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, also spoke of the desecration of our probation services. A number of noble Lords mentioned the welcome commitment to a police covenant report on police welfare, including my noble friend Lady Harris, who spoke of police treatment centres.<\/p><p pid=\"c548.0\/8\">We wanted a commitment from the Government for a strong and wide-ranging anti-fraud measure to attack online fraud and scamming, as recommended by the Government&#8217;s economic crime plan in 2019. The noble Lord, Lord Vaux of Harrowden, concentrated on this point, and it was covered by my noble friend Lord McNally and the noble Viscount, Lord Goschen. As the noble Lord, Lord Vaux, said, the limited U-turn on this issue in the online safety Bill goes nowhere near tackling this scourge of contemporary life&#8212;an epidemic, as the noble Viscount called it.<\/p><p pid=\"c548.0\/9\">Turning to the judicial review Bill, the Queen&#8217;s Speech promises to<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c548.0\/10\">&#8220;strengthen and renew democracy and the constitution&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"c548.0\/11\">and promises legislation to<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c548.0\/12\">&#8220;restore the balance of power between the executive, legislature and the courts.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c548.0\/13\">However, the Bill now proposed is limited to introducing suspended quashing orders and to ending Cart JRs in which the High Court reviews Upper Tribunal decisions. I agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, that suspending quashing orders will sensibly allow time for government to correct irregularities before implementing decisions, rather than quashing them immediately. My original reaction to the proposal to reverse the Cart decision was sympathetic, but I now rather doubt that the Government&#8217;s evidence on this stands up, so I look forward to debating the issue further in due course.<\/p><p pid=\"c548.0\/14\">However, our greater concern, persuasively expressed by the noble and learned Lords, Lord Hope and Lord Woolf, my noble friends Lord Thomas of Gresford and Lord Beith and the noble Baroness, Lady Chakrabarti, is that the language of the Queen&#8217;s Speech heralds a far wider reform of judicial review. The noble Lord, Lord Faulks, and his distinguished panel carried out a thorough and principled review of administrative law and effectively found that, in general, our system does not need radical overhaul, as the noble Lord, Lord Faulks, confirmed today. An attack on JR would threaten the rule of law and would be an unacceptable political response to a mistaken criticism of alleged judicial overreach, largely fuelled by the Government&#8217;s reaction to the Miller decisions.<\/p><p pid=\"c548.0\/15\">On the proposed sovereign borders Bill, making asylum claims inadmissible for illegal entrants sounds, at first blush, justifiable. It is not. This proposal ignores the fact that many who run untold risks, sustain all manner of hardship and finally manage to find their way here, albeit illegally, have had no possible means of securing the visas that they would have required to enter legally. Without a workable and humane proposal for safe and legal methods of entry, as called for by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, this proposal would erect a barred gate against many who deserve our compassion and our welcome. We have a long tradition of offering sanctuary to the persecuted and to refugees. We are not talking only of justifiably outlawing people-smugglers but of making the grant of asylum dependent on authorised legal entry. On this issue, I strongly agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, the noble Lord, Lord Blunkett, and the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Moulsecoomb, whose passion on it I share.<\/p><p pid=\"c548.0\/16\">As we witness the horrifying rise in anti-Semitism here and abroad, we should remember that welcoming the oppressed demonstrates our civilisation and our compassion. By shutting our doors to the oppressed we side with their oppressors. I would add that, for all the elegance of his language and his clearly good intentions, we profoundly disagree with the approach of the noble Lord, Lord Green of Deddington, to immigration and changes in the ethnic make-up of our society, which we believe do not weaken this nation but enrich and enhance it, just as the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, described.<\/p><p pid=\"c548.0\/17\">The Government&#8217;s plans for reform of the Mental Health Act are welcome, particularly the proposals to reform the process of mental health detention, to deal more humanely with autistic people and to improve the management of offenders with mental disorders. This is all in line with concerns long expressed from all around this House.<\/p><p pid=\"c548.0\/18\">Finally, I add to what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Garnier, said last Wednesday on the subject of criminalising coercive and controlling behaviour by charlatan counsellors or so-called psychotherapists who peddle their services to take over the lives of troubled young people, implant false memories of abuse by parents and families during childhood and create a dependence on themselves, alienating these vulnerable young adults from their parents and families in a damaging cycle of coercive control over their lives. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Garnier, highlighted many years of parliamentary endeavour on this subject, thwarted not by principle but by the &#8220;wrong Bill&#8221; argument&#8212;an argument that we should abhor. We also want to see a professional register that would support genuine professionals and their status, and encourage potential clients to seek help only from properly registered professionals. This is, perhaps, a small issue, but it is one on which this House has a great contribution to make. The Government should be in no doubt that many, throughout the House, feel strongly on these issues. This will give rise to amendments to the proposed legislation, and will not go away.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a462.0\/1\">On the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s first point, just like I will listen to voters in parts of England, I hope that he will listen to the voters in Wales, where we won three of the four police and crime commissioners and a Labour Government achieved the best result in elections since the advent of devolution, showing that Labour in power actually works. [Interruption.] He scoffs at the voters of Wales. I think he should seriously look at the message that they are sending to him.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/2\">On the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s second point, on the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, Government Members know perfectly well that they could have had a Bill that found consensus across this House. Instead, they chose to introduce divisive elements on protest and on discrimination against Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities that made that impossible. He knows that, and Ministers know it too.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/3\">Indeed, there are measures in the Bill on death by dangerous driving, for example, championed by my hon. Friends the Members for Barnsley East (Stephanie Peacock), for Barnsley Central (Dan Jarvis), for St Helens South and Whiston (Ms Rimmer) and for Bradford South (Judith Cummins), who worked on a cross-party basis with the former Prime Minister, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Theresa May\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10426\">the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)<\/phrase>. There is the part of the Bill on positions of trust, where we extend the scope of protections against those who perpetrate sexual relationships with young people under 18. Again, that had a cross-party genesis, with my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Sarah Champion\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25168\">the Member for Rotherham (Sarah Champion)<\/phrase> working with <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Tracey Crouch\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24871\">the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch)<\/phrase>. That too could be widened, to include driving instructors and music tutors. I credit my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"John Spellar\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10558\">the Member for Warley (John Spellar)<\/phrase> for securing changes to the Disclosure and Barring Service.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/4\">There are some long overdue parts of the Bill that deal with disproportionality, such as the use of problem-solving courts, recognising remand of children as a last resort, and reform of the criminal records disclosure regime, but the reality is that those things go nowhere near far enough. I was challenged about what Labour would do. The Lammy review, which sets out 35 recommendations, has sat on the Government&#8217;s shelf since 2017. They need to implement it. [Interruption.] The Lord Chancellor knows very well that they are not implementing the 35 recommendations. I would be quite happy to go through all 35 with him.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/5\">On the Government&#8217;s proposed legislation on race and ethnic disparity, I am deeply concerned, since it now seems to be their position that structural racism does not even exist. With that view, we cannot trust this Government to bring forward measures so desperately needed to tackle structural racism. That lack of trust is shown in the way the Home Office has so badly mishandled the Windrush compensation scheme. [Interruption.] The Home Secretary shouts &#8220;Rubbish&#8221;, but I have spoken to the victims who have been treated so badly.  I have spoken to people who have waited years for payments, forced to fight back against insulting offers, and people whose family members have passed away before compensation was received.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/6\">Now, the Home Secretary says &#8220;Rubbish&#8221;; these are her statistics. She promised to speed up the process. On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-04-21\">21 April<\/phrase>, 1,417 cases were being processed. Five hundred of them had been ongoing for over a year, and others had been in the system for over two years. Those are the Home Secretary&#8217;s own statistics. That slow progress piles injustice upon injustice.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/7\">Let me come to the crackdown on protest. Where our existing laws are sufficient, it is wrong-headed and dangerous. The right to protest is a precious part of our democracy that should be treasured, not trashed. At the same time, the measures against unauthorised encampments would further discriminate against our Gypsy, Traveller and Roma communities, in breach of the Human Rights Act and of the Equality Act.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/8\">Another area in which the Government&#8217;s poor record is matched by their lack of ambition is addressing violence against women and girls, which remains a stain on our society. The tragic death of Sarah Everard drew attention in the starkest terms to the desperate need for change that so many of us have long been calling for. As a society, and as men in particular, we must do better by listening to the outpouring of powerful testimonies, but&#8212;more importantly&#8212;by acting. The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill was rightly exposed for the shameful way in which it overlooked reforms that people have been crying out for, and I pay tribute to all those who have spoken up so powerfully: my colleagues my hon. Friends the Members for Croydon Central and for Birmingham, Yardley (Jess Phillips) and my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"David Lammy\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10678\">the Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy)<\/phrase>, and all those across these Benches and the House who have said, &#8220;Enough is enough&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/9\">There is deep anger and frustration about the scale of the challenge and the glacial speed of action. We have had several strategies announced in the past by the Government, and in the Queen&#8217;s Speech we have had the announcement of the violence against women and girls strategy, but with no timescale or proposed action. Today, Labour is proposing action, and we published our proposals this morning: a rape survivors plan, with support needed from start to finish; cases of rape and serious sexual violence fast-tracked through the system and a Minister tasked with the responsibility of driving change through; tougher sentences for rape, stalking and domestic homicide, including reviewing sentences for all domestic abuse; and a new law on street harassment. We need to ensure that all police forces have specialist teams of rape and serious sexual assault officers in place to support victims and drive up conviction rates; to remove the legal barriers that prevent any victim of domestic abuse getting the help they need, such as barriers to legal aid and no recourse to public funds; and a victims Bill with the victim at the heart of the system, supported through the process and afterwards. Let us see no more strategies and limited pilot schemes: let us see the action that is long overdue.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/10\">On the counter-state threats Bill, the warnings for action could not have been clearer: citizens poisoned on our own streets, attempts to subvert our democracy, and London becoming a laundromat for dirty money. The Intelligence and Security Committee&#8217;s report on Russia could hardly have delivered a more damning indictment of deep, systemic failings in the Government&#8217;s  approach to the security threat posed by Russia, finding that the Government had &#8220;badly underestimated&#8221; the Russian threat and the response it required.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/11\">We thank our security services for the work they do, but they need more support. The Russia report concluded that previous changes in resourcing to counter Russian hostile state activity are not, or not only, due to a continuing escalation of the threat, but appear to be an indicator of &#8220;playing catch up&#8221;. We cannot keep playing catch-up, which is why we have long called for the recommendations of the Russia report to be implemented. It is why we have consistently criticised the actions of the Government of China against the Uyghur and on the security law in Hong Kong. We will look at this long-delayed legislation closely, and seek to work constructively to bring about the changes needed to guard against not just the threats of today, but the fast-emerging global threats to our democracy.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/12\">As we look at the UK&#8217;s role in the world, I want to turn to the new plan for immigration. I do not disagree that the asylum system is too slow: the reason for that is the Conservative party, which has run the immigration system for the past 11 years. The share of asylum applications that received an initial decision within six months fell from 87% in 2014 to 20% in 2019. That is the Conservative record, and we have seen an approach from Ministers that lacks both competence and compassion. There has been a huge surge in the number of dangerous crossings in small boats from France, but where is the comprehensive deal with France to deal with it? The Department for International Development, which was the very Department that addressed the causes of people being displaced from their homes in the first place, has been abolished. Safe routes such as the Dubs scheme have closed down; the Dubs scheme closed after just a few hundred children, when everyone expected it to help 3,000. That is not the way to tackle the issue or the heinous crime of people trafficking.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/13\">At the same time, we have seen people housed in overcrowded accommodation that represented a fundamental failure of leadership and planning at the Home Office, leading to a dangerous covid outbreak and putting vulnerable people, staff and neighbouring communities at risk.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/14\">From what we have seen of the plans so far, they will do next to nothing to stop people making crossings. They risk withdrawing support from vulnerable people, including victims of human trafficking. Nor do this Government show any sign of delivering the international agreements they require for their measures. Yet again, Conservative failure will be hard-wired into the system.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/15\">On the issue of borders, the lax measures against covid have been frankly negligent. The Government were late to introduce formal quarantining, they failed to have an effective home quarantining system, and they were late to introduce border testing and hotel quarantining &#8212;and even then, only 1% of arrivals actually stayed in hotels.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/16\">Like everyone across the House, I am deeply worried by the sharp increase in the covid variant cases in Bolton, Blackburn, Darwen and other parts of the country. Cases have almost doubled in the past four days. If there is one thing we have learned from this awful virus, it is its ability to spread rapidly.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/17\">We should never have been in this position. We have been warning the Government for months of the reckless risks they have been taking with their half-baked border  measures. [Interruption.] The Home Secretary shakes her head, but she has been on video making clear her disagreement with the Government&#8217;s approach to the borders. We called a vote in this House in February on comprehensive hotel quarantining, but the Conservative party refused to back our plans, which would have given us the best chance of stopping strains reaching the UK. Instead, the variants first discovered in India, Brazil and South Africa have all reached the UK, with outbreaks occurring.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/18\">India was added to the red list only after cases had already been detected in the UK back in February. By <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-04-05\">5 April<\/phrase>, India was reporting more than 100,000 new covid cases a day, and neighbouring countries Pakistan and Bangladesh were added to the red list on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-04-09\">9 April<\/phrase>. As cases rocketed in India, No. 10 kept saying that the planned visit by the Prime Minister, which was scheduled for <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-04-25\">25 April<\/phrase>, would go ahead. It was not until <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-04-19\">19 April<\/phrase> that No. 10 cancelled the trip to India&#8212;the same day that the Health Secretary announced that India would be added to the red list. That measure came into force on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-04-23\">23 April<\/phrase>.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/19\">It has been reported that during that time of dither and delay, more than 20,000 travellers from India entered the country. The Prime Minister has serious questions to answer about the suggestions that he delayed adding India to the red list because of the planned visit.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/20\">Ministers must learn the lessons, act more cautiously now on the reopening of international travel, and make their border protections effective. Yet again, it is the same theme: Ministers talk tough but fail to take action to keep people safe. Sadly, that is the story of this Government: tough rhetoric; little effective action. At the same time, violence has been on the rise, affecting all our communities; neighbourhood policing has been cut to the bone; our democracy has been left vulnerable to hostile state action; and we have an immigration system devoid of compassion and competence.<\/p><p pid=\"a462.0\/21\">What we needed was a bold vision for security in our country and safety on our streets. Instead, the legislative agenda set out in this Queen&#8217;s Speech merely repeats a pattern of failure, and it is the British people who are left to pay the price.<\/p>",

In addition, it progressed domestic reforms to strengthen the union; increase productivity and protect citizens; and delivered the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union.<\/p><p pid=\"a2413.3\/2\">My Government acted to protect the health and safety of the nation. Legislation was passed to ensure the NHS could continue to provide care for all those in need of it and that essential public services, such as the courts and prisons, could continue.<\/p><p pid=\"a2413.3\/3\">My Government took action to support jobs, businesses and livelihoods, with over &#163;350 billion of financial support, helping to protect over 11 million jobs. To support businesses, my Government provided affordable loans, business rates relief and modernised insolvency laws. To facilitate businesses operating under social distancing restrictions, laws were passed to increase flexibilities in planning and licensing decisions. My Government took action to support the industries most heavily affected by the pandemic, including tourism, culture and leisure, and took steps to repair the public finances once economic recovery is secure.<\/p><p pid=\"a2413.3\/4\">My Government protected the most vulnerable by supporting those who were shielding during the pandemic, placing rough sleepers in emergency accommodation and increasing funding for essential public services.<\/p><p pid=\"a2413.3\/5\">My Government worked with the devolved Governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to ensure all citizens across the United Kingdom shared in the benefits of scientific advances in testing, medicines and vaccines, as well as benefiting from the logistical expertise of our gallant Armed Forces.<\/p><p pid=\"a2413.3\/6\">My Government built one of Europe&#8217;s largest testing regimes, supporting an evidence-based roadmap to ease restrictions and making it safe to visit loved ones, including in care homes, at the earliest opportunity.<\/p><p pid=\"a2413.3\/7\">My Government supported research by British scientists to develop one of the world&#8217;s most effective vaccines. Following the first deployment of a clinically authorised Covid-19 vaccine anywhere in the world, my Government embarked on one of the fastest vaccination programmes. My Ministers led international efforts to ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines for every country in the world.<\/p><p pid=\"a2413.3\/8\">Legislation was passed to ensure the United Kingdom&#8217;s smooth exit from the European Union and the end of the transition period. A comprehensive trade and co-operation agreement was negotiated with the European Union, alongside continuity trade agreements with 67 countries.<\/p><p pid=\"a2413.3\/9\">Legislation passed in this Session will make the most of the opportunities that being an independent nation brings for the entire United Kingdom. A points-based immigration system was introduced, ending free movement while enabling the United Kingdom to welcome skilled workers from across the world. Hundreds of powers were returned to the devolved Governments following the end of the transition period. Laws were enacted to enable the funding of projects which further the prosperity of all parts of the United Kingdom through shared economic growth, enhanced infrastructure and common cultural values. Legislation was passed  to ensure the union continues to provide an effective market for businesses, regardless of where in the United Kingdom they buy from or sell to.<\/p><p pid=\"a2413.3\/10\">My Government pursued an extensive programme of domestic reform. Alongside increased investment in schools and putting more police on the streets, my Government prioritised the safety and health of the nation while pursuing economic growth and increasing opportunity across the United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"a2413.3\/11\">My Ministers further supported the NHS by enshrining in law for the first time a multiyear funding settlement. Legislation was passed to ensure faster and safer access for patients to innovative medicines.<\/p><p pid=\"a2413.3\/12\">My Government prioritised investment in infrastructure and world-leading scientific research and skills. To unleash productivity and improve daily life for communities across the country, my Ministers brought forward proposals to transform rail, road, bus and aviation infrastructure and modernise the planning system. Legislation was passed to accelerate the delivery of gigabit-capable broadband.<\/p><p pid=\"a2413.3\/13\">Legislation was passed to ensure the United Kingdom&#8217;s financial services sector remains open and internationally competitive. Pension laws were reformed to make it easier for people to save for later life.<\/p><p pid=\"a2413.3\/14\">The security of the nation and its citizens remains of the highest importance to my Government. New powers to protect the United Kingdom from emerging economic and cyber threats were introduced. New legislation passed in this Session will ensure the security services have the powers they need to keep citizens safe.<\/p><p pid=\"a2413.3\/15\">To tackle violence against women and girls, landmark laws were passed to address domestic abuse, including recognising coercive control and non-fatal strangulation for the crimes that they are. New measures were introduced to increase prison sentences for the most serious crimes, including terrorism, and to support victims and their families.<\/p><p pid=\"a2413.3\/16\">To keep residents safe in their homes, steps were taken to apply building safety regulations to communal areas and establish a new regulator to keep buildings safe.<\/p><p pid=\"a2413.3\/17\">My Ministers have pursued policies to protect the environment for future generations, including by improving the sustainability of agricultural and fishing practices. Proposals were published to reform the energy sector and deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  My Government prioritised creating green jobs, including plans to quadruple offshore wind generation. My Ministers continued to lead the global effort against climate change, making preparations to host the COP 26 summit in Glasgow. Funding was increased for developing countries to respond to the impacts of climate change.<\/p><p pid=\"a2413.3\/18\">Legislation was passed to ensure that parliamentary boundaries are equally sized and up to date. Draft legislation was published to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.<\/p><p pid=\"a2413.3\/19\">My Ministers announced plans to invest over &#163;24 billion in our gallant Armed Forces over the next four years. Legislation to strengthen the Armed Forces covenant was introduced in Parliament.

For greater accuracy I have obtained a copy, and also directed that the terms of the Speech be printed in the Journal of this House. Copies are being made available in the Vote Office.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/2\">The Speech was as follows:<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/3\">My Lords and Members of the House of Commons<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/4\">In the midst of a global pandemic, my Government&#8217;s legislative programme responded to the needs of the United Kingdom, making sure that public services and businesses had the support they needed. In addition, it progressed domestic reforms to strengthen the union; increase productivity and protect citizens; and delivered the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/5\">My Government acted to protect the health and safety of the nation. Legislation was passed to ensure the NHS could continue to provide care for all those in need of it and that essential public services, such as the courts and prisons, could continue.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/6\">My Government took action to support jobs, businesses and livelihoods, with over &#163;350 billion of financial support, helping to protect over 11 million jobs. To support businesses, my Government provided affordable loans, business rates relief and modernised insolvency laws. To facilitate businesses operating under social distancing restrictions, laws were passed to increase flexibilities in planning and licensing decisions. My Government took action to support the industries most heavily affected by the pandemic, including tourism, culture and leisure and took steps to repair the public finances once economic recovery is secure.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/7\">My Government protected the most vulnerable by supporting those who were shielding during the pandemic, placing rough sleepers in emergency accommodation and increasing funding for essential public services.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/8\">My Government worked with the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to ensure all citizens across the United Kingdom shared in the benefits of scientific advances in testing, medicines and vaccines, as well as benefiting from the logistical expertise of our gallant Armed Forces.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/9\">My Government built one of Europe&#8217;s largest testing regimes, supporting an evidence-based roadmap to ease restrictions and making it safe to visit loved ones, including in care homes, at the earliest opportunity.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/10\">My Government supported research by British scientists to develop one of the world&#8217;s most effective vaccines. Following the first deployment of a clinically authorised covid-19 vaccine anywhere in the world, my Government embarked on one of the fastest vaccination programmes. My Ministers led international efforts to ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines for every country in the world.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/11\">Legislation was passed to ensure the United Kingdom&#8217;s smooth exit from the European Union and the end of the transition period. A comprehensive Trade and Cooperation Agreement was negotiated with the European Union, alongside continuity trade agreements with 67 countries.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/12\">Legislation passed in this session will make the most of the opportunities that being an independent nation brings for the entire United Kingdom. A points-based immigration  system was introduced, ending free movement whilst enabling the United Kingdom to welcome skilled workers from across the world. Hundreds of powers were returned to the devolved governments following the end of the transition period. Laws were enacted to enable the funding of projects which further the prosperity of all parts of the United Kingdom through shared economic growth, enhanced infrastructure and common cultural values. Legislation was passed to ensure the union continues to provide an effective market for businesses, regardless of where in the United Kingdom they buy from or sell to.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/13\">My Government pursued an extensive programme of domestic reform. Alongside increased investment in schools and putting more police on the streets, my Government prioritised the safety and health of the nation whilst pursuing economic growth and increasing opportunity across the whole United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/14\">My Ministers further supported the NHS by enshrining in law for the first time a multi-year funding settlement. Legislation was passed to ensure faster and safer access for patients to innovative medicines.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/15\">My Government prioritised investment in infrastructure and world-leading scientific research and skills. To unleash productivity and improve daily life for communities across the country, my Ministers brought forward proposals to transform rail, road, bus and aviation infrastructure and modernise the planning system. Legislation was passed to accelerate the delivery of gigabit capable broadband.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/16\">Legislation was passed to ensure the United Kingdom&#8217;s financial services sector remains open and internationally competitive. Pension laws were reformed to make it easier for people to save for later life.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/17\">The security of the nation and its citizens remains of the highest importance to my Government. New powers to protect the United Kingdom from emerging economic and cyber threats were introduced. New legislation passed in this session will ensure the security services have the powers they need to keep citizens safe.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/18\">To tackle violence against women and girls, landmark laws were passed to address domestic abuse, including recognising coercive control and non-fatal strangulation for the crimes that they are. New measures were introduced to increase prison sentences for the most serious crimes, including terrorism, and to support victims and their families.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/19\">To keep residents safe in their homes, steps were taken to apply building safety regulations to communal areas and establish a new regulator to keep buildings safe.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/20\">My Ministers have pursued policies to protect the environment for future generations, including by improving the sustainability of agricultural and fishing practices. Proposals were published to reform the energy sector and deliver net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. My Government prioritised creating green jobs, including plans to quadruple offshore wind generation. My Ministers continued to lead the global effort against climate change, making preparations to host the COP26 Summit in Glasgow. Funding was increased for developing countries to respond to the impacts of climate change.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/21\">Legislation was passed to ensure that Parliamentary boundaries are equally sized and up to date. Draft legislation was published to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/22\">My Ministers announced plans to invest over &#163;24 billion in our gallant Armed Forces over the next four years. Legislation to strengthen the Armed Forces Covenant was introduced into Parliament. Measures to tackle vexatious claims made against veterans were passed into law.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/23\">My Government published a comprehensive review of its defence, foreign and national security policies and continued to promote freedom of speech, human rights and the rule of law. A new sanctions regime targeted human rights violators and abusers, including those responsible for human rights violations in Xinjiang. A new visa will enable eligible citizens of Hong Kong to live, work and make their home in the United Kingdom.<\/p><p pid=\"a521.1\/24\">My Government worked closely with international partners to tackle the global challenges presented by the pandemic, including by delivering over 300 aid programmes and supporting girls at risk of being excluded from education.

They are also regions of the world where we are the largest European investor, and we need them for our balance of payments.<\/p><p pid=\"b2339.2\/2\">Twenty-five years ago in January, I was the battle group commander for a battle group of 19 ships which: deployed from the UK and went out through the Mediterranean; worked in the Gulf; flew the first  operations in the Iraqi no-fly zone&#8212;only our fighters were able to do it, from the carrier; operated in the Indian Ocean; went to Singapore for a five-power defence arrangement; carried out an amphibious assault of over 2,000 men in Brunei; went through the South China Sea, Japan, Korea and numerous other countries; was there for the Hong Kong withdrawal; visited Australia; and returned home.<\/p><p pid=\"b2339.2\/3\">What came over to me then was that the Foreign Office was so desperately pleased with everything that was done in diplomatic terms and what it meant for UK Ltd. I signed &#163;2.5 billion-worth of defence and other deals&#8212;not just defence contracts&#8212;and we were able to do humanitarian things in various parts of the world. The ability of a group to do these things is absolutely there. Just on the intelligence side of life, it was clear to us that the Chinese were very worried when they saw the capabilities of this group that we could deploy 8,000 miles away and carry out an amphibious assault. It makes their islands look a bit dodgy and they have to think about it. When I operated with 22 ships in the North Atlantic the year before, it showed the flexibility; these ships can get everywhere, and the Russians were very worried because they could never find us.<\/p><p pid=\"b2339.2\/4\">This is a very powerful and useful group, and well done to the Government for doing it. But I also say beware, because when I sailed from the UK in January it was a Conservative Government; when I returned in August it was a Labour Government, and my noble friend Lord Robertson of Port Ellen was the Minister of Defence, who was so taken by the capability of this force that in his very good strategic defence review he decided we needed big carriers. I am delighted we got them, because now we have them today doing this.<\/p><p pid=\"b2339.2\/5\">My question may be only a petty one. There is no doubt that this shipbuilding strategy sounds very good, but I am scarred by being told I am going to get ships but never standing on their quarterdeck. In each of the big deployments I did as a carrier battle group commander, I had two solid support ships with me. I notice that only one is going out to the Far East, and it is over 40 years old&#8212;RFA &#8220;Fort Victoria&#8221;. I ask the Minister: when will we actually put in the order for the three fleet solid support ships we need, and will they be built in this country? It is no good these things being put off. It is like with the Type 26s: we need the orders, and we need to start building.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a145.0\/1\">It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Ms Ghani. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Selaine Saxby\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25880\">the Member for North Devon (Selaine Saxby)<\/phrase> on securing this timely debate during Great British Beef Week. I draw attention to my declaration in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests, as one of the few practising farmers in the House.<\/p><p pid=\"a145.0\/2\">The Cotswolds has one of the most sensitive landscapes in the country and I have always proudly championed British agriculture. As a farmer who grew up on my mother&#8217;s dairy farm, I know from first-hand experience how the UK produces some of the highest quality food produce of anywhere in the world, with exceptional animal welfare and environmental standards.<\/p><p pid=\"a145.0\/3\">As Britain secures new trade deals, we have the opportunity to promote that high-quality meat and dairy produce across the world, produced by our innovative, environmentally friendly farmers. After 40 years of the European Union&#8217;s common agricultural policy, we can now pursue new trading relationships. It is an amazing opportunity to shape the future of our farming, promote our interests and meet the needs and ambitions of British consumers in the 21st century.<\/p><p pid=\"a145.0\/4\">In 2020, meat and dairy products combined accounted for 2.2% of UK goods exports and 3.1% of all UK goods imports. The current trade deficit is found in all categories, apart from mutton and lamb, which has a trade surplus of &#163;0.1 billion. We now import roughly 50% of all that we eat, down from 65% when I was a  student. The UK is about 85% self-sufficient in dairy production and beef, but 98% self-sufficient when it comes to lamb. We need to work to a point where it is not just lamb that is in surplus, but where we are near self-sufficient in many more sectors.<\/p><p pid=\"a145.0\/5\">What is the difference between our lamb and beef sectors? It could partly be better marketing of beef, which is usually a more expensive option in the supermarket. The deficit is something we want to change with our new trading arrangements. Beef exports from the UK last year came to &#163;382 million, with growing markets in Hong Kong, Singapore, Peru and Canada. There is also growing demand in China for British pork, and in France for high-quality lamb produced in the Cotswolds.<\/p><p pid=\"a145.0\/6\">British agriculture needs to increase and diversify its exports as much as it can in new international markets, after heavily relying on Europe. There is no reason why British food manufacturers cannot be innovative enough to create a wider range of products using British produce. That is especially the case for dairy-based products that are heavily imported, such as yoghurt and prepared desserts. That is unnecessary when we have such a strong dairy sector.<\/p><p pid=\"a145.0\/7\">I urge farmers to take advantage of growing global markets. The Department for International Trade is launching a new mentoring programme, providing expert advice on trading internationally. Farmers in the UK are leading the world in finding innovative farming methods to farm in climate-change friendly ways, with the NFU pledging an ambitious net zero target by 2040.<\/p><p pid=\"a145.0\/8\">The UK beef industry is one of the most sustainable in the world, with an extensive grass-based grazing system&#8212;not a cause of deforestation as in other countries, as my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Neil Parish\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/24779\">the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Neil Parish)<\/phrase> said. The Committee on Climate Change found that the UK beef industry emits around half the greenhouse gases compared with the global average.<\/p><p pid=\"a145.0\/9\">As my hon. Friend the Member for North Devon said, there are 278 million dairy cows worldwide. If they were all managed as efficiently as UK dairy cows are, we could shrink that number to 76 million and still produce the same amount of milk throughout the world. Around 70% of the British herd is on grass, and 65% of UK farmland produces some of the most productive grass in the world. That protects the character and identity of the countryside and generates an important income for rural communities. In the Cotswolds, which I have the privilege to represent, the distinctive, attractive landscape would not be the same without the raising of livestock, including the production of high-quality lamb, much of which could be exported.<\/p><p pid=\"a145.0\/10\">Here in the UK, there is nothing better for the environmentally-conscious consumer who wants a balanced diet than to buy British. Not only does buying fresh local produce reduce greenhouse emissions from transporting produce; in addition the produce will be sourced from farms with sustainability at the heart of their practices. It is good to see some retailers increasingly championing UK products. I know, because I did a lot of the shopping during the lockdown, that Waitrose and Aldi have led the way on supporting British farmers throughout the pandemic. I hope that other supermarket chains will be encouraged to follow their example.<\/p><p pid=\"a145.0\/11\">In conclusion, farmers can now set their ambitions well beyond the UK into exciting new markets. As they expand, they will have our full support in doing so.<\/p>",

The Government is committed to ensuring that the UK remains at the global cutting edge of technology and innovation in financial services. Creating the conditions needed for our Fintech businesses to grow and compete, both here and abroad, is central to delivering on this ambition. This is why, at Budget 2020, I asked Ron Kalifa OBE to carry out an independent review of the UK Fintech sector.<\/p><p>The Kalifa Review of UK Fintech (the Review) <strong>[1] <\/strong> was published on 26 February 2021. It made a number of recommendations aimed at Government, regulators, and industry across five areas: Policy and Regulation, Skills and Talent, Investment, International Attractiveness and Competitiveness, and National Connectivity. At publication, HM Treasury welcomed the Review and highlighted key recommendations including:<\/p><ul><li>A Centre for Finance, Innovation, and Technology to strengthen national coordination across the Fintech ecosystem to boost growth<\/li><li>A regulatory &#8216;scalebox&#8217; to provide additional support to growth stage Fintechs<\/li><li>Amendments to UK listings rules to make the UK a more attractive location for Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)<\/li><li>Improvements to tech visas to attract global talent and boost the Fintech workforce<\/li><\/ul><p> <\/p><p>Here we have set out the actions that Government and regulators are taking in response to the Review&#8217;s recommendations.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Centre for Finance, Innovation and Technology<\/strong><\/p><p>The Government recognises the potential for a private-sector-led Centre for Finance, Innovation and Technology (CFIT) as an accelerator for Fintech sector growth. It can achieve this through research, thought leadership, and working with regional Fintech hubs and national Fintech bodies to identify and address barriers to growth to the benefit of the sector across the whole of the UK. I have confirmed that the Government supports the creation of this Centre and that it will work closely with the Fintech community to make it a reality.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Regulatory Scalebox<\/strong><\/p><p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has also welcomed the Kalifa Review and has set out steps it will be taking to deliver against the Review&#8217;s idea for a &#8216;regulatory scalebox&#8217;, by<\/p><p>enhancing its existing regulatory toolkit. These actions include:<\/p><ul><li>Launching &#8216;Always Open&#8217; to make the Regulatory Sandbox available on a rolling basis<\/li><li>Clarifying the scope of qualifying propositions for the Regulatory Sandbox to ensure as many firms as possible are able to access support<\/li><li>Launching, in conjunction with the City of London Corporation, the second phase of the Digital Sandbox pilot, inviting applications to test proof of concepts to solve sustainability and climate change financial challenges<\/li><li>Considering how to provide a &#8216;one-stop-shop&#8217; for growth-stage firms to dock in and easily navigate what sources of FCA support are available to them<\/li><li>Working with industry over coming months to identify further solutions for supporting firms manage the journey to scale<\/li><\/ul><p> <\/p><p>The FCA has also announced plans to create a regulatory &#8216;nursery&#8217; for enhanced oversight of newly authorised firms, enabling an opportunity for additional support as firms become used to the requirements of regulatory compliance.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Listings regime <\/strong><\/p><p>The Lord Hill Listings Review, which was published at Budget 2021, made recommendations to boost the UK as a destination for IPOs and optimise the capital raising process on UK markets, addresses a number of the Kalifa Review&#8217;s recommendations for attracting more Fintech listings to the UK. The Government set out details of its response to Lord Hill&#8217;s Review in a Written Ministerial Statement on 19 April (HCWS919). In parallel, the FCA plans to consult on issues raised by the Kalifa Review including reducing the minimum &#8216;free float&#8217; a company must have when it lists, and whether premium listed companies can have dual share class structures.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Scale-up visa<\/strong><\/p><p>The Government demonstrated its support for attracting international talent to the UK at Budget 2021 by announcing creation of a &#8216;scale-up visa stream&#8217;. The new stream will be created within a new elite points-based route that will allow employees with a job offer at the required skills level from a recognised UK scale up, including Fintechs, to qualify for a fast-track visa, without the need for sponsorship or third-party endorsement. The Government will set out further details by July and the new route will be implemented by March 2022.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>International competitiveness <\/strong><\/p><p>The Department for International Trade (DIT) has announced it will create two new Fintech initiatives in response to the Review. The first is a new Fintech cohort within DIT&#8217;s Export Academy initiative. This will provide bespoke, 1-2-1 advice to eligible UK Fintechs who are ready to scale into key markets such as North America, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Tailored advice will cover topics such as legal, tax, regulation, accounting, and market entry matters, all of which will support the international expansion ambitions of Fintechs on the programme. This is in addition to the wide range of existing DIT export support services currently available for UK businesses. DIT will also establish a Fintech Champions scheme, comprising of leading UK Fintech advocates who are successfully exporting. DIT Fintech Champions will fly the flag for UK Fintech overseas and support the next generation of UK Fintechs in their growth journeys through mentoring and peer to peer learning. Both initiatives will enhance UK Fintech overseas, further elevating the UK&#8217;s status as a world leading Fintech Hub.<\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Regulation for digital finance <\/strong><\/p><p>The Review also made recommendations more broadly for the Government to develop a regulatory framework for digitalisation and emerging technology in financial services. The Government is taking forward a number of initiatives in these areas:<\/p><p>Along with the Bank of England, HM Treasury has launched a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Taskforce to coordinate the exploration of a potential UK CBDC &#8211; the Government and the Bank of England have not yet made a decision on whether to introduce a CBDC in the UK. A CBDC would be a new form of money that would exist alongside cash and bank deposits, rather than replacing them; the Government recognises that cash remains important to millions of people across the UK, and has committed to legislating to protect access to cash.<\/p><p>HM Treasury and the Bank of England are launching a CBDC Engagement Forum to gather strategic input on all non-technology aspects of CBDC.<\/p><p>The Bank of England is also launching a CBDC Technology Forum to gather input on all technology aspects of CBDC.<\/p><p>The Bank of England has launched a new account type that will allow access to central bank money by innovative financial market infrastructure providers to allow them to provide enhanced wholesale payment and settlement.<\/p><p>The Government has announced a financial market infrastructure (FMI) sandbox for firms exploring how to use technologies, such as distributed ledger technology (DLT), to innovate in the settlement of financial securities. This regime will aim to support firms, which are developing this new technology, with a more flexible and tailored approach to meeting requirements in current legislation, whilst appropriately balancing any risks to financial stability, market integrity and consumer protection. This new regime will be inspired by the FCA&#8217;s sandbox and HM Treasury will work together with the Bank of England and the FCA to deliver this.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In 2020 the Government&#8239;committed to creating a framework of standards, governance, and legislation to&#8239;enable a UK Digital Identity market. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS) published a draft Trust Framework for consultation in February this year which&#8239;sets out the Government&#8217;s vision for the rules governing the future use of&#8239;Digital&#8239;Identities. A next iteration is expected to be published this summer.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy is taking forward work on Smart Data and has committed to bringing forward legislation to better enable data-sharing across-sectors, including Open Finance. The FCA published a Call for Input on Open Finance in 2019 and published a Feedback Statement in March this year. This set out that the FCA will work closely with the Government as it takes forward the work on legislation as well as assessing the regulatory framework that would be needed to support Open Finance.<\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>Tax<\/strong><\/p><p>The Review also highlighted the benefits of tax incentive schemes in supporting Fintech growth and at Budget 2021 the Government announced steps it is taking to ensure the schemes work as efficiently as possible, including:<\/p><p> <\/p><ul><li>A Call for Evidence on the Enterprise Management Incentive scheme to seek views on whether the scheme is meeting its objectives, and examine whether more companies should be able to access the scheme<\/li><li>A review of R&amp;D tax reliefs which follows the consultation last year on expanding the qualifying expenditures to include cloud computing and data<\/li><\/ul><p> <\/p><p>The Kalifa Review also makes various recommendations that Government considers industry is best placed to take forward and I am grateful to Ron Kalifa for bringing these to my attention.<\/p><p>I would like to conclude by thanking Ron Kalifa and his team for their exceptional work in producing this seminal Review. Ron has succeeded in producing insightful analysis, and garnering widespread support from industry for a suite of proposals that keep us on track for the continued success of UK Fintech.<\/p><p>I look forward to taking forward the steps I have outlined today.<\/p><p>[1]https:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/978396\/KalifaReviewofUKFintech01.pdf<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"d2035.0\/1\">My Lords, I begin by congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Godson, on his excellent maiden speech, a convention I am also happy to follow. I really do look forward to hearing more of his contributions in these debates, particularly on international matters.<\/p><p pid=\"d2035.0\/2\">The review is welcome but, for it to be worth the paper it is written on, the Government need to end the  contradictions and inconsistencies that have undermined our role on the world stage. In the past year, we have shown ourselves to be a compassionate nation, built on community solidarity and co-operation to bring our country through this pandemic&#8212;values that the Government should reflect in their foreign policy.<\/p><p pid=\"d2035.0\/3\">Being a force for good in the world means always taking a stand against injustices, human rights abuses and suffering, even when it is inconvenient to do so. Here, I also pay tribute to my noble friend Frank Judd. If he had been here today, he would have been making these points most powerfully. He was a man of principle and a good man.<\/p><p pid=\"d2035.0\/4\">Being a force for good in the world also means putting forward a vision for a more secure and prosperous future, delivering on the UN&#8217;s global goals and fulfilling our commitment to the world&#8217;s poorest and most vulnerable people. I say to the noble Lord, Lord McDonald: a common strategy does not require a big super-department&#8212;certainly, a strategy involving diplomacy, defence and development does not need a big department. Rather, it needs a commitment to work together across Whitehall. In respect of our position of shadow Secretary of State for International Development, one of the many reasons the excellent Preet Gill is in the shadow Cabinet is that she will champion, and is championing, the sustainable development goals&#8212;something that I think is missing from our Government at the moment.<\/p><p pid=\"d2035.0\/5\">One of the issues that has been a theme throughout this debate is the disconnect between the Government&#8217;s words and their actions. How can we be the champion of human rights while selling arms to Saudi Arabia, which has contributed to creating the world&#8217;s most desperate humanitarian situation? How can we aspire to be a world leader in international development while breaking our legal commitment to 0.7%?<\/p><p pid=\"d2035.0\/6\">To maintain our enormous influence on the world stage and be a moral force for good, we must be consistent in our approach. That means once again becoming a champion of the rule of law. The UN is almost alone in its popularity as a global institution&#8212;this is based on its track record of promising and providing stability and progress. As the noble Lord, Lord Ahmad, said in his introduction, we should take pride in our role as a founder and use our influence to put our principles into practice.<\/p><p pid=\"d2035.0\/7\">We must also stand unwavering in our support for NATO and strengthen our bond with our closest security allies. As my noble friends Lord Reid and Lord Browne and other noble Lords have made clear, in increasing the number of nuclear warheads the Government are not only undermining the non-proliferation treaty but recklessly out of step with our NATO partners. The Opposition are fully committed to the renewal of Trident to deter the most extreme threats to our national security, but we must also use our position as a nuclear power to support multilateral controls on these weapons.<\/p><p pid=\"d2035.0\/8\">As the review acknowledges, we will always be strongest when we work in tandem with our closest partners, including on our international obligations, but there is no question that our position as a bridge between Europe and the United States has been put under strain over the past decade. Together, the United  Kingdom, the United States and Europe can provide an unrivalled united front for the values that we share. Beyond the US and Europe, we must also deepen our co-operation with other Five Eyes allies and look to emerging powers that share our world view.<\/p><p pid=\"d2035.0\/9\">This includes some in the Indo-Pacific, particularly fellow democracies, but this will require more than warm words, and the Government&#8217;s plans seem rather thin on detail. Do the Government see this as a relationship based on security, regional trade or values? Where are the resources to back up this proposal? Will the Government request partner status at ASEAN? Do they intend to work within existing structures only?<\/p><p pid=\"d2035.0\/10\">We must strengthen our ties with civil society too, and there is little of substance on this in the review. Women&#8217;s organisations, charities, faith groups, trade unions and other organised communities have all demonstrated that their role in geopolitics is indispensable. When nations fail in their most important task of providing safety, security and freedom for their people, it is always civil society that leaps first to their defence.<\/p><p pid=\"d2035.0\/11\">By breaking legislation and a manifesto commitment to spend 0.7% of GNI on ODA, the aid budget weakens our credibility, as we have heard in this debate. It will strip life-saving support from millions of people. I emphasise that maintaining 0.7% would not have avoided cuts&#8212;it would still have resulted in cuts to ODA&#8212;but it would have helped to maintain the order of priorities. That is where this review and the Government have got it wrong. When will the Government come to Parliament, present the change to legislation and put it to a vote?<\/p><p pid=\"d2035.0\/12\">Our commitment to the world&#8217;s poorest and most vulnerable also means spending on the right aid projects. That means supporting multipliers, such as nutrition, clean water and education, which have myriad development benefits. Unfortunately, today&#8217;s announcement has shown that the Government are cutting these exact schemes.<\/p><p pid=\"d2035.0\/13\">As we heard in the debate, analysis by Save the Children suggests that spending on education for girls&#8212;a government priority&#8212;would reduce by 25% compared with 2019-20 levels. The charity also estimated that spending on humanitarian preparedness and response would be cut by 44%. As the noble Lord, Lord Purvis, said, on Tuesday the FCDO Yemen development director told the Commons IDC that the decision to cut foreign aid to Yemen by more than 50% was made without any assessment of the impact on women, those with disabilities or internally displaced people. We have to assume that these cuts are being made with no coherent strategy or clear understanding of their impact.<\/p><p pid=\"d2035.0\/14\">I am pleased to see that the integrated review confirmed that a development Command Paper will soon be published, but there seems to be no timeline for when this will appear. Can the Minister confirm when the international development paper will be published?<\/p><p pid=\"d2035.0\/15\">As my noble friend Lord McConnell said, the cuts to ODA will make the world a more unpredictable and insecure place. Notwithstanding the moral and humanitarian case to alleviate poverty, this continued injustice will often manifest itself in national, regional and global threats if not addressed. Inequality can be one of the biggest drivers of insecurity.<\/p><p pid=\"d2035.0\/16\">Despite the review confirming that Russia poses the greatest threat to our security, the Government still have not fully implemented any of the Russia report&#8217;s recommendations. I repeat the question I put to the noble Lord, Lord Ahmad, earlier: can the Minister explain the Government&#8217;s failure to implement any of the Russia report&#8217;s recommendations? After all, it is 18 months since the report was completed and more than three years since the chemical weapons attack in Salisbury.<\/p><p pid=\"d2035.0\/17\">The Government&#8217;s inconsistency towards Russia must end, and the same can be said for China. The integrated review warns that China<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"d2035.0\/18\">&#8220;presents the biggest state-based threat to the UK&#8217;s economic security&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"d2035.0\/19\">yet the Government have refused a complete audit of our relationship with that state. The noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Ahmad, often speak against the human rights violations in Hong Kong, yet the Government are reopening two UK-China government investment forums that closed when Beijing introduced the national security law. They are being reintroduced when that law is not only still there but being enforced, and people are being put in prison as a consequence of it. It does not make sense.<\/p><p pid=\"d2035.0\/20\">The Foreign Office sanctions officials for their persecution of the Uighur Muslims, but refuses&#8212;as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said&#8212;to back Trade Bill amendments preventing deals with countries suspected of genocide. I hope the Minister will respond to the noble Lord&#8217;s specific questions on this point.<\/p><p pid=\"d2035.0\/21\">I will conclude. If the Government are truly to stand for our values as a nation, their actions must match their words. I repeat what the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, said: we need once again to become a reliable and trusted voice in the world.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1238.0\/1\">Throughout this debate, we have all heard the harrowing stories of the mass human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang. We have heard about the mass detention camps; forced labour; systematic campaigns of rape, sexual abuse and torture; forced sterilisation; the separation of children from their parents; the destruction of mosques; and the erasure of Uyghur culture.<\/p><p pid=\"a1238.0\/2\">The Chinese Communist party has a shambolic record on human rights, with long-established repression of Christians, Tibetans and Falun Gong. Indeed, the lessons learned from the oppression of Tibetans has been applied in Xinjiang. The Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy has concluded that the Chinese Government have breached every article of the UN genocide convention in their treatment of Uyghurs and bear responsibility for committing genocide. The UK Government cannot continue to appease China, given these crimes against humanity. It is imperative that the UK Government go  beyond words of condemnation and use every possible avenue to end the persecution and punish those who have instigated and participated in it.<\/p><p pid=\"a1238.0\/3\">Given the overwhelming evidence of genocide, international authorities must be given the unfettered access to establish whether that it is taking place. We welcome the talks that are under way between China and the UN to allow the UN Human Rights Commissioner to visit Xinjiang but, given China&#8217;s intransigence and crackdown on critical voices from the international community, can we really be anything other than sceptical of China&#8217;s commitment to transparency? China&#8217;s delegate to the UN Human Rights Council panel said:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1238.0\/4\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;The door to Xinjiang is always open , and we welcome the High Commissioner to visit Xinjiang&#8221;,<\/p><p pid=\"a1238.0\/5\">but we know that the Communist party&#8217;s attitude is far from welcoming.<\/p><p pid=\"a1238.0\/6\">In recent months, numerous accredited international journalists have been expelled from China. BBC World News has been banned and, as we heard earlier, the BBC&#8217;s John Sudworth left Beijing at short notice last month after nine years reporting from China, amid concerns for his family&#8217;s safety after he reported on the persecution of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities. Shamefully, the Chinese Government imposed sanctions on five elected Members of Parliament for simply doing their jobs and speaking out against the horrific human rights abuses that are currently taking place. Who knows whether all of us who have spoken today could be added to that list? I say, feel free&#8212;we stand together and will not be silenced.<\/p><p pid=\"a1238.0\/7\">Given such behaviour, what faith does the Minister have that China will allow full access to the Human Rights Commissioner to visit Xinjiang for a full and robust investigation into the genocide that appears to be taking place? Indeed, what access to Xinjiang has been given to officials in the UK embassies in China? Will the Government support visits by groups of MPs, such as the APPG on Uyghurs and the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, to see the reality for themselves?<\/p><p pid=\"a1238.0\/8\">Moreover, if China continues to be obstructive, what legislative action will the UK Government take? What can we learn from allies that seek to uphold the international rules-based order? To give one example, the USA enacted the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act 2018, which denies Chinese Government officials access to the US if they are responsible for implementing restrictions on Americans who seek access to Tibet. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Tim Loughton\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/10371\">The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)<\/phrase>, who has spoken today, has introduced a similar Bill, of which I am a sponsor; I urge the UK Government to give that Bill their full support and extend the legislation to cover other areas of China, including Xinjiang.<\/p><p pid=\"a1238.0\/9\">The time for appeasement is over. We cannot ignore the reality that the evidence of genocide is overwhelming. We have a moral duty to condemn it and accordingly to support the strongest possible action. The UK Government ought to declare that they regard the situation as genocide&#8212;genocide. Will the Minister do that today? The Government seem terrified of living up to their moral responsibilities. Despite lobbying from their own Back Benchers, last month they whipped their Members to defeat the anti-genocide amendment to the Trade Bill. It is inexplicable that the Government wanted to resist that amendment, although as we know from the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s leaked remarks, the Government  appear to be more concerned with trade deals with the growth markets of the future than the protection of human rights.<\/p><p pid=\"a1238.0\/10\">The UK must follow other countries and introduce specific legislation to make clear its support for the Uyghurs as a persecuted community. For example, it is estimated that as much as 20% of the world&#8217;s cotton is gathered in Xinjiang, much of it by prisoners in camps; the Government should legislate to sanction any produce that originates from the province, to ensure that supply chains do not tacitly support slave labour. Furthermore, we need to offer asylum to those who escape persecution in China. If we can do it for those wishing to leave Hong Kong, we can do it for those fleeing genocide in Xinjiang. We need to protect Uyghur communities based here in the UK to ensure that they do not suffer intimidation from Chinese officials for bringing these abuses to light. Can the Minister commit to those measures?<\/p><p pid=\"a1238.0\/11\">Finally, although China has emerged as a global superpower, we cannot cower in fear as it systematically attempts to destroy the culture and lives of millions of people. We cannot be picked off nation by nation in turning a blind eye to genocide for the sake of trade deals. As we know from history, the true scale and horrific details of genocide rarely become fully known until much later. For all the statistics that we know of, for all the tormenting stories that we have heard of, and for all the secret images that have been smuggled out of China illustrating what is happening, the likelihood is that the situation is much, much worse. Therefore, we must be on the right side of history and take action now. This is not just a moral obligation, but a legal one, too. As a signatory to the UN genocide convention, the UK has an obligation<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1238.0\/12\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;to prevent and to punish the crime of genocide.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"a1238.0\/13\">We in the SNP wholly support this motion today. It is time for the UK Government to uphold that commitment to do everything in their power to prevent further atrocities from taking place and, in alliance with our international partners, ensure that the Chinese Government are held to account for their horrifying crimes.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1792.0\/1\">My Lords, I declare an interest as a former chairman of the Bar Standards Board, which regulates barristers through its code of conduct. By accepting the immense honour of becoming a Member of your Lordships&#8217; House, we explicitly take on certain limitations in the rest of our lives. We take on the Nolan principles; we have to understand conflict of interest and, above all, what it means to act on one&#8217;s personal honour and to serve Parliament and the national interest. We have seen, in the recent controversies about civil servants and politicians taking on second jobs, what happens when some of these principles are jeopardised.<\/p><p pid=\"a1792.0\/2\">The Lords&#8217; Conduct Committee is well aware that, in a small number of professions, there is a duty of confidentiality that makes it difficult for Members to disclose the identity of the Government, organisation or individual to whom services are being provided, and it took that into account. The suggestion that noble Lords should not be required to reveal earnings from foreign work on the basis that it would breach client confidentiality or put them at a commercial disadvantage is, with great respect to noble Lords who are lawyers, without merit.<\/p><p pid=\"a1792.0\/3\">First, members of the Bar are not obliged to accept foreign work under the Bar code of conduct. Their doing so is a choice. The cab-rank rule does not apply to all foreign work, so a noble Lord can choose whether to accept foreign work and can no doubt advise his or her client that, in so doing, he or she may be required, under the rules of this House, to disclose the level of earnings. It is quite unrealistic to suggest that, if disclosure were required, London would lose its attraction as an arbitration centre. That is, with respect, to regard too highly the contribution made by the handful of lawyers in this House who would be affected by the rule.<\/p><p pid=\"a1792.0\/4\">Nor is the identity of a client necessarily confidential. One need look only at the websites of, say, Blackstone Chambers, 1 Essex Court, Brick Court or Essex Court Chambers to appreciate that their members&#8212;some Members of this House&#8212;endlessly list the names of their clients and the prestigious matters in which they have acted for such clients. There may be occasions when advising a particular client is so sensitive that the identity of the client itself cannot be revealed, but, again, that is a matter which should be addressed at the outset with the client by a noble Lord lawyer receiving foreign fees. If the client is not prepared for the noble Lord, his adviser, to discharge his or her duties to this House, the barrister can politely decline to advise and one of the other highly skilled members of the Bar can undertake the work, while the barrister Member of this House will soon be busy with other clients.  Is the objection from lawyer Members of this House more about not wanting to be hampered in competing for arbitration work than it is about the sanctity of client confidentiality or the status of London as an arbitration centre?<\/p><p pid=\"a1792.0\/5\">What may lie behind their objection is not so much the risk to client confidentiality&#8212;which, with great respect, is all but non-existent&#8212;but that revealing the scale of foreign earnings could be a source of embarrassment to Members of this House who are both discharging public duties and, at the same time, earning very large fees in respect of foreign work. But that embarrassment is not a reason for this House to reject the proposed rule. On the contrary, it demonstrates the need for the rule. If a barrister Peer feels embarrassed at the thought of revealing earnings or clients, it is a good indication that the brief should be declined.<\/p><p pid=\"a1792.0\/6\">Nolan principles would have to be applied if a barrister Peer were acting for, say, Hong Kong or Myanmar. This would be very relevant in debates and amendments on, for example, immigration Bills, Armed Forces Bills, national security Bills and even financial conduct Bills. It is of course the perception of conflict of interest that matters. No one is suggesting that Members of this House would actually try to influence proceedings in favour of a client without disclosing it.<\/p><p pid=\"a1792.0\/7\">In the current climate, it is more important than ever that Members of this House should be clear about their dealings with foreign clients. Any exemption from the proposed new rules risks bringing the reputation of the whole House into disrepute, which most of us very much do not want. Barrister legislators may choose what foreign work to take or not take, bearing in mind their privileged position as parliamentarians. There is, I surmise, no shortage of work for them which does not involve such clients.<\/p><p pid=\"a1792.0\/8\">We should ask our lawyer colleagues to respect the position of the House, accept the committee report and reject the amendments. Although I have sympathy for the noble Lord, Lord Balfe, his amendment would delay what needs to be done right now.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a1768.0\/1\">I thank the Minister for the Statement made in the Commons yesterday. I pay tribute again from these Benches for the amazing work of all the NHS staff and volunteers in delivering the vaccine to so many millions of people. However, as the chief medical and scientific advisers have repeated  many times in recent weeks, the virus is still among us, creating new strains and threatening our recovery in the UK. It is therefore vital that the Government continue as we emerge from this lockdown to be led by data, not dates.<\/p><p pid=\"a1768.0\/2\">It is clearly right to add India to the red list. In the UK we have deep ties and bonds with India of course, but it was the correct thing to do in the circumstances and it is also right that the Prime Minister should postpone his visit. Pakistan and Bangladesh, both of which have lower rates than India, have been on the list since <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2021-04-09\">9 April<\/phrase> so I wonder why it took so long to add India.<\/p><p pid=\"a1768.0\/3\">Can the Minister update the House on the presence of all three new variants identified&#8212;the Indian, Brazilian and South African&#8212;and their presence and spread in the UK? Indeed, can he update the House about the global co-ordination of surveillance of the new variants?<\/p><p pid=\"a1768.0\/4\">With regard to protecting our borders, this week Hong Kong identified 47 Covid cases on a single flight from Delhi. Before the Friday deadline there will be hundreds of people arriving on flights from India. Is this not very risky?<\/p><p pid=\"a1768.0\/5\">Even with high levels of vaccination across the population, there will be significant groups who are not vaccinated&#8212;children, for example&#8212;so the virus will be endemic. As the Chief Medical Officer has recently confirmed, papers from SAGE model a third wave this summer. How do we avoid that?<\/p><p pid=\"a1768.0\/6\">The poorest and lowest paid in the most insecure jobs do not isolate as they should because they cannot afford to do so. From these Benches we have pointed out time and again that one way to ensure self-isolation&#8212;and therefore help the Government tackle this&#8212;would be to pay higher sick pay and expand its scope. Will this happen?<\/p><p pid=\"a1768.0\/7\">There is no mention in the Statement of vaccine passports. Does the Minister anticipate that they will soon be needed for football games and concerts?<\/p><p pid=\"a1768.0\/8\">I regret that we need to turn to the media stories about lobbying and the revelations in the Sunday Times regarding the former Prime Minister acting on behalf of Greensill and the payday financing scheme. As my right honourable friend Jon Ashworth said in the Commons yesterday:<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1768.0\/9\">&#8220;This was not an act of altruism to staff in a pandemic but an investment plan to package up loans to sell to investors, with the former Prime Minister, not nurses, in line for a payday windfall. Cameron wrote in one of his emails: &#8216;As you can imagine, Matt Hancock&#8217; is &#8216;extremely positive about this innovative offer.&#8217;&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Commons, 19\/4\/21; col. 659.]<\/p><p pid=\"a1768.0\/10\">What was being sought was a partnership with NHS Shared Business Services, which is jointly owned by the department, to access the personal and financial data of thousands of NHS staff for their electronic records for commercial gain. I expect the move would next be to the social care sector. We know that at least 30 trusts may have spent valuable time considering the adoption of this untested payday lending scheme as a result of the lobbying by Mr Cameron. Can the Minister ensure that publication of all the text messages, emails and correspondence with David Cameron will happen? Can the Minister tell the House how many NHS leaders and officials Mr Cameron and Mr Greensill  lobbied and met? How many NHS trusts in total were approached about this expensive&#8212;and, indeed, unneeded &#8212;scheme? Even today, we see further allegations of contracts being granted without proper scrutiny and governance, following the Secretary of State&#8217;s own links with Topwood. Questions about conflicts of interest are inevitable.<\/p><p pid=\"a1768.0\/11\">Apart from the issue about pay levels in the NHS which might necessitate such a scheme, can the Minister accept that NHS staff deserve a pay rise and support, not payday loan apps forced on the NHS by speculators trying to make money out of the pandemic? What is his view of this? Does he appreciate that honesty, probity and transparency are directly linked to people&#8217;s acceptance of and adherence to the rules we have all obeyed for many months to beat this pandemic?<\/p><p pid=\"a1768.0\/12\">Last year, a former Conservative chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Feldman&#8212;who was running a lobbying firm with healthcare clients&#8212;acted as an unpaid adviser to the Minister himself. When I was a Minister I was told that one must not only be scrupulous and transparent in one&#8217;s dealings but that one should not do anything that could be misunderstood or misinterpreted.<\/p><p pid=\"a1768.0\/13\">I hope the Minister will not just get angry as he has in the past and say it is all not true and how hard everyone is working to get the pandemic under control&#8212;everyone knows how hard he and the public servants are working&#8212;as he will be missing the point. The point is about the reputation and standing of government, democracy and accountability. Does he believe it would be a good thing for the Government to reflect on the Nolan principles of public life, particularly with regard to recent procurement processes, and the lessons that might be learnt?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"a205.0\/1\">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this morning, Mr Paisley. I am grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Julie Marson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/25879\">the Member for Hertford and Stortford (Julie Marson)<\/phrase> for securing this debate and for all the contributions, which were focused on the importance of investment to the livelihoods, the prosperity and quality of life of people in Members&#8217; constituencies and beyond. It is a privilege for me to be able to speak about the role of the new Office for Investment, a joint venture between No. 10 and the Department for International Trade, to cement the UK as a global hub for investment.<\/p><p pid=\"a205.0\/2\">The UK&#8217;s approach to investment is driven, and needs to be driven, for the reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford laid out, from the top&#8212;from the Prime Minister&#8212;who is showing the world that the UK is open to investment, and that Global Britain is a vision and a reality, not just rhetoric. As we seek to build back better in the wake of covid-19, we have to use our newfound freedom to go further and faster than ever to drive jobs and growth across the country.<\/p><p pid=\"a205.0\/3\">The Government are determined to secure more investment opportunities in order to level up every region and nation of the UK with new jobs and businesses. The Office for Investment is very much focused on the levelling-up agenda, as the whole of Government needs to be.<\/p><p pid=\"a205.0\/4\">We do not in any way want to surrender the power, attraction and magnetism of London and the south-east. When I was Minister for Investment, the majority of investments into the regions came as a secondary investment from companies that had previously invested, often, into London and the south-east. This is about keeping the best of what we have. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford said&#8212;she may even have understated the point&#8212;not only are we the leading investment destination in Europe, but by size we are probably the most attractive foreign direct investment economy in the world. Only the United States and China-Hong Kong have higher levels of FDI. We know that the FDI tends to lead to more research and development; it leads to more exports; and it leads to higher wages, which we would all support.<\/p><p pid=\"a205.0\/5\">The Office for Investment lies at the heart of making that happen, by identifying and tearing down the barriers faced by top-tier investors. It sends a big signal, which is important, and it is tied to the Prime Minister, but the aim is not that it should grow into a behemoth. It is a very small, strategic group, working, through my colleague Lord Grimstone, with DIT, which, in various guises over the years and now as a dedicated trade Department, has been at the heart of delivering the offer to investors. The Office for Investment is bringing that signal, with the imprimatur of the Prime Minister. By being at the top of Government, it brings the convening power that only the Prime Minister&#8217;s Office has across the rest of Whitehall. As colleagues have suggested, this is about having a coherent offer. It is pointless to have a great initiative here if a very slow response elsewhere ruins the pitch, which should be carefully crafted and prepared, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford pointed out.<\/p><p pid=\"a205.0\/6\">It is estimated by industry that in the first three months of 2021 alone, the UK FinTech sector&#8212;my hon. Friend highlighted the importance of venture&#8212;raised more than &#163;2 billion in more than 100 investment deals. How are we going to be successful in the long term? It seems to me that science, innovation and technology&#8212;and I would include education in the piece&#8212;are at the heart of how we shall deliver competitiveness for the UK in the longer term. That is at the heart of our offer. Venture is so important. Even last year, in the pandemic, we saw another rise in venture investment into the UK. It is creating that science, innovation and culture here, and having a strong educational offer that brings in the brightest people from around the world, that all adds to the UK having a uniquely favourable role to play. Then what is needed is to put in place the funding to make this the best place in the world from which to start one of those businesses and grow to scale.<\/p><p pid=\"a205.0\/7\">We want to put in place those factors and the finance. I think that NASA called the growth path for businesses the &#8220;valley of death&#8221;. We want to ensure that we have all the steps covered going forward. That is why it is so important that we look to partner with others&#8212;the Office for Investment plays a critical role in that&#8212;and that the Treasury and others show flexibility in the new sovereign investment partnership with the UAE, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford rightly highlighted. It is precisely in order to put such funds in place to support UK business that the OFI can deliver in a way that we have perhaps not seen before.<\/p><p pid=\"a205.0\/8\">The Office for Investment will help drive forward our recovery to the benefit of people up and down the UK. It comprises a crack team of specialists who are working hard to land big investment opportunities. The OFI is there to help influence the overall environment but, in terms of particular projects, it is aimed at the top end. The aim is not to fall. It is working hard to land those big opportunities, while continuing to uphold the highest standards in scrutiny and security. As has been said, officials report directly to my good friend Lord Grimstone, in his role as joint Minister for Investment at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the DIT. The Office for Investment will bring together the best in the business from across Government and around the country to drive forward our investment-led recovery.<\/p><p pid=\"a205.0\/9\">The Office for Investment is already delivering results. It was great to hear from <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jim Shannon\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip\/person\/13864\">the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)<\/phrase> about the thousands of jobs that have  been created in Northern Ireland, but we want to go further. That is why we are setting up a DIT trade hub in Belfast to ensure that Her Majesty&#8217;s Government are working closely with Invest Northern Ireland in a more effective way, to ensure that the global reach of the UK Government and the staff we have in more than 110 countries can maximise the investment that comes into Northern Ireland.<\/p><p pid=\"a205.0\/10\">We have seen the UAE investment. We hope we will also see investment from other high-growth markets. If I had to think of what DIT&#8217;s fundamental role is, it would probably be hitching or aligning&#8212;whatever word we choose&#8212;the UK with the fastest growing parts of the world. That is what we have the opportunity to do, and we have to use our flexibility. In the same way that that flexibility has allowed us to lead Europe in vaccines, we have to ensure that every time we make the same brave judgments and create the conditions to deliver success.<\/p><p pid=\"a205.0\/11\">I should give my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford a minute to reply, but are there any questions I should pick up on?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p pid=\"c1304.0\/1\">The Statement is apparently geared to what the Government describe as &#8220;illegal immigration&#8221;. In the Commons, the Home Secretary referred to &#8220;a broken system&#8221;&#8212;the Government&#8217;s words. After nearly 11 years in office, it is this Government who are responsible for the present system and its consequences, and it is time that the Government accepted their failings.<\/p><p pid=\"c1304.0\/2\">In 2010, the Government&#8217;s policy was to reduce net migration below 100,000. That policy&#8212;whether one agreed with it or not&#8212;was not implemented. We have never had an explanation from the Government as to why, nor will we have one today, because they will not wish to admit that it would have damaged our economy. It was certainly nothing to do with membership of the EU and free movement, because that was a known factor at the time when the policy was drawn up. That policy was clearly not drawn up with the intention that it would be implemented; it was simply because the Government wanted to attract headlines for sounding tough on reducing the number of people coming to this country. Time will tell whether the real purpose of this Statement falls into the same category.<\/p><p pid=\"c1304.0\/3\">We have a broken system because, over the last decade, the Government have been more interested in sounding tough to secure headlines than in addressing the broken system over which they now admit they have presided for some years and continue to preside. The Statement says that the Government&#8217;s current broken system<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1304.0\/4\">&#8220;limits our ability to properly support others in genuine need of protection. This is manifestly unfair to those desperately waiting to be resettled in the UK.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1304.0\/5\">It also refers to the system being overwhelmed, and to the<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1304.0\/6\">&#8220;persistent failure to enforce our immigration laws&#8221;.<\/p><p pid=\"c1304.0\/7\">Who exactly do the Government think is responsible for that failure which they have now recognised? The Statement also refers to the<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1304.0\/8\">&#8220;pathway to citizenship to enable over five million people in Hong Kong to come to the UK.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1304.0\/9\">We welcome this. Five million is somewhat larger than the 16,000 unauthorised arrivals detected in the UK in 2019 and which apparently<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1304.0\/10\">&#8220;limits our ability to properly support others in genuine need of protection.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1304.0\/11\">This assumes that none of the 16,000 is also in need of protection because they are fleeing war and persecution or, in the Government&#8217;s view, even worthy of protection simply because of the way in which they have reached this country.<\/p><p pid=\"c1304.0\/12\">The Hong Kong pathway is evidence of the need for safe, legal routes for those in need of refuge. Can the Government say how many of the 5 million eligible people in Hong Kong they expect to come to the UK? The policy statement says that<\/p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c1304.0\/13\">&#8220;an estimated 320,000 people [may] come to the UK over the next five years.&#8221;<\/p><p pid=\"c1304.0\/14\">How was that estimate arrived at and how many is it estimated may come from Hong Kong to the UK after the first five years? Can the Government also confirm that there is no restriction on the numbers of people in Hong Kong who are rightly allowed to come to the UK being able to do so?<\/p><p pid=\"c1304.0\/15\">The Statement says that, under the Government&#8217;s broken system, 109,000 claims are sitting in the asylum queue. No doubt, this is&#8212;at least in part&#8212;because the Government have allowed the share of applications receiving an initial decision within six months to fall from 87% in 2014 to just 20% in 2019. Why did the Government let that happen? Why are so many appeals successful? Are the Government going to tell us that it is all the fault of &#8220;leftie lawyers&#8221; or will they at last accept responsibility for the system which they now describe as &#8220;broken&#8221; and &#8220;collapsing&#8221;?<\/p><p pid=\"c1304.0\/16\">The Government have previously told us about pending agreements with France to stop criminal gangs involved in the terrible crime of human trafficking. What has happened to those promised agreements? The Statement is silent on that issue, though the policy statement tells us that, in 2019, 32,000 attempts to enter the UK by unauthorised groups were prevented in northern France.<\/p><p pid=\"c1304.0\/17\">The Government have previously referred to those who have arrived here through non-recognised routes being returned to the first country in which they could have sought asylum, or to another country. With which countries have the Government reached agreement to take back those seeking asylum who have arrived here through non-recognised routes? Is it their view of the provisions of international law and of the Refugee Convention that refugees fleeing war and persecution have to claim asylum in the first safe country through which they pass, and that they have no right to transit through another country to get to this country to claim asylum? Many would disagree with this stance is correct or right, but is it the Government&#8217;s position?<\/p><p pid=\"c1304.0\/18\">What safe and legal routes currently exist by which refugees, including children, can reach this country, following our departure from the EU and the ending of the Dublin arrangements? This is on top of the earlier abrupt cessation of the Dubs scheme. Is there any limit on the number of refugees who can come to the UK by safe and legal routes? If so, what is it? If there are no, or minimal, safe and legal routes, that is only going to make dangerous and unauthorised entries to this country, including through traffickers&#8212;whether by small boat, air, in the back of a lorry or a shipping container&#8212;more, not less likely.<\/p><p pid=\"c1304.0\/19\">The Government claim that, since our departure from the EU, we have control of our borders. Does that mean that implementing what is set out in the Statement is not dependent on reaching agreements with any other countries? Does claiming that we have control of our borders mean that, at all our ports of entry, the level of checks will be such that the likelihood of successful, unauthorised entry into this country is minimal?<\/p><p pid=\"c1304.0\/20\">Finally, how will success or failure of the policies set out in the Statement be judged? What will be the criteria, yardsticks and statistics against which the Government will make this assessment?<\/p>",
