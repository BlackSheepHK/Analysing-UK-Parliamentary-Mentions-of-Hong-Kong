            "body": "<p>I beg to move:\n<q>That the Additional Import Duties (No. 3) Order, 1938, dated the tenth day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-eight, made by the Treasury under the Import Duties Act, 1932, a copy of which was presented to this House on the said tenth day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-eight, be approved.<\/q>\nThis Order is designed to impose a minimum specific duty on handkerchiefs made wholly or partly of cotton, in order to give manufacturers in the United Kingdom protection against abnormally cheap imports from Japan. Prior to the issue of the present Order on 10th March, handkerchiefs of all sizes were liable to a duty of 20 per cent. ad valorem, or 30 per cent. ad valorem if they contained lace or embroidery, and these rates of duty will continue to apply as an alternative to the minimum specific duty which the Order now seeks to impose. The Order, which has been issued on the recommendation of the Import Duties Advisory Committee, relates to handkerchiefs made wholly or partly of cotton, wool, hemp, flax or jute. Most handkerchiefs, as the House knows, are made either of linen, that is flax, or cotton. Linen handkerchiefs and the better qualities of cotton handkerchiefs are, in the main, priced at a level which puts them entirely beyond the scope of this alternative specific duty, and in practice, therefore, the change in duty of which I am asking the House to approve would only affect the cheaper&#8212;indeed, the very cheapest&#8212;type of cotton handkerchiefs.<br\/>\nThe scope of this new specific duty has been further restricted by limiting its application to those handkerchiefs which neither in width nor length exceed 24 inches. These limitations have been inserted in order to exclude so-called handkerchiefs of very much larger sizes which, I understand, are now used for bead or neckwear. The Committee have not included handkerchief material in the piece in their present recommendation; but they propose to watch the course of events carefully with regard to handkerchief material, and, if it should appear that the new duty is being avoided by\n\nthe importation of this material, they may consider taking steps to close that loophole.<br\/>\nThere is a substantial production of the cheaper types of cotton handkerchiefs in this country by firms situated mainly in the Manchester district. There was very little foreign competition in this class of trade until about four years ago, but since then there has been a very striking increase in imports from Japan at prices with which British manufacturers are unable to compete. As a result, the market has become disorganised, and there has been a marked decline in home production.<br\/>\nLet me support that contention with a few figures. In 1933 the imports of handkerchiefs were 1,186 cwts. at a c.i.f. value of &#163;31,426, and of those imports only 35 cwts. valued at &#163;401 came from Japan. Four years later, in 1937, the position had materially changed; our total imports were 6,093 cwts., valued at &#163;83,081, and of that quantity no less than 5,768 cwts. came from Japan at a total value of &#163;60,834. Therefore, more than 90 per cent. of the handkerchiefs imported in 1937 came from Japan, and the average c.i.f. value of those imports was the very low figure of 1s. 10&#189;d. per lb. The House may not at first sight appreciate the smallness of that sum. Let me, therefore, give the average price per lb. of the imports from other countries. Those which came from Switzerland were valued on the average at 17s. 8d. per lb, those which came from Germany at I2s. 10&#189;d. per lb. and those which came from other foreign countries&#8212;such as France, Belgium, China and Austria, a very small proportion of our imports&#8212;were valued at us. 8d. per lb. The goods which came from within the British Empire, that is, from Canada, India and Hong Kong, also a very small proportion, were valued at 5s. 7&#189;d. per lb. The Japanese imports, as I say, were valued only at 1s. 10&#189;d. per lb. On those cheap Japanese goods the average <i>ad valorem<\/i> incidence of the new specific duty would be about 80 per cent. On the basis of the average c.i.f. value as we know it for last year, the higher priced goods imported from within the Empire and from other foreign countries would not be affected at all by the specific duty which is imposed by this Order as an alternative to the <i>ad valorem<\/i> duty.<br\/>\nThe Japanese goods in question consisted partly of children's small handkerchiefs weighing 2 lb. to the gross, and costing an average of about 3s. 6d. per gross c.i.f., and partly of larger-sized handkerchiefs which are used by adults. Both these types, and particularly the larger-sized handkerchiefs, are produced in cheap qualities by British manufacturers, and although the new duty will, as I have explained, bear a high <i>ad valorem<\/i> incidence on the average of the Japanese imports, it is really no more than is necessary having regard to the very low price of these goods. British manufacturers, I am informed, have never made handkerchiefs for retail sale below 1d. each. They have always, however, produced goods for the cheap end of the trade, and until the Japanese entered the market they had the whole of this section of the trade to themselves.<br\/>\nBritish manufacturers still produce large quantities of penny handkerchiefs for distribution through the fixed price stores as well as the wholesale trade, and I believe there is not the slightest reason to suppose that the new duty will lead to any diminution in the supply of penny handkerchiefs. I made particular inquiries this morning in order to find out whether this would mean hardship to the people who wanted the cheapest possible kind of handkerchiefs, and to ascertain whether there existed halfpenny or even farthing handkerchiefs; and I am informed that that is not so. There may be one or two cases in which handkerchiefs have been sold at under a penny, but, substantially speaking, the penny handkerchief is the handkerchief which is bought by these people who want the cheapest handkerchief possible. The substitution, therefore, of an alternative specific duty, which will frankly hit the very cheap Japanese goods, will neither put up the price of the penny handkerchief nor lead to any diminution in the supply of these useful articles to the market.<br\/>\nI remember that on the last occasion when we discussed Import Duties Orders, hon. Members in various parts of the House were anxious to know exactly the home production and the number of people employed.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>At this late hour I want to touch on only one or two points. The Under-Secretary will have had the feeling of the House on this question of the dismissal of air pilots. Only yesterday one of the directors of the North-Eastern Airways asked me whether I would use my good offices to try to get some of these pilots restored to their posts, because some of them are penniless and without the means of life. I ask the Under-Secretary to look into the matter and see whether Imperial Airways cannot find posts for these men. What have these pilots done last year? Pilots of Imperial Airways have carried more than 70,000 passengers for over 6,000,000 miles, carried over 7,000,000 ton-miles of traffic and run the biggest fleet of commercial flying boats in the world. They have made 10 crossings of the North Atlantic ocean in accordance with prearranged time tables and have kept up to schedule; brought into operation the all-air Empire mail programme, which is a great landmark in the history of this country; made the first commercial Empire flight from England to New Zealand, 13,000 miles away, and established the first British trans-ocean air service between British possessions and the United States of America. This year they have been running a good service to Singapore and carrying 11&#189; tons of mails every week. If you count the postcards as letters, that means something like 9,000,000 letters a week, or 4&#189; times the amount carried by the Dutch air mail.<br\/>\nWe ought to do everything we can for these pilots. They have made a great success of the Empire air mail service, thanks to the foresight of the General Post Office. It is a great scheme that you should be able to carry these letters from this country to all parts of the Empire, without surcharge. Imperial Airways ought to be congratulated on the success they have had in carrying these mails to all parts of the Empire. I notice that in another new schedule they are to speed up some of their work and to run seven services a week in each direction between\n\n\nEngland and Egypt, three between England and Kisumu and two between England and Durban. On 10th April they will run from England to Cairo in one day five hours, to Khartoum in two days one hour, to Kisumu in two days twelve hours, to Mombasa in three days two and a-half hours, to Mozambique in three days nine and a-half hours and to Durban in four days ten hours. That is a very good achievement indeed. The England-India-Iraq-Australia service is to have four services a week in each direction between England and Calcutta, two between England and Singapore, two between England and Hong Kong and two between England and Brisbane.<br\/>\nThe only criticism I have to make on the Cadman Committee's report is that they are very severe on Imperial Airways. Surely the record that I have just read out is a good one. They have delivered the goods, and all this destructive criticism of Imperial Airways is not good. In the past they have had very little money. Other nations have given more subsidies than they have had. On the whole, we ought to congratulate the directors of Imperial Airways and the managing director for the way in which they have handled this traffic. I agree with the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Perkins) that there ought to be a whole-time chairman for Imperial Airways. You need a man of vision to run Imperial Airways and he should get around him a little handful of enthusiasts. It is not good for them to have too many business men on Imperial Airways.<br\/>\nOne criticism I would make in the other direction is that Imperial Airways have not led enough. They have followed the aircraft industry. In America you will find that the big firms lead and do not follow the big companies. They do not follow the aircraft industry. They say exactly what they want and they get it carried out. I have been told that the managing director is unpopular, but you do not want a \"Yes\" man. You would not have all these services of the Imperial Airways if you had had a \"Yes\" man. He is a brusque man, and he seems to have delivered the goods pretty well. I cannot see that there is much to find fault with. It is said that he did not get on with the Director-General. There are Government directors on the Board of Imperial Airways; if things were\n\nnot going quite right surely those Government directors should have gone to the Air Minister and asked him to look into this or that question and put things right. So far as I can see they never attempted to do that, and it is very unfair to throw the whole blame on to the managing-director.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>My right hon. Friend the Member for Hillsborough (Mr. Alexander) said at the beginning of his speech that he wanted to keep the Debate on broad lines, and that he was more concerned with policy than with matters of detail. With one or two exceptions the Debate has been on those lines, which I intend to follow. Hon. Members have expressed regret at the absence of the First Lord and have complimented the Parliamentary Secretary on having taken up the task of bringing forward the Estimates at short notice. Possibly I am more in a position to commiserate with the hon. Gentleman, since for one period I held that position, and as my chief was in another place, I had to shoulder the burden in the House. I wish also to congratulate the Civil Lord who is to wind up the Debate and who, I believe, undertakes that difficult task for the first time; but the task to-night will not be as difficult as it has been on other occasions, since the stream of criticism has not been as antagonistic or destructive as in former Debates.<br\/>\nBefore dealing with the points which I wish to raise, I would like to refer to the very serious statement made by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Nuneaton (Lieut.-Commander Fletcher). I think that statement was a little more serious than was suggested by the hon. and gallant Member for Hertford (Rear Admiral Sueter), who said that it was a case of whether or not two rival firms should bid one against the other. I am not concerned, as I hope no one in the House is concerned, with any mere advertisement between different firms, but I think that the case presented by my hon. and gallant Friend was so specific and so detailed as to be a very serious accusation, and I think it should be answered publicly in the House in order\n\nthat any disquiet may be allayed. I know nothing about the case, but I think the position cannot be left as it is at the present moment. A public statement ought to be made in order that we may know whether there is a case for an inquiry as was suggested by my hon. and gallant Friend.<br\/>\nThe right hon. Gentleman the Member for Epping (Mr. Churchill) spoke of tire serious times in which we are living and expressed concern about the position. He commented adversely on the very sparse attendance in the House when the Parliamentary Secretary made his very important statement. Since then, the attendance has been small. It is indeed regrettable that, in dealing with these important matters concerning the Royal Navy, there should have been hardly more than a dozen Members in the House at some periods during the evening. It is all the more regrettable in that we are considering the largest expenditure of national funds on the Navy that has ever been called for in time of peace. Let it be borne in mind that that expenditure is being made to guard the nation against the effects of the Government's own policy. They have brought us to the point that dangers and fears surround us on every side, and we have to consider the largest Vote for the Navy which has ever been before the House, as a result entirely of the policy of the Government.<br\/>\nIn opening the Debate, my right hon. Friend drew attention to the position which has been created in the Western Mediterranean. He drew attention to the transfer of Italy from one side to the other, but he said, in parentheses, that probably that did not mean very much. If it were taken alone it would not, but when we read that there is now a line-up of the dictator countries joined together as possible enemies to cut our lifeline and our line of communication, it is a very serious problem. Much as we are concerned, and as we are bound to help in time of need and emergency, we have a right to make it clear to the House and the country the part the Government have played, and to point out that if the policy of the Opposition had been carried out and we had stood by the League of Nations, we should not have found ourselves in our present position.<br\/>\nMy right hon. Friend asked that some reply might be given with regard to the\n\n\narmament of the capital ships now building, and whether 14-inch or 16-inch guns were to be installed. He also made some reference to the question of the charge. I have seen statements made, and I have heard statements from people of authority in naval matters that at the battle of Jutland the Germans were more effective with their 12-inch guns than we were with our 14-inch guns, and that that was due chiefly to the charge. That matter certainly calls for some inquiry, and I have no doubt it will receive due attention from the Admiralty. It might allay a certain amount of uneasiness if we could get a definite statement in regard to it.<br\/>\nThe hon. and gallant Member for Pembroke (Major Lloyd George) made reference to the importance of smaller craft. I agree with him as to the importance of smaller craft rather than capital ships in the present circumstances. The Parliamentary Secretary called attention to the fact that preparations had been made for developing the convoy system. Unfortunately, the policy of the Government has brought us to a position in which we are very doubtful how many friends we are likely to have in any trouble that may break out. The fact is that we have fewer merchant ships and seamen than we had in 1914, and there are more powerful weapons, of greater precision, than on the former occasion. Therefore, smaller craft, such as destroyers, will play a more important part than was realised in the last War. It is important that there should be some further statement from the Government on this matter, and we should welcome a statement, if possible, from the Civil Lord.<br\/>\nThe hon. and gallant Member for Portsmouth, North (Sir R. Keyes) made several statements which were commented on by my hon. Friend the Member for West Leyton (Mr. Sorensen). My hon. Friend said that it was stupid to spend money on the Navy in the way suggested by the hon. and gallant Member, merely because it is the Navy. We must consider the Navy in regard to its relationships. It is still our first line of defence, and we have to depend upon it, despite the development of other arms, to keep open our sources of supply, in order that we may have the necessary sustenance. It is, however, foolish to try and put the Navy on other lines. The hon. and gallant Member criticised a point made by my right hon. Friend with regard to\n\nthe position of the Navy in the Mediterranean, particularly during the Abyssinian struggle. He said my right hon. Friend was unfair to the Navy in suggesting that it took no action. He said that the Navy was there all the time, and stood by. That makes the position worse, because we were under some obligation to the League of Nations. We were a member of the League, we had given specific promises. I think it will be agreed that had a rigid line of policy been adopted then we should have been in a different position to-day and the whole aspect of these Estimates would have been altered.<br\/>\nThe hon. and gallant Member for Portsmouth, North, made another extraordinary statement. He wanted to see the Navy prepared, in effect, to take on the whole world. He visualised the possibility that we might find ourselves engaged against the whole world. He suggested that we needed a Navy capable of holding its own if we had a war in the Far East, the Mediterranean and the North Sea at one and the same time. That is a perfect nightmare. I consulted with my right hon. Friend the Member for Hillsborough on the point, and so far as we could make out, our requirements in such circumstances would be 45 battleships, 160 cruisers, 400 destroyers and 100 submarines. A vast programme like that, when we are appalled by the present one, would certainly give us a sleepless night. That is carrying the thing to an absurdity. What we are hoping for, even now, giving the support that we are bound to do in present circumstances, is that nothing will be left undone that will enable us to co-operate with other nations, to bring us again to something like the League of Nations idea, whereby we could so pool our resources and so rely upon each other that it would not be necessary for any one nation to have to go in for this sort of thing, which simply sets up an armament race without any permanent good or any benefit to anybody, but merely keeping on edge the nerves of the nation and at the same time wasting our resources.<br\/>\nThere was a lively passage between the hon. and gallant Member for Portsmouth, North, and his own Front Bench with regard to the Naval Air Force, which called for the intervention of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence, who said that the hon. and gallant Member was wrong and that he was not in full possession of the facts. What are the facts?\n\n\nThe House ought to be informed, because the hon. and gallant Member made serious accusations. I think he said the Navy would never rest while things remain as at present. That is a wonderful example of unity at a time of great national difficulty. I would ask the Civil Lord to set our minds at rest in regard to that matter, and let us know what are the obscure facts to which the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence referred.<br\/>\nThe Civil Lord has paid a visit to Singapore. Many of us regretted that we did not hear that vibrant, sonorous speech of his which was relayed to the ends of the earth. We are interested in his journey and want to know something about it, what it was for, and what is the policy that it portends. For instance, is it proposed to defend Hong Kong, or are they going to retire behind a north and south line running through Singapore and leave all British interests in the Far East to their fate? I hope the hon. and gallant Gentleman will be able to give us some information about what I am sure must have been the very enjoyable trip which he had with the Royal Navy. Anybody who has had anything to do with the Navy knows that it must have been a good time, even if hard work accompanied it.<br\/>\nA lot of reference has been made to the West Mediterranean. What about the Eastern Mediterranean? I should like to know what steps are being taken there and what is the state of contact at present between the French and British naval staffs in that regard. There was a great deal of talk, when the present Home Secretary was First Lord of the Admiralty and visited the Mediterranean, about the value of Cyprus as a naval base, and we should like to know something more about that. We understood that there were great possibilities and advantages in equipping the island with a modern harbour. Has that project been abandoned, or is it still a policy that is being pursued and developed? That is a matter that is of real importance to us and also, I imagine, to our French allies. Have we any naval plans regarding Cyprus? I think it is not too strong to say that these are very grave and great questions, and there is a host of others also which should give the Admiralty staff great anxiety and call for mature consideration.<br\/>\nWe on this side of the House are in this unique position to-night, that owing to\n\nworld conditions none of us, however strong our opinions might be in some directions, feel that we want to embarrass the Government, at a time of such great difficulty, with regard to this great Service. At the same time, we are only doing our duty as an Opposition, and safeguarding our own position, in pointing out that the present position has largely been brought about by the Government's own policy, and that they are responsible, both for this tremendous expenditure and for the unease and fear that exist in the world to-day, and particularly in our own country; and in that measure they must take the full share of responsibility. The Opposition are not going to do anything to embarrass their own country, however.<br\/>\nWhile we consent to this very large expenditure, we are hoping that the Government will, even at this late hour, realise that it is impossible for any nation nowadays to live entirely to itself, that a narrow nationalism is not enough, and that to go on building up armaments in competition with other nations is bound to lead to disaster, both financial and military. While we look upon this as an interim action on the part of the Government, we hope they will pursue every means possible to get agreements with other nations, and that the time may come when we shall be able to consider a great reduction in these Estimates, because there will be less fear among the nations that each is building against the other. We hope that we may come into harmony rather than into conflict, and that we may bring those elements which are likely to bring disaster in the world into line with the common rule of law.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I beg to move,\n<q>That this House approves the Observations of His Majesty's Government on the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Civil Aviation.<\/q>\nWhatever may be thought about the report which is to be discussed this afternoon, it must be agreed by all that the members of the Cadman Committee have performed their task without fear or favour. I must emphasise that because I cannot help recollecting that at the time when the committee was appointed some derogatory, and I think unworthy, reflections were made from the Front Bench opposite upon the impartiality of the committee, and especially of the Chairman. But the character of the report before us has demonstrated the falsity of those reflections. It demonstrates also the great zeal and energy displayed by this committee, who in the short space of a little over two months saw nearly 70 witnesses, including nine hon. Members of this House, in addition to written documents which were submitted to them.<br\/>\nI think that hon. Members, particularly those whose observations in this House really were the origination of the committee's existence at all, will feel that they have had good value for the &#163;5 19s. 9d., which we are informed is the amount of the expenditure connected with the report. I know that hon. Members will also give credit to the Government for having lost no time in coming to a conclusion as to the course of action to take in view of the committee's recommendations. We have endeavoured to suit the convenience of the House by publishing, along with the report, our own observations and the decisions at which we have arrived. The Blue Book is not a long document, and hon. Members who have studied it will have seen that the recommendations of the committee have to a very large extent been accepted by the Government. I am glad also to be able to say that the two companies concerned with civil aviation. Imperial Airways and British Airways, have also signified that they agree very largely with those parts of the report which concern their own organisation and administration. I therefore have no hesitation in moving this Motion.<br\/>\nBefore I go into detail I would like to begin by alluding to the recommendations of the committee on which I can make one or two more general observations. It will be recollected that the committee were not given any formal terms of reference but were referred to the Debate which took place in this House on 17th November last. I do not think that the committee will have found any great difficulty in accommodating themselves to that perhaps rather unusual form of reference, but I am glad to think that they have gone rather further than a committee required to examine certain allegations and accusations, because I think that anyone who studies the report will see that what the committee have endeavoured to do was to put forward a constructive programme for the development of British civil aviation&#8212;a programme which, we hope, will add to the prestige of the country in this matter, will lead to the improvement of its communications, and will culminate in the creation of what practically may be considered a new industry in the output of civil machines which will, perhaps, occupy our aircraft factories when the present pressure of military work is to some extent relaxed.<br\/>\nI think the committee were impressed with the desirability that British-owned civil aeroplanes, whether they are flying on Imperial routes or to any other country, should be such as to convince everybody who travels in them, everybody who sees them pass or who inspects them, that they take a leading place among the planes of the world for speed, for safety, for comfort, and in the completeness and modern character of their equipment. There are evidently great advantages to be gained if that object can be achieved, not merely in the improvement of the service itself and the direct advantages which are to be expected from that, but, in other ways, indirect advantages, in the general advancement of British prestige throughout the world, and ultimately, perhaps, in the development of the export of British-made civil aeroplanes. The Government, too, are impressed by these considerations. Broadly speaking, we accept the conception which, as I see it, lay behind the recommendations of the committee, and we believe that the decisions which we have taken and the recommendations of the committee which have been accepted by us\n\n\nwill, m fact, go a long way to achieve that purpose in course of time.<br\/>\nI said that the report is not a long one, but, perhaps, it will be convenient if I attempt to classify the decisions of His Majesty's Government under four heads, or categories. First of all, there are the measures which are required for the purpose of strengthening the organisation in the Ministry for dealing with civil aviation. Secondly, there are the steps proposed for increasing national expenditure upon this object, which, as the House will be aware, includes the doubling of the maximum which is at present the statutory limit of the amount of subsidy which can be given. Thirdly, there is the allocation of the external routes between Imperial Airways and British Airways. Lastly, there is the administrative reorganisation of those two companies. I will say something about each of those categories.<br\/>\nI think, first, I must just say one more word upon the suggestion which has been made, reflecting upon my Noble Friend the Secretary of State for Air. I said something about this yesterday, when these reflections were made in the Debate, and I need not, therefore, spend much time upon it to-day, but I wish to repeat that, whilst the Government are not anxious to deny that there have been shortcomings in the development of civil aviation, we cannot leave out of account the urgent necessity and the prime duty of the Secretary of State, while he has been in office these last three years, to push along, with the utmost diligence and speed and determination, the military programme. Had he in any way neglected his duty in that respect he would not readily have been forgiven by the country. I am bound to say that I have not, in my experience, known any Minister who has devoted himself more completely and with a more single mind to the duties placed upon him in a great office than has my Noble Friend. Far from censuring him, I feel that we ought to pay him a tribute for the very remarkable results that have been achieved during his administration. I think my Noble Friend has, perhaps, suffered from the fact that he is not here to defend himself. [HON. MEMBERS: \"Hear, hear.\"] I quite understand, and to some extent sympathise with, the view\n\nof hon. Members, that they would like to have every Minister in this House to defend himself and to answer questions. That is impossible in present circumstances, but I have, at any rate, done my best to mitigate the disadvantages, and to try and meet the difficulties of hon. Members who have desired to have in this House somebody who could represent the Air Ministry with authority and who could, being himself a member of the Cabinet, speak on questions of policy as well as on questions of administrative detail.<br\/>\nIn my Noble Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster the House will now have a member of the Cabinet a member of the Air Council, the Deputy of the Secretary of State upon that Council, who not only will be able to attend to the business of the Air Ministry in this House and reply to hon. Members, but who will also make a very valuable contribution to the organisation and administration of the Air Ministry itself. I know that some hon. Members will always say, In putting two equal Ministers into one office, is it not a division of responsibility, and does it not involve a duality of policy? There have been cases in past times when difficulties have been created because two Cabinet Ministers have been concerned with the same office; but I venture to say that it all depends on the personalities concerned. Between my Noble Friend the Secretary of State for Air and my Noble Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster there will be no conflict; there will be no duality; there will be complete harmony of working and of goal. The effect of having this additional representative of the Air Ministry in this House will be that my hon. and gallant Friend the Under-Secretary will have now an opportunity of devoting particularly to the development of civil aviation those qualities which he has already brought to the general work of the Air Ministry, which, I think, everybody has recognised, and particularly yesterday in his admirable statement to the House. In addition, we have appointed a permanent Under-Secretary of State who will not only be the Secretary to the Air Ministry, but who will have the general administrative direction of civil aviation, and whose duty it will be to ensure that there shall be full and considered correlation between the policies of civil and military aviation.<br\/>\nThere are to be found, in Part II of the Government's Observations, a number of other improvements in the organisation of the Ministry, designed to enable us to carry out to the full the development of civil aviation as and when opportunity offers. They are not all exactly the same as the proposals of the Cadman Committee, but we believe that they will be at least equally effective. One particular recommendation which we have not accepted is the one which is concerned with the duties of the Service members of the Air Council. If hon. Members will be good enough to look at paragraphs 27 and 28 of the Observations, they will see the reasons which have weighed with us in not accepting this particular recommendation; but I would like to draw special attention to the fact that it is the opinion in the Air Ministry that interference with that arrangement at the present time would have an unfortunate effect on the carrying-out of our programme. That is the last thing that we want at present, and we believe that the other measures that we have taken will do all that is required.<br\/>\nI come now to the question of increased expenditure. I am sure that the House will not quarrel with me when I say that what you can do to help civil aviation must largely depend on the amount of money you are prepared to spend on it. It is because we recognise that that we feel that if we are now to start a new life and infuse fresh vigour into this whole subject of civil aviation, it is absolutely necessary that we should be prepared to spend a larger sum than we have in the past. Although my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has many objects on which to lavish his spare resources, he has agreed to go as far as to increase this statutory limit which is imposed on the amount of subsidy which can be given, by &#163;1,500,000, bringing it up to &#163;3,000,000. In connection with that, I would like to draw attention to the three general principles which have been laid down by the Government in connection with the expenditure of public money on these services. They will be found in paragraph 12 of the Government's observations. It will be seen, first of all, that the limits within which expenditure can be incurred are very clearly envisaged; secondly, that when we come to decide between competing projects we must have in mind two main considerations: first,\n\nthe importance of maintaining and developing air communications within the Empire, and, secondly, the importance of selecting at the appropriate time routes which afford the opportunity of substantial traffic and revenue where important British commercial interests are involved. The third principle is that in deciding upon the ways in which the Government can best encourage the development and production of civil aircraft, we shall seek the co-operation of the air operating companies and also act in close consultation with Sir Charles Bruce-Gardner, who is the independent chairman of the Society of British Aircraft Constructors.<br\/>\nI now come to the third category, on which I need not say very much, because we have agreed to accept the recommendations of the committee both as to the number of companies who should operate and also as to the allotment of routes. As will be seen from the report, both Imperial Airways and British Airways arc-ready to fall in with the suggestions made by the committee, and so I think that we may take that particular matter as settled. I think that the policy which has now been followed for some considerable time of concentrating upon Empire routes and thereby attracting to those routes the greater part of the money which is available has proved right, and the maintenance of these Empire routes should and must be made the first charge upon any money which may be available in future from the Exchequer.<br\/>\nI come to the last category, which has reference to the administrative organisation of these two companies. It is fair to recall that while the committee are strongly critical of the management of Imperial Airways, they also find, as will be seen in paragraph 46 of the report, that they have carried air passengers in safety and in comfort and have conveyed mails and freight with considerable efficiency. It may also be noted that their findings on the allegations of defects in equipment are all favourable to the company. Furthermore, we should remember that whatever may have been the faults of this company, we have, through its agency, established now a network of air communications which connect up the Empire and which have reduced the time of postal and personal communication by air from weeks to days. There is a twice-weekly service to South\n\n\nAfrica, a twice-weekly service to Singapore, and a four-times-weekly service to India, and all these are carrying mails without extra charge and with a gain in speed, which, I think, will be very valuable for social and commercial intercourse. There are plans, as the House knows, for bringing these services during the present year to Australia, Hong Kong, and New Zealand, and at the same time preparations are being made to bridge the Atlantic through Canada and the United States, for which purpose, as my hon. and gallant Friend said yesterday, there have been some extremely successful experimental flights already made. Finally, steps are being taken to connect up the West African Colonies by a new air route down the West coast of Africa, which may subsequently be expected to cross the Atlantic to South America.<br\/>\nThese are plans and achievements of very considerable scope, and they have hardly yet received as much attention as they deserve. We in this country have a habit of concentrating upon our shortcomings and overlooking our achievements, and there might be a good deal to be said for that point of view, but when you come to make a general stocktaking, it is only fair to bring in what there is to bring in on the credit side. It is only fair to do justice to those who, in this great development of joining up the various parts of the Empire have given a great deal of their time and labour, and, indeed, in many cases, have risked their lives. There is no doubt that Imperial Airways have set up a fine record for safety, and they have shown a quiet efficiency in taking over these mail services and in carrying them on with a punctuality which is even comparable to the old shipping companies in days gone by. I think that I ought also to call attention to the fact that the Post Office has played no mean part in this development. Under my right hon. Friend the Minister of Health, and under the present Postmaster-General, there has been a very striking development of policy. They have given the lead to the whole world in the policy of what we call an \"all up\" air mail. That great, and I was going to say sudden, advance has been comparable in postal history to the achievements of Roland Hill in establishing penny postage and certainly in any tribute to the recent progress in\n\ncivil aviation, the part played by the Post Office ought not to be left out of account.<br\/>\nHaving said so much in fairness to those concerned, there still remains the fact that the Committee have shown themselves extremely critical of the internal management and administration of Imperial Airways. They have made a number of recommendations for alterations which apply to Imperial Airways or to British Airways or to both. The Government in general agree with these recommendations. We think they are right in principle. We have been in communication with the two companies, and it is very satisfactory to know that, so far from resisting or setting themselves in opposition to these proposals, they have readily accepted them, and they will very shortly be carried out.<br\/>\nThere is one matter to which, I think, I ought to make some reference, and that is the opinion in paragraph 108 of the report that there should be a limitation of dividends of these companies on the lines of public utility companies. The Government are in sympathy with what they understand to be the general principle underlying that recommendation, and that is, that public money ought not to be used for the purpose of raising dividends to undue levels. That is the principle by which we have been guided in our negotiations with these companies, but of course, one has to take into account that they have been under the necessity of raising considerable sums of money from the public, and that in any enterprise of this scope and of this novelty, there is an exceptional element of risk which must not be lost sight of. Perhaps those considerations may justify the raising of dividends somewhat higher than is customary in the case of ordinary public utility companies. At the same time the Government, as I say, are in sympathy with this principle and we have stated in the observations that we will consider, in the light of these recommendations, whether, in connection with further assistance which we give by way of subsidy, we cannot give effect to them without the violation of existing contracts.<br\/>\nThere are in Part III a number of minor recommendations which hon. Members will, no doubt, have read carefully, and for the most part there, also, we are in agreement with the recommendations of the committee. We have, in fact,\n\n\naccepted practically everything of importance in the report. I do not think that there could ever have been a case in the recollection of any hon. Member where a report so outspoken in its terms and so far-reaching in its recommendations has been presented in so short a time and has met with so large a measure of acceptance by the Government of the day. I feel that hon. Members will recognise that the Government in this matter have been actuated entirely by the desire which they share with the whole House to try to remedy defects which have been shown to have occurred in the past. We sincerely wish to see British prestige in civil aviation raised to the highest point that is conceivable, and we believe that by the co-operation of the Government, the operating companies, and the Society of Aircraft Constructors through their independent chairman, Sir Charles Bruce-Gardner, we shall succeed in due course in enabling British civil aviation to establish for itself as high a reputation as has already been earned by the British Mercantile Marine.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>All types ordered under the expansion programme. The policy can thus be said to be working freely and satisfactorily. I have spent a long time on the material side of the expansion programme. Of equal importance is the personnel side&#8212;the provision of personnel, its training and its welfare. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for War said the other day, to this aspect of the programme I turn with pleasure and satisfaction.<br\/>\nBetween April, 1935, and March, 1938, 4,500 pilots and 40,000 airmen and boys entered the Royal Air Force. That means an average per year of 1,500 pilots and 13,000 airmen, compared with a typical pre-expansion year of 300 pilots and 1,600 airmen. The Cranwell programme for 1938 comprises 75 entrants, compared with an average pre-expansion figure of 56. This entry includes a number of aircraft apprentices and of nominated Dominions candidates.<br\/>\nAs regards the short service programme, in the year 1937&#8211;38 all our requirements were filled by January this year. In the forthcoming year we estimate for an entry of 1,368, compared with 1,190 in 1937. The continued response of entrants from the Dominions&#8212;many of whom come here on their own initiative&#8212;has been very satisfactory and is indeed gratifying. The 1938 programme for airmen stands at 17,000, compared with 14,700 in 1937, and our 1938 requirements include an increase in apprentices and boys and entrants for the fitter group. These figures show the demand which is being made in the field of eligible candidates. The standard of education and personality has, so far, been maintained both for officers and airmen. In the forthcoming year, the age for boy entrants is to be reduced from 15&#190; to 15.<br\/>\nI wish to emphasise strongly the need for skilled men. The need for skilled men is not confined to productive industry. Maintenance and repair of machines continues to be a matter of highest importance. With the need for skilled men in view, another depot equivalent to that at Halton, for fitters, fitter-armourers, instrument makers and apprentices is being established at Cosford. Although requirements in the past year have been satisfied, I would urge the importance of public support being continued to the full.<br\/>\nI now come to the question of pay. I was glad to be able to announce last week a change in the married emoluments of married airmen over 26 on similar lines to those announced for the Army by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for War. At present, married soldiers and airmen over 26 years of age receive, if not on the married establishment, marriage allowance of 7s. a week, or 10s. a week if on low rates of pay, plus allowances for children. Entry to the married establishment does not normally take place until the completion of 12 years' service, and entitles the man either to married quarters and fuel and light if quarters are available, or, alternatively, to special allowances plus allowances for children. In place of this dual system it has been decided that all married airmen over the age of 26 shall in future receive a family allowance consisting of 17s. a week (except when provided\n\nwith quarters) and additions for children at the present rates. The allowance will be slightly higher for flight sergeants and warrant officers. This change will take effect from the 28th April this year. Regarding pay, the existing rates are generally considered adequate, but certain increases in the rates for the lowest trade group (Group V) in the ranks of corporal and below will be introduced with effect from the 30th April. Certain small improvements will be made from the same date as regards other trade groups&#8212;broadly an extra 3d. a day for aircraftmen first and second class with some other minor adjustments.<br\/>\nI should like to say a word in particular about the Auxiliary Air Force, and to give them credit for the amount of work which they perform, far in excess of any obligations which they may undertake. The Auxiliary Air Force squadrons occupy a proud position as first-line units. The need for operational efficiency is correspondingly high. Anyone visiting these squadrons can see that the members realise it, and work accordingly. All the conditions in connection with the Auxiliary Air Force are now being carefully examined by a committee at the Air Ministry. The Balloon Section, which forms a part of the Auxiliary Air Force, has, I think, in the public estimation at the moment a special operational interest. It is necessary first of all to get somewhat numerous regular personnel trained. Both regular personnel and the equipment are now ready. Sites for all the four centres have been chosen and the establishment of the first centre is imminent. Recruiting for the auxiliary personnel (over 5,000) will start shortly, and indeed preliminary registration of applicants is taking place already.<br\/>\nAnother problem of co-ordination and balancing the various parts of the programme is with regard to reserves. The more our Air Force expands, the more reserves we shall want. But equally, the more the Air Force expands the greater is the necessity for retaining certain people in it, with the consequent adverse effect on our reserves. What might otherwise seem a vicious circle is being successfully broken by the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. Compared with the forecast for last year of 800 pilots, well over 1,000 joined. The Volunteer Reserve shows a definitely encouraging prospect.<br\/>\nThe strain of the expansion programme raises special questions of the welfare of personnel, and much praise is due to the spirit with which the men in many of the stations are meeting conditions attendant on life in temporary accommodation. The steady increase in permanent building contributes perhaps more than anything to relieve these conditions. One of the most difficult problems of temporary accommodation has been, in many cases, the absence either of married quarters at the station, or anything like suitable accommodation in the immediately surrounding district, often isolated and rural. Consequently an arrangement has been made during the past year whereby, under certain conditions, either transport has been provided or necessary allowances to cover transport of airmen travelling to and from their homes.<br\/>\nWith regard to training, the House already knows that elementary training of short service officers&#8212;the term \"elementary\" takes the place of <i>ab initio<\/i>&#8212;is carried out at civil flying training schools. Between the inception of this scheme of training in August, 1935, and 31st December, 1937, a total of 3,330 pupils have passed through these schools, of whom approximately 84 per cent. passed on to Service flying training schools. The average standard of pupils passing out from Service flying training schools in 1937 was higher than in 1936. This is due partly to improved equipment at the schools and partly to the experience which is being gained of this system of training.<br\/>\nGreat importance is attached to navigation and blind flying. The supply aspect of instruments has already been dealt with. Instrument flying is now taught in the normal sequence of flying instruction at flying training schools. So also, is night flying. No matter how expert a pilot may be in instrument flying, constant practice is necessary if he is to retain his efficiency. With this end in view a very satisfactory adjunct to actual practice in the air has been found in the Link Trainer. A considerable number of these instruments have been ordered and are in course of delivery to stations. By the end of March all flying training schools, Cranwell and a number of other schools and stations will be equipped with one. Eventually at least one trainer will be provided for every flying station at home and overseas, including India and aircraft\n\ncarriers in the Fleet Air Arm. It is proposed to send the majority of pilots posted to bomber squadrons through a 10-weeks' navigation course on leaving flying training schools. When the expanded organisation comes into being at the School of Air Navigation next month the total output is estimated at nearly 700 a year.<br\/>\nA word on the subject of accidents, and I know the sympathy of the House goes to the relatives of those who have lost their lives. Let me dispose at once of the suggestion that they are due to lack of instruments. That is not so. Close examination as to the causes of accidents last year&#8212;and they are varied&#8212;discloses no predominant cause, nor does it indicate any particular variation from conclusions drawn in previous years. It is recognised that there is, by comparison, a dangerous period of his flying career through which a pilot necessarily passes, and this period can only be bridged by experience itself. Naturally everything possible is done to minimise accidents consistently with the performance of training. For instance, pilots posted to a squadron are not called on to fly an unfamiliar type solo without a prior period of dual instruction on that type. There is nothing to suggest that there is either more or less risk of fatal accidents on modern than on older types.<br\/>\nI have referred to the progress in permanent building. During 1937&#8211;38 permanent construction or reconstruction was completed at 12 stations and started at 24 more. During the forthcoming year 22 stations will reach completion, and at 18 more permanent construction will begin. The task of selecting numerous sites for the Royal Air Force expansion in such a comparatively small and highly developed island as ours has presented great difficulties. Sites either acquired or required for the current programme at home number several hundred. Some are big, some small; some very important, others less so&#8212;but each does constitute a potential difficulty. The Air Ministry authorities do, however, make every effort to consider other interests, both local and national. As a reinforcement to their efforts, the Ministry is fortunate enough to have lately secured the services of Professor Abercrombie, well known in the realm of town planning and rural preservation. This in itself should be a guarantee of endeavour.<br\/>\nWith regard to works services abroad, progress has been made in the provision of accommodation in the Far East. In Iraq, in accordance with the treaty with the Iraq Government, all units have now moved into the large station at Dhibban, except those which will remain at Basra and Shaibah. At Nairobi, where the squadron has the distinction of being the only one in the Royal Air Force stationed \"south of the line,\" a new aerodrome is being provided. Both the stations at Nairobi and in Iraq I had the good fortune to visit during a tour of inspection last autumn in the Middle East.<br\/>\nI would wish to say a word covering the operational work of the Royal Air Force abroad. On the North-West Frontier of India, apart from the normal duties of co-operation with the land forces, the Royal Air Force were employed extensively in transportation duties in South Waziristan. At one period Valentia aircraft were employed in carrying provisions, kit and mail to the garrison at Wana, comprising some 4,000 men and 1,000 animals. During the period from April to December a total of 260 tons of supplies and 4,400 personnel were transported by these aircraft. Not least was the advantage of being able to transport a number of sick and wounded in connection with these operations. In Palestine the Royal Air Force has co-operated with the authorities in locating and rounding up armed bands, and has also supplied protection to commercial road convoys. As I am now dealing with events overseas, may I express our gratitude for the generous gift of 2&#189; million dollars from the Rulers of the Federated Malay States towards the cost of additional squadrons to be stationed in Malaya.<br\/>\nAt the end of my Noble Friend's Memorandum comes meteorology, but that is not meant to signify its place in the order of importance; on the contrary. The increasing recognition of the value of meteorological research and information is shown by the fact that of all the various heads the estimate for this service shows the biggest percentage increase. By the end of the present financial year 21 new meteorological stations will have been opened. This has involved, and indeed is largely dependent on, the provision of additional staff and, as few new entrants have specialised knowledge of meteorology,\n\nis it necessary to train them before they can be placed in charge of stations or entrusted with the responsibility of issuing forecasts. The collection and collation of information is one thing, its speedy dissemination in a form easily understood and applied is another. This practical problem is being met by greater frequency, over a longer period, of broadcasts and the use of such devices as the teleprinter. The amount of valuable meteorological information at the disposal of pilots is nowadays not only extensive but increasing. The success of the Transatlantic flights is a proof of this.<br\/>\nIn the old classical story of the first legendary flight, Icarus, who was warned not to fly too high lest the sun melt the wax which cemented his wings, or too low lest the water damaged them, received in effect a meteorological warning, by the neglect of which he met with disaster. He had little excuse then; he would have less now.<br\/>\nWith regard to civil aviation, a full discussion will take place to-morrow, and hon. Members will no doubt prefer to confine their remarks to-day to Service questions. As these Estimates, however, cover civil aviation, I should like to deal briefly with it here. Further progress has been made with the Empire air mail scheme, and on 23rd February the second stage, which extends the scheme to Singapore, was commenced. It is anticipated that the full scheme, with through services to Australia, will be brought into operation during the forthcoming year. Survey work has been carried out in connection with the Trans-Tasman route, and negotiations between the Governments concerned are in progress.<br\/>\nIt is confidently hoped that the extension of the main Empire scheme to Sydney will be followed by a regular air service therefrom to New Zealand. Since December last Bangkok has been substituted for Penang as the junction on the main Empire route for Hong Kong. It is proposed to provide a more efficient service between Bangkok and Hong Kong by increasing the frequency of operation from once to twice weekly in each direction.<br\/>\nVery successful experimental flights were carried out on the North Atlantic route during 1937. Five round trips between Hythe and New York were successfully completed by Imperial Airways,\n\n\nusing modified Empire flying boats. Pan-American Airways also carried out two round flights. These flights, which, incidentally, included record crossings of the Atlantic, were without incident and provided a very considerable amount of useful data. It is interesting to note that the total route mileage of regularly operated British Empire routes during 1937 amounted to almost 80,000 miles&#8212;an increase of some 12,000 miles on the figure for 1936. The figures include regular internal routes in the United Kingdom.<br\/>\nWith regard to the recommendations of the report of the Maybury Committee, a comprehensive scheme for meteorological, wireless, and traffic control facilities, including the training of the necessary staff, is being proceeded with as rapidly as circumstances permit. The preparation of the Order-in-Council, required in order to set up the licensing authority for internal air routes, has involved consideration and solution of many legal and other problems. Further consultations have taken place with aerodrome owners and operating companies and the draft Order has now reached a final stage. Finally, substantial provision&#8212;amounting to &#163;200,000&#8212;has been made to cover existing items of development of civil aircraft, and to proceed with new items during the year.<br\/>\nI must now refer to the expenditure for the current financial year. It has been necessary to proceed with certain new works services for which provision was not made in the original Estimates for 1937, and whose start could not be delayed. The details of the works services in question are set out in the Estimate which has been issued, as well as certain variations from the original provision for other services. Savings are anticipated on various services, sufficient to meet the additional provision required. I accordingly present to the House a token Supplementary Estimate for &#163;100.<br\/>\nThis brings my review to an end. Throughout this review there must have been in the minds of hon. Members, as in my own, a realisation of that which cannot be directly assessed in terms of money or material, but without which money and material are of no avail. I refer to the spirit of all who have helped during the past year in this great endeavour. It is not for me to attempt\n\nto detail those to whom I refer, when such a task is impossible. I would rather let it go forth that the House recognises with gratitude, as I do, the untiring efforts and loyal services of those who have helped, in high position or in humble.<br\/>\nIn conclusion, let me say that the Air Force which we need with its functions of defence, counter-offence, reconnaissance, trade protection, and co-operation with the Navy and Army at home and overseas, must be viewed not merely in any mathematical computation but objectively in relation to the tasks which it has to perform. The Prime Minister in answer to a Parliamentary question last Thursday said:\n<q>The policy of the Government is to create an Air Force of such character and size as, having regard to all relevant circumstances, including the nature of our war problems and the extent and availability of our aggregated resources, will constitute an effective instrument for our purpose.\"&#8212;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 10th March, 1938; cols. 2106&#8211;7, Vol. 332.]<\/q>\nOur aggregated resources have many times in the past enabled this country to perform successfully heavy and difficult tasks, and will do so again. It is in that faith that to-day I present these Estimates to the House and give indication of further demands yet to come.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>Sometimes it is useful to give a general review of the different Votes. With the consent of the Committee I shall revert to the plan I originally suggested, but as there are many details it might be valuable to sum them up under different heads. The administrative heads are Foreign Office salaries and incidental expenses, A and D; then Diplomatic and Consular salaries and allowances, item O; and expenses in connection with pipes in Iraq, item YY. These particular administrative expenses are outlined in the Estimate. It will be seen that there is an additional sum required for Foreign Office salaries, and as shown on page 8 of the Estimate it is due to the increased provision required for the Passport Office owing to the issue of a larger number of passports. Extra staff had to be employed in the summer and considerable overtime was worked. The extra expenditure there was &#163;4,800.<br\/>\nThen there were the cost of additional staff and the extra pay necessitated by setting up the Committee for Non-Intervention in Spain. That extra cost con-\n\n\nsisted of the payment of an interpreter and of some extra typists, and there was some extra expenditure at the Foreign Office to meet the political situation abroad, which entailed the addition of one clerk in the News Department and extra help in the Registry and the Library. There is no very controversial question arising under these administrative heads. Hon. Members will see the total sum set out on page 7 of the Estimates. The Appropriations-in-Aid come to only &#163;10 less than these expenses and these are receipts from passport fees. Therefore the Committee are being asked to vote an extra sum of only &#163;10 under that head. Under head O, the other administrative question which we are considering, in the original Estimate for the general Consular Services&#8212;this excludes China&#8212;a reduction of &#163;20,000 was made in the total sum on account of savings caused by vacancies and leave of absence. It is now known that this saving will amount to only about &#163;10. In the main Estimates already presented the total is given each year, and from it a deduction is made owing to vacancies, but this deduction was in fact too much and therefore this sum is included.<br\/>\nWith regard to the other item, relating to pipes in Iraq, this is not a matter which need detain us very long. Certain waterpipes were taken over by the British forces in Basra during the War and the military authorities paid the full sum for them to the Civil authorities. It was used to help balance the Budget. It is now decided that it is time to repay the owner of those pipes and the sum is to be paid to the owner.<br\/>\nI now come to the points that arise in connection with Spain. The heads which I think it would be convenient to take are the application of the Non-Intervention Agreement, which is item RR; the contribution to the Red Cross, item WW; the evacuation of refugees, item XX; and arrangements preliminary to withdrawal, ZZ. I hope that it will be convenient to consider all the points connected with Spain in one block. Item RR, if read out, sounds very complicated, but the extra sum required can be fairly easily explained. The cost of both schemes of observation, on the Portuguese and the Spanish-French frontiers, originally amounted to &#163;834,000, with the addition of &#163;64,000 which the observation on the\n\nPortuguese-Spanish frontier was to cost, making a total of &#163;898,000. Of this 80 per cent. was to be met by the Big Five Powers. Great Britain, France, Italy, Germany and the Union of Soviet Republics. The share of each of the Big Five was to amount to &#163;143,680, that is 16 per cent. of the total sum referred to. In our case, as the whole of the cost of the observation on the Portuguese-Spanish frontier was to be borne by the British Government, we subtracted the &#163;64,000 which that observation was costing, and that has reduced our liability to &#163;79,680.<br\/>\nWe are told that &#163;48,000 will in fact be the cost of this observation on the Spanish-Portuguese frontier, so we should find that the Estimate should result in a repayment to the general fund of &#163;143,680, which would be our share of the general observation, of the sum of &#163;16,000. We have, however, included a figure here of &#163;12,000, because we do not anticipate that the total sum of &#163;16,000 will be necessary. Therefore, we are paying back &#163;12,000 with which we had credited ourselves on the strength of our taking over the observation on the Spanish-Portuguese frontier. The fact that this total sum for observation on the Spanish-Portuguese frontier is less than we had anticipated is largely due to the fact that observation has been in suspense, and it has not been found that the same amount of money was needed as was originally estimated.<br\/>\nNow I come to the head WW, which deals with the \"relief of distress in Spain\"&#8212;a contribution of &#163;5,000 to the Red Cross in Spain. His Majesty's Government, as is known, are signatories of the Geneva Red Cross Convention, and we received in June of last year an appeal from the International Red Cross Committee for financial assistance in the work undertaken by them on behalf of victims of the civil war in Spain. It was explained in that appeal that the funds available from other sources were not sufficient to enable the committee's work in Spain to be carried on. His Majesty's Government have always attached very considerable importance to the relief of non-combatants in Spain, and they have looked for any impartial scheme by which this could be carried out, a scheme on an international basis which might be agreeable to both the contending parties. I think it is well known to hon. Members what good work the International Red\n\n\nCross Committee does in regard to such questions as the supply of medical stores to both sides, the organisation of information bureaux, from which news of individual Spaniards may be obtained, the negotiation of exchanges of prisoners and hostages, the provision of evacuation facilities for the civil population of Madrid, and various forms of work on behalf of prisoners. Those are all duties which the International Red Cross has performed and is performing with success, so that in the light of the evidence given of their work, with the consent of both sides, and after taking steps to satisfy ourselves that a number of other Governments were making contributions, His Majesty's Government decided upon the contribution which is in this Supplementary Estimate. I would only add that this sum must not be taken by the Committee as being a final figure of what might be granted to the International Red Cross in this connection.<br\/>\nAnother heading under Spain is XX, \"evacuation of refugees.\" This refers to the evacuation of refugees from Madrid, and a sum of &#163;33,000 is included in the Supplementary Estimate. These refugees were evacuated from the foreign missions in Madrid, and this was a humanitarian step which resulted in the saving of many lives and was urged by His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Valencia. The Spanish Government were at that time conducting, under the auspices of the International Red Cross, negotiations with various foreign Governments for the issue of passports to all except men of military age, and between 8th November and 19th December a vessel which was chartered by us succeeded in evacuating no fewer, in all, than 4,100 civilian refugees, who reached the coast by motor services organised by the Acting British Consul at Madrid. I should like to pay a tribute to the authorities concerned and to His Majesty's Consular representatives, who so successfully carried out this excellent piece of work. In addition, there were certain expenses involved in transporting similar refugees in His Majesty's hospital ship \"Maine,\" a ship which some of us have heard of before. The work of the Navy in evacuating refugees is well known, and I do not think it needs any extra tribute of mine to the excellent work that has been done. I would only add that a considerable portion of this expenditure, I am pleased to\n\ntell the Committee, will be recoverable from the various Governments in whose missions the refugees were sheltered. Therefore, at a later date, Appropriations-in-Aid will include a sum which will help to repay the &#163;33,000 for which we are asking now.<br\/>\nI now come to the other heading relating to Spain, ZZ, which deals with preliminary arrangements for the evacuation and withdrawal of volunteers. This particular sum seems a very small one, but if the withdrawal of volunteers is successful, the question at issue is a very large one. In deference to what you said, Sir Dennis, I will restrict my observations to the question on the Paper, which is a request for the sum of &#163;800 for preliminary expenses connected with the withdrawal of volunteers, to which we all attach great importance, if we can make it successful. Pending a settlement of financial arrangements, certain preliminary expenses have been incurred, and these are expected to amount to a certain sum, of which this is a preliminary instalment. The actual expenses referred to here, namely, &#163;800, relate, I am told, to the appointment of a doctor who would advise as to the arrangements made for the creation, for example, of evacuation camps in connection with the withdrawal of these volunteers, and the Committee is being asked to vote this sum now in order that the preliminary arrangements for the withdrawal of volunteers can be proceeded with. I cannot go further into detail at this stage, but the whole question is an important one and is being considered in all its bearings by the Non-Intervention Committee.<br\/>\nLet me now tell the Committee something about the problems which arise in connection with China. The first point is a grant to our Ambassador at that time, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, which comes under the heading UU. I do not wish to recapitulate all the incidents which occurred at that time. His Majesty's Ambassador, as is known, was seriously wounded by a machine-gun bullet as a result of an attack by two Japanese planes. Let it be said that His Majesty's Government decided themselves to pay the grant for which we are asking the Committee, a sum of &#163;5,000, a grant which they consider is consonant with the importance of the occasion. I am happy to say that the ex-Ambassador's health is improving steadily, and we sincerely\n\n\nhope that it will be restored so as to enable him to continue to render that conspicuous service to the country which he has given in the past. I am sure the Committee will have pleasure in voting this sum of &#163;5,000 for the purpose which I have described.<br\/>\nI turn next to another heading under China, and that is VV, \"evacuation and maintenance of British refugees.\" This relates to the cost of transport to Hong Kong and the maintenance there of British subjects, mostly women and children, evacuated mainly from Shanghai on the outbreak of hostilities between China and Japan. At the time that this expenditure was incurred, the Committee will remember, there appeared to be considerable ground for thinking that the international settlement south of the Soochow Creek might be endangered by land and air hostilities and that, therefore, the safety of the inhabitants of the international settlement might be jeopardised. British subjects were therefore advised to leave without delay, and approximately 3,800 women and children and 300 men, all in straitened circumstances, were removed, thanks to the arrangements made by our Consular representatives, to whom I would like to pay a further tribute at this moment. Their work has been extremely hard, they have not known any regular hours, and their responsibility has been immense.<br\/>\nWe are asking for a Supplementary Estimate of &#163;15,000 for this purpose. Before these refugees were evacuated they were asked to undertake to repay the cost of passage and the cost of their maintenance on their arrival in Hong Kong, but, as I have described to the Committee, many of them being in straitened circumstances, they were unable to pay the preliminary expense themselves. There has also been a certain amount of forced evacuation from their homes of British subjects who fled up the river to Hankow, away from the tide of war advancing up the Yangtze. I can assure the Committee at this stage that the future position in Hankow will be carefully watched, and in particular the possibility of establishing a zone which will be free, as far as possible, from the operations of war if they ever reach that city.<br\/>\nThe last heading in relation to China is QQ, on which there is an anticipated\n\nshortage of receipts of fines and fees for services in China in consequence of the Sino-Japanese dispute. That shortage is quite understandable, since the normal activities of peace have been suspended, and all types of Consular fees for services, visas, and so on have not come in to the normal extent.<br\/>\nNow let me deal with the last Supplementary Estimate, which relates to the expenditure needed to settle satisfactorily the Assyrians on the Khabur settlement. The details of that will be found on page 15 of the Supplementary Estimates. The problem of the Assyrians has been a difficult one, but it is not for me to outline the whole history of the case this afternoon. We are looking for a solution. No solution can be completely satisfactory, but we hope that some success will attend the establishment of about 9,000 Assyrians on the Khabur settlement. Let me remind the Committee that after the unhappy incidents of 1933 the Assyrian Committee of the League Council considered the question, and searches were made all over the world, including the British Colonial Empire, for a place where they could be settled. Hopes were finally placed on the Ghab scheme in the French Mandated Territory of Syria. This, unfortunately, had to be abandoned in July, 1936, owing to the sudden change in the Syrian political situation, due to the approaching termination of the French Mandate in Syria, and efforts were made to solve the problem in another way.<br\/>\nAs the result of a visit of the French and British members of the Assyrian Committee in the early summer of last year, a scheme in north-east Syria was elaborated which could be expected to give a good chance of economic prosperity for settlers. A definite decision was reached by the League Council in September to reorganise the River Khabur scheme on a permanent basis. We undertook to pay about 43 per cent. of the cost, Iraq undertook to pay a similar amount, and the League the rest, amounting to just under 15 per cent. This &#163;4,000 is a preliminary contribution to the amount deemed necessary to proceed with the work, and which will mostly consist of water wheels, and so forth, to enable cultivation to be undertaken by the settlers. The Committee is being asked on this Estimate for an extra sum of only &#163;10 owing to the fact that there have been various savings on the contri-\n\n\nbution towards expenses in connection with the League of Nations, such as savings on exchange in buying Swiss francs, on travelling expenses, and on the piece of sculpture for the new League of Nations building.<br\/>\nTo conclude the story of the Khabur scheme, in which the Committee has already taken a great interest, the total required at this stage will be &#163;4,000, and that is, as I have explained, offset by certain savings. The ultimate expenditure on the Khabur scheme is expected to be &#163;18,000. That is not nearly so much as the Ghab scheme would have been because the drainage and communication charges are not so much. It is hoped that this scheme will give a better economic future for the Assyrians outside Iraq who have been settled there since 1933, and some since 1936. I feel sure the Committee will have no hesitation in voting this small extra sum or the other sums referred to under the many heads I have had to cover. I would remind the Committee that they have covered administrative questions; questions relating to Spain, chiefly the evacuation of refugees; questions relating to China, and especially the sum to be paid to our Ambassador; and, in conclusion, there has been an amount necessary for the settlement of the Assyrians.<\/p>",

It is a wholly good thing that you should centralise the separation of crude oil into petrol, oil for ships, and so on. That form of rationali-\n\n\nsation should make for better labour conditions and for more stable conditions generally. But, under the conditions which operate among the exploration companies, the cost of living is, of course, much higher than in the agricultural part of the country, where there are plenty of gardens, plenty of produce and the like. I have been struck by the reports which have come in about nutrition in these places. One of the troubles which capital has to face and which we all have to face in Trinidad is not so much undernutrition as thoroughly bad nutrition from the point of view of efficiency. If there are not to be endless troubles over cost of living indices, it must be made clear that it is in the interest of employers that they should make sure that their workers get good, nutritious food, and, above all, locally grown food, because in the tropics freshness is worth everything. When it is very hot, you do not want heating food, but you want, particularly, mineral salts, vitamins, proteins and the like; the calorific values by which we assess the needs of people in our climate do not operate in the tropics, where conditions are quite different, and where the metabolism of individual bodies is quite different. I am sure we shall learn a great deal from this report and the attention it has drawn to that subject. Another subject is housing. Tribute has been paid by the Commissioners to the Apex Company in particular.<br\/>\nI am sure that the whole organisation&#8212;and I shall have a difficult time over this&#8212;of the medical department in Trinidad has got to be improved, and improved quickly. It is impossible to allow doctors who are carrying out their duty to the State of insisting on the standards laid down by the State with regard to housing and sanitation to be at the same time in private practice and in receipt of private fees, either from employers or anybody else. I shall be accused of forcing D.P.H. men and the like on the Colony, but I am determined to do it. To my mind it is essential that the major recommendations of the report should be carried out.<br\/>\nThe hon. Member for Rothwell (Mr. Lunn) spoke about labour departments. I entirely agree. I think it is most unfortunate that we have not had a labour department in the Island of Trinidad before this. We have got many of them\n\nentirely as the result of the despatch of 1935, though the germs of some of them existed before. We now have actually established labour organisations in Ceylon, British Malaya, Hong Kong, Malta, Tanganyika, Kenya, Nyasaland, St. Vincent, British Guiana, St. Lucia, the Solomon Islands and the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. I am in correspondence with the local governments, but there is a difficulty in obtaining men&#8212;we may have to appoint them and train them on the job&#8212;in the case of the Gold Coast, Northern Rhodesia, Uganda, Mauritius&#8212;I have telegraphed for a man for Mauritius&#8212;and Grenada. These I will consider later.<br\/>\nI rejoice in having obtained the services of Mr. Lindon to go out immediately and take up the post recommended by the Commission. He was originally a docker, a colleague of Mr. Ernest Bevin in the trade union movement. Later he took up advisory work under the Ministry of Munitions, and has since done most valuable service as a conciliation officer in the Ministry of Labour. I was very lucky to get him for Trinidad. I impressed upon him how vital I thought it was in the interests of everyone that there should be properly organised trade unions in Trinidad and proper machinery for the adjustment of grievances in relation to wages, hours and the like. I am perfectly certain that the one chance of getting better conditions in Trinidad, after what the Government, Mr. Lindon and the trade unions can do for themselves, is to get it perfectly clearly understood by the local managers of these big companies that it is in their interest that it should not be merely a question of so many cents an hour, but that it is to their interest that the wage-earners in their employ should feel that they are real partners in the industry, and that human treatment is much more important than anything else. It is human treatment by the management on the spot that is, to my mind, the most vital thing of all.<br\/>\nSome hard things have been said about me to-night. I do not want to keep the Committee, but I must meet the criticisms that have been made of me&#8212;the criticisms of my treatment of Sir Murchison Fletcher, the criticisms, particularly by the hon. Member for Roth-well, about the sending of troops, and the criticism that I have prevented in some way or other the taking of action\n\n\nby the Government of Trinidad before the outbreak of the trouble. I want to say quite definitely that in all these matters I am quite clear in my own mind that I never restrained the Government of Trinidad from putting into force any of the statutory powers which they already possessed; not only that, but I never turned down a single request that they made, and I would go further and say that I saw Sir Murchison Fletcher before he took over the Governorship of Trinidad, to which he was appointed on the recommendation of my predecessor. I told him about the existence of the Labour party, and of my view that there was need for social reform in Trinidad. I impressed that upon him before he went out, and he must have known that. I am sure he knew that, in anything he proposed for action, he would have had my most active support in that direction. I am quite sure he knew that; I made it abundantly clear to him before he went out.<br\/>\nQuite frankly, I was in this difficult position. Sir Murchison Fletcher was appointed by His Majesty on the recommendation of my predecessor, Mr. J. H. Thomas, about six months before I became Secretary of State for the Colonies, and he was on leave in this country. Not only was he here, but there was a deputation to Mr. Thomas from people in Fiji. There was a great shoal of Indian written representations, and two Europeans had come all the way to protest to me against Sir Murchison Fletcher's efforts, and the recommendations he had made to my predecessor and to me, to do away with elected representation in Fiji. I listened to Sir Murchison Fletcher, and he pressed that on me, but I overruled him. I did not agree with his proposal to do away with elections for Indians and Europeans in the colony of Fiji. The mere fact that I took that line in regard to Fiji must have shown him perfectly clearly what my views were. I have been accused of treating him badly. I have not got it on my conscience in the least that I have treated him badly. If he is criticised by the report, so am I, and I profoundly regret that, now that he is no longer in the Service, and is a free man, he thinks it necessary in certain particulars to challenge the findings of this Commission. I am perfectly clear that I can have no part or lot in that. If he wishes to publish his criticisms of the\n\nCommission, he may use his rights as an independent citizen of this country to criticise them, and say where and how; but it is not for me to lay before Parliament the complaints of Sir Murchison Fletcher with regard to the Commission.<br\/>\nLet me say a word about how this Commission was composed. The decision to send out the Commission arose from representations made in this House by hon. Members opposite. I want to make it clear that no Governor and no Secretary of State is, or should be, immune from the criticism of an independent Commission. That criticism is the duty of a Commission if they think it is in the public interest to make it. You may agree with their findings or not, but it is their duty to criticise where they think that criticism is necessary. How was this Commission composed? The Chairman, as is well known, was acting here as chairman of the Industrial Court during the absence of Sir Harold Morris. He is a man of long service in connection with these matters. As to the second member of the Commission, I wrote to the Leader of the Opposition, and agreed with him that I should write to Sir Walter Citrine and leave it to the trade union movement of this country to nominate the second member of the Commission.<\/p>",

Members on both sides of the House compelled me to put it forward to-day. I take that as an indication of general support for such a Motion. Indeed, I cannot doubt that were it put forward in the form of a petition we should have had no difficulty in collecting a number of signatures, even more impressive than that which was appended to the petition presented to the House an hour ago, for the matter is one which is deeply exercising the minds of a very large body of industrialists and of workpeople. I count myself fortunate in having the opportunity to put forward this Motion, which appeared on the Order Paper on 10th November in the name of my hon. Friend the senior Burgess for Dundee (Miss Horsbrugh), but was not discussed owing to the lamented death of a former Prime Minister, to whom we owe, more perhaps than to any other single man, the fact that a tariff policy was introduced into this country in 1931. I have had little time to study the question, and I must ask the indulgence of the House if I rely more than usual on notes. May I begin with a brief declaration of faith?<br\/>\nI believe that self-sufficiency, more particularly in the matter of manufactured articles, is a good thing, and that we should seek to maintain, within our own borders, as much as possible of the manufacturing activity necessary to meet our own needs. I want to see tariffs as high as is necessary to equalise the difference between our own standard of living and that of potential importers,\n\nbut not so high as to exclude a fair element of competition. Individual freedom, which it is our duty in this House to maintain, and which we so greatly prize, depends largely on the ability of every man and woman, in whatever walk of life, to choose freely by what type of employment they will earn their living, and, in particular, on what types of skilled employment are open to them. We are rightly proud that in this country, as perhaps in no other, there is a wide choice of skilled occupation open to every man and woman. If we regard that freedom as worth having, we must foster it by a deliberate tariff policy.<br\/>\nEconomics is in the ultimate resort a branch of aesthetics not merely a matter of cash. We can have what we like provided we want it sufficiently and are willing to go without other things. Our social services cost us &#163;500,000,000 a year. I want to see them extended, developed and improved, but it is impossible to do that unless we protect ourselves against the uncontrolled, and sometimes catastrophic, importation of goods from countries overseas, whether British or foreign, with lower standards of social obligation, which is not quite the same thing as a lower standard of living. Our social services assume a fair regularity of employment and short periods of unemployment. There is a popular song in Germany, which, being translated, reads:\n<q>Our land and homes our children shall inherit,<\/q><q>We by our work their gratitude shall merit.<\/q>\nWe must look beyond the present. Our children have a greater claim upon us than our contemporaries. We have but a few years to live; they have to carry the burden in the future. We should not seek an extra pair of boots, an extra garment or an extra meal for ourselves by a policy which will prejudice the future of our children. Our tariff policy, framed in 1931, has now been in force for six years. Every depression that has hit this country has originated abroad and one wave after another has struck us. We have been, to a large extent, immune, and we have recovered from that depression mainly because of the tariff wall&#8212;not anything like as strong as many of us would wish&#8212;which we then erected. We ought to have the power to insulate ourselves, as far as is possible, from hurricanes originating\n\n\nabroad&#8212;the consequences of political incapacity or commercial greed, and particularly the latter&#8212;in other countries.<br\/>\nThe tariff policy of 1931 has been an immense success. It is not a high tariff. The junior Member for Dundee (Mr. Foot), addressing this House on 22nd December, 1937, suggested that it was higher than that of most foreign countries, and averaged no less than 26.9 per cent. He was quoting figures&#8212;not his own&#8212;but they misled him. They consisted of a comparison of total Customs revenue relatively to the retained imports of 1935, but, in point of fact, the vast proportion of those Customs duties were upon petroleum, tobacco, beer, and wines and spirits, which are not, in fact, protective revenues at all. They are really straight revenue-producing taxation which we should not modify under any Free Trade policy whatever.<br\/>\nOur tariff revenue resulting from a protective tariff policy does not amount to more than &#163;49,000,000 a year, that is to say, approximately 7 per cent. of our retained imports of &#163;702,000,000, a figure probably lower than that of any country in Europe. There were other duties which the hon. Member mentioned such as tobacco, sugar, tea, coffee, which are really not protective but primarily revenue-producing duties intended as a direct tax upon the consumers. A tariff revenue of &#163;49,000,000 is not, in my submission, under present conditions, sufficiently high.<br\/>\nI have said that our tariff policy has been a success. In 1931, our exports were &#163;390,000,000; in 1937 they rose to &#163;521,000,000. In 1931 our exports of manufactures were &#163;292,000,000; in 1937 &#163;404,000,000. Employed persons in 1931 numbered 9,500,000, and by 1937 they had risen to 11,500,000, and of these my impression is that at least 600,000 were directly employed in manufacturing goods which are being protected by a moderate protective tariff. In 1931 our production of coal was 220,000,000 tons, and in 1937, 247,000,000 tons. The gloomy prophecies of which so much was heard in this House in 1931 when the tariff was introduced have been falsified at every point. In spite of the rise in prices, the food index figure stands to-day at 45 points above 1914, as compared with 59 in 1929. It is true that it was as low as 32 in 1931, but at what a cost of misery. Is there anybody\n\nwho would wish to go back to 1931, with its low prices and low employment?<br\/>\nImperial Preference has been a resounding success. Exports to British countries are up &#163;78,000,000 since 1931; imports from British countries, &#163;158,000,000 since 1931. Yet we have maintained and increased our foreign trade. Our foreign exports are up by &#163;65,000,000 since 1931, and our imports by &#163;10,000,000. But our retained imports of competitive manufactures in 1937 were 32 per cent. higher in volume than in 1935, and higher than in 1924. Is this the moment for weakening our tariff against the cold winds which will come, I fear, against us with hurricane force? The answer is to be found in the Ministry of Labour Gazette. With 1,500,000 persons unemployed we can afford to take no risks, so long as our recovery has not reached the point at which we can reduce our unemployment below that figure.<br\/>\nThe fundamental reason for exports is to purchase what we cannot ourselves produce or make. Great Britain, with the exception of coal, has nothing to export except the skill of her people. Our capacity for trading abroad consists of our ability to export coal and manufactured goods, assisted by invisible exports such as shipping services, which are being steadily undermined by half-a-dozen governments, led by the United States of America, who are subsidising their shipping and seeking to drive our shipping off the ocean so far as they can. The French Government are also considering further great subsidies, and there are other States&#8212;Russian, German, Italian, and others&#8212;all determined, unless we can take counter measures, or enter into mad competition, to reduce still further our invisible exports. If we import more competitive manufactures than are absolutely necessary, we are wasting our buying capacity and adding to our costs. The annual cost of supporting 1,500,000 unemployed in decent penury&#8212;and we do not suggest that it is more than that&#8212;is &#163;75,000,000. The real cost in misery and in the waste of human material is not to be calculated in terms of money. Men and women cannot&#8212;and even less to-day than formerly&#8212;quickly transfer their acquired skill from one industry to another. Each smitten industry leaves a long trail of distress behind it. Against these violent fluctuations the tariff wall we have is small enough, and there are\n\n\ngreat anxieties abroad among the commercial community lest we should be led by distributors and financiers and those of the community to whom production is of no particular account, to lower that wall, in the vain hope that other nations will imperil their own slender degree of prosperity in order to encourage ours.<br\/>\nI have spoken of invisible exports. The shipping service is one of them. Another is the produce of our loans abroad. Sir Robert Kindersley has recently drawn attention to the steady shrinkage of the sums which we may expect to receive, and which we have received in the past few years, from this source. If I remember aright he said that last year our available receipts from that source were &#163;76,000,000 less than in the previous year, and they are likely to go down yet further. I see no likelihood of any considerable recovery. In these circumstances it is doubly dangerous for us to seek to encourage an import trade for which we may soon be unable to pay&#8212;extra imports, which, I would add, tend in time of relative prosperity to consist largely of luxury goods. We paid &#163;175,000,000 in 1937 for competitive manufactures. Add to this &#163;75,000,000 paid for unemployment, and you have a total of &#163;250,000,000, four-fifths of the total value of all the raw materials imported into this country for the purpose of our industry.<br\/>\nThese figures indicate that the situation, while it is far better than it was, is still dangerous, and that it is most unwise for us to contemplate any considerable reduction of our tariffs or any considerable increase of our imports. Let me give a few examples. We purchased in machinery &#163;11,000,000 more in 1937 than in 1935. That is more than double as much. The imports of carpets increased by 1,500,000 square yards in the last two years at an additional cost of nearly &#163;1,000,000. Carpets from India rose by 150,000 square yards. I have spent years in India. I know how those carpets are made, under what conditions, and I do not like them. I do not envy those who would seek to bring the level of our industries down to the level under which only too many of those carpets are made. In 1937 the total of paper and cardboard of all sorts imported was 26,000,000 cwts., 5,000,000 cwts. more than in 1935, at an increased cost of nearly &#163;4,000,000. All of\n\nthat paper and cardboard could have been made in this country, with advantage to our own trade.<br\/>\nFor rubber footwear, a comparatively small item but with a very large factor of personal employment, the figures are astounding. In 1937 we imported 915,000 dozen pairs, an increase of 400,000 dozen pairs compared with 1935. We imported 2&#189; pairs for every boy and girl between the ages of five and fifteen, almost all from Canada and Hong Kong. We could and should have produced them in this country. I see little value in a foreign trade which consists of bringing rubber shoes from Hong Kong, where wages are based on the very lowest price of labour payable to Chinese, who are themselves living largely outside our control in conditions which we could not for a moment consider for our own people.<br\/>\nOn the agricultural side our imports of eggs, every one of which we could produce better ourselves, are larger than ever, and they come for the most part from countries with a standard of living far lower than that I should like to see here. We are apt to regard Denmark as a country with a relatively high standard of living. Let those hon. Members who wish to see how far Denmark has that higher standard go to a Danish farm and see the conditions under which agricultural labourers live. Those conditions would not be tolerated here for a moment. Our imports of cream leaped from the prewar figure of 8,700 cwts. to 75,000 cwts., and less than half of it came from the Empire. Butter imports, pre-war, were 4,000,000 cwts.; in 1935 imports reached 10,000,000 cwts. Condensed skimmed milk, of little food value, represented 600,000 cwts. pre-war, and in 1935 1,500,000 cwts., and less than 5 per cent. came from the British Empire. Yet our cow population has gone up by less than 2 per cent. since the Milk Marketing Board was established.<br\/>\nThe agricultural industry is still suffering depression. There are fewer men on the land year by year, and fewer acres under cultivation, and yet the agricultural industry is one in which, although the wages are unduly low, there is greater permanence of employment than in any other branch of industry. Farmers, far from making profits, can barely make both ends meet. What a different story they\n\n\nhave to tell from that of the great distributors and the great wholesale importers of foodstuffs for farmers, who in their annual reports regard a profit of 25 per cent. on the year's working as something about which not to boast, and express the hope it will be more next year. I doubt whether the farmers of any 10 counties of England make as much profit on the year's working, allowing &#163;5 a week for their own services, as is made by one large importing firm with a tenth as much capital as the farmers have invested.<br\/>\nWe can buy abroad only by exchanging goods or services. Of services I have spoken&#8212;shipping going down, invisible exports from our loans going down. The profits of insurance and similar services seem unlikely to increase, for restrictive legislation is being imposed in almost every country, making it more difficult for firms to develop that very valuable form of business; and I see no likelihood of royalties on patents, or books, etc., increasing.<br\/>\nMay I say a few words regarding particular industries? I have some connection with the embroidery trade. It employs, I suppose, 6,000 or 8,000 hands, mostly young women. It is highly competitive. It has been protected for the past five years by a moderate tariff, on the strength of which firms engaged in the business have extended their factories, have spent large sums in purchasing machinery, and have trained girls and men in what is a highly skilled and delicate and thoroughly good type of employment. Their industry is now under a cloud, for they hear of negotiations with Switzerland and of attempts to procure a reduction of our tariffs. Is it in the interest of this country that a trade of that sort, already on a highly competitive basis, should be imperilled? It is a comparatively small thing, no doubt, if 8,000 women are working only half time or their number is reduced to 4,000 or 5,000, but there are few trades better suited for women in industrial areas, and it gives them a choice of occupation which on the social and the aesthetic side I regard as of great value. I hope that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for East Leicester (Mr. Lyons) will deal with the question of fabric gloves, and I have no doubt that the Seconder of the Motion will deal with the industries of\n\nher own constituency, in particular with jute.<br\/>\nWe hear rumours in the Press and elsewhere that one of the bases of the proposed trade agreement with America is that our market will be made more accessible than at present to the products of American motor factories. America already sells to us four times as much as she buys. What likelihood is there that our exports can be increased even to cover the value of the increase of cars imported? Do we really want more or cheaper cars? What will be the effect on the motor industry of this country, concentrated as it is in a very few localities? A public works policy will not help Coventry or Cowley, or Luton or Leicester. I earnestly hope that the interest of these great industries will not be imperilled. Our textiles, the luxury trades, the high-class goods trades, may or may not benefit by a change in tariff, but the 100,000 or 120,000 young men engaged in the motor industry cannot be readily transferred to the highly technical and delicate operations of the textile and leather industries, and the like.<br\/>\nHaving reached the position we have done, and trade having become more or less stabilised, it is, in my submission, far better to keep what we have got now, when trade has become accustomed to the tariff, than to enter into adventures which are causing grievous anxiety and are partly responsible for the present recession of trade, however slight it is. The threat of increasing importations is just as important a factor to-day as are the importations themselves. It is having the worst effect upon those very industries which have conduced most notably to the recovery of our trade in the past five years. It is the new trades which are going to be affected, not the old ones, and it is the new trades which have done so well&#8212;as is shown by the evidence given on behalf of the Ministry of Labour today before the Royal Commission on the Geographical Distribution of Population&#8212;which will particularly suffer if, as we fear, there is to be a substantial modification of our tariffs. I believe this to be above all the case in agriculture the plight of which is widely regarded by persons with no particular political views as being a real danger to our national welfare.<br\/>\nWhether in peace or war we must depend as far as we can on what our own\n\n\nsoil will produce with our own hands, on what we can get from our own mines, and above all from our technical knowledge and skill, the character and health of our fellows. These are great assets. No country in the world has better soil, better mines, no people has a higher character or greater skill. They are enjoying more protection than we realise from the tariff wall which was erected around this country by the wisdom of the Government of 1931. I see storms ahead in the new world as well as the old. No one can be unaware of the anxieties that beset the Government in many directions. I earnestly hope that in the negotiations to which they have put their hands they will bear in mind the terms of this Motion, and that they will remember that, having reached our present position, we desire, above all, stability. The safeguard which we need is not a lower but a higher tariff, and an assurance that those tariffs which we already enjoy will not be altered.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>We are about to rise for the Christmas vacation and we find a world very little in accord with the peaceful traditions of the season. We have war raging in Spain and in the Far East. There are grave incidents and grave controversies. Since we last discussed foreign affairs there have been a good many happenings. There have been important conversations. There have been the Hitler-Halifax conversations. There has been a series of visits to the Continent&#8212;[<i>Interruption<\/i>.]&#8212;yes, and I have been to Spain. There have been important visits. We have had important visits from French Ministers and from foreign monarchs. A leading Power, Italy, has left the League of Nations. There are matters which give rise to grave anxiety to-day, and it is right that we should have a statement of Government policy. I hope that the Prime Minister will be able to give the people of this country some hope. I believe that there is a need for a general review of the situation. I notice that one of the Government papers even wanted to make the Prime Minister's speech for him. That is quite unnecessary. A leading article in the \"Times\" sets out that there is no real need for a Debate. [HON. MEMBERS: \"Hear, hear.] Yes, there is need for a Debate, because there are grave differences in this House on questions of foreign affairs. Reference has been made to previous periods in our history when there was general agreement on foreign affairs between the two sides of the House, but that does not exist to-day.<br\/>\nThe actual events occurring in the world are important, but I want specially to stress the general trend of events, and to ask whither this country is going. I want to ask whether we are being steered to a port and, if so, what port, or whether we are drifting. The wars in Spain and in the Far East are only symptoms of very unstable world conditions. Last week we called attention in this House to the plight of the distressed areas as being grave problems in themselves, but as symptomatic of an unstable economic system. We were dealing with the symptoms and not with the disease. On that occasion we got a cheap and flippant\n\ndebating reply from the Secretary of State for Scotland which was quite unworthy of the right hon. Gentleman and of the gravity of the subject which we were discussing. I do not think that the Prime Minister will give us a mere debating speech this afternoon.<br\/>\nLet us glance at the main features. The Government have again and again declared that the League of Nations is the foundation stone of Government policy. We have now had Italy leaving the League. The United States have never belonged to it. Three great Powers have now left the League of Nations, and thereby have renounced the obligation not to use force as an instrument of policy. All those three States are, in varying degrees, engaged in aggression. They have all chosen the method of force, or the threat of force. I do not regret in the least Italy's departure from the League. Her presence had become a weakness, and not a source of strength, but the renunciation by three great Powers of the League of Nations and of the Covenant means that there is no peace in the world. The British philosopher Thomas Hobbes wrote, long ago:\n<q>The nature of war consists not in actual fighting but in the known disposition during all the time there is no assurance to the contrary.<\/q>\nWhen the League of Nations was at its full strength there was an assurance to the contrary. Ever since the invasion of Manchuria in 1931, we have, in the sense in which Hobbes used the term, been in a state of war. That is a matter of the gravest importance to this country and to the British Empire, because the preservation of world peace is the first interest of this country and of the British Empire. I say the peace of the world, and not merely the peace of the country or of the British Empire. It is the maintenance of peace throughout the world that is of importance to us. We cannot disregard war in any part of the world.<br\/>\nI want to draw the attention of the Government to one particular example of war mentality that we have to face, and that is the world-wide propaganda that is going on. I remember that when I first came to this House we had constant complaints, which I think were justified, of propaganda on the part of the Comintern. It was said then that that kind of propaganda was destructive of the comity\n\n\nof nations, and whenever anybody was making terms with the new Government of Russia we took the line that that kind of thing was wrong. We have that kind of thing in a far higher degree to-day from the States which are engaged in aggression. It is directed against Democracy, against the League, against the ideal of peace, and against this country and the British Empire. I stress that point to hon. Members who are specially concerned with regard to the British Empire.<br\/>\nLet me take the first point. There is broadcasting. We have already raised, by questions in the House, the matter of hostile broadcasting throughout the Near East in which this country is constantly misrepresented. That is a very serious matter. Propaganda was one of the new weapons discovered during the last War, but it has never been used in this intensity and on such a widespread scale as it is to-day deliberately against this country and the Empire. We are making very belated efforts at counteracting that, not by counter-propaganda but by reasonable setting out of the truth. Secondly, I would refer to the cinema. I have had very disturbing reports of the kind of propaganda that is going on in countries, say, in South America, where numbers of news-reels are given. In those news-reels there is nothing to the credit of this country. The only things that are recorded are those which are thought to be to the discredit of this country. Everything about this country is given a twist. It has gone so far that even British residents abroad tend to ask themselves what is happening to the old country. All they hear about is Mosley rows.<br\/>\nThe next thing to which I would refer is the question of Press services. I doubt whether we get a good Press abroad. I believe that enormous sums are being spent by some countries on the patronage of the Press. Sometimes they give a good cheap Press service to newspapers abroad, but the news is given a tendentious twist always against this country. I doubt very much whether some of our Embassies abroad are properly equipped to deal with this type of thing, especially if they have the kind of old idea: \"Never mind; we stand aloof. We hardly know the Press representatives. We are quite content to stand in\n\nour rectitude.\" I do not believe that you can meet that sort of propaganda by a passive and aloof attitude of that kind. There is the question of propaganda literature of which floods are sent out on behalf of various aggressive States. Beyond that, is the widespread network of organisation. Every now and again you see it at work in various countries. Anyone who has read the reports of the activities of the Germans in Spain long before this rebellion broke out will see the kind of thing that is happening. One has only to read of what is happening in other countries. This is the new technique of aggression, the poisoning of people's minds, and there is a constant attack being delivered. It is a form of warfare that attacks this country, attacks democracy, attacks all the ideals for which this country stands. I say that it requires the very careful consideration of our Government and very definite action to counteract it. I do not want to stoop to such methods, but we ought to take every legitimate step to see that our case is not prejudiced. One of the great supports of this country is the good will of the smaller peoples of the world.<br\/>\nI now turn to the question of the other side of active aggression. You have the Sino-Japanese War. War has not been declared. That is another example of modern technique. The Japanese do not declare war; in fact they say that they are invading China for China's good. You have here a new imperialism. You had Manchukuo. Then you had the invasion of Jehol, and now the invasion of enormous areas of China, pursued with revolting cruelty. I wonder whether there is any apologist on behalf of Japan here to-day? This thing has been going on for a number of years. It started in 1931. I cannot help recalling that Mr. J. L. Garvin of the \"Observer\" denounced the curious pacifists who complained of the invasion of Manchukuo, and with all his pontifical authority assured us that the invasion of Manchukuo did not mean anything like the invasion of China, but was the pursuit of perfectly legitimate aims on behalf of Japan. Those comforting assurances have now failed. Indeed everything is overshadowed by the scale of the situation in the Far East. Its gravity and unpleasantness cannot be exceeded. I do not think there will be to-day any apologist for Japan. If you talk with\n\n\nrepresentative Japanese they are naturally pro-Japanese and do not speak against their own country. After complaining of the anti-Japanese attitude of the Chinese Government they fall back on the excuse put up by any ordinary criminal. They say, \"It was just our economic needs that compelled us to take that which did not belong to us.\" They have now come into conflict with the interests of other nations. They have shown a complete disregard of international law. They have fired on British ships and American ships. They kill our nationals. They have a complete disregard of what the Government consider are British interests. They threaten a blockade of the Chinese coast. There is a sinister resemblance between these attacks on British and American shipping and the attacks on Russian shipping which preceded the invasion of Manchukuo. After trying it on the Yalu they are trying it on the Yangtse, to see what will be the result. They are, in effect, entirely disregarding the interests of anyone else in China. They behave as if they were General Franco, and as if British commerce were merely on a par with Spanish women and children. They have dealt with British ships as Mussolini has dealt with those of the Spanish Government.<br\/>\nThere is a grave situation in China. Hong Kong may be cut off from the mainland; Shanghai may be left derelict. The Government are clearly alarmed. They have sent stiff Notes to Japan, but they are meeting the results of their own past actions. They and the other States acquiesced in the wrong done to China. They have acted under the idea that if Japan was allowed a certain amount of latitude she would respect the interests of European Powers, and that Japan's aims were very limited. I think that Japan wants the hegemony of the Far East. British imperialist interests are threatened. But the Government do not realise that peace justice and the rule of law for all is the real British interest. British commercial interests are now in jeopardy because the British Government did not realise in time that they could be protected only as long as we were protecting the interests of the whole world. The Manchurian failure started the process that has gone so far. My point is that the Government have always tended to give too narrow a view to what are really British interests. The true British\n\ninterests are the preservation of peace, the support of international law and of democracy. The British Empire can survive in the world only in so far as it serves greater interests than our own. It survived in the past through good will, but propaganda and a short-sighted foreign policy are destroying its foundations.<br\/>\nI hope that the Prime Minister will be able to say something to us on the Far East situation. I am not pressing him at all. I know that the situation is very difficult. But it is not a matter for us alone. It is a League matter. It is also a matter in which the United States of America are vitally concerned. Every one of us always hopes that we may have the greatest amount of co-operation with the United States. May I here say how deeply we deplore the loss of Mr. Bingham, who did so much to help to a better understanding. It is a serious thing that British ships and American ships, British men and American men, are attacked. But this is only incidental to the great crime of the unprovoked aggression on China. I was a little alarmed when the Foreign Secretary, in his Note of 15th December, said that a repetition of these incidents must impair the relationship between this country and Japan. He rather assumed that the relationship was unimpaired by the attacks on China.<br\/>\nI do not think we shall find that the rest of world opinion will get excited over British rights and wrongs. But it is concerned with the foundations of peace. I believe that the League has the right and the duty to support China in her fight against aggression. They can supply her with arms; they can deny supplies to Japan. No one is suggesting that war should be made on Japan. But this pressure can be brought to bear. The United States have similar interests, and I would rather like to see parallel action on her part. I hope that there will be full consultations with the United States and with the League Powers. If action had been taken earlier Japan might well have been stopped already. If we had realised that the attack on China was ultimately an attack on the British Empire because it was an attack on the rule of law for which we stand, we might have brought pressure to bear quite a long time ago.<br\/>\nI turn again to the question of Spain. Here again we have had a disregard of\n\n\ninternational right and the same triangle that is operating in propaganda against the British Empire, which attacks China, is encouraging and supporting General Franco. Non-intervention had no basis whatever in law and justice. It had a basis only in expediency. If that expediency has failed to materialise it is time that it was abolished. I see nothing now but a continuance of this one-sided non-intervention, while delay continues, negotiation continues everlastingly over every single point. You will get delays, whether with regard to the withdrawal of volunteers or anything else, so long as all the time you leave a situation which is to the advantage of the aggressors in Spain. I have tried to see what I could in Spain. I believe that there is a wonderful fight being put up there by a heroic people who are being attacked by aggressors from outside. I believe there are signs that throughout Spain there is growing resentment against being made the battlefield for these aggressors. We have never asked that there should be intervention by arms by this country. What we do ask is justice for the Spanish Government.<br\/>\nI do not believe that General Franco will break through the great army that opposes him. But there is danger in the food situation. There is no effective blockade in the technical sense, but there is a hampering of shipping by Franco's forces, backed by the forces of foreign Powers. Can the Government tell us anything with regard to the concentration of Italian war vessels in Spanish waters at points where it is suggested attacks might be made by land? I have very little faith in anything that is done under the Italian flag. There is no effective blockade, but there are Admiralty orders and warnings that seem often to assist a blockade. The First Lord of the Admiralty paid me a handsome compliment the other day. He said I was worth two batteries of machine guns to the Spanish Government. The tragedy is that the right hon. Gentleman is worth a fleet to General Franco. That was seen at Bilbao. I do not want it to be seen at Barcelona.<br\/>\nI am not very satisfied with the position of the diplomatic agents, the trade agents. I do not know what the Duke of Alba's commercial qualifications are. I know that Sir Robert Hodgson is a\n\nfirst-class diplomat. It does not look like a question merely of sending trade agents; it looks much more like the opening of diplomatic relations prior to recognition. I believe that here again the Government have been backing the wrong horse. If they had taken their stand on international law this Spanish contest would have ended. I believe that British Imperial interests have been sacrificed by a short-sighted policy. The Government will say that they have been holding the scales evenly, but they have not been holding the scales evenly. I do not believe that anyone who has observed the conditions of non-intervention will agree that they have. I think they have been playing the game of our enemies. Here we come to a question which divides the House. It is, fundamentally, what are the interests of this country, and what do we stand for? Our position is that we are prepared to stand for the rule of law and for international justice. We believe that by that we are serving British interests in the best possible way. The Government will only stand firm when it is immediate British interests that are affected. By doing that they have weakened that world support which this country, the British Commonwealth and the British Empire need, and I think they have divided this country.<br\/>\nThe day of the Pax Britannica has gone with the change in weapons and in the position all over the world. But the ideal of the Pax Britannica can be carried out through the League. This moment, when Italy is leaving the League, is not a time for suggesting that therefore the League must be scrapped; it is a time for strengthening the League. We do not want to dissolve the League of Nations. The question is, what can the League do when it is shorn of three great Powers? I would say that the strength of the League is not merely in its physical force; the strength of the League is in the ideal that is in the minds of people all over the world, the ideal of peace, even among the peoples who cannot speak for themselves because they are under dictators. That is the reason why, in the attack on this country, there is also a definite attack upon the League.<br\/>\nIt may be suggested that we are asking the Government to line up against the triangle of the dictatorship Powers, but we are asking for no such thing. What we are asking is that the Government shall\n\n\nwork with other countries. We must lay down some kind of basis. Before there can be anything like disarmament, there must be moral disarmament. Before you come to friendly terms with people, there must be a cessation of war propaganda, and there must be a real basis for settlement. There have been conversations, recently and none of us on this side raised any objection whatever to those conversations between this country and the ruler of Germany; but I want to ask what is the basis of those conversations. I do not believe that a manoeuvre on the balance of power is going to bring us peace. I do not believe that a short-term programme of trying to get peace for a few years in exchange for a few concessions is going to get us out of the war atmosphere. I should have thought that the lesson of the last few years was abundantly plain, that treaties are no good at all unless there is the will to carry them out.<br\/>\nI understand that the question of colonies was discussed. We on this side do not believe that colonies can be treated as counters in a game of diplomatic bargaining. We hold that colonies should first and foremost be administered in the interests of the people who live there. When we hear colonial claims put forward by what are called the hungry Powers, we have to remember that, if that claim is valid for Germany, it is equally valid for Poland, for Czechoslovakia, for Austria, or for Switzerland, and that no dividing up of colonies, whether our own or anyone else's, is going to lead to a real settlement. In the same way, disarmament depends on security. Our settlement of outstanding questions depends on disarmament of the mind, and on proper provision for the utilisation of the economic forces that will be released by disarmament. That can only be done by international effort.<br\/>\nThere are elements in the world to-day which make another world war possible&#8212;propaganda, rival Imperialisms, great armaments. One thing is certain, and that is that another war will bring no country any real gain. One other thing is certain. If there were to be another war, there would have to be another peace settlement. We want the peace settlement without the war. We have set forth our views as to how that settle-\n\nment can be accomplished. We believe that we have to hold fast by League ideals and to strengthen the League. We believe that security must be obtained through collective security by building up the strength of the world to repel aggression. We believe that you can get disarmament, not as a result of security alone, but only on a basis of justice, and we do not think that the Treaty of Versailles was the last word in justice. We are now at a stage when much of that Treaty had been torn up. It is surely time that we tried to get a new settlement. With regard to colonial territories, we do not believe in a re-dividing up. We believe that all colonies of all Powers should be held on the principle of a Mandate, first for the peoples of those territories, and, secondly, for the whole world. If we look broadly at this question, we see the immense scope that there is for world development and world prosperity.<br\/>\nThe real way to deal with the dictators is not to think that you can attack them by war; the real way is to show that there is another and a better method, that the method of force will not succeed, that we do not intend to yield to the method of force, but that their aims can be secured by a peaceful co-operation of all the great States of the world. I believe that to-day the dictators are sitting less easily in the saddle than they were. There is a good deal of discontent in Italy, in Germany and in Japan&#8212;[HON. MEMBERS: \"And Russia.\"] There is a failure to give to the peoples what they want. But a dictatorship thrives on fear. A dictator is able to say to his people, \"Look how we are surrounded. There is danger on this side; there is danger on that side.\" If we want peace, we must get rid of that fear. I want the Government to consider whether it is not time that this country gave a lead for a new start. There will be another meeting of the League in January. To-day, as I see it, we are drifting into a dangerous situation. I do not think that that dangerous situation can be averted by any subtle diplomacy, by any playing with counters. I think it means a new start and a great appeal, which I should like this country to make.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I beg to move,\n<q>That this House is of the opinion that a public inquiry should be held to review the present situation of British Civil Aviation and make recommendations.<\/q>\nLike the daughter of Herodias, I ask the House to-day to give me the head of the Secretary of State for Air in a charger. I am asking for nothing less than a public inquiry, because I believe nothing less than a public inquiry will compel the Air * Ministry to take some action in the matter. My only regret is that the Secretary of State himself is not a Member of this House so that he could reply to the charges I am going to make. I hope, however, to give him an opportunity to reply to the charges, and in due course there will be another discussion in another place.<br\/>\nAt the outset I ought to explain my own position. There have been rumours circulating to the effect that I am financially interested in the aircraft industry. I have no financial interest whatsoever in any branch of the aircraft industry. There is one possible exception, and that is that I am a director of a company which has received an inquiry and, I believe, an order from the Air Ministry to provide hydrogen plants for filling the balloon barrage around London. Beyond that I have no financial interest whatever, and the only reason why I am raising this matter this afternoon is because, like many hon. Members, I am thoroughly dissatisfied with the present position and future prospects of British civil aviation. We know that all is not well. We know that we are behind the Americans and Germans, and we dislike being laughed at by Americans and Germans, and even by the Dutch. Since I have been in rather close contact with a considerable number of professional pilots at Croydon I have heard several tales. When Messrs. Imperial Airways a few years ago tried to run a night service to Berlin they sent over a machine which, I am informed, they bought second-hand from the Royal Air Force, and when it landed at Berlin it was the object of a joke; German pilots actually tied a parrot's cage to its tail. Tales of this kind tend to bring British civil aviation into disrepute. I am trying in my own way to call attention to a serious position, and I am inspired simply and solely by a\n\ndesire to see British civil aviation leading the world in just the same way as British shipping leads the world now.<br\/>\nThere are five matters I want to raise. They have been raised before but we have never had any satisfactory reply. First, there is the question of subsidies which are given to two British air lines&#8212;Imperial Airways and British Airways. Both these air lines run services to Paris. In other words, we are faced with the Gilbertian situation of two British air lines both subsidised by the Government competing with each other, cutting each other's throat, on the same route. I know the Minister's reply will be that British Airways are only subsidised to go to Scandinavia, and that they are not specifically subsidised for the London-Paris route. To that my reply is that if there was no subsidy whatever, neither of these air lines would be in existence for more than a year and, therefore, I claim it is true to say that we are subsidising two companies to compete with each other on the same route.<br\/>\nNext I come to the subject raised at question time to-day&#8212;the fact that after years of neglect there is no civil air-liner of a size suitable to sell in the Empire or in Europe. British Airways, the chosen instrument of the Government, a short time ago desired to buy more aeroplanes. They searched this country and could not find a suitable aeroplane, and as a result they bought German and American aeroplanes. To-night, when the night mail air service goes from Croydon to reach Berlin in the early hours of tomorrow morning it will be carried by British pilots on a German machine. But that is not only true of this country. It is true of the whole of our Empire. The new airline which is being opened across Canada is to be equipped entirely with American machines. In the early part of this year after I had come back from Canada I went to the Air Ministry and told them what I had heard, that the contract would certainty go to America. I begged, I implored, trie Air Ministry to release the only possible machine which could secure the contract for this country, that is the Blenheim bomber, and I was refused. I notice that since then Blenheim bombers have been supplied to Turkey.<br\/>\nThe losing of that contract is an important matter. In the future a traveller\n\n\nwishing to fly round the world will fly by Imperial Airways over the Atlantic and also over the Pacific, and he will fly from Hong Kong home also by Imperial Airways, but when he goes across Canada he will go on a British Air Line which is using American machines. But it is also true of South Africa. South African Airways have recently ordered 22 German machines in order to run services in South Africa, and last, but not least, Australia is beginning to follow suit. Australia has just ordered one machine from America. I am told it is a model, on trial. Unless the Air Ministry wake up to the seriousness of the position we shall lose for all time the whole of the Empire markets for British civil air power.<br\/>\nI come to a question which affects many hon. Members, and that is the position of municipal air ports. For the last eight years the Government have been encouraging the creation of municipal air ports, and a considerable number have been built. These air ports cost the ratepayers a great deal of money, but now the municipalities are finding them nothing more than white elephants. I have a letter written by an organisation called the Municipal Corporations Association, in which they say that the losses on these air ports vary from &#163;2,800 a year to &#163;20,000 a year. Everyone knows that these air ports, generally speaking, are completely stagnant. Meanwhile the officials at the Air Ministry sit back in their chairs with their arms folded, and so far have done practically nothing whatever to help these aerodromes. They have not even set up the licensing authority recommended in the Maybury Report. During the Royal Air Force expansion scheme many new aerodromes were built. In my own area there are three municipal aerodromes, and yet not one of these has been used by the Air Ministry. Instead of that they have built no less than six Royal Air Force aerodromes, and are going to build one large Government store. They have deliberately banged and bolted the door against municipal aerodromes in the west of England, and naturally there is considerable resentment among the ratepayers, who feel that they have been badly let down by the Government.<br\/>\nThe fourth point is the question of an aerodrome for London. I claim that\n\nnothing has been done and that nothing will be done in the near future for the creation of an adequate air port for London. Everyone knows that the wireless directions given from Croydon are described as second-class; they are liable to great error. In the middle of Croydon Aerodrome there is a terrific dip, so deep that an aeroplane can completely disappear from sight. In the words of the chairman of Imperial Airways, a gentleman who is not very friendly towards me at the moment, \"Croydon has inherent drawbacks.\" I do not believe that whatever money is spent on Croydon Aerodrome it can ever be a first-class air port.<br\/>\nI come to the alternatives. There are Gatwick and Gravesend. Hon. Members may remember a prospectus which appeared in the newspapers on 6th June, 1935, under the name of Airports; Limited. I have read that prospectus, and I find one interesting paragraph which naturally was put right in the middle of the prospectus.\n<q>The Air Ministry have undertaken that \"&#8230;\" they will enter into agreements with the company whereby \"&#8230;\" the Air Ministry will make annual payment to the company during the next 15 years.<\/q>\nThe amount, of course, was not disclosed. Later on, under the heading \"Sources of Revenue,\" I find one of the sources mentioned was payment by the British Air Ministry under contract in respect of night flying equipment. The Air Ministry honoured their bond: The Secretary of State went down to open the airport a year later and was backed up by the Royal Air Force. I claim that in fact the Air Ministry encouraged this flotation. I claim that they were responsible for this flotation, and that on the statement which appeared, to the effect that the Air Ministry were prepared to pay a certain amount of money towards it, a considerable amount of money was put up. Many widows put up their mites because the Air Ministry allowed this statement to go forth.<br\/>\nWhat is the position now? The only air liners operating from there were British Airways, and in six months they had gone because the aerodrome was unsuitable, I am told that this morning the shares are worth about io&#163;d. The widows' mites have all been lost and in order to save the face of the Air Ministry these two aerodromes have ceased to be terminal\n\n\nairports for London and are now being turned into reserve training schools. I wonder whether, when these two contracts were given, there was any competition or whether they were given without competition in order to save the face of the Air Ministry. I cannot help feeling that the Air Ministry are very wise indeed to refuse the inquiry for which I am asking. Croydon is second class and it can never be more than second class. Gatwick and Gravesend are out of the question. Heston at the moment is too small. The London County Council have flatly refused to do anything because they say it is the responsibility of the Air Ministry. Now we are faced with the fact that London, the heart of the world, is left with one adequate aerodrome, and that one is only worthy of a second class Balkan State. Unless something is done and clone quickly passengers from London to Paris will spend more time on the road than they will spend in the air.<br\/>\nNow I come to my last complaint against the Air Ministry as such, and that is connected with the railway clearing houses. I made inquiries on this matter but found it very difficult to get accurate information. I am quite frank with the House, and if I am wrong I hope any hon. Member who is in a position to do so will get up and say that I am wrong, and I shall withdraw what I have said. But as far as I can make out there is the closest possible connection between the following companies: The railway companies, Imperial Airways, Railway Air Sendees, British Airways, British Continental Airways, Hillman Airways, Spartan Airways, Northern and Scottish Airways, Highland Airways, Western Islands Airways, Jersey Airways, Blackpool and West Coast Airways and the Isle of Man Airways. In other words, with a few exceptions practically all the internal and external services are under the same influence or the same control in this country. I shall make one or two observations on that point.<br\/>\nThis amalgamation, this great organisation, has in fact closed all the booking facilities to anyone who is outside the ring. I well remember that about six or eight months ago this matter was raised in the House. Hon. Members here were very indignant about it. In particular I am referring to the fact that this octopus was then refusing to allow British Airways, which was a subsidised company\n\nand then outside the ring&#8212;to allow the railway clearing house and travel agencies to book for them. There was an outcry. I raised the matter again and again in the House and my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Hertford (Sir M. Sueter) took a prominent part in the matter. We blocked all the railway Bills until the right hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. Lees-Smith) made a very fine fighting speech and we won the day. The same thing has happened again. North Eastern Airways, the only air line going up to the north east of England and making use of municipal aerodromes on the East Coast, finds itself in exactly the same position. Not only are the railway clearing house and all the main booking offices closed to it, but they in their turn have used the big stick with their sub-agents and it is now practically impossible for anyone to buy a ticket for that air line. I believe that the policy of the railway companies who have got a very substantial holding in this group, is to treat civil aviation in the same way as they treated the canals in the early days. Either they want to break them or buy them out and if they buy them out, the idea is to wring their necks.<br\/>\nAs I look ahead I cannot help feeling a great deal of sympathy for the professional pilots in this country, because it is going to mean in future, and probably means now, that every pilot if he is dismissed from one particular air line in this group automatically is dismissed from the whole lot. I believe the companies can use this weapon to force a general lowering of the status of pilots. There is one other point. This great amalgamation has, and certainly if it has not now will in future have, the power to hold a pistol at the head of the Government and to say to the Government, \"Give us a subsidy for air lines in this country or we will shut down the whole of British civil aviation.\" I am as good a Conservative as any hon. Member behind me, but I cannot help wondering whether nationalisation of our internal air services and our external air services - would not be preferable to the present position, because as far as I know the whole of British aviation is rapidly coming under the control of two financial houses. [HON. MEMBERS: \"Who are they? \"] Hon. Members ask who they are. They are D'Erlangers and Whitehall Securities.<br\/>\nI believe that the Air Ministry know that what I have told the House is true. But the Air Ministry are either unwilling or incapable of doing anything. They have sat back with their arms folded. The fundamental trouble is, I believe, that members of the Air Council who rule the roost have a military outlook and drag along civil aviation in the same way as a mother drags along an unwanted child. Until we can get civil aviation away from the militaristic outlook of the Air Ministry and hand it where it ought to be, to the Ministry of Transport, we shall never get fair play for civil aviation in this country.<br\/>\nLet me now refer to a subject that I raised the other night, the position of the organisation known as the Air Line Pilots' Association. I am not going into great detail because I talked on this subject a fortnight ago. The main object of this Association in general is to maintain the status of professional pilots in this country, and as such we are at this moment opposing by every method in our power the present policy of Imperial Airways to cut the salaries of new pilots coming into the service. We are also opposing them on certain abuses which are becoming very common. There was an air liner called the \"Hanno\" which forced-landed somewhere near Bahrein some time ago. I have good reason for suspecting that the pilot had flown all night and in fact had been employed continuously for 18 hours on end without sleep. I am also informed that this is quite a normal occurrence for pilots east of Cairo. I cannot vouch for that statement because I have not seen the pilot, but I have seen a considerable number of pilots who are prepared at a public inquiry to come forward and give evidence to that effect. We do not want to dictate. All we want is to co-operate in a friendly way.<br\/>\nLet me give one or two instances of what I mean. We want to raise such matters as: the position of landing lights on aeroplanes; a pilot being unable to see the petrol gauges, or perhaps the instruments do not work under icy conditions; or the pilot cannot get his engine revolutions in conditions of snow or ice. These things are not found out by those who are sitting in offices in London. They are found out only by the men who fly\n\naeroplanes under all conditions. We should be told by the hon. and gallant Member for Hertford, \"Oh, but these matters can be raised now. Any pilot who finds these things can approach the management.\" Certain pilots approached the management only a short time ago about the equipment for the Budapest service, and they were all promptly dismissed. How can anyone say that direct approach to Imperial Airways is working successfully at the moment? No pilot dare complain because he will be dismissed the next day.<br\/>\nI repeat the charges I made the other night, that in my view and from the evidence put before me there has been a considerable amount of victimisation at Croydon. I find it difficult to believe that out of 200 pilots employed by Imperial Airways it is purely a coincidence that the chairman and the vice-chairman of this organisation should have been suddenly dismissed, although neither of them had ever broken anything and one of them had been employed by the company for some 18 years. There are many grievances. I am prepared at a public inquiry to give 10 to 15 cases where I believe that victimisation has taken place. I shall read one letter to the House. I have the original here and will show it to any one who is interested. A pilot wrote to the organisation:\n<q>Imperial Airways have chosen to withhold my May and June flying pay, subject to my signing a form.<\/q>\nThe form was the new contract under which the pilot was to receive a lower scale of pay. They held a big stick over this pilot and said to him \"Unless you sign this contract we are going to withhold your May pay and June pay.\" The Secretary of State has told us that he is satisfied there is no victimisation, but I most respectfully suggest to him that he has heard only one side of the case. He has interviewed only the Government directors; he has not interviewed the men themselves. Therefore I believe that he has prejudged the case. For that reason we are asking this House for a trial by jury. If we cannot get a public inquiry and if a trial by jury is impossible we ask for a judge who is at any rate prepared to hear both sides of the case and not to hear only one side. Why has this inquiry been refused? It is a simple thing. We ask for a public or a private inquiry&#8212;we do not mind which. Why has\n\n\nit been refused? I believe the reason is that neither the Air Ministry nor Imperial Airways are prepared to face it. I wonder whether the Under-Secretary of State, if he sees fit, will either confirm or deny the rumour which is now in circulation to the effect that the staff manager of the whole company, Air Vice-Marshal Sir Tom Webb-Bowen, has suddenly resigned from the company. I am informed that that is the case and that lie has resigned on personal grounds; but I cannot help thinking that it is at least a little suspicious that this gentleman should suddenly have resigned at the very moment when this conflict is at its highest.<br\/>\nSuggestions have appeared in the Press, and have been made to me, that our organisation should join up with another organisation known as the Guild of Air Pilots. The Guild has done good work in the past, but it is now quickly becoming nothing more nor less than a city company. In fact, it is slowly dying, so engrossed in its own fat that it cannot see out of its own eyes. There are people who would welcome amalgamation with the Guild, but from what I know it appears to be impossible, because we have a suspicion&#8212;a very good suspicion, I think&#8212;that the Guild of Air Pilots is in close connection with Imperial Airways. If we cannot amalgamate with the Guild&#8212;and I have very grave doubts whether that will be possible&#8212;there is only one alternative left to us, and it is to look around for another and bigger tree, a tree with different leaves, under which we can take shelter. [An HON. MEMBER; \"The T.U.C.\"]<br\/>\nI will now deal with matters connected with British civil aviation in foreign parts. As the House knows, there are two main operating companies, British Airways and Imperial Airways. My relations with British Airways are more than friendly. I am completely satisfied that they are doing everything in their power to uphold the prestige of British civil aviation. They are using up-to-date machines&#8212;I know they are American machines, but they have to be because there are no British machines available&#8212;they are using up-to-date equipment; they are popular; they are running to full capacity&#8212;and at any rate they are trying. But unfortunately, my relations with Imperial Airways at the moment appear to be a little strained.\n\nIn fact, I have not even been asked to dinner with the managing director.<br\/>\nIt has been suggested to me that it is wrong to criticise Imperial Airways. It has been suggested that to do so is unpatriotic, and that by criticising them, one undermines British prestige. Imperial Airways are nothing more nor less than a public utility company. They are heavily subsidised by the taxpayers of this country, they are paying a very large dividend, and they are increasing their directors' fees. Surely Members of this House have not only the right but the public duty to subject this company to the most searching criticism and inquiry in order to see that we get value for our money. I rather resent the attempts that have been made to stifle criticism of Imperial Airways. Those attempts savour very unpleasantly of those totalitarian methods which are now so popular in certain countries in Europe and against which this country has been the main bulwark in the past.<br\/>\nI will give the House a few facts. In the first place, hon. Members know the Government's attitude. The Government wash their hands of Imperial Airways; they say that the company are merely sub-contractors and that the Government cannot take any responsibility for them. The second fact is that the chairman of Imperial Airways, a very able, charming and brilliant business man, is a director of many companies, and Imperial Airways have not a full-time chairman. The third fact is that there are two Government directors on the board. The fourth fact is that the Government hold all the deferred shares. The fifth fact is that there is an increasing subsidy being paid by the Government to the company every year. The sixth fact is that Imperial Airways receive very large mail contracts from the Government.<br\/>\nI wish, first of all, to criticise the company on financial grounds. I would like to pay a tribute to the sporting way in which the Air Ministry have not hidden anything and have given me all the figures for which I have asked. According to the figures which they have supplied to me, in 1936 Imperial Airways received from the Government &#163;377,000, and it is estimated that in 1938, two years later, the figure will have gone up to &#163;800,000, more than double. Out of this increase, the dividend, which last year\n\n\nwas 8 per cent., has been increased to 9 per cent., and the directors' fees, which were &#163;6,500, have gone up to &#163;12,000, very nearly double&#8212;no doubt due to the cost of living. With regard to pilots' salaries, many officially-inspired statements have appeared in the Press which have given the impression that pilots get round about &#163;1,500 a year. I have made detailed inquiries, and I am prepared to dispute the statements that have been made. I have in my possession particulars of the assessment by the Income Tax authorities of one of the captains now employed by Imperial Airways. Instead of the &#163;1,500 which I expected to see, there is only a miserable &#163;300. I believe that if a public inquiry were made into the salaries that are paid to the pilots, the figures which have been given in the Press would be proved to be greatly exaggerated.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I am aware of what the hon. Gentleman says, but he knows as well as I do, and if he does not I am telling him, that I am speaking relatively, and relatively the position in Scotland is better than it has been for a long time past. We know that the Clyde has never been so busy, that there were 86 vessels launched in the first eight months of this year, that steel and iron are in a position in which they have not been for years, and that blast furnaces have been working harder than for many years. In fact, the only industry that I cannot put my hand on at the moment as doing well is housing in the City of Glasgow itself, and no doubt hon. Members will resent my saying it, but they must be aware of the fact that the majority on the Glasgow Corporation is a Socialist majority, though it may not be so for very long.<br\/>\nWe come now to the Amendment. What exactly are the three charges that the Opposition have against the National Government? The first charge is that of a \"weak and vacillating\" foreign policy, but it seems to me that that is a perfectly exact description of the policy of the Opposition themselves in regard to foreign affairs&#8212;non-intervention in Spain last year, intervention in Spain this year,\n\nand then, having seen that intervention would very likely lead to a war, which they had tried to deny us the weapons to win, they changed from opposition to armaments last year to support of armaments this year. But what are the facts about the Government's foreign policy? We heard them to-clay from the Foreign Secretary, elaborately, convincingly, and definitely, and I would like to simplify the description of the foreign policy of the National Government under two heads&#8212;long-term policy and short-term policy. They are both equally easy to explain, though possibly difficult to fulfil, but at any rate they are both consistent and both definite.<br\/>\nThe long-term policy, as I see it, can be sub-divided under three heads. The first is to preserve the security and integrity of the British Empire and its peoples, the second is to play our part in collective action for security, and the third is to promote the peace of the world. I wash out all reference to isolation, because we know it is not a possible policy. We are tied to Europe; the Channel is no more a protection, and we are tied to Europe financially, strategically, and economically. In regard to the short-term policy, the day-today policy, that has again to be divided under two headings. To localise all existing conflicts and, secondly, to mediate in such conflicts where mediation is possible. How well the Government have fulfilled these policies is a source of unending surprise and gratitude to the country. Take two examples. The first is that of Spain. I am not going into the pros and cons of the Spanish situation, except to say that I believe the time will come, and come, possibly, before we are expecting it, when we shall thank God that the National Government were able to keep the conflict sufficiently localised, sufficiently far from spreading throughout the world, like a prairie fire, absorbing, blasting, and killing everything with which it came in contact&#8212;a time when we shall see a situation arising in which Spaniards will again have to live side by side with Spaniards in peace and amity. The Spaniard is a proud person, and Spain is a proud country, and I am convinced, as I believe the National Government are convinced, that when that time comes Spaniards will look back with gratitude and friendship to the one country that never produced, as the\n\n\nForeign Secretary has said, war materials to kill Spaniards.<br\/>\nThere is another example, and that is Japan. We have been told that the Socialist Opposition wants a boycott of Japan. The word \"sanctions\" is no longer very popular, as it was not a great success when it was applied before, unhappily. I think that if we could have got world co-operation or co-operation among 52 nations, it would have been a great achievement, but we could not. There was a leakage in Austria, for instance, and once there is a leak in the tank it is no good trying to pretend that the water will not escape. What is the logical result of such action as the Opposition desire, namely, the institution of a boycott? It obviously means that you would set up in Japan, already nervous, great irritation, and the logical result of that would be the bombardment of Hong Kong. We could not possibly detach sufficient of our Fleet from the obligations which we have undertaken in the Mediterranean, and there we should be embarked in a great war which we should be absolutely unequipped to wage. The Socialists are all warm and aglow when they pass a resolution making a demand on the Government. There is a virtuous feeling that now all will be well and that they will get the support and confidence of their misguided electors throughout the country, but that is not so, because there is no way of fooling all the people all the time, and it would be a great mistake, in my opinion, for the Socialist party to adopt that attitude.<br\/>\nNow I come to the second charge, that of betraying the principles of the League. It is a somewhat vague charge, but I suppose it is good enough to appeal to all those well-meaning sentimentalists throughout the country whose sense of realism is, unhappily but quite honestly, clouded by their sense of idealism. What are the actual facts with regard to the question of dropping the League, for that is what it comes to? In my opinion, and, I think, in the opinion of the country as well, this country, led by the National Government, has given more real support to the cause of peace through the League of Nations than any other country in the world. Who took the lead in disarmament originally? This country. Who took the lead in the Disarmament\n\nConference? The British delegate. Who initiated the embargo on arms to Bolivia and Paraguay? The British delegate. Who was the <i>rapporteur<\/i> at the meeting when the Yugoslav-Hungarian dispute was so happily prevented from becoming an armed conflict? Again it was the British delegate. And who was mainly responsible for sending an international force to the Saar? Again the British Government. It was only when, in the pursuit of peace, the National Government found the League hopelessly disunited, both in method and design, that they took the burden on their own shoulders and, while acting in strict accordance with the principles of the Covenant, adopted a more simplified machinery and more suitable for the purpose.<br\/>\nThe third and last charge is:\n<q>lack of any constructive and fundamental proposals for raising the standard of life of the people.<\/q>\nIn my opinion, this charge would be humorous if it were not so unprincipled. I wonder if it was with malice aforethought or design that when framing this Amendment the word \"proposals\" was selected. I hate to rub it in, but that is what \"policy\" means to the Opposition. How many \"proposals\" of theirs have we not had&#8212;short-term proposals and five-year plans, put up by the party above the Gangway, and how little has been the result in the well-being of this country? We believe in deeds and not so much in proposals, although there are some very fundamental proposals contained in the Gracious Speech from the Throne. First and foremost is an expression of confidence. It is a queer fact which no Member of the Opposition party ever seems to realise that a Conservative or National Government can pass progressive social legislation which a Socialist Government would never get the country to accept, because the country has confidence in the sobriety and competence and sanity of the Nationalist Government. That is why I suggest that the Opposition should cultivate the qualities that I have just laid down. Then come tariffs, the bargaining weapon by which we have brought back trade from the foreigner that had been taken from us and given it back to our own people. Finally, there is the lowering, if not indeed the abolishing, of the tariff by the\n\n\nestablishment of the trade agreements with our neighbours. They have been a fruitful source of income, amounting to something like &#163;40,000,000 of revenue, and have introduced a complementary trade between Britain and other countries.<\/p>",

If this means that when the Government get to Brussels they are going to propose a compromise by which the Chinese give up any territory to the militarists of Japan, I hope the Chinese delegates will come out in public and appeal to the public conscience of the world. We are faced here, not with a war for which responsibility is divided, but with a flagrant aggression condemned by the Assembly of the League. In every such case until that of Spain the League began its work by demanding that the invaders should evacuate the territory they had occupied. In 1925 Sir Austen Chamberlain refused to discuss with the Greek Dictator, he would not even debate about the merits of the question, until General Pangalos had brought his troops off Bulgarian soil. I hope that that procedure will be followed at Brussels in regard to Japan. And if the Japanese refuse, I hope our Government will immediately propose an oil embargo. I believe we could count on American co-operation.<br\/>\nPresident Roosevelt went far beyond the Prime Minister in what he said. He said that the nations' task was now \"to put an end to acts of international aggression.\" He said that it was necessary for them \"to make concerted efforts in opposition to these violations of treaties.\" It is plain that he is ready for concrete collective action, otherwise his speech is nonsense. There are two men who could defeat President Roosevelt if they desired to do so&#8212;the President of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the leading statesman of the Republican Party. But Senator Pittman, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, not only threw over the Neutrality Bill which he himself prepared, but he said that we ought to \"refuse to continue commercial or credit relations with Japan,\" and that \"in so doing there need not be a single shot fired.\" Everybody knows what Mr. Stimson has said. He\n\n\nhas talked about oil, iron and cotton. He has analysed the trade with Japan and pointed out that we could certainly bring her down. He has given it as his opinion&#8212; and as Secretary of State he must have considered this matter for years in the light of possible action&#8212;that we could do this without any danger of war to ourselves.<br\/>\nThe Government will say that the Japanese would occupy Hong Kong. The Japanese would not occupy Hong Kong. With Russia on their flank, that would be \"midsummer madness\" of a kind which Japan has never shown. They have not even dared to make their own blockade effective, because they do not want complications with other Powers. But even if they did occupy Hong Kong, that would not mean that we need necessarily reply by armed resistance. We should need only to wait six or nine months until their oil was finished, and they would not be able to move an aeroplane, a gun, a submarine, a transport or a warship. Their arms would be useless encumbrances to the troops who sought to use them. They would come out of Hong Kong as they went in, without a shot being fired, and Hong Kong would then be ours again.<br\/>\nThe Government have this one last chance to re-establish the power and authority of the League. I beg them not to lose it. I beg them to remember that while we are supplying oil to Japan, the blood of Chinese children is on our hands. If the only answer of the Government is that which the Prime Minister gave the other day: \"What is the use of talking about the League of Nations,\" then I say with great respect, that I hope they will talk less about it at the next General Election when it comes.<br\/>\nI have made a controversial speech, but I want to end on a non-controversial note. I want to appeal to the Government and to hon. Members in every quarter of the House. Many of them, I know, honestly believe that economic pressure, \"quarantine,\" \"ostracism\" as the Americans call it, would be dangerous and ineffective. But at least let them ask the Government not to make another Hoare-Laval Agreement at China's expense. Let them urge that the Brussel's Conference should meet and act on the basis of the Nine-Power Treaty. Article i of that Treaty reads as follows:\n<q>The contracting powers agree to respect the sovereignty, the independence and the\n\nterritorial and administrative integrity of China.<\/q>\nI ask the Government and I ask the Noble Lord to give us an assurance that that fundamental undertaking will be observed. Let them not think that Japan can safely conquer China if we keep Hong Kong and Shanghai. Such a Treaty would not serve our material interest. Those places would be useless to us, as the Japanese in Manchuria have taught the Federation of British Industries. But such a Treaty would be an act of shame, like the Hoare-Laval Agreement&#8212;an act of shame which the British people would not twice forgive.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>That is a question for them, and they must answer it, and I think they could probably give a perfectly good answer. I have enough to do to look after my own end. I should like to examine the likely result of this ultimate promise to fight. It is like two children one of whom has a ball. Let us say that\n\n\nthe ball may be Gibraltar, Hong Kong or the right to turn a country into a shambles. One says to the other, \"Give me that ball.\" The reply is, \"I will not.\" Then comes the challenge, \"I will come and get it,\" and that is followed by the threat, \"I will lay you out if you do.\" The last sentence is the promise to fight. The question is, does that promise keep the peace? If the one who wants the ball is the bigger of the two, the promise does not keep the peace. If the aggressor wants something that we have got, and if he is the bigger boy, it does not keep the peace, but if the boy who wants the ball is the smaller one, it does keep the peace until he can persuade, perhaps, two other boys to come in with him and make the demand.<br\/>\nI want to illustrate that general line of argument in connection with existing foreign difficulties, and particularly in connection with that great trade emporium of ours, the name of which has been on the lips of everybody since I came back to the House. I have heard much of the possibilities of what may happen to Hong Kong if anything is done in connection with what, I believe, is being contemplated as to trying to stop war between China and Japan. I think I am correct in repeating what is generally said, namely, that if we do anything in this dispute, Japan may declare war and will either seize Hong Kong or try to seize it, and then possibly we may lose it. I do not think there is any risk of that, for the simple reason that Japan has plenty on hand already. While I think there would be no risk of war, I admit, for the sake of argument, the proposition that if we do anything Japan may declare war and we may lose Hong Kong. I ask myself, what is the contrast between the likelihood of war coming that way and the likelihood of war corning another way? Let us suppose that it happened, where should we be? certainly we should have the Chinese armies helping us. Chinese armies seem to spring up almost from everywhere. I suppose we should have taken our course along with other nations and have got them to agree to economic pressure. I do not say economic sanctions, because we should not be acting under the League of Nations.<br\/>\nPutting the position at its worst&#8212;although I do not conceive it possible\n\nthat Japan would declare war&#8212;if an attack were made on Hong Kong, and Japan took it, there would be this certainty that with all the other countries on our side the war would not stop until we got Hong Kong back, and a great deal more, but not for ourselves. [HON. MEMBERS: \"Oh!\"] We do not desire more for ourselves. If we do nothing, what is the alternative? Here, I would ask hon. Members to think of our position in the Far East. It is said that Japan having already the north, and now the middle, will seize the south. Then she builds land batteries at her leisure around Hong Kong, just as other Powers have been building batteries which command Gibraltar. She might attack Hong Kong whenever she pleased, preferably at a time when we had some slight difficulty in Europe. Then war automatically follows&#8212;if they attack the British Empire. But what sort of a war? Not a war with any allies, but a war in which we alone should be fighting against Japan under great difficulties in the Far East. Therefore, I want to make my main point. It is the inevitable conclusion that in one case our policy would mean that we should fight if necessary, although I do not think it would be necessary, and win, but we are certain in the other alternative to fight, and although we are not certain to lose we should fight with no one to help us.<br\/>\nA few weeks ago I wrote a letter to the \"Times\" which they kindly published in the fifth column of the desirable middle page in which I suggested that if only this country and the United States of America and the Dutch Republic would act together it would stop the war. That idea was supported by many people more eminent than myself, but none of us meant that this could be done by the present Government or by the present Prime Minister. If Parliament had been called together in an emergency and the Prime Minister had talked on the wireless to the United States of America, and the President of the United States had talked on the wireless to this country&#8212;the Prime Minister is not a good broadcaster, while the President of the United States is&#8212;if this had happened, if the Prime Minister had called Parliament together surely half the country would have wondered why he had gone mad, and the other half why he had become sane, and between the two we should have been rather in a mess.<br\/>\nIs not the clue to our present policy in regard to the dispute in China summed up in two words of a recent speech by the President of the United States in which he said there must be \"concerted effort.\" If we were to ask the President to say in advance publicly that he will go to war whatever we do, it would be fatal. If the President were to ask us to guarantee publicly in advance everything that we might be willing to do that would be equally fatal. It is clear from the words \"concerted effort\" that the President is not likely to do that. The United States do not expect us to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for them, and we do not expect them to do everything that is necessary. It is necessary to move slowly, but I hope that we shall take up that phrase \"concerted action,\" and keep it steadily before our minds.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I listened with a great deal of agreement to much of the\n\nspeech that the Leader of the Opposition has just delivered. Indeed there were some respects in which I would have gone further than he did in criticism of the Government's foreign policy, particularly in regard to the League of Nations and the Government's failure to match the energy which it is throwing into the necessary business of rearmament with equal energy thrown into the business of a constructive policy of peace, and especially of economic appeasement. But I must say I found it difficult to follow that part of his speech in which he spoke of countries like Italy and Germany, aggressive imperialist countries, being ruled in the interest of the capitalist classes. If there is one wretched class more downtrodden than another in Germany, Italy and Japan at the present time, it is the capitalist class. <i>[Interruption.]<\/i> Certainly, if there is one class that more bitterly resents the domination of the military clique in japan at the present time, it is the capitalist class. If any hon. Member is in touch with opinion among capitalists in Germany or Italy, he will know that the same is true of those countries particularly. He will have seen in the newspapers recently that heavy taxation has been imposed in successive instalments on capitalists with different interests, and lastly upon equity shareholders in great Italian industries to the extent of 10 per cent. And as for the democratic countries, if any hon. Member thinks that the capitalist classes in the democratic countries welcome war and the prospect of war, he has only to follow the Stock Exchange quotations in Wall Street and here in the City of London. The idea that capitalists live and work for, and can profit by, war, is a gross delusion, and it only complicates the study of these very difficult, dreadful and fateful events and tendencies which we are now considering, if we draw the red herring of Capitalism and Socialism across the path.<br\/>\nWe have to consider that there has been a very serious deterioration in the international situation since we last met. We may admire the adroit diplomacy of the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and we may welcome, in particular, the Nyon Conference, of which the Leader of the Opposition spoke with so much approval, with which I heartily agree. It was not a characteristic performance on the part of\n\n\nthe Government. It was, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, a most unusual performance. Indeed, I have not the slightest doubt that if the Leader of the Opposition or I or any other hon. Member on this side of the House had suggested that, in the situation which arose in September, Britain and France should declare that they were going to police the Mediterranean with or without Italy and act upon it in the absence of Italy, hon. Members opposite would then have shouted \"War\"! But for once the Government showed resolution and they acted. They carried with them the eager and loyal co-operation of France and other Mediterranean Powers, and the world situation, and in particular the situation in Spain and the Mediterranean, was for the time being greatly improved.<br\/>\nBut in other directions the Government are drifting. The situation in Spain drifts from bad to worse, and the Secretary of State himself did not conceal from us his feelings, that the Non-Intervention Agreement was working in an increasingly unsatisfactory manner. Although we all rejoice that events yesterday took a slightly more hopeful turn, energy and speed will be needed if this opportunity is to be improved. Again, I agree with the right hon. Gentleman who has just sat down, that it is deplorable that not only on this occasion, but on other occasions which have occurred during the Recess, a more adequate response has not been made to the great speech of President Roosevelt in the United States of America. It is one of the greatest utterances made certainly during the past few months&#8212;I might almost say years&#223;&#382;and I would say, speaking as an ordinary British citizen, that I regard it as the most hopeful utterance that has come across the Atlantic Ocean since the War.<br\/>\nI believe profoundly that a greater cause is at stake in these world events, in the Mediterranean, in Spain and in the Far East, than mere national interest. It is not merely a question of Gibraltar, important as that is; it is not merely a question of our Imperial communications through the Mediterranean, and it is not merely a question of Hong Kong, but it i is, as President Roosevelt pointed out in Chicago, in the heart of the Middle West of the United States of America, an issue which goes to the very roots of intrer-\n\nnational law, justice, sanctity of treaties and our hopes of establishing the permanent peace of the world.<br\/>\nIn discussing the issues which the Secretary of State raised in his speech, I would turn first to the issue in Spain and repeat what he frankly said, that non-intervention is working unsatisfactorily. He said that the Non-Intervention Committee had been waterlogged for two months. Why only two months? He might have said for 14 months. It started waterlogged and it has never been baled out. I would, first of all, ask the Prime Minister, as I understand that he is going to reply, whether he will give us some of the facts about the situation in Spain at the present time? I will not ask him what is the present total of the numbers of troops on both sides, because that is a matter which he might clearly answer is <i>sub judice.<\/i> We are hoping that the commission will be sent out to ascertain the facts which are, of course, in dispute, but I would only make this comment in passing on an official statement which was issued the other day by the Italian Government. The Italian Government said in that statement that there were only, 10,000 Italian troops fighting in Spain, and that the numbers of volunteers fighting on the side of the Spanish Government was much larger. Then why all this fuss about the withdrawal of proportionate numbers on either side? If indeed the number of Italian and German troops is smaller than the number of volunteers fighting for the Spanish Government they ought to welcome the Government's proposals that the withdrawal should be in proportion.<br\/>\nUpon this question of troops, I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether any Italian troops have landed in Spain, in the Spanish Islands round Spain, in the Balearic or other islands during the Recess? If so, would he tell us how many were landed and on what dates? In particular, I should like to know whether any air forces and pilots have been sent to Spain or to these islands. I have seen in the newspapers that Signor Mussolini's son went there at the end of September, and I should like to know whether there is any truth in these assertions, and on what dates, as far as the Government know, these troops and air forces were sent. In particular I should be grateful if we could be told whether there is any reason to suppose\n\n\nthat the garrison at Majorca has been strengthened, and whether there is any reason to anticipate any attack by the Italian troops on the island of Minorca; whether any of the islands of Columbretes, off the east coast of Spain, and the rocky island of Alboran, where there is a lighthouse, have been occupied by German or Italian troops or workmen and fitted out as submarine bases? I should also be grateful if the Prime Minister would tell us what these troop movements to Libya mean. Why should troops be moving into Libya? I see that the Italian Government have stated in official statements that it is on account of the international situation. In what respect is the international situation affecting Libya. Are we taking any steps to ensure the proper protection of Egypt against any danger that may threaten that country?<br\/>\nI ask the House to consider what, in fact, is the military situation in Spain. General Franco has been winning victories, and he has been winning them in the Basque country and in the Austurias. But these victories have not been won by Spanish soldiers. They have been won mainly by Italian and German airmen and troops, and of these the overwhelming majority are Italian. If anyone wishes to dispute that statement, I have only to call in evidence Signor Mussolini himself, who has sent glowing messages of thanks and congratulation to the Generals who commanded his troops in the campaign, and himself attributed the success of the campaign to the efforts of the Italian troops. Therefore, do not let us have any misunderstanding about this, because by Signor Mussolini's own assertion it is the Italian troops who have been mainly responsible for winning these victories for General Franco in the North of Spain.<br\/>\nNon-intervention, at the same time, has reduced to a trickle, or at least to a narrow stream, the recruits and munitions to the Spanish Government's army. But the Spanish Government's war factories are beginning to turn out material. They are coming into production now, and within a very few months, I am credibly informed, they will have twice as many men in the field as they had at the beginning of last year. On the other hand, non-intervention, although it has prevented the Spanish Government from getting more than a small proportion of their supplies from outside sources, has\n\nnot prevented large regions of Northern Spain from being captured and conquered, and great cities from being occupied by Italian and German troops. It is fortunate, however, that these victories have been in Northern Spain and not in Central and Southern Spain. General Franco has not been marching towards Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona, but towards little seaports on the Northern Coast of Spain of which few of us had ever heard before the War began. Nor can Italy continue to maintain all through next year the immense burden of supplying drafts, munitions, clothing and equipment to these great armies in Spain, in addition to the other great armies which she is maintaining in Libya and in Abyssinia. Everything, therefore, depends upon what happens. in Spain in the next few months or weeks. That is the fateful period.<br\/>\nThe fall of Gijon liberates 100,000 men, according to such information as I have and which we read in the newspapers from the best informed correspondents. In so far as they are Spanish soldiers, that is none of our business. The Spaniards must settle their own affairs, but it will be a final mockery of the Non-Intervention Committee if while the Committee is discussing the withdrawal of volunteers, 100,000 Italian troops are thrown against the front lines of Republican Spain. I am told that there are five Italian divisions concentrated now at Saragossa. I do not know whether the Government are aware whether that information is true, or approximately true, but I do not think there is any doubt that there is a considerable number of Italian troops on that front.<br\/>\nThe right hon. Gentleman begged us not to belittle the Italian offer. That is the very last thing that I should wish to do. If the Italian offer is followed up by action and if these troops are withheld from the front line and forbidden to take part in any offensive action until the Commission is set up and the machinery of withdrawal is set into motion, then I shall be the first to come down and pay my tribute not only to the successful diplomacy of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs but to the wisdom and forebearance of Signor Mussolini. But if this is a time-gaining manoeuvre, and if while this discussion is going on in the Non-Intervention Committee during the next few weeks these Italian troops are\n\n\ngoing to be concentrated for one great effort to smash through the lines before the winter and to finish the campaign if possible before the end of the year, then I say that a short time limit must be fixed and the necessary measures taken, in close co-operation with the French Government, to give equivalent help to the Spanish Government, but not in troops. Let me, with permission, withdraw the word \"equivalent\" and say some compensating help in regard to the opening of the French frontier for the supply of munitions to the Spanish Government.<br\/>\nI hope that I have made it clear that if the Italian offer is to be taken on its merits I should be the last to belittle it; on the contrary, I should welcome it; but there are some ominous signs. Reuter's correspondent, telegraphing from Rome, says that in official circles there word has gone round that there is no vital change in the situation and that the deadlock is only postponed. That is a danger to which I should like to direct the attention of the Government. Reuter's correspondent says that the Italian Government officials declare that it is not a vital change in the situation that has been made but merely a postponement of the deadlock, a move for gaining time by keeping the countries, especially France and Britain, talking round the table while the Italians make a final blow at Republican Spain.<br\/>\nI have supported the Non-Intervention policy patiently. I supported the Government's plan in July, but I begged them at the time to set a time limit. I was afraid that there would be all these delays and that in the meantime the Italians would be reinforcing their troops in Spain. Now that the main principles of the proposal have been accepted by Italy and Germany, success will depend entirely on the speed, the energy and the drive that is put into carrying out the scheme. I hope the Prime Minister may be able to give us some assurance as to when the Commission will be set up. If possible, I should like to know the name of the chairman. Perhaps it is too early to ask that question and I would not press for the information, but it might be a reassurance if he could tell us the name of the chairman of the Commission. I hope that he will be a man of resolute courage and drive, who will not be likely to be diverted from his\n\ntask by the blandishments of the officers he will meet in Spain. I hope that he will be a man of experience and knowledge, and that he will undertake this very difficult task with energy and determination.<br\/>\nI notice that in the speeches made in the Non-Intervention Committee and in come of the communiqu&#233;s issued on its behalf the words \"withdraw\" and \"evacuation\" seem to he used as though they were synonymous. While it is true that you cannot have anything like simultaneous evacuation, because there must be railway schedules, which must obviously take considerable time to arrange, there might be something very near simultaneous withdrawal, at any rate the withdrawal of troops from the front line to the rear out of reach of the fighting. Obviously, that can be carried out much mote quickly than evacuation. I would urge that efforts be made to get the withdrawal of foreign troops on both sides completed within a. very few weeks. Meanwhile, I would suggest that the Non-Intervention Committee and its sub-committee should remain in permanent session until this machinery can be set into motion. I do not suggest that there should be a full meeting of the Non-Intervention Committee every day, but I do think that its sub-committee and its executive organs should remain in permanent session until the Commission is set up and withdrawals are effected.<br\/>\nThe alternative to non-intervention, as I said in July, is not intervention, but if, within a definite time limit, there is no withdrawal, let alone evacuation, of the foreign troops, I hope the Government will make it clear that we shall give full support to France if she wishes to open the frontier between herself and Republican Spain. The right hon. Gentleman says that the country does not wish to intervene in the Spanish struggle. I agree, but the policy of so-called nonintervention is working out as intervention in the affairs of Spain. It is working in this way, that we are preventing the legitimate Government of Spain from obtaining the munitions it requires to defend itself against an invasion of Italian and German troops, while the other side in the struggle is able to obtain any quantities of munitions and large bodies of troops are being sent to it from other European countries by their Governments. I would in this connection\n\n\nstress the importance of co-operation with France.<br\/>\nI was glad to hear the right hon. Gentleman deal with a mischievous rumour which appeared in one of the newspapers this morning about our desire to break the deadlock by getting France to agree to the granting of belligerent Tights before the withdrawal of volunteers; but he did not deal with other rumours that in recent weeks the British Government have been restraining the French Government from taking the action which it thinks necessary in regard to the frontier adjoining Republican Spain. I am very much afraid that unless we are careful we shall have the Hoare-Laval situation in Europe again, with the roles reversed, the right hon. Gentleman playing the part of M. Laval and restraining the French Government from taking the action which is necessary in order to assert the authority of the democratic Powers against the aggressive dictators.<br\/>\nThere is one further point, to which the Leader of the Opposition referred at the opening of his remarks, which I wish to mention, and that is the question of the fugitives in the Asturias. He referred to the women and children there. I will not follow him into that matter, although warmly agree with him and desire to associate myself with what he said. There is also the question of other fugitives, especially the military officers and the officials of the Basque Government who are in peril at the present time. As the Leader of the Opposition mentioned, we helped fugitives from the Red terror, and I am very glad that we did so and that our Navy did good work for the people who were threatened by the Red peril. Similarly, we ought to help people who are threatened by the White peril.<br\/>\nThe Basques have shown great humanity. When Bilbao was being attacked they released 1,500 of their prisoners. At Santander when the final collapse came they surrendered to the Italian general in command&#8212;all the troops that entered Santander were Italians&#8212;on three conditions, that no soldier was to be compelled to fight on the other side, that military officers and Government officials were to be allowed to leave the country in ships, and that no reprisals were to be taken against the\n\ncivilian population. None of these conditions has been kept, and I believe that is owing to the pressure from General Franco's supporters. Whatever may be the reason, the fact is that none of these conditions has been kept, that 1,500 civilians and 16 priests have been murdered in one province alone, that officers and Government officials have been imprisoned, that there have been mock trials and that 600 death sentences have been passed. I do not know whether any of these condemned people have been shot. I would urge the right hon. Gentleman and the Government to intervene if they can to save these people, to offer transport for them and to use such influence as they can, in the name of humanity, to save these people from being persecuted and shot. I hope that the time is coming when the Government will be able to play the part which I am sure the right hon. Gentleman wishes to play, when he can play it effectively, that of mediator. I hope that in this and other ways we shall do all we can to assuage the bitter passions in Spain and to lead that country along the path of peace.<br\/>\nI should like to turn to the question of the Far East, and to express our horror and indignation at the action of Japan, particularly at the use of terrorism and bombardments against the civil population. I wish the right hon. Gentleman had referred to the Roosevelt speech, but instead of that he told us about the Nine-Power Conference. He did not tell us what policy the Government are going to pursue at the Conference, but he addressed the right hon. Gentleman who was sitting next to the Leader of the Opposition and said that no doubt he would explain what the policy of the Labour party was. I want to know what the policy of the Government is. He said that they hoped to stop the fighting, that they hoped to get through with the agenda which had been prepared and that they would work for success. We can all agree to that, but how are they going to work for success? What are their objectives to be? Upon these points he was silent. We are afraid that the Government will continue what the Leader of the Opposition called the \"half-loaf\" policy. Japan wants the whole of North China, in addition to Manchuria. Will she be content with the half instead of\n\n\nthe whole? Is that the policy which the Government have in mind? If not, will they tell us what it is?<br\/>\nPresident Roosevelt has given us a clear indication of his policy&#8212;a concerted effort to maintain the sanctity of treaties. The right hon. Gentleman referred us to the opinion which he had expressed at Llandudno; there he told his audience that it was a clarion call to return to belief in the pledged word of nations and the sanctity of treaties. It was much more than a clarion call to return to belief. It was a clarion call to action, to concerted effort to uphold the sanctity of treaties. That speech which was made in Chicago in the centre of the Middle West, a part of the country where it required most courage to make a speech of that kind, has been supported by the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate, who has called upon us to ostracise Japan. President Roosevelt talked of quarantine, but the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee talked of ostracising Japan. It has been supported equally strongly by Mr. Stimson, the Secretary of State in the last Republican Government.<br\/>\nIf the Foreign Secretary challenges the right hon. Gentleman on the Front Opposition Bench to say what is his policy, I will tell him frankly what my policy would be, and I should like to know whether it is in accordance with the views of the Government, because we have had no indication yet what are the views of the Government. I would consider what measure of pressure can be exercised upon Japan, if pressure is necessary. I think that about 58.2 per cent. of the exports of Japan come to the United States, to Britain and the British Empire, and to Holland and the Dutch Empire. I say, let these countries, and those which would join with them, France and other countries, which together would probably be the recipients of two-thirds of Japanese exports, refuse to accept them&#8212;that is in the last resort. If we did that it would be impossible for Japan to finance the war and to obtain the supplies she needs for her munition factories and for her civilian population and maintain the equipment necessary for her armies. But there is one difficulty. If we did that there are some countries&#8212;the right hon. Gentleman may\n\nhave Hong Kong in mind&#8212;which are vulnerable and which may not care to take part in a policy of that kind for fear of retaliation. Therefore it is necessary to have in the background, but I would keep them in the background and regard them as a last resort, adequate forces to resist any counter-action which an aggressor might take in order to break through the ring of sanctions.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I want to make only one comment on the interesting speech of the right hon. Member for Epping (Mr. Churchill). He has always been looked upon in recent years as one of the foremost champions of the collective system of massing overwhelming forces against an aggressor, but I entirely fail to see how that system is going to he worked effectively if there must never be the slightest interference in any way with the British Navy. You must be willing to co-operate and work with other people, and it is no good saying that what the British say goes and that it does not matter what\n\n\nanybody else may say. May I associate myself with the congratulations to the First Lord on his attaining his present position? I hope he will make a great success, and that on the next occasion he will come to the House with a Measure of much greater importance than the one he has brought forward to-day. He does not himself pretend that it is a Bill which means very much. I think he feels it to be rather a poor little thing, but perhaps its smallness is the measure of the complete failure of the foreign policy of the National Government during the last five years. In my judgment the situation in which we find ourselves to-day is due to the weakness and folly of the British Government since the National Government came into office.<br\/>\nBut working within the narrow limits of the world situation, the Bill has certain merits and it is one which we shall support, as we desire to see it passed into law. May I point out some of its merits which have not actually been mentioned? It means some advance, and it is better to have some advance than none at all. Further, throughout the whole of the negotiations I understand that there were the happiest relations between representatives of the British and American Governments. They understood each other, their views were similar, and at the close of the negotiations a letter was exchanged in which it was made clear that we regarded the American Government's idea of partiy as a fundamental part of British policy. Personally it seems to me that this is of enormous importance, and that we should always press that position. In parity with the American Government you have a potential doubling of the British Navy. I cannot conceive any situation in which they would come in against us, and if they are properly handled, and we pursue a foreign policy which will command their respect, they will come in with us on every occasion. In that way any increase in the American Navy is an increase of the British Navy.<br\/>\nThe third merit of the Bill is that the Government have succeeded in producing an international instrument to which Germany and Soviet Russia are parties. That is a thing which nobody else has been able to do. It is true they have done it by rather indirect methods, but however much Germany may dislike it they are parties to an agreement to which\n\nSoviet Russia and other nations are a party also. I hope this will encourage them to go on and be willing to enter into agreements on a very much wider scale with all the important countries of the world. I feel that one of the most important minor merits of the Bill is the great advance in notification. That is a real improvement. A much more complete list of basic information is to be given and a more complete covering of ships' categories than ever before. I imagine that a provision of that kind, far in advance of anything in any previous naval treaty, will prevent such surprises as have occurred in the past by the sudden introduction of the Dreadnought and the Deutschland. In this connection it is interesting to see what are our actual obligations as to the exchange of information under the Covenant of the League. Under Article 8, Section 6:\n<q>Members of the League undertake to exchange full and frank information as to the scale of their armaments, their military, naval and air programmes and the condition of such of their industries as are adaptable to warlike purposes.<\/q>\nWe are a long way from doing that, but in this Measure there are some steps taken towards carrying out these obligations. I regret that there are no arrangements for mutual inspection of each other's ships and dockyards to see whether promises are being kept. The First Lord gave us a lecture on the solemnity of international obligations, how we must trust each other and assume that people meant what they said. That is all very nice, but we know that there are some Powers in the world, nothing will induce me to mention them by name, whose word is not quite as reliable as that of other Powers. Under the disarmament proposals the National Government were prepared to go a long way to have mutual inspection by representatives of the Disarmament Commission to see what was going on in our establishments here, and I think it would have been another useful step forward and would have led to a great deal of mutual confidence if some arrangement of that kind could have been carried out. No doubt we shall all have our unofficial inspectors, our spies, to see whether these obligations are being carried out or not. Why not do it openly by arrangement rather than by the very much less attractive way of\n\n\nhaving spies to do the work? The fifth point of merit in the Bill is that there are arrangements for a new Naval Conference to take place in 1941, with a preliminary discussion a few months previously. It is something to have had that definitely fixed so as not to have the conference spreading over several years.<br\/>\nI have alluded to the fact that the Measure is on a very limited scale. The limited situation with which the Government have had to deal was produced by their foreign policy. It arises from the disastrous events which took place in Manchuria in 1931. The naval and military authorities in Japan were wondering how far they would be allowed by other Powers to take forcible action, the civil authorities in Japan were still in control, and there was an internal struggle going on. If Great Britain had acted firmly, according to her obligations, the civil authorities in Japan would have triumphed, the policy of force would have been nipped in the bud, and the whole world situation, from the point, of view of a naval agreement, would have been changed for the better. We might then have gone forward on the basis of the Washington and London Treaties, and have made a great advance on them.<br\/>\nIf we had seized the opportunities of the Disarmament Conference in the realm of Naval affairs, almost unthinkable progress could have been made. There is reference in this Agreement to battleships of 35,000 tons, but I believe there was a moment in the discussions at the Disarmament Conference when firm leadership would have produced agreement on the basis of 10,000 ton battleships, and we could have accepted for the world limits which were thought good enough for Germany in the Treaty of Versailles. Owing to the way in which the situation was handled, that is something which is almost inconceivable at the present time. It is the measure of the change in the situation to see the difference between battleships of 35,000 tons&#8212;and there is no certainty about that limit&#8212;and the definite limitation to 10,000 tons which was at one time within sight.<br\/>\nThe whole of our troubles in Naval affairs are due to the fact that there is in power in Japan a government which relies on force as an instrument of national policy, and which is unwilling\n\nto co-operate with other countries in order to come to a general agreement for disarmament and conciliation on the lines of the League of Nations. But as that is the case, I entirely agree that there is no alternative but to face it. If they are going to use force, it is necessary for others, the United States and ourselves, who stand by the new order, to possess forces which will make it entirely impossible for their views to prevail. We are obliged to take up that attitude, but it is due to the attitude of Japan, and that in turn is due to the foreign policy of the present Government. We are in a very dangerous situation as regards the race in armaments. I would like here to quote some words which appeared in the Memorandum on the London Naval Conference, published on 25th March, 1936:\n<q>Furthermore, the agreement should go far to put into effect the hopes expressed by the Prime Minister at the opening of the Conference, that the public mind will be relieved of the threat of a general race in Naval armaments.<\/q>\nHow untrue those words are to-day. The Naval race is going on at the present time. That statement bears no relation to facts as they now are. There has been a good deal of reference in this Debate to the question of 16-inch guns on battleships. The only comment I wish to make on that is to stress the fact that there is there a very great possibility of a race in armaments on a colossal scale, involving enormous expense. It has been made clear to-day that the United States and Japan are going to put in 16-inch guns. I understand that Great Britain and France take the view that the most efficient way is to have 14-inch guns, because one cannot put in guns of a higher calibre without sacrificing speed and protective power. I understand the British view is that with 16-inch guns, it would be necessary to have a vessel of something like 40,000 tons or 45,000 tons. If there are 18-inch guns, which is by no means impossible, if Japan cares to build them in due course, it will be necessary to have battleships of approximately 57,000 tons. There we have some indication of the road to ruin on which the whole world is travelling at the present time.<br\/>\nI wish to refer to one matter that has not been spoken of in the Debate, namely, the lapse of Article 19 of the Washington Treaty, which deals with the fortification of insular bases. That is another\n\n\nvery great potential danger in the future. There is danger of the race in the construction of fortifications and Naval bases in the islands in the Far East. This is again due to the policy of the Japanese Government, which refuses to come to any agreement on these matters with the other Powers. I understand that it is the desire of the Japanese Government at any rate to have available for purposes of fortification the Islands of Bonin, Amami-O Shima, and Loochoo, which they regard as vital in the chain of their national defence. Certain of the islands in which Japan is interested are held on mandate from the League of Nations, and the Japanese Government will not permit anyone to go to those islands to see what is taking place. I think some information ought to be given as to the attitude of the British Government on that matter, for it is not solely a matter for Japan, but is one for the League of Nations. We ought to take the necessary steps, through the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League, to find out what is going on in those islands, where any fortification is wholly prohibited. There is every reason to suppose that fortification is going on.<br\/>\nIf there is fortification of those Japanese Islands, will the United States take no action? There are available the Aleutian Islands, the fortification of which is no longer excluded. I presume that the United States also will have to act. Have the Government any information on this matter? If Japan and the United States take action of that sort, what will be the position of the British Government with regard to Hong Kong, which was previously excluded, but which is now available? Will the Government be good enough to inform the House whether they now contemplate any action with regard to Hong Kong, or whether, in the event of the two other Powers concerned fortifying their islands, they will feel called upon to do something of the kind? There would then be a race in those fortifications.<br\/>\nI am afraid the prospect is very gloomy; but with regard to this Measure, I do not see that we can do anything except pass it as a useful and very minute remainder of what might have been and what should have been. It is only by resolute, consistent and wholehearted backing of the collective system of the League of Nations, above all by the\n\nBritish Government, that we can produce conditions which will make real Naval disarmament possible and bring peace and security to the world.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I beg to move, as an Amendment to the proposed Clause, in line 25, after \"Kingdom,\" to insert:\n<q>or a dominion as defined in section twenty-seven of the Finance Act, 1920.<\/q>\nThe Committee will share my satisfaction that this Amendment raises no problems of Income Tax assessment, but, on the other hand, presents a quite simple question of policy. The Subsection which we have reached is the one under which statutory undertakers whose services are rendered wholly or mainly in the United Kingdom are exempted from National Defence Contribution, and the Amendment is to add to that list the company whose operations take place elsewhere in the British Empire. I suggest to the Committee that there is no real case for dividing up these statutory undertakings strictly in accordance with geographical location within the Empire. There are some hon. Members who would wish not to exempt these statutory undertakers at all, but I do not argue that question. My contention is that if you exempt any, there is a good case for exempting not only those who operate in the United Kingdom, but also those who operate elsewhere in the Empire. It seems to be a little hard that we should divide statutory undertakers into sheep and goats and say that those sheep who browse in comfort in home pastures shall not he taxed, but, on the other hand, that the goats who are working in stoney places outside shall be heavily fleeced. The principle underlying the exemption has been expressed several times by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Last night he said:\n\n\n<q>The view we took was that a public utility company, or in some cases a company established which, by law, was rendering that kind of service and was by law restricted as regards the profits it distributed or the charges it made, was a class of case which ought to be exempted, because they are not free as others may be to make what profits they please or charge what they like.\"&#8212;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 30th June, 1937; col. 2062, vol. 325.]<\/q>\nThat is a general principle, and I suggest that it does not matter where the company is performing its services. Whether the locality be Hammersmith or Hong Kong, the principle applies equally. No doubt my right hon. Friend will say that in logic I ought to claim exemption for companies operating in any part of the world, but there is a solid practical reason against that. We cannot expect the taxing authorities in this country to be acquainted with the minute details of foreign law, and it would be a matter of interpretation of the law whether these statutory undertakers are entitled to exemption or not. In the case, however, of the rest of our Empire, I believe that that administrative difficulty does not arise. I am assured that elsewhere in the Empire the laws under which these companies work are largely modelled on ours, or, anyhow, are very similar, and, of course, in any particular case of doubt it would always be easy to obtain the exact facts by reference to the India Office, the Dominions Office or the Colonial Office.<br\/>\nOn the general question of policy as to what should be our attitude towards British firms carrying on such works within the Empire, my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham (Sir E. Grigg), who, I understand, is going to support this Amendment, is far more entitled than I to speak, but I would suggest that it is the settled policy of all parties to encourage the development of our overseas territories to the best of their ability. In 1929, one of the first actions of the Labour Government was to pass a Colonial Development Act with this precise object of assisting in the development of our overseas territories. If we have that object in view, it would seem to be wrong to tax a statutory undertaking because it happens to be working outside the United Kingdom in some other part of the Empire.<br\/>\nThere is one question to which I must refer, because it is a vital one in relation\n\nto this proposal. Would the Amendment be a costly one? I should be the last to ask the Chancellor to accept any Amendment which would make a serious hole in the revenue of the Exchequer. It would be unfair of any of us to press on him a concession which would embarrass his financial scheme, but I suggest that this could not cause any very big loss of revenue. The different categories of businesses exempted are set out in the four paragraphs (<i>a<\/i>), (<i>b<\/i>) (<i>c<\/i>) and (<i>d<\/i>). I have not been able to find any companies owned in this country that will be affected by paragraphs (<i>b<\/i>) and (<i>c<\/i>), while, as regards paragraph (d), we all know that the great mass of the railways throughout the Empire would not, anyhow, come within the scope of National Defence Contribution. There would remain a certain number of electricity, water and gas companies operating in very various parts of the Empire, and I think there are a few Indian railways, and perhaps one or two in Africa; but anyhow I suggest that the scale of these exemptions cannot be very large, and that the Amendment would not be costly to the Exchequer.<br\/>\nA further reason for its acceptance is that, whatever may be the gross loss to the Exchequer, the nett loss would be substantially less, because, were these statutory undertakers exempted, such dividends as they pay to Trust companies here on their preference and ordinary shares would thereupon become liable to National Defence Contribution. Indeed, the effect of the Amendment would be to transfer the payment on such amounts from the statutory undertaker to the trust company. That class of investment is one which trust companies certainly used very frequently to hold, and there must be a substantial block of securities in such undertakings that are held by companies who would have to pay National Defence Contribution on these dividends. In consequence, the nett loss to the Exchequer would be considerably less than the gross loss. For the reasons, therefore, that the Amendment would not involve a heavy loss to the revenue, and that it would encourage the development of our overseas possessions, I submit that it is worthy of favourable consideration.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>There is always a certain difficulty in deciding on the best way to manage a Colonial Office Debate in Committee of Supply. On this occasion, I understand from the Opposition it is desired that this Vote should be kept open until the report of the Palestine Commission has been received, and that another day should be allotted to the discussion of that report. The Colonial Office Vote can be divided into two parts, one dealing with the Colonial Office and the other with the Middle Eastern Services, but I think it would be more convenient to keep open the Vote for the Colonial Office and for my salary, so that if any questions are raised in to-day's Debate which I am not able to answer, without inquiry and reference, in the course of the afternoon some part of the additional day may be used for dealing with those questions.<br\/>\nAs to this afternoon, I do not think I ought to take up much time in making a preliminary speech on the subjects in the Vote which interest me. I think I ought to be as brief as possible and give hon. Members a chance of raising the points which they desire to raise and to which I shall endeavour to reply in due course. My experience has been that we are apt to get a very wide range of\n\nsubjects on this Vote, and instead of reserving my reply until the very end of the Debate, it may be desirable that I should intervene and make a short reply in the course of the Debate on the matters dealt with up to that point, and then make another short reply later dealing with any subsequent points which have been raised. It is extremely difficult to frame a comprehensive reply dealing with the peoples of 40 different dependencies in every continent in the world and all the aspects of their governments, and matters affecting 55,000,000 people who are under the care of the Colonial Office.<br\/>\nI will only touch on one subject before I sit down and give place to the hon. Member for Rothwell (Mr. Lunn), in order to endeavour to shorten the subsequent Debate on one of the subjects which I know is particularly near his heart, namely, the mui-tsai question. No doubt he will wish to say something about it to-day, but I think I had better explain my position&#8212;it may change in the next few weeks&#8212;on the receipt of the considered comments by the Governors of Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements on the report, which was published on 1st March. It and copies of the volumes of evidence were immediately sent out by air to the two Governors concerned, the Governor of the Straits Settlements and the Governor of Hong Kong, and I sent a dispatch to those Governors asking not merely for their individual views, but for the considered views of their Governments, that is to say, of the Governors and the Executive Councils on both the majority and minority reports. Before I form any opinion, it is only proper that I should get their considered expression of views on the recommendations of both reports.<br\/>\nAs I read the majority and minority reports, they have a very great deal in common, and I hope that we shall not have any attempt to run the reports against one another, but that we shall realise that there is a great deal of common ground between all the members of that Commission and that it is, therefore, important that we should not lose sight of what they are all in favour of. As I have said, I realise that this question, the mere dealing with mui-tsai alone, is only one part of the extremely complex social problem that faces us in those two Colonies. Not only is\n\n\nthe predominant element of the population Chinese&#8212;predominant, I mean, in numbers and not in anything else&#8212;but also in both the Chinese community is very largely shifting; that is to say, it is not a stable population always composed of the same individuals. In Hong Kong thousands of Chinese come in every week and go out every week. It is an island in the mouth of the Canton river, in the neighbourhood of one of the most populous parts of China, and, therefore, we are dealing with a continually changing population, and, as everybody knows, away back for centuries past there have been social customs, as regards polygamy, the sale of children, and all the rest of it, inherent in Chinese life which are repugnant to our ideas and are extremely difficult to tackle, with a shifting Chinese population and particularly with a Chinese population so many of whom are living, not in houses, but in boats.<br\/>\nI remember before I got to Malaya looking at the map of Singapore and seeing in the middle of the city the Singapore river, which divides one half of the city from the other. If you drive along there, at one point you go over a bridge, but when you look at the river you do not see any river. You just see thousands and thousands of boats in which the Chinese live&#8212;Chinese houseboats. They are there in thousands, living on the water, in accordance with custom, and what you might call the management, and the reform, and the alteration of the social customs of a shifting population of that kind does present baffling administrative problems, whatever is the law. We have set our hands to the plough to eradicate or mitigate the evils from those customs, and we are not going to turn back. All that I would say is that when Dr. Drummond Shiels was Under-Secretary of State and Lord Passfield was in my position, I remember Dr. Shiels making a very optimistic speech in this House about the end of mui-tsai and the control of the mui-tsai system. This report has brought out the fact that, in spite of all the efforts made and in spite of the law, this custom and analogous customs go on, and, more than that, you find that all kinds of substitutes, such as adoption and the like, are resorted to in order to get round the law.<br\/>\nMay I say one thing before the hon. Gentleman speaks? We welcome the fact that both in China itself and in the settled Chinese population, both in British Malaya and in Hong Kong, there is a growing public opinion of a more Western character, which views these old social customs in China as things which ought to be done away with or which ought to be changed. That applies particularly to the Christian community, who certainly are not polygamous and who share our views in these matters, and I hope that nothing will be said in the course of this Debate, in dealing with a difficult problem of this kind, which will do anything to prevent the active co-operation of Chinese reformers and of the Chinese community in helping the British officers and the British administration to eradicate these old customs. I am quite sure it is essential, if we are really to achieve success, a real success and not a paper success, to carry the Chinese population with us and to get them to realise that when they come and live even for a short time on British territory, it is the view of the British that many of these customs which they bring with them are repugnant to our ideas of what is right and that we cannot approve of them&#8212;that, in fact, we shall take steps to eradicate them.<br\/>\nIt is, as we read in the report, a long and uphill journey, and I quite agree that no sooner have you dealt with mui-tsai itself than you are into the problem of dealing with many other analogous problems and that the general task of social reform and of moral reform in those parts of the world is one which we must always have prominently in mind. I want to make it clear that until I receive the advice and recommendations of the Governors and their executive councillors on both reports and on the alternatives, obviously I am not in a position to say exactly how, in what degree, or in what order the various and many recommendations in both reports will or will not be put into practice.<\/p>",

Those who undertake a gigantic scheme of rearmament are stimulating imports without stimulating exports. If the hon. Gentleman would preach that doctrine to the Germans and Italians he would be rendering a greater service in the interests of peace.<br\/>\nIn Schedule 6, which he proposed to drop, there is an interesting item on which I would like to comment because of a question which was put at Question Time to-day by the hon. and gallant Member for Orkney and Shetland (Major Neven-Spence). He raised the point of the large imports of rubber boots and shoes from Canada and Hong Kong. When we adopted a protectionist policy, I regret that we did so, with Canada, on the Empire Free Trade basis, instead of the preferential basis under which we could have given ourselves a measure of protection against the competition of other Empire countries. We have not done it, and it is a great mistake, but we have asked the Colonies to do something rather different from that which we are prepared to do for ourselves. On page 45 of this Agreement in respect of a whole list of Colonies commencing with the Bahamas and finishing with Northern Rhodesia it says that they are to be asked to give a preference in respect of rubber boots and shoes and canvas boots and shoes with rubber soles to the extent of Is. a pair or its equivalent, that is to say, the general rate should be the preferential ad valorem rate, if any, plus 1s. per pair. We are not asking the Colonies to admit into their territories Canadian rubber footwear duty free. We are asking that there shall be 1s. a pair difference between the rate which is charged on foreign footwear and that which is charged on Canadian footwear. That is a reasonable and sensible proposal, because Canada is a very large consumer of the primary products of most of the Colonies mentioned.<br\/>\nMy criticism is this: Why can we not afford our own manufacturers in this country the same consideration? I know that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary has heard this issue raised from a great many quarters. It happens that rubber shoes are an outstanding case, but there are a large number of other manufactured commodities which fall into the same category. If it is desired to set up irritation on the part of the manufacturers against our friends in the Dominions, we could do this by pursuing indefinitely the doctrine of Empire Free Trade instead of the doctrine of Imperial preference. At a later stage, when the matter becomes wider on the Motion that the Resolution of the Committee be ap-\n\nproved, there will be an opportunity for a wider Debate, but I think this is an appropriate occasion to emphasise the contrast between the want of protection for ourselves <i>vis &#225; vis<\/i> Canadian manufacturers and that which we are giving to the Crown Colonies to retain for themselves. I only wish the President of the Board of Trade had been as solicitous for the United Kingdom manufacturers as he has been for the Crown Colonies.<\/p>",

Firms have a right to go to arbitration over the capital clause and over individual contracts. I am glad to be able to pay tribute here to the invaluable assistance given us by the Hardman Lever Committee, who are advisers on matters of principle and arbitrators in matters of dispute.<br\/>\nI think I have said enough to show where we stand in the military sphere. I would only ask hon. Members to cast their minds back to two years ago. Let them compare the 53 squadrons of the Metropolitan Air Force of 1935 with the 124 squadrons which will be in being in a few months' time. Let them reflect on all that lies behind the bare numbers of first-line aircraft, the men and mat&#233;riel and stores of all kinds, the immense elaboration and extension of our ground organisation, and the creation <i>de novo<\/i> of an adequate war potential. It is only by comparisons of that kind that a true indication can be obtained of the real progress that we have made in our vast undertaking.<br\/>\nIn past years it has been my custom to give some account of the activities of the Royal Air Force, especially overseas. Last year events at home tended to throw into shadow even the more important operations of the Air Force overseas but, none the less, the year has not been without incident. In particular, the Air Force co-operated usefully and valuably with the land forces in attempting to maintain and restore law and order in Palestine. The speed with which air support could be summoned by wireless to the assistance of convoys engaged with armed bands was one notable feature. It is interesting to note that, from the time of the original summons, it took an aeroplane six minutes to get off the ground. In other parts of the world, particularly in the neighbourhood of Aden, the Air Force has continued successfully to discharge its function of maintaining and restoring law and order, more often than not by demonstration flights alone.<br\/>\nReference has been made in my Noble Friend's Memorandum to the very important exercises which were undertaken at Singapore in January last, when squadrons from Iraq and India, accompanied by bomber transport aircraft, went to Singapore to engage in the exercises there.<br\/>\nI must now turn to civil aviation, where several matters of first importance arise. One of the recommendations of the Gorell Committee on Civil Aviation, that the control of air-worthiness of civil aircraft should devolve upon a statutory autonomous board, was accepted in principle, with the exception of the larger passenger - carrying machines. The requisite Parliamentary authority was given last year by the Air Navigation Act and the memorandum and articles are now virtually settled. The board will be known as the Air Registration Board. It will consist of from 16 to 18 members representative of operators, constructors and insurers, assisted by co-opted members not in any of those categories, and also by two members nominated by the Secretary of State. It is expected that it will commence operations under the chairmanship of Sir Maurice Denny within the next few weeks. It is hoped that the provisions of Part III of the Act, providing for third party insurance for civil aircraft, will come into operation on 1st July.<br\/>\nAnother event of the first importance is the report of the Maybury Committee on the development of civil aviation in Great Britain. Certain <i>ad hoc<\/i> proposals of the Committee have already been implemented. The far-reaching recommendations contained in the final report, in so far as they involve State action, have, as has been stated in my Noble Friend's memorandum, been accepted in principle by His Majesty's Government. Perhaps it will be useful if I mention briefly the main points of policy. The first point is, that routes must be fully organised with wireless and other equipment, so that the services may be regular and punctual both by day and by night, and so as to limit, as far as possible, the risks and dangers of collisions in the air. Accordingly, it is proposed to set up a general system of radio and control facilities, operated by the Air Ministry. Provision for a first instalment of the cost is included in the present Estimates. The experience of internal air services\n\n\nduring the past year has also raised in an acute form the question how such services can best be enabled to operate upon an economic basis. The Committee concluded that if they are to pay there must be some limit to competition. Available traffic must be concentrated so as to permit of a greater number of flying hours for each machine maintained in operation. The practical scheme outlined by the Committee for testing this conclusion is to be followed up in order that further experience may be gained. I should like to take this opportunity of expressing the thanks of His Majesty's Government to Sir Henry Maybury and the members of his Committee for the very valuable report which they have presented.<br\/>\nTurning now to developments in British external air communications, satisfactory progress is being made towards the fulfilment of the Empire Air Mail scheme. After protracted discussions last summer, the Australian Government have now agreed to come into the scheme under arrangements enabling certain special adjustments to be made to meet Australian requirements. The present intention is that the scheme as a whole shall come into operation at the beginning of next year. As from that time all first-class mail from the United Kingdom to Empire countries on the Empire Air routes, will be carried by air at a flat rate of 1&#189;d. per half ounce, that being the current preferential Empire postage rate. Meanwhile, it is hoped that a start will be made on the Durban route in the early summer of this year, and on the Singapore route towards the end of the year. The complete scheme aims at providing flying boat services on the routes to South Africa, India and Australia, assisted by landplane services to India, all operated by the new Empire aircraft. There will be three flying boat services a week to Kisumu, of which two will go on to Durban; and three services a week to Singapore, of which two will go on to Sydney. The landplane services will probably be three services a week to Egypt, of which two will go on to Calcutta, so that with the three flying boat services, there will be five services a week to India, and, of course, there will be arrangements made for feeder services in connection with all routes. Hon. Members will have learned with gratification that the Portsmouth City Council have\n\nagreed to co-operate in this Empire scheme by adopting a proposal for a flying boat base and aerodrome at Langstone Harbour.<br\/>\nThe main details of the arrangements agreed upon between the various governments concerned in connection with the proposed North Atlantic service were explained by me to the House last July. The formidable task of providing the necessary ground organisation and equipment is being actively pursued, and bases for both land and marine aircraft are being selected by the various governments affected. As regards aircraft, there are three main lines of Transatlantic development in hand. Four-engined high speed land machines are on the point of completion, with which it is hoped to operate an experimental service before the end of this year. A fleet of specially designed flying boats should be available in the course of 1938, and the possibilities of catapulting long-range flying boats are being actively investigated. The Mayo composite aircraft and refuelling in the air constitute two subsidiary lines of research, directed to finding the best solution of long-range problems. Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages. They will all be actively pursued with the object of finding out their possibilities. Meanwhile, experimental trials have already begun with two flying boats of the \"Empire\" type specially fitted for long-range operation. I think that the House will agree that we have every reason to be proud of the achievements of these Empire aircraft.<br\/>\nAmong the new British external services introduced in 1936 were a weekly mail service between Khartoum and Kano and Lagos, and a temporary service between Penang and Hong Kong, pending completion of arrangements for a permanent connection from Hong Kong to the Empire trunk routes. It is expected that the Burmuda-New York service will begin operations this year. It will entail nonstop hops over 800 miles of water. A proposal for the establishment of a trans-Tasman air service, which was discussed at a conference at Wellington last autumn, still awaits the approval of the Governments concerned.<br\/>\nThe expansion of the Royal Air Force and the development of civil aviation in this country have very largely increased the demand for meteorological informa-\n\n\ntion, especially in regard to flying at night or for flying in cloud. To meet this, a revised organisation of meteorological stations has been evolved, and is being brought into operation as rapidly as the necessary trained personnel can be provided. The organisation will cover a number of primary forecasting stations with scientific and observer staff. To each of these stations there will be allotted a series of subsidiary stations, situated on aerodromes, from which night or cloud flights take place. Trained assistants will man these stations and will provide local information and obtain forecasts from the main stations as required. For the Empire air routes, the work of establishing the meteorological ground organisation has made satisfactory progress, while a special section of the Meteorological Office is engaged upon a study of weather conditions in the North Atlantic.<br\/>\nIt is now necessary for me to return for a moment to the current financial year. Some further adjustment became necessary in our expenditure during the year, beyond that provided for in the Supplementary Estimate presented in July last. Briefly, we have made more headway with our works and buildings programme than had been expected, and the result is an increase of expenditure; while, as far as equipment is concerned our expectations have not been fully realised. It is, therefore, necessary for me to present to the House a token Supplementary Estimate for &#163;100 to cover the major variations which I have mentioned, and some less important variations which are also shown in the details of the Estimate.<br\/>\nIt is impossible for me, in a speech of any reasonable length, to give an adequate idea of the immense activity which has prevailed during the past year throughout the Royal Air Force, both in the Service itself and in the Departments of the Ministry. It is the more gratifying, therefore, to me to pay a deserved tribute to the loyal manner in which the incessant demands of the expansion scheme have been met, both by the staffs of the departments, and throughout the Service. Throughout all the expansion, in every step on the industrial side, and in fact in almost every aspect of our work, we have had the invaluable and untiring assistance of Lord Weir, who has brought to bear upon our problems his great industrial experience and his almost unique\n\nknowledge of the Air Force, which he himself did so much to create.<br\/>\nThe Ministry can make plans, and the nation can provide the money; but the plans cannot effectively be carried out without the loyal and intelligent cooperation of all ranks and all departments. Indeed, more than that is needed to make a success of an expansion scheme so vast. We need the willing co-operation of the aircraft industry and of the other industries working for us, and the help and the encouragement of the nation as a whole. All that is vital. All that we have had. The staffs of the Department have given us of their best. The existing personnel of the air stations and squadrons have accepted the continuous stream of recruits and enthused them with their own spirit. The aircraft industry and other industries working for us have shown an earnest desire to do everything they possibly can to help. Finally, the nation at large has encouraged us with an ample flow of recruits. We ask that this flow may continue.<br\/>\nI make bold to say that so large an expansion in so short a time has never been approached, even remotely, in like circumstances by any other Service Department. It is an expansion without precedent in peace time in the history of our country. It is being accomplished by voluntary effort, and not by emergency powers. It is based on cooperation and good will, and not upon dictatorial decrees. We have still an enormous task before us during the next two years. I venture to say that we have made a good beginning with an expansion scheme of which even yet we cannot clearly see the end. I am confident that, if the help and encouragement that we have received during the past two years are continued, we shall surmount successfully whatever further problems we may be called upon to meet.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I thank the hon. and gallant Gentleman. It suits my argument&#8212;that, in addition, they had over 6o battleships of different sizes, a very much larger number of line of battleships than we have to-day. We were for some years before the outbreak of the War in alliance with Japan, and were were able, after the first few months of the War, to leave almost entirely the convoying of food ships from Australia, from New Zealand or Hong Kong, or tea shipments from India, to Japanese convoys. The hon. and gallant Gentleman who interrupts certainly will not deny the great assistance that Japan rendered to us in that connection. We have laid before us a building programme which is going to cost hundreds of millions of pounds on the Navy alone in five years, and at the end of it what will you have? It is said that you are aiming at a strength of 15 new capital ships. I suppose it may be argued later that you are going to put some of the present capital ships into reserve. I should hope you are, with the money that you are spending. The existing capital ships are costing anything from &#163;500,000 up to &#163;2,500,000 per ship to refit. I understand you will also have 70 cruisers, 53 of which will be under age, and with that you propose to operate on a unilateral basis. You say you are so expanding at Singapore that you will be able to have an adequate operative base in the Far East. The First Lord's words were deliberately chosen so as to indicate that we shall no longer be in the position of humility in which we were put in connection with the League situation on the Manchurian issue.<br\/>\nAt the end of that programme, as far as I can see, you may stand in grave danger because you have discarded real support of collective security and you have no alliances of the kind that you had before the War. You will probably be without an effective friend in the world. [<i>Interruption.<\/i>] If that is not the policy why does not the First Lord tell us what it is? We have asked for it again and again. We have said, \"Tell us what we must vote the money for, as our contribution to collective security, and we will vote it if it is for collective security and is reasoned out on a basis of collective security.\" There has not been a word of that to-day. If it is not on collective security, is it on balance of power? If so, what fleets are you going to count upon as coming to your aid, or does the First Lord really think we are going to believe that a unilateral force of 15 capital ships under age, with perhaps a few older ships, and 70 cruisers is going to be capable of defending the whole of the British Empire on a unilateral basis? Anyone who knows the real facts and knows the strategical position knows that that is completely false, yet we cannot get from the Government what is the real policy to which they are building their standard. You must make up your mind. Your naval programme must be on a basis of absolute provision or on a basis of provision relative to other people's navies and the navies that are going to be against you or with you Until we can get some information upon that, we are entitled to say we cannot accept this policy of the Government. It is not only expensive, but it is giving no guarantee of naval security at all.<br\/>\nIt is also said that, if we want to have any effect on the programmes of other Powers, we ourselves must arm. We must not become weak. We must become stronger. I have been looking in the last few weeks to see what was likely to be the effect of the announcement of our increase of armaments, especially of the Navy. I wonder if the First Lord has given any attention to that. For example, I read in the \"New York Times\" on 19th February the statement of Admiral Leahy of the United States Naval Department, in which he referred to the British programme and said, \"Of course it will be necessary for the United States Navy Department to increase its fleet accordingly.\" I entirely agree with\n\n\nthe First Lord that we have no need to worry about the increase of the United States fleet if only the United States and ourselves are to be considered, but is it not perfectly true to say that, for every ship that the United States lays down because of the increase of the British programme, you may expect a similar provision to he made, as far as they can, by the Japanese?&#8212;[<i>Interruption.<\/i>] I am delighted to get that kind of acquiescence. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Epping knows quite well that the financial question, which was raised in 1914, led large numbers of people to believe that, even if war broke out, it would not last three months, but it lasted four years. It was the opinion commonly canvassed in this country, and when I look at the Budget of Japan for the last five years, year after year, and when I see, for example, that last year they actually spent over 1,000,000,000 yen upon their fighting services, compared with about 400,000,000 yen three years previously, an increase of two and a half times&#8212;and it was all by loan&#8212;I am not at all of the opinion that they have come to the end of their borrowing. Personally, I do not think that financial considerations of that kind will ever prevent nations with the outlook of Japan, Germany and Italy, especially based upon their actions in the last few years, from actually going on building if they believe that we are carrying out a large armaments programme.<br\/>\nThe remarks of the First Lord in making a distinction between defensive and offensive methods, were no doubt entirely based upon strategical considerations in the event of a war breaking out, but I am sure that there will be people in other countries who will read those remarks and who will think that the actual expansion of the programme in this country is for the purpose of being in the position to take the offensive and not merely to act upon the defensive. If that is the wrong interpretation, I hope that the First Lord or the Parliamentary Secretary will make it abundantly clear to the people concerned. At any rate, I hold the view, and I am sure many of my hon. Friends do, that the mere question of temporary financial trouble is not going to prevent nations like Germany, Italy and Japan from answering,\n\nas far as they can, the expanded provisions which are going on in this country to-day, and, therefore, there is no actual guarantee of security in that programme. The First Lord must, of course, have seen the announcement recently of Signor Mussolini's answer to Britain's rearmament programme in the three Services, namely, that there should be a war basis adopted.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>Nearly all litigation arises between men who have nothing and men who have something. When both sides have nothing there is no litigation. It is an artificial doctrine in our law to make a man responsible for another man's mistakes. It is not an artificial doctrine to say that when it is\n\nthe fault of a fellow workman the man should not be responsible. That is a modification of the artificial doctrine. Suppose you take a ship away to some distant part of the world and one sailor injures another at the dockside at Shanghai or Hong Kong or somewhere like that. Think of the cost of such a case when the ship comes home. All these cases of injury fall into the hands of a certain class of lawyer. We used to have lots of them. They had touts, who followed the ambulances on their bicycles. They besieged hospitals and they had understandings with some doctor inside, who were sending to particular lawyers, and there were all sorts of cadging. Then an action under the Employers' Liability Act was raised against the unfortunate employer, and at the end of the day there was very little for the workman. That sort of thing raised a whole breed of that type of legal adviser, any number of them. The beauty of the Workmen's Compensation Act is that it has almost entirely killed litigation. The percentage of claims that actually go to litigation is infinitesimal. Why? Because there is no evidence needed, except that a man was working in the course of his employment. He can get compensation even if he is drunk when employed, because I suppose the framers of the Act thought it natural for a man to get drunk now and again. That practice has almost died out now, even in Glasgow, for you seldom see anyone the slightest bit touched in any way, still less so when working. The hon. Member for Springburn (Mr. Hardie) knows well enough that in the big licensed premises in Clydebank it was a very common thing at breakfast time for a man to go in for a pint and a glass. The licensees had rows of glasses ready waiting for the men as they came in. That has all died away. The Workmen's Compensation Act is so framed in favour of the worker that even if he is guilty of misconduct or carelessness he still gets his compensation.<br\/>\nThe liability under this Bill would be unlimited. It is really a Bill for the relief of unemployed lawyers, and the litigation that would arise from it would be colossal. Cases to-day are settled very largely on this line: The Geddes Committee put on heavy court dues for cases heard in the courts. That is most nefarious. There should be no court\n\n\ndues; the courts of the land should be open without any payment to all His Majesty's lieges. To-day, when an action is raised, the claims inspector looks to see who the solicitor is. He says, \"Now we must wait until this fellow has a good account.\" He' then goes to the solicitor and says, \"It will be some time before the case comes for trial and heavy expense will be incurred. Come along and settle the case. I will give you so much.\" It is generally about one-fifth or one-quarter of what the man will recover. The solicitor sends for the wretched man and says, \"Look here; I have an offer of &#163;100. It is a miserable offer and you will get far more from a jury. But you will get it entirely into your own hands with not a penny deducted, for they have paid me generously.\" He is quite honest about it. Then the solicitor says, \"But if you are going on with this case you will need to put up the money for court dues and the money to pay the jury. I do not mind running the risk of losing my fees, but I am not going to be out of pocket, and the jury's fee is 10s. a day, which is a heavy outlay.\"<br\/>\nIn England the jury fee is 1s. 6d. a day. I might explain that the theory was in England that the winner stood refreshment for the jury when he had won his case, and in those days is. 6d. covered a great deal of refreshment. But in Scotland the fee is 10s. a day. My hon. Friend the Member for Smethwick says that that represents the difference in price between beer and whisky. These court dues are a heavy charge and there is actually a charge of 10s. an hour while a man's counsel is speaking. So if you have a long-winded counsel you pay heavily for it. It is as if the court was a taxi-cab. I have heard my friend the late Lord Justice Clerk Scott-Dickson say to a counsel intervening at the luncheon hour, \"You are taking 2s. 6d. of So-and-So's time.\" To resume, the solicitor says to the wretched man \"You have to put up that money, it may be &#163;20.\" and, of course, the poor fellow cannot find &#163;20. He, therefore, accepts that miserable settlement. That is what is happening. There are other ways of settling. I knew a man who adopted this way of settling. He would have &#163;80 in silver laid on his table. Then he would say to the man, \"If you will take it, it is all yours.\" The fellow had never seen so much\n\nmoney. The solicitor would say: \"I will give you a canvas bag to carry it away.\" When people were known to have had a lump sum settlement the bookie was on the doorstep at once. Sometimes the man's wife would say: \"We will start a little shop,\" and some wily commercial traveller would come along and stock the shop. They would think they were doing spendidly as they sold the stock, but in a few weeks or months they were on public assistance. The truth is that the man on a weekly wage does not know how to handle a large sum of money. It takes a long time to learn how to handle it. As a matter of fact there are only a few inhabitants of the world who were born with the instinct for looking after money.<br\/>\nThe result of the passing of this Bill would be a perfect maelstrom of litigation and the only people who would get any benefit out of it would be the new crop of lawyers who would grow up. I may be sounding very disloyal to my own profession but I regard unemployed lawyers as a great danger to the community. They are just like so many hungry sharks. They are the creators of all these abominable Marketing Boards which ruin producers and at the time raise the cost of the people's food. In Canada they go round to the farmers and address them and get them to vote for Marketing Boards which spread ruin everywhere. They call it \"farming the farmers.\" I do not want to see a great crop of such men growing up, and that is why I am opposed to this Bill as a practical man who knows all about this side of the profession. I have acted for defendants and for plaintiffs. Once I made a very reasonable offer to a man without serving any writ or document. I wrote a letter and a representative of the insurance company came round, one of their claims settlers, a very \"fly\" class of men. If there were a railway accident to-morrow they would be on the doorstep of the home of everybody who was injured in order to try to get the man to settle before he had recovered consciousness.<br\/>\nOne of those fellows came and offered me just a trifle. I refused it and said the settlement I had proposed was a most reasonable one. He went away, but afterwards came back and gave me what I thought was a reasonable sum. I said to him, \"I am very glad you had the sense to settle.\" He said, \"I should\nnot have got away with it with So-and-\n\n\nSo or So-and-So,\" naming two solicitors. I said, \"Why did you first offer me such a ridiculous sum? It is an insult?\" and he answered, \"Well, we thought you were such a decent chap that you would not screw us up.\" I said, \"That is all very well. I will screw you hard for my client but not for myself.\" That is the sort of thing which this Bill will lead to, crops of solicitors growing up and endless litigation. There is no worse service you can do to a man than to put him into the law courts. That is a terrible thing to do. People are driven to bankruptcy, insanity and suicide by litigation. Litigation is civil war, it is war in the civil courts. If we introduce this legislation it will be enough to break the hearts of many employers of labour and destroy the nerves of both the worker and his wife.<br\/>\nAn hon. Member opposite has argued that there is litigation under the workmen's compensation, but there is always a certain amount of litigation till the borders have been defined. Of course there are always border-line cases, and it is those which lead to litigation. A new Act of Parliament always involves some litigation over those border-line cases. Then it has been said that the sums awarded under workmen's compensation are inadequate. The hon. Member for Hitchin instanced the case where a man with a family got compensation amounting only to 25s. a week, and no doubt that is a very hard case, but the point is that a man is not awarded compensation on the basis of the number of his family. If that were to be the case it would lead to inquisitorial investigations by insurance companies, who would say to an employer, \"You must not employ men with philoprogenitive tendencies or we shall have larger sums to pay\". All our wage system is on an entirely wrong basis. We pay the man with a large family the same wage as a man with no family at all.<br\/>\nIn the old agricultural days the labourer had a small sum of money as wages, but as he grew up and married he got the advantages of a free house, and milk and meal and other things of that kind. In cities we cannot conduct affairs on that basis. However, there ought to be some system of investigation into the circumstances of the workman because all these liabilities can be insured against, and the man could be given a more ample\n\ncompensation. But these risks which the employer would run ought to be capable of calculation, so that the employer will know what his business expenses are going to be. Under this Bill the risks are practically illimitable.<br\/>\nMotor car insurance has been cited as an example. I would remind the House that one of the first things that happened after motor insurance became compulsory was that some of the motor insurance companies burst up and large claims were never settled. That is not a satisfactory position. Moreover, motorists pay high premiums. The insurance premium costs almost more than the petrol; it is more than the cost of tyres; it is the equivalent of depreciation on the car. It is a colossal charge; and it must be remembered, too, that private motor cars are not run for profit.<br\/>\nOn practical grounds I oppose this Measure, and would urge upon hon. Members that they should not involve working men and their employers in litigation, because if they do they will in the end be very much in the position of the old sheep farmer in the Highlands who went to a lawyer with a claim against another farmer. The lawyer said \"I will give you a letter to Mr. So-and-So.\" He handed the farmer a letter of introduction. The farmer opened it and found that it read:\n<q>Here are two fat 'wedders' from the braes of Balquidder. They have fallen out thegither. So if you fleece the one I'll fleece the other and we will make them agree like brother and brother.<\/q>\nHe showed it to his opponent, and at once the two farmers settled the case, and they settled it in the true Burnsian fashion. They adjourned to a neighbouring hostelry, and there they sat down and fulfilled the words of Burns:\n<q>Its ay the cheapest lawyer's fee to taste the barrel.<\/q>\nI would repeat my warning to those members who are putting the workmen's case in this debate that they will be doing them a great injury if they get this Bill passed into law. They will be landing workmen in a maelstrom of litigation and they will not get any good out of it. The only people who will benefit will be the new class of sharp lawyers who will arise. The better course would be to pursuade the Government to look into the position as regards workmen's compensation, and to remove the evils and the excrescences\n\n\non the present law, and to make it more generous towards the workmen. The position of the workmen who get hold of large sums of money in lump sum payments should also be safeguarded. Steps should be taken to see that the money is not taken off them by some rascal or other who will waste and dissipate it. For these reasons I shall vote against the Bill, for I have the greatest desire to see working men get the highest compensation for their injuries&#8212;provided that the money actually reaches them and is not taken off them by somebody else.<\/p>",

I hope also that his visit will mean that we have knit together the bonds of Empire more closely than before. I say that especially after listening to the last Debate. I was shocked to hear the large number of wreckers there are in the House. I had no idea that there were so many men who do not believe in cooperation in the Empire. Nearly every speaker wished to support the break-up\n\nof the Empire. I am obliged to the hon. and gallant Member for Wycombe (Sir A. Knox) for saying that if you want to hear speeches regarding co-operation in the Empire you have to come to this side of the House. We on these benches are as anxious as, even more anxious than, any hon. Members we have heard to-night to establish co-operation with our brothers and sisters in the Dominions overseas.<br\/>\nRegarding Empire settlement, I can say truthfully that I am a supporter of it under proper conditions. If proper conditions can be established and we can see opportunities of a livelihood for our people who go overseas, I have not the least objection to Empire settlement. Had this Bill been like the Act of 1922, there would have been no division upon it. My objection is to a particular feature of this Bill, and I am glad to have the opportunity of registering another vote against it on that ground. From the beginning of these discussions I have foreseen what is likely to happen if this Bill became law.<br\/>\nPrior to the introduction of the Bill an Inter-Departmental Committee inquired into the future of migration and made a number of recommendations with many of which I agreed, and with one of which I did not agree. That recommendation is now contained in the Bill, as a result of the Secretary of State having presided over that Inter-Departmental Committee. It was to the effect that instead of the 50&#8211;50 arrangement which we had for 15 years there should be a 75&#8211;25 arrangement when dealing with certain classes of migration through voluntary societies. I believe that the best co-operation with the Dominions is co-operation between the Government in this country and the Governments over-sea. I do not believe we ought to hand out money to voluntary societies for the purpose of transporting human beings from one end of the world to the other. By this Bill we are to provide 75 per cent. from this country to enable voluntary societies to carry, out one of these recommendations. That is to see that children who may be neglected, children who may be orphans, children who may be in poor law institutions can be sent oversea and used as little child slaves in many cases. I opposed mui tsai in Hong Kong and I am opposed to restarting this system which we had already abolished.<br\/>\nI want this House to have an opportunity of voting against the restarting of such a scheme of sending young children abroad in that way. We had this system of sending for 18 years and many thousands of children were sent overseas to Canada, and as a result of the report of 1924 the Canadian Government and the British Government both felt that there was no argument for a continuance of that system and it was abolished. Now the present Secretary of State desires to restart it, and recommends that it should be restarted. If I wanted an argument in support of my case I can find one in the words which the Secretary of State used in his last speech in reply to my argument upon it. He said:\n<q>The type of migration to which the hon. Member and his party object is, not the migration of children in any circumstances but the migration of children under a system which means that they are boarded out in families in the Dominions. He has pointed out that in the past this boarding-out system was condemned by a Commission which travelled in Canada, and that it has resulted in many unsatisfactory cases in which children were treated as drudges in families. I would not contest that at all.<\/q>\nThe right hon. Gentleman admitted the whole of my case. He continued:\n<q>I agree with the hon. Gentleman that in the past that system did result in some cases in which children led a rather unhappy life in the homes where they were boarded out; and that experience would naturally make the Government think very carefully before deciding to approve in principle of the recommencement of any such scheme. There are very weighty arguments against the Government deciding to participate in any such scheme again, and they may very well come to the conclusion that they will not participate in such a scheme, but I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an absolute assurance to-day.''&#8212;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 4th February, 1937; col. 1498, Vol. 319.]<\/q>\nBecause the right hon. Gentleman cannot give that assurance which I think he ought to give, that he will not recommend his Government to restart a scheme in which there are no safeguards and no inspection in the interests of the children, I oppose the Bill. For these reasons I hope that a Division will be taken and that the House will vote in favour of young children born and bred in this country not being sent to any part of the world, in the Empire or outside it, to be used, as the right hon. Gentleman admits many of them were used, as little drudges. We ought to regard them as human beings.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I beg to move, to leave out from \"That\" to the end of the Question, and to add instead thereof:\n<q>whilst this House recognises the importance to the State of the mercantile marine and is prepared to grant it proper assistance, it cannot assent to the continuation of a subsidy under conditions which are swelling private profits instead of ensuring the efficient reorganisation of the industry and the estab-\n\n\nlishment of a higher standard of wages and conditions for sailors in recognition of their arduous calling.<\/q>\nI am very glad to find the Parliamentary Secretary in such a combative mood. If he is the batsman, I am the bowler, and I hope it will prove to be a bowler's wicket. I am very sorry that the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Board of Trade himself is not here, partly because I think his presence would have been desirable in this Debate, and partly because I have some understanding of the responsibilities which are falling upon the Parliamentary Secretary on this occasion. I should hope that the President of the Board of Trade will not return in the \"Queen Mary\" but in one of his own tramp steamers or in a cargo liner employing Lascars and living on Lascar rates of wages. This appears to be the Parliamentary Secretary's swan song on this question of subsidies for tramp shipping, and no doubt that is why he has been a little more aggressive than on previous occasions.<br\/>\nI do not propose to refer specially to the question of the conditions of life at sea, because I have spoken about them before, but I think one is entitled to refer to the conditions on which the subsidy was originally given. The Parliamentary Secretary has spoken again to-night about the fulfilment of the conditions, and one of those conditions is the payment of wages on the National Maritime Board's scale. I have a case here of a ship, the steamship \"Baron Inchcape.\" A letter was addressed to the Board of Trade away back in November, and a further letter was sent in January, and the Board of Trade was good enough to acknowledge by postcard the receipt of the letters, but the reply did not reach the organisation which was concerned until the very day on which we had our first discussion in the House this week, and then it was sent by hand. I am glad at least that the Board of Trade can be active on occasions, but it has been a matter of two months' delay before this question has been inquired into. The complaint was that during two voyages the steamship \"Baron Inchcape\" paid wages below the National Maritime Board's scale. That boat is owned by a company which gets the subsidy from the Government. This is the reply, which was very hastily sent by hand on Monday. Who applied the\n\nginger in the Board of Trade, I do not know, but no doubt the hon. Gentleman does.\n<q>I am directed by the Board of Trade to refer to your letters of the 24th November, 1936, and the 7th January, 1937 &#8230; regarding the rates of wages paid to certain of the navigating and engineer officers serving on the steamship 'Baron Inchcape' on two voyages commencing 3rd September, 1935, and 2nd September, 1936, respectively.<\/q><q>The Tramp Shipping Subsidy Committee have been in communication with the owners of the vessel on this matter, and have ascertained that the error in respect of the wages paid to the first and second mates and the first, second, and third engineers arose inadvertently &#8230;.<\/q>\nThat is a long word, but it is a very good one and appears to cover \"a multitude of sins.\" The reply goes on:\n<q>&#8230; and that when the matter was brought to the owners' notice in connection with the opening of articles for the subsequent voyage of the vessel, the position was rectified.<\/q><q>The owners have satisfied the Committee that they have taken the necessary steps to make good to the officers concerned the difference between the rates actually paid to them in respect of the previous voyages and the rates applicable under the appropriate National Maritime Board Agreement.<\/q><q>In these circumstances the Committee regard the matter as satisfactorily settled.<\/q>\nI am bound to say that a letter like that fills me with the deepest apprehension. I cannot believe that any responsible shipping company can underpay people&#8212;what was the word?&#8212;inadvertently. I cannot believe that the Tramp Shipping Subsidy Committee is doing its work effectively. I hope the hon. Gentleman will, by the courtesy of the House, be entitled to make his explanation of that, because again he has stated that there has been a fulfilment of these honourable conditions with regard to wages.<br\/>\nIn the House of Commons over two years ago now I drew attention to a speech of the President of the Board of Trade, made in Leeds. I regretted when I spoke that he had not made it in this House, but at least it was a brave speech. He said:\n<q>Power had been taken to prevent black-legging in the chartering of tramp steamers that were entitled to the subsidy. They would see to it that the portion of the British Mercantile Marine that received subsidies should not blackleg in wages or other conditions that were under the control of the National Maritime Board.<\/q>\nWe have raised from time to time the question of Lascars employed in British\n\n\nships. I have said in this House that Lascars are all of them born in Aden and are, therefore, British citizens, and that the Chinese sailors on British ships are all born in Hong Kong and ate, therefore, British citizens. I am assured that that is broadly the truth, and I am going to accept the position now, that these Lascars and so on are British citizens who are, tinder the spirit of this Act, entitled to the protection of the British Maritime Board and its regulations. I quoted in an earlier Debate in the House from the form issued by the Tramp Shipping Committee for applications for subsidy in respect of tramp voyages, and I want the Parliamentary Secretary and the House to follow my argument here, because we have succeeded time after time, as a result of questions pat by my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherhithe. (Mr. Benjamin Smith), in eliciting a little more information about the position of these Lascar seamen. The form in question has to be filled up by a tramp ship-owner or by a cargo-liner Owner Who is, for the purposes of the Act, a tramp ship-owner for the time being, and he is required to make this declaration:\n<q>I declare that these particulars are correctly stated and that during the period covered by the application\n<ol><li>(<i>a<\/i>) I was the registered owner of the ship above mentioned;<\/li><li>(<i>b<\/i>) National Maritime Board wages were paid to all officers and crew;&#8230;\"<\/li><\/ol><\/q>\nWe have had a case of inadvertence in regard to that, to which I have already referred. It goes on:\n<q>&#8230;(<i>c<\/i>) All members of the crew were British subjects &#8230;<\/q>\nwhich includes Lascars, Chinese born in Hong Kong, and Kroo boys from West Africa&#8212;\n<q>&#8230;(<i>d<\/i>) The National Maritime Board agreement requiring the inclusion of three certified navigating officers, in addition to the master, in the crews of foreign-going vessels of 2,75o tons gross and upwards was complied with.<\/q>\nThere is a footnote to the form, which says:\n<q>If a declaration cannot be made in the sense of (<i>b<\/i>), (<i>c<\/i>), and\/or (<i>d<\/i>), the words should be struck out and an explanatory statement attached.<\/q>\nOn 8th December last my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherhithe asked the President of the Board of Trade whether he would state\n\n<q>the number of vessels in respect of which subsidy has been paid during 1936 in which lascar or other coloured seamen formed the whole of the crew and part of the crew respectively.<\/q>\nThe Parliamentary Secretary will no doubt remember his reply on that occasion. He said:\n<q>The information desired is not available in the records of the Tramp Shipping Subsidy Committee, since it is not relevant to their consideration of claims to inquire whether the crew on any particular voyage comprised or included coloured seamen.<\/q>\nHe went on to say:\n<q>Owners must satisfy the committee that in the engagement of seamen they have complied with the committee's requirement regarding the employment of British crews.\"&#8212;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th December, 1936; col. 1808, Vol. 318.]<\/q>\nHaving regard to the form of the declaration to be signed by the shipowners, which I have read, and having regard to the footnote which I have also read, the inference to be drawn from the Parliamentary Secretary's reply on 8th December last is that all persons, whether white or coloured, employed as British citizens on a ship on a voyage which qualified for subsidy were paid according to the National Maritime Board Agreement. That is perfectly clear. If the coloured seamen were not paid in accordance with that agreement, that declaration could not be signed by a shipowner&#8212;at least, not honestly&#8212;and an explanation would be necessary. I have read the agreement which says that if an owner cannot answer (<i>b<\/i>), (<i>c<\/i>) and (<i>d<\/i>), he must attach an explanation, and that explanation would clearly go before the Tramp Shipping Subsidy Committee. Consequently, the information for which my hon. Friend asked a few weeks ago ought to be available and must be available in the offices of the Tramp Shipping Subsidy Committee, unless every British seaman employed on every ship which has got a subsidy was receiving the Maritime Board rate of wages.<br\/>\nI am going to say that as regards Lascars, as regards Chinese, and as regards Western African Kroo boys, those rates are not being paid. I am going to suggest&#8212;and I do not want to put it too high&#8212;that the President of the Board of Trade and the Parliamentary Secretary have not been very frank about this question. I am going to suggest that they have prevaricated. I am even going to suggest that they have misled this House\n\n\nand the public. On 7th April last year my hon. Friend the Member for Rother-In-the&#8212;I hope he will not mind my, quoting him so often to-night&#8212;asked a question of the President of the Board of Trade about the crew of the steamship \"Kelvinbank.\" That was a steamship owned by a, company that received nearly &#163;77,000 of subsidy in 1935,, a company which employed a very large number of lascars and Chinese. In reply, the President of the Board of Trade said that the lascars were serving on a lascar agreement opened at Calcutta, and that subsidy had been paid in respect of voyages carried out in 1935 by this vessel. My hon. Friend then put this question:\n<q>Is it the case that the agreement they are under contravenes the rates of the National Maritime Board?<\/q>\nThe President of the Board of Trade replied:\n<q>I cannot say that until the agreement has been examined by the Committee.<\/q>\nMy hon. Friend then drew attention to the fact that the National Maritime Board agreement contains a stipulation as to overtime, and the President of the Board of Trade replied:\n<q>The remaining members of the crew are employed on a lascar agreement and, as is customary, there are no stipulations regarding overtime in this agreement. I have drawn the attention of the Tramp Shipping Subsidy Committee to this matter.<\/q>\nMy hon. Friend, who seemed to be irrepressible that afternoon, pressed the point further, and said:\n<q>If that is so the agreement\"&#8212;<\/q>\nthat is, the National Maritime Board agreement&#8212;\n<q>is not being observed by this company.<\/q>\nThen the President of the Board of Trade said, for the second time within two minutes:\n<q>I have already said that I have drawn the attention of the Committee to these facts\"&#8212;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 7th Ana 1936; cols. 2577&#8211;8, Vol. 310.]<\/q>\nTherefore, there can be no dubiety of meaning about the answer given by the President of the Board of Trade. My hon. Friend's enthusiasm waned for the moment, and he gave the President of the Board of Trade two months before he pressed the matter again. On 16th June he put this question to the President of the Board of Trade:\n<q>Whether ha has now, consulted the Tramp Shipping Administrative Committee as to the\n\nvalidity of lascar agreements on ships in respect of which subsidy has been claimed; and, if so, with what result?<\/q>\nThe President of the Board of Trade replied:\n<q>I am not aware of any reason for consulting the Committee on this subject.<\/q>\nNot aware of any reason for consulting the Committee on this subject, when on one day he had twice stated that he was bringing the matter before the Committee. The right hon. Gentleman went on to say:\n<q>But I may remind the hon. Member that lascar agreements are Indian Government agreements signed in India under the supervision of the Indian Government's representatives.<\/q>\nIn view of that answer, which was a complete denial of what the right hon. Gentleman had said he would do two mouths before, my hon. Friend pursued the matter further by asking:\n<q>Has not the right hon. Gentleman given the House to understand that the Maritime Board's agreements are the agreements which have to be observed to qualify before the collection of the subsidy, and is he not now saying that he is extending these agreements to lascar agreements made in India, for which the Maritime Board have no responsibility at all.<\/q>\nThe President of the Board of Trade replied:\n<q>The hon. Member is mistaken in imagining that the Maritime Board agreements apply in this case.<\/q><\/p>",

            "body": "<p>Since 1930 scores of thousands more have come back to the United Kingdom than have left our shores for the Dominions. That is what I said and that is what I mean, and there is no prospect at all of any migration to any of the Dominions at present. There is a large amount of unemployment in each of the Dominions to-day. There is no statesman in any of the Dominions who supports the idea of migration at this moment. There is no Labour organisation and no trade union which will welcome migrants in the Dominions. The Prime Minister of New Zealand the other day said:\n<q>If people come here from Great Britain, jobs for them must come with them.<\/q>\nThat is the attitude of all the Dominions. I wish conditions were better than they are and I wish there were the opportunities. I have always been satisfied, since I took up this question, that there are many people who, if there were an opportunity of a livelihood and decent conditions, would be willing to go overseas, but I know that conditions are such that there is no possibility of anyone going and finding the prospects as bright\n\nas they are at home. We must be careful not to let it be understood that we desire to shovel our people overseas, and I think there must be a real guarantee of a proper livelihood for those who go. Then I have no objection, if there is full and complete publicity as to conditions overseas, to people, who desire to go on their own, taking the step. We have not had much information from the right hon. Gentleman. The White Paper is very vague indeed upon these proposals. I know that the Overseas Settlement Board has a difficult job with economic conditions as they are here and overseas, but they say in their interim report that the United Kingdom Government should not in any circumstances contribute more than an equitable share. Why do they recommend that we should spend 75 per cent. and ask only 25 per cent., I take it, from voluntary organisations or private companies in the Dominions? I cannot understand why they should make this recommendation, which is accepted by the Secretary of State. I may be wrong but the purpose of this increase as I see it is very objectionable. With Government co-operation it is to be only fifty-fifty, but with voluntary organisation, I suppose that it is to be up to 75 per cent.<br\/>\nMigration, in my view, can be successful only if it is subject to arrangement between the Government of our own country and Governments overseas. We are dealing with human beings and with human feelings in this question of migration, and we should take every factor into consideration when dealing with migrants, and not simply be concerned with getting them out of this country. There should be publicity given to the conditions so that we may know where we are sending our people and the conditions under which they are to live. We are not living in pre-War days, and cannot take the steps that were taken in those days. We all know the hardships and suffering that many migrants underwent in those days, and I hope that such conditions will never be repeated.<br\/>\nI hope that when we get the Bill, which the right hon. Gentleman will have to introduce if this Resolution is passed, he will tell us more of the intentions of the Government with regard to migration. I have no desire on this occasion to go into the report of the Inter-Departmental Committee which sat two years ago, except to say that I want the doubts as\n\n\nto the intention of the right hon. Gentleman with regard to the 75 per cent. cleared up. That Inter-Departmental Committee, which was presided over by the right hon. Gentleman, recommended the restarting of child migration to Canada. I hope that it may never be restarted. We had child migration to Canada for many years up to 1924, when a delegation went out to Canada, and, as a result of their report, the migration of children under school-leaving age was closed entirely, both the Government of the United Kingdom and the Canadian Government agreeing that it should cease. I do not say that every child that went to Canada was made the subject of cheap labour, but there was a good number of cases personally investigated by the delegation, cases in which the children were found to be little drudges. I have spent a good many years in fighting mui-tsai in Hong Kong, and I do not want to see anything resembling it established in any British Dominion.<br\/>\nI hope that we shall be told very plainly by the right hon. Gentleman whether or not it is intended to restart child migration to Canada, or to seek from the Canadian Government their approval for the restarting of the system. I hope that our Government will never approve of it, and that the Canadian Government will not take steps with the object of restarting it. I can tell the right hon. Gentleman that he will meet with the bitterest opposition if that is to be one of the things recommended. I would prefer that our people should be settled at home, but if they wish to go to the Dominions, it must be with the co-operation of the Governments overseas. People should not be left in the hands of voluntary societies, however estimable they may be. We must have regard to the fate of these people when they go overseas. If we allow this Resolution to go through, we do not promise that the Bill will be allowed to do so without opposition, unless we have a very clear statement from the right hon. Gentleman upon the main points which I have mentioned. When he introduces his Bill, he must tell us the Government's policy on migration. It is not for the Board to tell us what the Government's policy shall be, but for the Government themselves and the Minister. If the Minister does not do so clearly and distinctly, I promise him that he will have\n\nopposition to the Bill when he brings it forward for a Second Reading.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I hope the right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme\n\n(Colonel Wedgwood) will forgive me if I do not follow him in the points raised in the interesting speech which he has just delivered. I think that no one in the House&#8212;if I may say so&#8212;can give a happier or more eloquent definition of the abstract principles of Peace and Justice. I think the House is indebted to the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Morgan Jones) for baying prefaced his remarks by a reference to the Far East. We sometimes seem to think so much of events in Spain or Germany that we fail to take note of the vast opposing forces now taking shape in the Far East. Speaking at a dinner in London last year on Far Eastern problems, General Smuts uttered these significant words:\n<q>Even measured by the gigantic scale of events to which we have become accustomed since the Great War we are face to face with one of the major conflicts of history. By the side of this fateful situation the troubles of Europe, which now loom so large to us are intrinsically more like petty family squabbles, in comparison.<\/q>\nWe all of us know the cause of tension in the Far East. The cause is the rapid expansion in Japan's population, a population expanding at the alarming rate of something like 900,000 a year, and which will not be stabilised until the year 1970. As someone has said, Japan is like a steam boiler within which the pressure is rising every minute. How can the Japanese Government solve this great problem? It can find only two possible means of solution. Japan can send her subjects in vast numbers overseas, or alternatively she can try to industrialise the country and find food for an ever-increasing number of people by increasing exports overseas. In China, Japan has close to hand sources of raw material. In the soya bean crop of Manchukuo, and the potential cotton crops of the Northern Provinces of China, she hopes to find valuable raw materials. She hopes to find also, among the teeming millions of China, a ready market for manufactured goods. But pressure in one direction inevitably creates counter pressure in another direction. The result is that at the present moment, vast forces, both political and economic, are aligning themselves to resist this pressure from Japan.<br\/>\nThe first and most obvious example of this is in China, where all parties, whether they own allegiance to the Nanking Government or to local Communist governments, are more and more\n\n\nagreeing that they should ally themselves in one common front against Japan. The second obvious instance exists in Soviet Russia. Soviet Russia looks with distrust across her Siberian frontier at Japan's increasing power in Manchukuo. Soviet Russia has turned Vladivostok and the maritime provinces into a, veritable fortress along the whole frontier, from Lake Baikal to the sea, enormous armies are massed. In fact, the whole of Western Siberia from the defence point of view, is a huge self-contained, self-supporting economic unit. Aeroplane factories, mines, textile factories, and there is a large population settled on the land which can all be called upon in case of emergency for army reserves.<br\/>\nThese vast political alignments are not the only ones. During recent years many countries have tried to defend themselves economically against Japanese penetration of their markets. No fewer than 40 countries have taken defensive fiscal measures against Japan, among them, in particular, this country. After the failure of negotiations some little time ago we were compelled to place quotas on Japanese goods entering our Colonial market, but if we examine the actual figures of those quotas we realise that the damage to Japanese trade was relatively small. Japan lost only 80,000,000 square yards or &#163;1,000,000 worth of goods by the quotas, but the friction caused was considerable. We ought to make one point very plain, that neither this country, nor anyone in the country, denies to Japan the right to live. I have the honour to represent a great constituency in Lancashire which, perhaps more than any other, has suffered from the effects of Japanese competition, but I do not hesitate to say that not one of my constituents would deny to his Japanese competitor the essential right to live.<br\/>\nWhat they have objected to in the past has been the suddenness and the violence of Japan's attack upon world markets. Signs are, however, becoming evident that informed and moderate Japanese opinion is beginning to realise the somewhat unfavourable effect of this sudden attack on world markets. Speaking at the Pacific Conference last year Mr. Yoshi Zawa, the Foreign Minister of\n\nJapan in 1932, used the following important words. I am sure that he will not mind my quoting him, seeing that he has given permission to another colleague to quote these words in an article in the \"Manchester Guardian\":\n<q>Japan has no intention or ambition to monopolise world trade or to divide the world's markets with this or that Power. Japan's desire is to promote her trade interests in a peaceful way, and Japan is free to conclude trade agreements on the basis of reciprocity and fair play.<\/q>\nPart of the trouble caused in the past by this too rapid attack on world markets has been due, in some respects, to the peculiar organisation of Japanese industry, over which the Japanese Government has had no control. I believe I am right in saying that no less than 52 per cent. of the commercial undertakings in Japan comprise small industries employing not more than five people. Those industries are probably family concerns comprising father and son. They enjoy relatively low production costs and no overhead charges. The Central Japanese Organisation have made considerable efforts to organise this type of competition, and in the last few years 600 trading associations have been formed.<br\/>\nA most useful principle has been embarked upon, and one, which I hope, will receive some measure of recognition from the British Government. On several important occasions Japanese interests have voluntarily restricted their exports. In 1933 Sir Horace Wilson, then at the Board of Trade, informed the Japanese Commercial Attach&#233; that producers in this country were anxious to have the tariff increased against Japanese electric lamps, and be asked him whether the Japanese exporters would be willing voluntarily to limit the volume of their exports to this country. The result was that a federation of electric lamp producers was organised in Japan, and the arrangement was entirely satisfactory. Consequently the volume of exports was controlled from the source. A similar agreement has been negotiated with the United States with equal success&#8212;an agreement controlling the export of pencils, cotton rugs, and knitted woollen goods. Japan has similarly made an arrangement with the United States and the Philippines with regard to cotton textiles. In the last few weeks, also, a general voluntary agreement covering\n\n\nhosiery goods entering this country has been entered into by Japan. These agreements have two very solid advantages. First, they promote a certain amount of good-will and confidence, and, secondly, and more important, they prevent the continual raising of tariffs against Japanese goods, which is bound to lead to friction. An appreciation and encouragement by the British Government of these efforts on the part of Japanese exporters would be of considerable influence in removing much of the ill-feeling which at present exists between the two nations.<br\/>\nI should like to say a few words upon <i>the status quo<\/i> Clause of the Five-Power Treaty. Under that Clause the respective signatories undertook not to fortify any further their bases and possessions within a certain specified area in the Pacific. The signatories further undertook not to provide increased naval facilities in any of those territories. The provisions of the Treaty lapse on the 31st December, 1936, and I understand that His Majesty's Government has been making inquiries to see whether this particular Clause of the Five-Power Treaty cannot remain in existence. From our point of view, it is an extremely important Clause, as likewise it is from the American point of view. From our point of view it covers the Island of Hong Kong, the oil territory of Sarawak and the coal port of Labuan. From the American point of view it covers Juam, the Alentian Islands, but exempts Pearl Harbour. From the Japanese point of view it covers Formosa, the Caroline Islands and the Marshall Islands. If this area can be preserved permanently free from naval bases or air bases it will be a great help towards peace in the far Pacific. The distance to be traversed by rival fleets and transports will be so great as to add relative protection to the various countries.<br\/>\nThis question of the <i>status quo<\/i> Clause brings me to the subject of the Philippine Islands. The United States has entered into a recent treaty with the Philippine people in which she has undertaken to evacuate the Philippine Islands within the space of 10 years after the signing of the Treaty. The only right which the United States maintain for themselves is the right to maintain naval bases. What actually does that mean? If the\n\nUnited States maintains naval bases in the Philippines is she still willing to undertake the defence of the Philippine Islands. On the other hand, if she is going to liquidate all her interests in the Pacific, is it not a temptation to any great Power to step in and occupy those rich islands? The attitude of the United States on this issue is extremely important. If she is willing to maintain her interests and obligations in the Pacific it may be possible to obtain agreement between Great Britain, Japan and the United States to guarantee the neutrality of the Philippine Islands. This would tend to give a feeling of confidence and to advance the cause of peace, for any occupation of the Philippine Islands by a great foreign Power would naturally alarm this country. For the Islands are half way to Australia, and such an occupation might be the cause of another terrible explosion.<br\/>\nI should like to say a few words about Anglo-Japanese co-operation. It will be remembered that a year ago Sir Frederick Leith Ross went on a financial mission to China. Nanking welcomed him, but Tokyo, apparently, viewed his arrival with suspicion. We may ask ourselves why that was so. At the present time China needs nothing so much as capital and capital goods. She wants capital with which to build railways and roads and telegraph systems. She needs capital goods such as trucks and steel rails for her railways, and agricultural implements with which to develop her agriculture. Japan does not possess the financial resources to carry out the development of China by herself. She must therefore face the questions whether she wishes to have China as her neighbour impoverished and unwilling to purchase her goods, a China which she claims is within her sole sphere of influence, or whether she will co-operate with other nations in the development of that great country. Is she willing to co-operate in China? If she were willing to try to regulate her entry into world markets by agreements, Japan would be showing signs of very great good will indeed.<br\/>\nWe have to ask ourselves what return we should have to give for that good will. I am going to make what I know will be a very unpopular suggestion in many quarters of the House. I suggest that Japan might demand the recognition of\n\n\nManchukuo. Whilst no one is more eager to support an effective peace system than myself, we must ask ourselves whether our present attitude really leads to peace. Is our present policy able to affect, by one jot, the fact that Japan's population is rising at the rate of 900,000 per year and that sooner or later it must find an outlet, perhaps by violent means. Do we take into account that Japan's isolated position is driving her more and more into the arms of Germany? We must really take these factors into consideration. And, for my part, if we could obtain Japanese cooperation in the Far East, and thereby ensure peace; and, better still, if we could feel certain that the Oldham spinner could return home more confident that his job will give him greater security for the future than has been the case for the last 10 years, I say that recognition of Manchukuo would not be too great a price.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>The speech of the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Chippenham (Captain Cazalet) reminds me of the hymn which speaks of\n<q>The roseate hues of early dawn,\nThe brightness of the day,<\/q>\nand later of\n<q>How fast they fade away.<\/q>\nWe have heard much the same hopes uttered about the Treaty with Iraq and the abolition of the Capitulations in Persia. We have heard it about our arrangements in Ireland, but the actual effects have not been so rosy. While I believe that this Treaty is a logical and necessary step in the development of our foreign relations, I do not believe that it will have any serious effect in the long run upon improving the relations between Egypt and the rest of the world. It would be much too much to hope for having regard to what we have seen in Iraq and in other countries in the last few years.<br\/>\nBut I will take up the thread of the Debate where it was dropped by the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Hopkin). He inquired whether the British troops could in an emergency be used in Egypt. From a perusal of the Treaty, I take the answer to be that there is nothing whatever to stop it, and that as allies we can be called upon to use our forces in support of our mutual interests, without au let or hindrance from the text of the Treaty. On the other hand, the Foreign Secretary, in delivering his address, was quite specific in saying that the roads were to be used and the troops were there for the protection of Egypt from foreign aggression, but that does not exclude them from being used at any time for the protection of major Egyptian interests at the invitation of the Egyptian Government. Who can doubt\n\namong such interests might be to give assistance to the civil or militray power in Egypt in protecting the lives of those who are living under the protection of the Government, which would include foreigners?<br\/>\nSecondly, he suggested that there was no reason whatever to think that Italy and Greece would agree to modifying the Capitulations in any circumstances. I do not think he had good grounds for that belief. I feel confident that the Italian and the Greek Governments will, in duty bound, take steps to ensure that, when the Capitulations are modified or abolished, they will be modified or abolished in circumstances and under conditions which will give legitimate protection to their nationals. The hon. Member for East Wolverhampton (Mr. Mander), in a fit of morbid self-flagellation, was ascribing to the rich merchants of Alexandria and Cairo the whole responsibility for raising objections to the abolition of Capitulations. It ill befits a prosperous merchant of Wolverhampton to make these accusations against the decent merchants of Cairo and Alexandria. The fact is that those who object to Capitulations are not the rich, who can very well pay the taxation, or the well-to-do, who have always managed in Egypt to do themselves fairly well, but the poorest and the humblest folks, the men on a weekly wage, married men, very often living a hard struggle in Cairo or Alexandria, who have no friends and no influential supporters, and who may have to suffer great indignities and injustices unless reasonable protection is given to them. That has always been recognised as being the main difficulty of abolishing Capitulations, and I strongly resent these remarks coming from what was once the great Liberal party ascribing to one of the most liberal of institutions, namely, the Capitulations, a purely selfish origin.<br\/>\nOn the Treaty itself there is only one Clause on which I venture to offer a word of criticism, namely, Article 14, which provides that any treaties or agreements inconsistent with the Treaty shall be regarded as abrogated. It adds:\n<q>Should either High Contracting Party so request, a list of the agreements and instruments thus abrogated shall be drawn up in agreement between them within six months of the coming into tome of the present Treaty.<\/q>\n\n\nWith all respect, I submit that it is unduly vague to abrogate a miscellaneous body of documents without putting them into an annexe. It is difficult enough in any circumstances to know whether any particular commercial or diplomatic instrument is involved, but when there is no list and no statement it may very well be a matter of great difficulty in the Egyptian courts in future, and even at the Permanent Court of International Justice, if we do not take steps to draw up such a list and make it absolutely specific, so that we may know where we stand. It is very necessary now that we at least should request the Egyptian Government to draw up such a list in agreement with ourselves, and that that document should be published and laid before Parliament. It is really a very dangerous precedent, and my brief studies in the Library have not brought to light any similar clause in any Treaty.<br\/>\nI congratulate the Foreign Secretary upon having secured the removal of the troops to Cairo into barracks which are to be built, as to four-fifths, at the expense of the Egyptian Government. That is a much better and more just arrangement than that which we made in Mesopotamia, where we are paying anything up to &#163;4,000,000 for barracks, no part of which is being refunded by the Government of Iraq, in a country in which we ourselves have to pay &#163;100,000 for guards to protect our own countrymen against the inhabitants of the country we are protecting.<br\/>\nWhile I realise the strategical importance to Egypt of the Suez Canal, I hope that in years to come it will not be unduly stressed. Lord Salisbury used to say that there were some people who if they possessed the whole world would require the moon as a strategical outpost. We managed to conquer and keep India right through the Mutiny without any assistance from the Suez Canal. We took and kept Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand long before the Suez Canal was invented or thought of. The Canal has a certain importance to us but far less than is generally realised. It is quicker to go to New Zealand via the Panama Canal or via South Africa than through the Suez Canal. It is often cheaper for freight to come from Mombassa via the Cape to\n\nthis country than by the Suez Canal. I do not question the value of the Canal as one of the links in our communications, but we have a better line of communication via the Cape than we shall ever have through the narrow waters of the Mediterranean. I feel that by the time we have spent &#163;3,000,000 to &#163;4,000,000 in Mesopotamia in guarding our air communications to India, and &#163;3,000,000 or &#163;4,000,000 on the Suez Canal in guarding our sea route to India, and by the time we have added our expenses in Cyprus, Palestine, Gibraltar and Malta, we shall possibly have put more money into that particular line of communication than it deserves. We ought to think more of the open sea route, remembering that even now, thanks to the high costs of Suez Canal dues, a great deal of shipping goes via the Cape and finds it cheaper to do so than through the Canal.<br\/>\nI welcome the expressions of good will towards Egypt which have fallen from the lips of many hon. Members. I welcome the atmosphere of friendliness in which the Treaty has been concluded, but statesmen come and statesmen go, and all that remains in 10 or 20 years' time is the written word, the document now before us. In 10 or 20 years' time much may depend on how this document is to be construed. I should like to put one question. The Canal is free to the shipping of all nations in peace and in war, by virtue of the Treaty which was signed on the 29th October, 1888. That Treaty was signed by Great Britain and the great Powers of Europe, and also by Turkey on behalf of Egypt. Turkey's signature still binds Turkey. Are we quite sure that Turkey's signature on the 29th October, 1888, is still considered by the Egyptian now to bind Egypt? If not, I suggest that she should be invited formally to adhere to that Treaty, in order that there may be no possible doubt in the minds of any foreign Powers that, when Egypt has entered the League of Nations, and is therefore bound by the Covenant of the League, she will still regard her obligation to maintain the Canal open in peace or in war as not less binding than before.<br\/>\nWe might have, for example, a war between Japan and Russia, in which either Power or both Powers would seek to use the Canal for the passage of their fleets. One of them may have been\n\n\nregarded as the aggressor by the League of Nations and have been so declared. In that case Egypt, unless she feels bound by the Treaty of 29th October, 1883, might well reply: \"We are bound under Article 16 to close our territory&#8212;and the Canal is our territory&#8212;against the movements of any foreign ships of war.\" I hope there is no dubiety and that the Egyptian Government do regard themselves as bound by that Treaty, but I cannot find that they have ever said so. There is nothing to that effect in this Treaty nor in any correspondence which has been exchanged, nor, as far as I know, in any public utterances of the Egyptian Government.<br\/>\nFinally, I wish to add my own humble voice in tribute to the work that has been done in bringing this Treaty to a successful conclusion. I remember some of the difficulties surrounding negotiations in regard to Egypt at Versailles in 1919 and again in 1921&#8211;22. A great deal of flood water has flowed under the bridges of the Nile since then. It is a great achievement on the part of the Foreign Secretary to have reached a definite agreement, and I feel sure that he will find that it will make progress in other directions easier. As I listened to his concluding words I was reminded of a speech of Disraeli in this House in February, 1876, on this same topic of Egypt, in which he said\n<q>The Government of the world is not a mere alteration between abstract right and overwhelming force. The world is governed by conciliation, compromise, influence, varied interests, the recognition of the rights of others, coupled with the assertion of one's own; and, in addition, a general conviction, resulting from explanation and good understanding, that it is for the interest of all parties that matters should be conducted in a satisfactory and peaceful manner.<\/q>\nIn the conduct of these negotiations and in his speech to-day the Foreign Secretary has shown himself to be a worthy follower of these maxims.<\/p>",

On 7th October three naval ratings belonging to a British flotilla visiting Keelung in Formosa were arrested by the Japanese police charged with the non-payment of a taxi-cab fare. There was, however, good evidence to show that the taxi-driver had been paid. During their examination at the police station the three ratings were called liars and repeatedly struck in the face by the examining officer. It was subsequently found that one of the ratings had had his jaw fractured by a blow dealt him by this official. A British naval officer, who intervened to try to secure the men's release, although he was in uniform and his status therefore unmistakable, was insulted by the same police official. Ultimately the British officer advised the men to say that they had not paid as the only means of getting away.<br\/>\nThe incident was of such a nature and the evidence so clear that His Majesty's Government instructed His Majesty's Ambassador at Tokyo to inform the Japanese Government that the visit of courtesy due to be paid by the Commander-in-Chief, China station, to Yokohama on 30th October could not take place unless due apology were made, instructions issued for the punishment of the police officers responsible, compensation given to the injured man and steps taken to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. The Japanese Government did not feel able to give this measure of satisfaction at once, feeling that they must investigate the charges for themselves. The Ambassador accordingly informed them that the Commander-in-Chief's visit was postponed in order to give them time to satisfy themselves of the truth of the charges against the Formosa police.<br\/>\nOn 10th November His Majesty's Ambassador communicated to the Japanese Government a copy of the report of the Court of Inquiry set up at Hong Kong by the British naval authorities with the suggestion that the facts disclosed therein should be compared with the report of the Procurator in Formosa before the Japanese Government furnished their final reply. The Japanese Government have now sent an interim reply expressing regret that such an unpleasant incident should have occurred and stating that further inquiries are being made in the light of the Hong\n\nKong Court of Inquiry's report, a copy of which has been sent to the officials conducting the inquiry. Pending the receipt of a satisfactory final reply from the Japanese Government, I am unable to regard the incident as closed.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I desire for a few minutes to raise a question which concerns the Secretary of State for the Dominions and which was raised in this House about a fortnight ago. I refer to the right hon. Gentleman's assent to, and the endorsement which he gave to the Natives Registration Bill sent to him by the Government of Southern Rhodesia. This Measure to which the right hon. Gentleman has assented provides for the licensing of native women in the compounds and locations in Southern Rhodesia. There is now only one part of the British Empire where anything in the nature of sex regulation or Contagious Diseases Act business operates and that I am sorry to say is in the State of Queensland. In recent years elsewhere those infamous Acts have been abandoned. They were abolished in Hong\n\n\nKong and the Straits Settlements between 1930 and 1933 but now, after all these years and the agitation raised by the late Josephine Butler we have the same infamous system being introduced in a British Dominion and assented to by the Secretary of State for the Dominions. In 1923 when Southern Rhodesia got its Constitution, it was provided that any legislation discriminating between the European and African population must be submitted for approval to the Secretary of State for the Dominions. Under the Native Registration Bill which has recently passed the legislature of Southern Rhodesia and particularly under Clauses 12 and 14, Africans imported for work in the gold mines from Nyasaland and elsewhere, are to be provided with what are called licensed concubines. These Africans are brought many miles from their homes, they are separated from their wives and families and they are employed on contract for periods which may extend to eleven months or may be as short as four months. When this Measure was being passed the Minister for Native Affairs, Dr. Huggins, who is also the Prime Minister, used these words:\n<q>There are a large number of women who have to reside on these locations and who have no business there in a certain sense and they will be, at the discretion of the location superintendent, given these passes. It is still hoped that we may be able to get rid of the majority of the real prostitutes in the locations but it is not proposed that there should be any interference with the concubines. As hon. Members know, the state of affairs in native life produced by white civilisation is really shocking. The bulk of these native boys in the locations are not legitimately married either under their marriage customs or under Christian rites.<\/q>\nListen to this:\n<q>It is quite impossible to keep these natives in the proximity of our towns unless certain facilities are provided.<\/q>\nHere is the Contagious Diseases Act coming in again. There is compulsory medical examination, there is the licence, there is the certificate to natives to be enabled to keep concubines. When a native gets his concubine for four, five, or six months, or whatever his contract may be, and then goes away back to Nyasaland or wherever his home is, his concubine is passed on to some other native in turn, and you have in effect a\n\nsystem growing up, now receiving legislative endorsement, which is a shame and a scandal under the British flag. The late Cecil Rhodes said, and proudly said, that he hoped to see the day when there would be equal rights for all civilised men South of the Zambesi, and here we get the segregation principle again, homes broken up, and the licensing of these women. I regret to say that when this Measure was submitted to the Secretary of State for the Dominions, it received his endorsement. We did not know&#8212;we have no means of knowing&#8212;in time about this kind of legislation. It does not appear in the Library. It is only by accident that we learn of it, and when we learn of it the mischief is done; it is too late.<br\/>\nI think the House is entitled to learn from the Secretary of State for the Dominions what are the reasons why he appended his signature to the Native Registration Act of Southern Rhodesia, and why he committed this House and the honour of this country regarding a system not far removed from licensed prostitution and which indeed opens the door to it. I trust that we have heard the last of this kind of thing and that the right hon. Gentleman may yet see his way to send a message to Southern Rhodesia asking that his signature shall be annulled, as he has power to do within 12 months from the date that he signed this Order, and asking that the Order, being in direct conflict with the ideals of the men and women of this country, shall not be operated. I trust that we shall set out on another road altogether, the road of endeavouring to create native settlements, enabling the 25,000 Nyasaland labourers who are there to take their wives and children with them, to build up a home life. I trust that we shall bring these Africans into a British civilisation, give them place, and pride in our common confederation within the British Empire, and stop this segregation policy. At any rate let us have no more responsibility on the part of a Minister of the Crown in London for concubinage or prostitution.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I have a good deal of sympathy with the hon. Gentleman the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Morgan Jones) who wished that we might sometimes be able to debate not the details of colonial administration, but the general question of what is the ultimate purpose of having a Colonial Empire. I do not think that this is the time to do that at any length, but I wish to discuss a more general branch of the question of Colonial government than has been mentioned at any length to-day so far. I think that anyone who has paid any attention&#8212;and I am bound to confess that my knowledge is entirely indirect and through others&#8212;to Colonial government in the last 20 years, will not doubt that the educational factor is fundamental to the whole thing, and that possibly among the fundamental factors it is the most urgent at the moment, and the one which is most widely common to all the Colonial territories. That consideration would be by itself enough to make us welcome the accession to the headship of the Colonial Office of the right hon. Gentleman who is now Colonial Secretary, for he has shown his interest in these matters before. I believe that the Advisory Committee on Education at the Colonial Office is very largely if not altogether his creation.<br\/>\nThe hon. Member for Caerphilly rather gave the impression that in African education nothing had been done except at Achimota. I am glad that the Minister mentioned Makerere. Other institutions might have been cited <i>e.g.<\/i> at Yaba and Fourah Bay. Outside Africa a good deal\n\nhas been done lately to improve educational administration. In Cyprus a positive and largely successful attempt is being made to free education from the dead hand of the departed Turkish and Greek Governments and to adapt it to modern requirements and local conditions. The Arab schools in Palestine have been very much improved and have been doing remarkable work. The recent memorandum on education in African communities is, I think, having some effect on some of the Governments in Africa. There has been an extremely valuable report on education in Hong Kong, and I hope that it will not be long before we can be assured that that report is having real effect. The same thing may be said about the recent recommendations concerning secondary education in Malaya.<br\/>\nAll these things are very well, and are largely an answer to the criticism that education is being neglected in our Colonial administration. But all these things are piecemeal and are necessarily by way of recommendation rather than of direction. I would ask whether this is not the moment, and the present Secretary of State the man, to try and give us a continuous policy in regard to this matter. In Africa especially I think it may be said that the whole problem is the problem of education and the problem of agriculture, and that these two things cannot be separated. It is very easy to exaggerate the possible pace of advance in Africa and especially is it very easy to be highfalutin about what can be quickly done in the higher ranges of education. That has been very largely done in print but, making all possible allowances for that, it remains true, as was pointed out by the hon. Member for Altrincham (Sir E. Grigg) that there is a demand for education in Africa which the African can think to be comparable with university education. If only on economic grounds it is important that that should be supplied as far as may be inside Africa. Certainly, some advance towards a standard of that sort there must be, and if it is to be done with any effect at all it cannot be done by unco-ordinated administration between six or seven African territories.<br\/>\nThat there cannot be unification is certainly true, partly because of local jealousies and partly because of differences in agricultural practice, which\n\n\nmust be a principal faculty in these colleges for some time to come. For these reasons and others a scheme of unification, having one college dealing with one subject and another dealing with another, that scheme which has been suggested would not be a complete solution, but some sort of co-ordination between territories there must be. Incidentally, if that is true, the first necessity clearly is that it must be known what territories they are which are to be co-ordinated. A planned relation is necessary not only geographically but chronologically, between the periods of office of different Governors. Without criticism of any Governor, it is clear that you may have one Governor who has taken a great interest in education followed by another who takes very little interest in education; or if you do have two Governors running who are interested in education, one may be interested in primary education and the other may be interested in the higher ranges.<br\/>\nTherefore, it is extremely necessary that there should be some sort of coordination over periods of time as well as between the various territories. I do not want to go into this side of the subject at length, but I might point out that so far the Governors who have most effectively and with the most lively minds attacked the problems of education in Africa have been men who were not the products of the conventional English system&#8212;Cromer, Kitchener, Wingate, Cameron. To mention that is perhaps sufficient indication that there ought normally to be some sort of direction to the Governors from home.<br\/>\nWhat sort of policy ought there to be in regard to education? The first requisite is that there should be a designed relation between the process of education and the product of education, so that at any given moment, at whatever level you have got your education up to, there can be some reasonable chance of that level of education being used; <ob\/>o that for going successfully through the best course of education that Africa can provide the natural reward should he responsible and important employment. That seems to me to be the first, and an absolute, necessity. How far you can go on raising that level is a matter which only years can tell, but if we should be foolish to assume lightly that the\n\nraising of the top level can be very rapid and very wide, we should be more profoundly mistaken to doubt that the effort must be constant.<br\/>\nIf there is to be any continual integrated educational policy, it must depend upon the British officers who serve it, upon getting the best men into the educational service and making the best of them when we have got them there. It is important, above all, to look after their status. That is more important than the question of remuneration. They must be treated as being equally valuable with men in the administrative service or the agricultural service or other services. They must have equality of consideration, which has not always been given. They must have equality of opportunity in influencing policy. I do not mean that they must have opportunity to influence policy equally with the administrative officers, who must in the highest ranks be able to influence policy more than others; but they must have some opportunity of influencing big decisions; otherwise the best men will not accept educational employment. Alternatively, although they may start off on the educational side, as soon as they begin to be successful and a little ambitious they will try to get into the general administrative side.<br\/>\nThe question of status is fundamental to the whole business of building up the educational system if we are to have a long-term policy that will do what we want it to do. Questions of remuneration are much less important, but there are one or two things that may be said. People who are in the teaching service may very often begin later than the man who comes into the administrative service and who usually comes in at 22 or so. They may not be wanted to be so long in any one Colony. Therefore, there are all sorts of reasons why, if they are to have effectively the same remuneration as other people, they should sometimes be given artificial seniority at the beginning of their service, or they should have accelerated promotion towards the end of their service; and sometimes they should be seconded for service from one Colony to another, or to England, and back again.<br\/>\nAs far as I have been able to inform myself, technical difficulties of this sort are not sufficiently met, and in so far as\n\n\nthey are met they are met mainly by the dispensatory powers of the Governors; but no man can found a career upon that, because one Governor may use such dispensatory powers freely. If a man comes at 28 into the educational service one Governor may arrange for him to have artificial seniority of four years, but another Governor may not do that. It is important that there should be a continuous policy, but such continuity cannot be assured by anything except the continual attention of the Colonial Office.<br\/>\nIf there ought to be a continuous and comprehensive policy of this sort, and if it must be directed by the Colonial Office and not left entirely or even mainly to local initiative, the Colonial Office ought surely to be controlled in that direction by this House. If we were always to have the present Secretary of State perhaps one might not feel so much anxiety, but in the way of all flesh he must pass and there ought to be a policy which will go on, modifiable and perhaps even reversible, but a policy going on without interruption. I submit that there ought to be periodically a comprehensive survey of what the educational policy has been in the recent past, what the effects are, and what the next line of development is expected to be. I suggest, if it is not impertinent on very imperfect information to make so specific a suggestion, that there might be at regular intervals, at periods of, say, seven years, inspections made by a very small committee, perhaps only two or three people who should fly all round Africa&#8212;a similar suggestion might be made about the West Indies or the Far East&#8212;and inform themselves how the policy had been going on, whether it could be better co-ordinated, whether they considered that the right sort of staff had been got or whether they felt at all doubtful about it, and how the line of development might be quickened or varied.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br\/>\nIn the first place, I do not think that this Bill is sufficiently a Navigation Bill. I agree with my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Wallasey (Lieut.-Colonel Moore-Brabazon) that it is unfortunate that civil aviation has remained under the care of the Air Ministry; I think that it should be under the care of the Board of Trade; but I also think that the day has come when it is essential for the safety of aviation that we should have a national scheme of regulations with regard to our air services&#8212;that there should be a co-ordinated scheme for aerodromes with regard to lighting, radio communication, and so on. I view with distress the powers which it is proposed to grant to local authorities, under Part II of the Bill, to purchase land compulsorily for the laying down of aerodromes. They can, as the House knows, do this outside their ordinary borrowing powers, and those who have studied the Press lately will have noticed that all over the place local authorities are beginning to think it necessary for their prestige to put forward schemes for aerodromes. To-day, the average cost of an aerodrome is in excess of &#163;100,000, and the average annual cost of upkeep is in excess of &#163;5,500. The average income from an aerodrome is in the region of &#163;250. I think, therefore, that there is a very grave danger in allowing local authorities to send forward schemes for the compulsory purchase of land, and I regret that this Bill has been brought before the House before we have had the Report of the Maybury Committee, who might have suggested some scheme whereby there should be a recognition from the central Government of where it was necessary and where it was desirable to have aerodromes.<br\/>\nAlso we ought to make national regulations with regard to safety. I was very much shocked when on 6th February the Under-Secretary told me, with regard to the \"City of Khartoum\" disaster, that the responsibility for an adequate supply\n\nof petrol in machines rested upon the pilot. It is wholly wrong that an employ&#233; of any company should be made responsible for saying when he considers he has or has not an adequate fuel supply. In the United States the \"City of Khartoum\" would have been carrying another 200 gallons by national regulations. It is high time that we had national regulations with regard to the quantity of fuel that should be carried in any machine.<br\/>\nIf we pass this Bill, we of course continue the subsidy to Imperial Airways for another 15 years. I believe there is a strong case for continuing some subsidy to Imperial Airways, and I am not altogether against it, but I should like to know exactly on what grounds these subsidies are given. A good deal has been made lately of the fact that just recently the Government have allowed British Airways to have a small part of the subsidy for their service to Sweden. I should like to know why it was that British Continental Airways, which ran a service before British Airways ever started a service to Sweden, and which is running a daily service to Antwerp, Brussels and Lille, and spends a great amount of money on it, was never allowed to put forward a tender. Why is it that the arrangement with regard to these subsidies is made behind everyone's back, with no reference to any one at all? If you are giving air mail contracts to a shipping company, it is usual to allow tenders to go forward, and it is a curious and unsatisfactory state of affairs that these arrangements should be made without anyone knowing anything about them until they are completed.<br\/>\nIf we are continuing the subsidy to Imperial Airways for 15 years, we ought to be sure that the service that it has given in the past has been in every case wholly satisfactory, because civil aviation is vital not only to the future trade of the country but probably to the future unity of the Empire, and we cannot risk giving it into the hands of any one company for a further 15 years unless when we look at the past we can be wholly satisfied with the service that it has provided. I do not think that we can be absolutely content with the service that Imperial Airways has rendered in the past. To-day great schemes are going forward. There are 29 new seaplanes\n\n\nunder construction and 12 land machines. A few days ago I saw one of those flying boats which is nearing completion. If it is as good as it looks, it is a machine of which we may be pround, but why has it been so long before we have been allowed to have up-to-date machines? Why, if the Air Ministry is doing its work efficiently, and if Imperial Airways has shown that initiative and enterprise which we have a right to demand of the company which has control of something of such vital import to the future of the country as commercial aviation, have we had to bring perpetual pressure to bear? Why is it that the machines run on Imperial Airways routes are obsolete from the point of structure, performance and speed? Why is it that in so many parts of the world we have no service where we ought to have a service?<br\/>\nSouth Africa intends to take over her service from Johannesburg to the Cape. It is very probable that she will later on insist upon taking over the whole of her own internal airlines. It is not a matter for satisfaction that she has bought German machines with which to run those services. It is indelible proof that she has not been satisfied either with the service or with the machines of Imperial Airways in the past. You can come to no other conclusion. Australia intends to take over her service from Singapore to Brisbane and Sydney. She is not going to have flying boats. I do not think there is any question that probably the ideal boat to put on that service would be the new Short machine which is shortly going to be flown. But Australia has not thought so, and the machines that she has bought for that route are American Douglas machines. That again is an indictment of the service that Imperial Airways has given in the past.<br\/>\nIt is a serious and a terrible thing that Australia has thought it necessary to buy American machines and that Africa has thought it necessary to buy German machines. It is lamentable. Pan-American Airways is going to run a service to New Zealand. She has annexed three small British islands in order to do so. I cannot remember all the names of these islands and as usual I have lost my notes. One was called Baker Island. I read of it in the \"Daily Telegraph,\" and\n\nthat is a reliable paper. I should like to know why those islands were annexed. Was it with the consent of the Government and, if so, why was the matter not referred to this House? I believe the service is eventually to be carried on from New Zealand to Australia. Is it not a pity that Imperial Airways is not the service that is connecting Australia and New Zealand? It is a very serious thing. It is imperative for our interests in China and the East that we should run a service from Singapore to Hong Kong and Shanghai. It is Pan-American Airways and Deutsche Luft Hansa who are capturing the trade in China and the East with their air lines. I do not think we can afford, either from the point of view of our trade or of British prestige, to allow this route to be captured entirely by an American service. We should not be asking why that has been allowed to happen if Imperial Airways had given us in the past the service that we have a right to demand and expect.<br\/>\nDeutsche Luft Hansa intend, I believe, to extend their services from China to India and Persia and Greece and on to Europe. Is that a situation that the House is going to view with equanimity? I do not myself regard it with any great degree of equanimity. If we pass this Bill, we shall give Imperial Airways a monopoly on routes on which it is to-day running no service. But look at those routes on which it is now running a service. Look at the route to Singapore. There is a Dutch service that reaches Singapore in three and a-half days less time than Imperial Airways. I think it is true to say that the Dutch service will not carry British mail because they have found their extra speed of such value to their trade. I cannot look upon that as satisfactory, and again I say that, if that is the service which Imperial Airways have given us in the past, we should be hesitant before we give them this tremendous power and monopoly for another 15 years.<br\/>\nFrance, in conjunction with Belgium, runs a line through Marseilles, Oran, and across the Sahara to the French possessions in West Africa in two and a-half days less time to-day than the projected service of Imperial Airways. That again is an unsatisfactory position. We granted a monopoly to Imperial Airways with regard to the North Atlantic route, and I\n\n\nbelieve it is probably true to say that Imperial Airways are further on with their schemes for running the North Atlantic route than any other company which could start to-day. But that is because every other company has been very clearly told that it would have no backing and no support, no subsidy, and would never be given the carriage of His Majesty's mails. I believe that had that not been the case in the past we might have been further on with schemes for the North Atlantic service than we are at present. The situation as we find it now, however, is such that probably Imperial Airways will be able to give us a North Atlantic route sooner than any other company which could start from scratch would be able to do it. But it is just as well to remember that Pan-American Airways have made very good agreements with France, and with Germany, for the running of the North Atlantic route, and it is also certainly true to say that Germany is further on with her experimental flights over the North Atlantic than this country.<br\/>\nWhenever we compare ourselves with America we are told, \"You must not compare yourselves with America. She has these vast spaces and these wonderful opportunities and we cannot compete.\" That may be true, but surely we have a right to say that we can compete with Germany. She has not had that vast wealth; she has not a vast Empire to serve. Should Germany to-day be further on with regard to the North Atlantic service than Great Britain? I do not think so, but there is absolutely no question that she certainly is. Germany flies 30 per cent. more route miles than we do, and in 1934 she had 100 per cent. more flown miles and carried nearly three times the tonnage of mails and two and a-half times the tonnage of goods. Holland gives more than half the service which Imperial Airways gives at less than one-tenth of the cost.<br\/>\nI do not think, when you look at that record, you can feel that you can, with trust and confidence, give to-day a monopoly on these many routes to Imperial Airways without thought. If we give this monopoly it will exist for 15 years. We are told of these great new seaplanes and these wonderful new land-planes which we are building, but I still doubt whether the seaplanes under con-\n\nstruction are as good as the seaplanes already in existence in other parts of the world. I hope that they are, but, even so, we have got them only after intensive pressure from this House. We have heard about them only in the year when it becomes necessary that the subsidy should be carried on for another 15 years. If we give the subsidy for another 15 years without question, what proof have we that Imperial Airways will show that initiative and enterprise in the future which they have failed to show in the past? What power will this House have to bring pressure to bear upon Imperial Airways if they fail? We cannot afford to-day to risk failure, and therefore, I hope that the House will reject this Bill.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I rise to call attention to a matter which concerns the relations of this country with India rather than the relations of this country with Palestine. But before the House turns finally from the subject of Palestine I should like to record my strong agreement with the majority of those who have contributed to the discussion this afternoon, and to express the hope to the right hon. Gentleman&#8212;who I see has just left the House&#8212;that he will find it possible to reconsider the policy, obviously the cause of such great anxiety in all quarters of the House of Commons and the other place.<br\/>\nThe point I wish to raise is the grant-in-aid paid by this country, the sum of &#163;1,500,000 paid by this country in aid of the military expenditure drawn from Indian revenue. This grant-in-aid, as the Estimates explain, is based on the award of a tribunal which reported in 1933, and it is by no means the only addition to our Estimates which has lately also arisen out of that contribution. The Indian contribution to our own Estimates, the contribution to meet the training of officers and men in this country, has been reduced during the period from &#163;1,400,000 to &#163;1,200,000. This country meets the cost of the Indian battalion which is stationed in Hong Kong. That is another &#163;70,000 on our Estimates.<br\/>\nI am very glad to see in these Estimates a grant of &#163;50,000 in relief of the sufferers by the earthquake at Quetta. I mention these things in order to make it clear that this House is not behaving ungenerously towards India at the present time. No one can say that, and if I question the merits of this particular Vote it is certainly not in any niggling spirit so far as India is concerned. What are the reasons given for this grant-in-aid? They are to be found on page 98 of the Civil Estimates. The first of them is\n<q>the availability of the Army in India for use in an emergency in the East.<\/q>\nThat was the statement made by the tribunal which reported in 1933. I am doubtful whether that view could have been well sustained even in 1933, and a great deal has happened in India and in the world since 1933. For one thing, the\n\n\nIndia Act is now on the Statute Book and the whole policy enshrined in that Act is based on our guarantee of law and order for India. I do not think that anybody would question that this placed a greater responsibility upon the British forces in India, and that if it ever became necessary to remove regular troops from India they would have to be replaced by Territorial battalions or some equivalent. I believe that in the War Indian troops were replaced by Territorials, and I very much doubt whether the case can be sustained that British troops kept in India are likely to be available in any other part of the East, let alone any other part of the world.<br\/>\nThe second reason given for this grant-in-aid is even more disappointing. It is \"the value of India as a training ground for British troops.\"<br\/>\nI cannot believe that that argument was ever accepted by the War Office. I should think it must have been repudiated at the outset by the War Office. The needs of internal security in India to which a large proportion of our troops there are applied, prevent adequate training because of the cost. I know of one division the brigades of which are each 600 miles apart, and the divisional training of these troops, including exercises which are valuable from our point of view, are impossible. I do not think that that division has come together at any time during the last few years, and to talk of India as a training ground for troops which are scattered like that in little pockets for the sake of internal security is to put forward a ground of payment by this country to India which is unsubstantiated.<br\/>\nEven if it were true that India is a training ground, the kind of training that troops receive in India is not likely to be of much use for troops which are to be used in European conditions. The conditions are changing so fast. If we are to get an expeditionary force in this country&#8212;and that is to be our contribution to the system of collective security in Europe, the Secretary of State told us&#8212;then we must have specially equipped and trained troops, because that is the kind of preparation which is being made in other countries. The training that such troops receive in India bears little relation to the training they would require if they were to be useful as an\n\nexpeditionary force to be used in Europe. Not only that, but under the award of the tribunal this country pays for all troops in the Reserve. These payments are calculated not only on Colour service but on Reserve service. Therefore, we pay for all these troops on Reserve even if their whole training has been in India. I do not think that anyone can argue that troops whose whole training has been done in India arc of use as Reserves for an expeditionary force to be used in Europe under present conditions.<br\/>\nIf we are to have an expeditionary force in this country for use if necessity arises in Europe, we shall have to recognise that the close interdependence which has been established for 60 years between our Army system in this country and the organisation of the Army in India is no longer workable and will have to be reconsidered. That. must raise the question of Army organisation in India, and it must, I think, persuade the House that it is entitled to some report, some explanation of the way our troops are used in India. It is years since this House has been told anything about Army organisation in India, despite the fact that our manhood goes out there in great numbers every year and spends an important part of its youth there. This House ought to know about the organisation of the Army in India, but I do not believe that it is told anything. If we provide the men, as we do, some account of the way in which they are used seems to be due to us. I trust that some occasion will be found, if possible on the India Office Vote or some similar occasion, when an account can after this long interval be given to the House of the way in which the Army in India is organised for the different purposes for which we maintain it. It is common knowledge now that our troops do not like going to India. The dislike is particularly marked in other ranks, but the service is not pop liar in any part of the British Army. I think that one of the reasons is unquestionably that the accommodation for all ranks in India is so bad.<\/p>",

It will be found on page 203 of the Army Estimates. A sum of &#163;200 has already been spent, presumably on preliminary plans and so on, and during the coming financial year it is anticipated that a further &#163;5,000 will be spent. I do not know what the total value of Hong Kong as a whole is, but I should have thought &#163;1,100,000 would buy up a very considerable part of it at the present time, and one would like to know exactly what it is proposed to erect in exchange for this tremendous sum of money.<br\/>\nI also notice that there are proposals in this Vote for dealing with the accommodation at, Blackdown.

I hope the Army, when they are going on with their building programme, which under these Estimates and under the White Paper will be very extensive, will have some regard to the surroundings of the buildings which they have to erect, and that they will not inflict on the county in which these buildings are to be situated some of the eyesores that at present are to be found.<br\/>\nPart of the difficulty at Blackdown is undoubtedly due to the expansion that took place during the War, when one had to improvise things very quickly, but I do not think that when they were erected anyone imagined that they would last as long as they have lasted. I recall that I took part, in erecting some hutments, and I recollect the language of the troops in regard to the quality of the wood, but I am bound to say that I think they were misinformed, or else the people who have been living in the hutments ever since have been suffering privations which they ought not to have been called upon to undergo. I hope that whoever answers for the War Office will be able to give us an assurance that in their very big building programme the War Office will have some regard, first to the comfort of the troops, and secondly to the amenities of the district into which they bring their buildings.<\/p>",

Member was moving the Second Reading of the original Bill describing the romance and the glory of the sea as it affected people who served in ships, he said that he did not want to become lyrical on the subject. No one could accuse him of trying to be lyrical to-night. He has given us a little homily on how the subsidy is being distributed, but not any reason for it. He has told us that five firms have taken over &#163;50,000 each and certain other firms have had over &#163;30,000 each. He further said that he had heard no argument against the subsidy as such. I hope that to-night I shall be able to adduce one or two arguments which the President of the Board of Trade may take the trouble to answer. One of the first things to which I will call attention is this: I see that the hon. and gallant Member for Barkston Ash (Colonel Ropner) is not in his place to-night. I was going to say that, perhaps, the reason is that with his firm getting a subsidy of &#163;50,000 this year he really did not think he ought to stand forth and declare himself with his hands stuck in the taxpayers' pockets.<br\/>\nThe right hon. Gentleman has been kind to his friends. In the north east trade something like 90 out of 374 shipping companies, 24 per cent. of the total, have received between them &#163;565,000 out of the subsidy of &#163;2,000,000, which is 26 per cent. of the total. I imagine that the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. and gallant Member for Barkston Ash are really saying \"Parliament is a good thing for a distressed area if shipowners have their being in a distressed area.\" If a small man in business fails, does he get a subsidy? If an unemployed worker loses his job, does he get a subsidy? [HON. MEMBERS: \"Yes.\"] I expected someone to say that, but I would remind those hon. Members\n\nthat the gentleman who gets his \"dole,\" as they misdescribe it, in fact finds the whole of the three contributions towards the funds, since without work no profit exists and no taxes can be paid.<br\/>\nThe original Act excluded from subsidy all vessels that were not registered under the British flag. That was in January, 1934. The reason was obvious. A note had gone forward to the shipping industry that a Bill was to be introduced. Friends were in office there were friends at court, and the method adopted was by giving publicity some months before the Shipping Subsidy Bill was put forward in this House. A White Paper was published months before the advent of that Bill to warn the shipowners connected with tramp shipping that there was a possibility for them, in conjunction with many other industries, to get their hands into the taxpayers' pockets. That in itself was an inducement to many shipowners with vessels registered under foreign flags, to register them under British flags in order to come within the terms of the subsidy&#8212;in fact, for foreign shipowners with directors who are known as \"guinea pigs,\" that is, who hold shares to a nominal amount in order to conform to the terms of the Merchant Shipping Act, to bring their ships under the British registry to gain the advantage of this subsidy.<br\/>\nEverybody knew, and certainly the hon. and gallant Member for Barkston Ash knew, that this subsidy was not for a year and that it was going on for another year. The hon. and gallant Member for West Eirkenhead (Colonel Sandeman Allen) postulated the possibility of 10 years for this subsidy. In February, 1935, the hon. and gallant Member for Barkston Ash said:\n<q>I have no hesitation in saying that I believe it will be found at the end of the year, when the subsidy period is up, that a further grant, in respect of next year, will be necessary. I have never disguised that opinion. So long as other nations continue to subsidise, we shall need to do so.\"&#8212;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st February, 1935; col. 712, Vol. 297.]<\/q>\nHe has never disguised his opinion. His opinion has been given to this House on many subjects connected with shipping. The total reward to his company is a sum in excess of &#163;50,000 out of the pocket s of the British taxpayers, in the last year of subsidy. Having staked his claim for a further year and, on behalf of the shipowners,\n\n\nhaving staked their claim&#8212;they have got a Bill here for its Third Reading&#8212;I presume that he is looking forward with an avaricious eye to see whether it is not possible to augment that sum next year. A firm with which the right hon. Gentleman is not unconnected, I refer to the Moor Line, receives &#163;40,000 in subsidy.<br\/>\nI ask the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. and gallant Member for Barkston Ash: Are not they a little ashamed of the fact that they can come here on behalf of their friends in the shipowning industry and take, year after year, millions of money out of the taxpayers' pockets, in respect of and for the profit of shareholders? That was the right hon. Gentleman's term in the Debate on the Committee stage. We have never yet been convinced, neither the right hon. Gentleman nor his hon. Friends have ever convinced this side of the House, of the truth of their statement that other countries are subsidising tramp shipping as such. On no occasion have they given us figures to justify the statement. We know that in the Plate trade the greatest competitors with the British shipowners are the Greeks, and no statement has ever been made that the Greeks are subsidising those ships. Again, under the last Act and under the new, tramp vessels have transferred from foreign flags to British registry. I ask the right hon. Gentleman to tell us how many British companies operating in the eastern Mediterranean, many of which have been the subject of questions in this House, companies which are disreputable, whose ships are disreputable and who have never conformed to the rates applicable by the Maritime Board, will come within the terms of this subsidy? A condition of the subsidy is that Maritime Board conditions shall apply. I want to bring to the attention of the right hon. Gentleman one of several cases in which those conditions are not applied.<br\/>\nI take the case of a firm, Messrs. Everard, Limited, who received the comparatively small sum of &#163;67 16s. I have here the details of an able seaman employed by this firm between August and December, 1935. He worked no less than 277&#189; hours' overtime, and the firm are refusing to pay a single penny of the money due. It is true that that vessel is\n\nemployed mostly in the coasting trade, but they have qualified for a small portion of the subsidy. If none of these voyages come within the subsidy, the position appears to be that shipowners are observing the National Maritime Board's conditions on subsidised voyages and taking it out of the seamen on other trips. This particular man has 27 years' service before the mast. Is the Board of Trade taking any steps to see that on subsidised voyages their regulations are being carried out in their entirety? In this same firm a man employed as a cook and ordinary seaman on the motor vessel \"Saunter\" had to remove his bed to the wheelhouse at night to get rest, because the allotted accommodation was reeking with vermin, and the sanitary authorities at Southampton had to compel the owners to take the necessary action. In another vessel owned by the same firm, the \"Actuality,\" it is alleged that the ship's articles and the Board of Trade Regulations have never been placed in a position where they can be seen by the crew. This same firm sought to deprive this seaman of his unemployment benefit when he finally left their service. They accused him of neglect of duty and insolence, but fortunately his union took the case up, and he was able to get his benefit.<br\/>\nThe firm of William Robertson of Glasgow drew &#163;2,185 in subsidy. They do not observe the National Maritime Board's conditions in any respect. They do not insert clauses in the articles, and they make no payment for overtime. J. S. Monks, Limited, of Liverpool, who drew &#163;1,275 in subsidy, insert no clauses in the articles and do not pay overtime, nor is any time given in lieu thereof. These conditions of the Act are being broken already. The firm of John Kelly do not observe the conditions, either by the insertion of clauses in the articles or by paying overtime or giving time off in lieu; and Sir Samuel Kelly, O.B.E., of Belfast, who drew &#163;1,337 10s. in subsidy, is in a like position. Then there is the Lyle Shipping Company, who drew in subsidy &#163;11,193. The steamship \"Cape Nelson\" recently sailed from Methil with Arabs, while numbers of local unemployed white seamen and firemen were available. The steamship \"Cape Sable,\" a new vessel signing on in Glasgow to-morrow, insisted on Arab\n\n\nfiremen being carried, while in Glasgow there are 500 white firemen on the live register. Incidentally, this firm imported the Arab firemen into Glasgow for the purpose of shipping them on board this ship. I believe it was the hon. and gallant Member for Barkston Ash who said, when challenging my right hon. Friend, that it is well-known that Las-cars and Chinese are not carried on board tramp ships. Here is a case in point, where the ship has actually the crew on board. The firm of Henry M. Thomson, of Edinburgh, who drew &#163;10,954 in subsidy, was referred to in the previous Debate in regard to the employment of Chinese firemen. Of course, it is said that every Chinaman who goes aboard a ship was born in Hong Kong, and every Arab was born in Aden. Everyone knows that, as long as they understand helm orders, that is good enough.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I am not sure but that is a point which will be dealt with later. A scheme of this magnitude entails a great deal of preparatory work. Long negotiations are obviously necessary with the score or more of Governments and administrations concerned. I am glad to say that, as far as the African route is concerned, complete agreement has been reached with the Union of South Africa and, subject to a few points of detail, with the Governments of most of the other African territories concerned. As regards the Eastern route, negotiations are still proceeding with Australia which has experienced certain difficulties about our proposals. Our aim and our wish is to have the full co-operation of that great Dominion. All I can say at the present moment is that we still hope to arrive at a mutually satisfactory basis of agreement. One of the principal objectives of the Empire scheme is to give the public an \"all-up\" mail service, that is to say the carriage of all first-class mail matter by air without surcharge. I feel that in this particular the whole community will endorse that policy.<br\/>\nThe House will wish to have some figures illustrating the progress of British civil aviation generally during the past\n\nyear. I think I can claim that these figures paint a generally satisfactory and encouraging picture. Not that we are, by any means, satisfied. Indeed, we hope in the coming year to move a great deal faster and a great deal further and we are laying our plans accordingly. One of the most far-seeing of our aeronautical prophets was Bishop Wilkins who lived 300 years ago and who was so versatile that he exchanged his episcopal duties for those of the first secretary of the Royal Society. He prophesied that the time would come when gentlemen going on a journey would call for their wings as regularly as they called for their boots. That should be our aim to-day.<br\/>\nLet me first deal with the progress of Imperial Airways, because that must continue to be our main, though not our sole, instrument for the development of British air transport. I suppose it is common ground that the objective of air transport is to convey by air, on the most economic basis possible, the maximum amount of mails, passengers, and freight. If that be so, ton mileage carried in relation to subsidy, must be the soundest criterion of progress. On that basis, the achievement of Imperial Airways is very satisfactory. Their subsidy last year was little more than one-third of that enjoyed by their French, and about two-thirds of that paid to their Italian competitors. I do not mention the comparative figures for the Dutch, because, in addition to their direct subsidy, they pay an indirect postal subsidy. The ton mileage carried by Imperial Airways in the last 12 months for which we have accurate figures was approximately 25 per cent greater than the corresponding French figure, 50 per cent. greater than the Dutch, and more than 150 per cent greater than the Italian.<br\/>\nI think that would have been a satisfactory achievement even if Imperial Airways had been receiving the same subsidy as the National air transport undertakings of France and Italy. But, as they received a far lower subsidy, I think it reflects considerable credit upon the firm's organisation and management. It is not surprising, therefore, that the prestige of Imperial Airways abroad&#8212;and with it the prestige of British air transport&#8212;stands very high, a fact of which I shall give one further example. In 1935, Imperial Airways' share of the cross-channel passenger traffic between\n\n\nCroydon and the Continent was once more substantially greater than that of all foreign companies&#8212;French, Belgian, German, Dutch and Swiss&#8212;combined.<br\/>\nI know that some hon. Members feel some doubt about the wisdom of our so-called \"monopoly\" policy, and if the House will bear with me I should like to make just four propositions in that connection. First, I would remind the House that Imperial Airways was created 12 years ago to salve the wreckage of the four previously existing companies which had been operating in competition. In effect the Government at that time was subsidising competition against itself, and the result was breakdown and bankruptcy all round. Secondly, \"the proof of the pudding is in the eating,\" and we have proof in the comparative figures which I have just quoted. Third, \"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery\" and the great Continental nations have all studied carefully the success of our Imperial air transport organisation. One after another&#8212;Germany, France and Italy, for example&#8212;have merged or are merging previously competitive organisations into strong centralised undertakings. There are now no fewer than 12 Continental countries each with a single national air transport organisation. In the only comparable field of operation, namely external air communications, the United States have directed all their resources to backing one single organisation&#8212;Pan-American Airways and its affiliates.<br\/>\nMy fourth point is one which is hardly open to argument, and that is the undesirability of dissipating public and private money and effort over a number of competing undertakings 'instead of concentrating them to the best advantage. Surely the lessons learned by such painful and costly experience in almost every other field of transport and communications must apply also to the air. But, though we are convinced that our policy is basically sound, we do not want the House to think that we are not fully alive to the dangers of monopoly nor yet that we overlook the possibility that, with units of organisation too great and a sphere of operations too vast, efficiency may begin to suffer. Imperial Airways will remain our instrument for the development of Empire air routes including the North Atlantic. In other spheres, where no wasteful competition\n\nwill ensue, we are prepared, within the limits of our available resources, to assist any other organisations which may seem to us to merit support. It is in accordance with that policy that we have lately entrusted to British Airways, Limited, the operation of Scandinavian services. We may follow the same course elsewhere at a later date.<br\/>\nI do not think it would be right to leave this subject without paying a tribute to the public-spirited action of Sir Eric Geddes and his board who, without any compensation whatever, have waived their contractual rights in respect of Continental services north of the line London to Berlin, and have also undertaken to co-operate fully with any new organisation which the Government may select to operate in this field. We have, for a long time past, been engaged on plans for a Trans-Atlantic service. Certain long range machines are already on order for this purpose, and others are about to be ordered. We aim at making an experimental begin ling this year, if possible, or at any rate early in 1937. There are other new services overseas which have already been, or will shortly be, brought into operation. These are a new link service from the Sudan to West Africa, a similar service between Penang and Hong Kong, both of which are already operating, and a service between Bermuda and New York.<br\/>\nFour years ago the route mileage of our Imperial air lines was 8,320; to-day it is 21,243. When all our projected services are in operation, it will reach a total of 41,405. I may add that those figures exclude throughout the very extensive internal services operated by our great Dominions&#8212;Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa&#8212;and by India.<br\/>\nLet me now pass briefly under review certain other fields of civil air development on which I should have much to say, did time permit. Internal services have continued to make satisfactory progress. There are now 12 companies operating regular services in these islands, with a route-mileage of over 5,000 miles. As compared with two years ago the increase in the number of civil registered aircraft engaged in regular service in this country is no less than 100 per cent. There has also been a satisfactory growth in the volume of flying carried out by private owners and\n\n\nthe light aeroplane clubs. At the end of December last there were 589 privately owned machines on the Register, as compared with 478 twelve months previously&#8212;that is, an increase of over 23 per cent. There were a total of 1,535 civil aircraft registered in this country at the end of 1935, which shows an over-all increase of 30 per cent, above the figure for 1934.<br\/>\nThere are now 41 light aeroplane clubs receiving subsidy. In addition, there are some 26 unsubsidised clubs. At the end of last year the total flying membership of the subsidised clubs alone was 5,968&#8212;a figure from which I think we may derive some satisfaction. Of course, not all these members had taken out their \"A\" licences. The number of such licences current at the end of the year was in fact 3,353. On a basis of comparative populations, there are again this year proportionately more private pilots in this country than the United States of America.<br\/>\nI apologise for this long recital of figures. They paint a more accurate picture of our rapidly growing civil activities than a long dissertation would do. This quick and healthy growth in every aspect of civil flying has brought in its train many novel problems of administration and policy. One result is the Bill now in the hands of hon. Members, of which I need say nothing to-day. I hope at an early date to have an opportunity to explain fully its scope and purpose. We have had to provide, also, more effective machinery for the co-ordination of the various State Departments concerned with civil aviation. After the Air Ministry, the Post Office is most closely concerned with air advancement, and I should here like to acknowledge the invaluable help which my right hon. Friend the Postmaster-General and his advisers have given, and are continuing to give us.<br\/>\nBut other Departments too are frequently affected, and accordingly two important Committees have been set up in the course of the year to ensure more effective co-ordination. The first of these is a Standing Committee under the presidency of the Permanent Secretary of the Treasury. Its primary function is to deal with questions of international air communications. The second is an <i>ad hoc<\/i> committee, of which Sir Henry Maybury is Chairman. This has been\n\nset up to consider and report upon measures for the development of civil aviation in the United Kingdom. I hope that this latter Committee will be in a position to submit a report at an early date.<br\/>\nCivil aviation is a subject of such outstanding importance and absorbing interest that I should like to give it a speech to itself. All that I have been able to do in the time at my disposal is to select a few of the more salient developments of the year. I have been able to give but very little time to them, and of the results of our stewardship during the past 12 months. Indeed, I fear that I have already taken up too much of the time of the House and must draw to a close. Let me then pass back from the particular to the general, and in a few closing sentences pick up again a thread with which I opened.<br\/>\nHon. Members in all quarters of the House may well ask me, \"Where are we heading?\" \"You have told us,\" they may say, \"the scale and nature of the expansion scheme; you have explained its difficulties and the rapid progress you are making notwithstanding. But what of the future? Is there no alternative to a rapidly accelerating race in air armaments?\" Let me say with all the emphasis at my command that His Majesty's Government have not given up, and have no intention of giving up, hope of securing an Air Pact in Western Europe&#8212;and perhaps in due course a Pact of wider scope. We still hope to see a Convention for the limitation of air armaments at whatever figure other countries may be willing to accept. Whether our hopes will be realised may depend a great deal upon events already exercising the minds of the peoples and statesmen of Europe. We must hope that wise counsels will prevail, but the House may rest assured that the influence of this country will be exerted to the very utmost in the cause of understanding and appeasement. Meantime we cannot remain un-armed in a world that is rapidly arming, above all, in the air.<br\/>\nThere are two all-compelling reasons for the course of expansion upon which we have embarked. In the first place, we must be in a position to make an attack upon these islands too dangerous to contemplate; and, secondly, we must be\n\n\nstrong enough to make an effective contribution to the system of collective security to which we are pledged, and to turn to more temperate views all who may be tempted to set force above conciliation. Those are the reasons and the justifications for the strengthening of our air defences.\n<q>To her hurt the ant got wings,<\/q>\nsays Cervantes. We must see to it that this does not prove true also of mankind. Surely the great gift of flight was meant for something better than death and destruction. That, at any rate, is my personal belief. It is still my hope and my belief that the aeroplane will eventually become the most effective of all instruments for promoting and maintaining the peace of the world.<br\/>\nMeanwhile, the experience of the past few years has proved that unbalanced air armaments are a standing threat. Let us try the other road. Air Forces balanced by international agreement may well constitute themselves the most powerful guardians of law and order. They may approach most nearly to that International Air Police Force which I know some hon. Members would like to see, but which I do not myself believe to be practicable to-day, or for many a long year to come. When I speak of the influence of the aeroplane for peace, I am far from thinking of it as a deterrent only. Of equal, indeed of even greater importance, is its increasing power to break down the barriers of time and space, and to promote a better understanding among the peoples of the world.<br\/>\nPerhaps some hon. Members have seen a very striking film which has recently been shown under the title, \"The Shape of Things to Come.\" Its later scenes depict a new and mechanised world which might not be particularly attractive to all of us. None the less, I think Mr. Wells with his vivid, penetrative insight, has seized on and illustrated two things which I believe to be profoundly true. In the first place, that there is a growing community of spirit among airmen of whatever nationality, which may ultimately exercise a profound influence upon world relations; secondly, that \"Wings over the World,\" in the sense which I indicated a few sentences previously, may one day prove to be the greatest force for peace mankind has yet seen. Let us all hope\n\nthat it may be so. Let us hope, too that it may be achieved without the preliminary horrors and suffering of another great war, which it is the primary purpose of these Estimates to avert.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I will not enter into that discussion to-night for the very obvious reason that it is not a suitable time in which to do it, but, frankly, the Government and many Labour organisations might spend money in that way rather than in many other directions in which it is now expended. If we look abroad, it is obvious that the Government are only doing what they are obliged to do in view of their responsibilities in present circumstances. I had the good fortune to be in Germany a fortnight ago for a few days when the White Paper was published. I had an opportunity of talking to German men of all classes and to hear frankly their reactions. They were universally, as they were voiced to me, reactions of disappointment at the White Paper, and, in. particular, as far as the provision for the Air Force was concerned. Hon Gentlemen immediately will say, \"Of course they were disappointed. We have told you all along that these increased forces were unsettling Europe.\" Quite the contrary was the truth. Their disappointment was that, whereas they expected to find an increase of 2,500 aeroplanes, there was only an increase of 250. The average German knows that if there is one thing that will prevent him from being dragged from his desk and from his home to take part in some foreign adventure it is\n\na strong British Air Force. That is casting no reflection on any ruler in Germany to-day because everybody knows that circumstances are largely uncontrolled; and there is a left wing in the Nazi movement which, even if Herr Hitler's proposals be honest to a degree, may in the end prevent us from reaping the fruition of the peace that he suggests. Therefore, it is an absurdity for anybody on the opposite side of the House, either here or in the country to suggest that the increase in the Air Force, small as it is, is going to cause the slightest flutter in any foreign country. On the contrary. Hitler himself has said that a strong Britain in the air will be a guarantee of peace in Europe. Many hon. Members will share the view that in the present international situation the Government might have gone a lot further in the way of increasing the Air Force. If you are dealing with a nation which places its faith in force it is not a sufficient deterrent to say that if they increase their forces we shall increase ours. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in a speech at Birmingham, said that we have the ability to outstrip all others, and I believe that if the Government had said boldly that we were to have 5,000 more aeroplanes, unless the international situation improved to such an extent that we could reduce that figure. we might have prevented the militarisation of the Rhineland. It is because we were not prepared to say boldly that we intended to have certain armed forces, which Germany in her present Economic situation could not hope to reach, that we are having difficulties on the Continent.<br\/>\nAs the Government have not been bold in the matter of the home defence Air Force, so also they have not been bold in the matter of an Imperial Air Force. I asked the Under-secretary the number of first-line aircraft available, excluding the fleet air arm, for the defence of the Empire when the 12 proposed squadrons were added, and the reply was 430. If hon. Members will cast their eyes round the world and think of the responsibilities of that small force, from Hong Kong and Singapore to Aden, Egypt, Cyprus, Malta, Gibraltar and the West Indies, they will agree that 430 aeroplanes are a fantastically small force for such an immense purpose, and we have therefore the fear before us that the\n\n\npolicy of recent months of drawing on the home defence forces to augment our Imperial forces will become a precedent. It is a most dangerous precedent. A force of 1,750 aircraft should be maintained for the defence of this country, and if the Under-Secretary is able to give the Committee any assurance on that point it will be appreciated in many quarters.<br\/>\nIn view of the lateness of the hour, I will keep my remarks exclusively to the Service point of view. There are three or four points which arise in connection with production&#8212;[<i>Interruption<\/i>]&#8212;and they are as important to hon. Members opposite as they are to hon. Members on this side of the Committee. I want to raise two or three points&#8212;and the measure of my remarks will be gauged by the minutes I occupy&#8212;with regard to the production of this vast force which the Air Ministry now has in hand. Production depends on tools, machinery and men. I want to emphasise to the Committee that the production of to-day is being seriously prejudiced because we have not adequate tools and adequate machinery, and we have not the skilled men. Of one of the greatest organisers whom I ever had the pleasure to meet, it was said that he had no limitations, and I believe that what the Air Ministry and what we have to say to all the Departments of the Government is that they must cast aside the normal limitations of their spheres of activity in order to solve this problem.<br\/>\nI instance the case of skilled labour. A little while ago I inquired of the Minister of Labour whether he would facilitate the return to this country of British citizens who went to the United States in better times, are now out of employment and would, I believe, come back here to fill some of these skilled jobs which are at present waiting. His reply was that there was no statutory provision to enable these men to return.<\/p>",

Friend the Member for Epping said were admirably adapted to cover convoys across the sea. He asked the Noble Lady if she wanted to fight Japan. If we did, his Government made it impossible for us to do so by shutting down the base at Singapore. For three years I commanded the Fleet which was destined to go to the East in the event of trouble. The House may take it from me that it is impossible to operate a Fleet East of the Red Sea without a base at Singapore. Most of the money that was spent prior to the shutting down of the Singapore base was provided by New Zealand. Large sums came from Malaya and from Hong Kong&#8212;they realised the great need for that base.<br\/>\nThe Noble Lord covered a great deal of water in presenting these Estimates. I thoroughly agree with the Admiralty view which he expressed so clearly about battleships. I am aware that there are a few sailors, some having the rank of Admiral, who express a contrary view, in the Press as well as in the House. I would recommend hon. Members who are troubled by what they presumably regard as a controversy between experts to examine the credentials of the present Board of Admiralty, who are trusted by the Navy as well as by the Government, and to compare them with the credentials of their critics. There are certain tests which those seeking for guidance should put, such as practical knowledge of weapons, their employment and development, and, above all, the crucial test of responsibility in high command and in high administrative appointments. The present First Sea Lord was selected by Lord Beatty 25 years ago to be his Flag Captain and Chief of Staff. He stood alongside his inspired chief on the bridge of the \"Lion\" in all three major engagements in the North Sea. Apart from the test of ordeal by battle, he was always beside him at the council table,\n\nand when Lord Beatty succeeded to the command of the Grand Fleet he, too, succeeded to a similar post and was present when the Grand Fleet kept the ring while measures were taken by other craft to destroy the unrestricted submarine warfare which was such a menace to this country. The right hon. Member for Carnarvon Boroughs (Mr. Lloyd George) seemed to have forgotten that it was the presence of a fleet of battleships in the North Sea that made it possible to carry on and defeat the submarine menace.<br\/>\nI have heard questions of submarine warfare and the value of submarines discussed very dogmatically by people who have never been in a submarine, or whose connection with submarines is perhaps 25 or 30 years old. There are, however, officers in the Service now occupying high positions who went through real submarine warfare in the North Sea, officers who were subjected to the anti-submarine devices of those days, hideous enough at that time, and who have since undertaken submarine work in the face of the anti-submarine devices to-day, which are far more formidable. They are fully alive to the value of a submarine in expert hands, but are in no doubt as to the limitations of the submarine. Among the submarine officers who, by their technical skill and daring built up that submarine service which had perforce to seek their targets in enemy waters in the Great War, there are several in high positions in the Navy now. There is one outstanding officer, who, incidentally, won the Victoria Cross for conspicuous gallantry in a submarine, in the Marmora, who is now Second Sea Lord. As my Noble Friend reminded the House, the Third Sea Lord commanded the aircraft carrier squadron. He has not only had experience in operating aircraft in sea operations, but also has great experience in practical flying. A Junior Sea Lord has recently commanded an aircraft carrier. I mention all this to call the attention of the House to the varied experience of the present board, and I strongly recommend them to trust these sea officers, highly experienced men who have sailed over and under the sea and have flown in the air above the sea and thoroughly know its ever-changing moods. I suggest that hon. Members ought to turn a blind eye, and a deaf ear, to some\n\n\nof the theoretical experts whose propaganda adds so greatly to the difficulties of those who have to bear the responsibility.<br\/>\nI wish my Noble Friend could have given the House a little more information with regard to the experiments relating to the effect of bombing upon battleships. I realise that the experiments were secret, but I know that they have conclusively proved the fact that modern battleships have less to fear from the heaviest bombs dropped from the air than from the plunging fire of armour-piercing projectiles discharged with immense velocity or large torpedoes which can be fired from submarines and destroyers&#8212;far larger than those which could be dropped from any seaborne aircraft. One thing to be remembered is the fact that the velocity with which a bomb from the air hits a ship is dependent entirely on gravity, whereas the velocity of the shell is immense and there is no comparison between the effects of the two on armour. If we are wrong about this question of battleships, then, I ask, why should Germany and France be building great and powerful capital ships. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Sir A. Sinclair) did not deal with those countries. He merely referred to Japan and America, but I suggest that, whatever is being done at the moment in the matter of battleships by Japan and America, we ought to take account of the fact that battleships and battle cruisers are being built, so to speak, on our thresholds. I am immensely relieved to know that the Admiralty approves of laying down two next year, and my only complaint is that as most of our ships of this class are 22 years old and, as we are only allowed 15, the replacement of two seems a very small contribution. The modern ships which are being built by other nations are bound to be far more efficient and far better able to withstand modern methods of attack than the old renovated ships which we shall have.<br\/>\nA Noble Lord in another place recently expressed a hope that the new coordinating Minister would invite the critics of the Admiralty to come forward and state their case. Incidentally I am sorry that the new Minister is not in his place. I would like to tell him how greatly I admire his courage in under-\n\ntaking this stupendous task which the Prime Minister has confided to him and to express very sincere hopes for his great success in it. But I can well imagine what would have been said by the War Office or the Air Ministry if an admiral had suggested that the critics of those Departments should be invited to come forward and state their case. However, I welcome the suggestion and I believe that the Admiralty welcomes it. I hope that those critics will be invited to justify, if thy can, their views and theories in the presence of the officers of the Admiralty, who, I would repeat, not only have a wealth of practical experience but have an abundance of practical experiments to guide the. I hope that the invitation to which I have referred will include my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Hertford (Sir M. Sueter) and that they will show him, confidentially, all the details of the more recent experiments, so that he will no longer have to depend on the 15-year old American experiments which he has somewhat inaccurately described in this House and in the Press.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>&#8212;gold, diamonds and manganese. As regards Sierra Leone, there again there has been a very considerable improvement&#8212;a very considerable increase in the value of domestic exports, produced once more, not by any improvement in the price of the old staple commodities, but by the development of mining activity. When, in West Africa, you turn to territories which has not got this tremendous support from mining activity, you find that the position has not been so good as it has been in those other cases. Nigeria has slightly improved her position, but not very greatly. In the case of Gambia, the value of exports decreased in 1934 as against 1933.<\/p><p>Let me come to the Eastern Colonies. In Ceylon there has been an enormous increase in the value of exports. That increase is represented by these figures: In 1933 the value of domestic exports was &#163;13,500,000. In 1934 it had risen to over &#163;18,000,000. Of course, a great deal of that improvement is due to the better prices for tea and rubber under the two schemes which regulate production of those articles. When we turn to Malaya, we find a similar result, due to a similar cause, although it is too early yet to separate the domestic exports from the total exports of Malaya. Nevertheless, the position with regard to the total exports is that in 1933 their value was less than &#163;47,000,000, whereas in 1934 it was over &#163;66,000,000. Undoubtedly a great deal of the improvement there has been due to the higher prices for rubber under the rubber regulation scheme. As regards Hong Kong, I am afraid the position there has been slightly worse in the past year than it was during the previous 12 months. Finally, looking to the West Indies, with regard to Jamaica the position in 1934 was somewhat better than it was in 1933, the figures having increased from &#163;2,400,000 to over &#163;3,000,000. But one has to recognise, of course, in that case that it represents very largely a recovery from the bad conditions of 1933, when the island suffered from the effects of a disastrous hurricane. With regard to the other West Indian Colonies, the position is decidedly patchy.<\/p><p>Taking these figures in general&#8212;and I think they are representative of the position of the Colonies as a whole&#8212;it is quite clear that there has been an\nimprovement in the trading position and the trading prospects of the Colonial Empire during 1934 as against 1933. Nevertheless, it is also obvious that the Colonies are by no means out of their convalescent stage. The problem of their economic development has still got to be very closely and very carefully watched. Anything that can be done to make them economically more robust must be done, and during the last two or three years an attack on the enemy Depression in the Colonial Empire has, of course, been developed at various points along a wide front. I should like to recapitulate some of those lines of attack, and I want to say something about the latest effect of the attacks which are being made. In the first place, of course, the Colonies themselves have made a very great effort to deal with this question of falling prices. They have done everything that they could to meet falling prices by reducing their costs.<\/p><p>With regard to that, the work of agricultural research, which has been pursued energetically during these years, has brought very good results, and I do not have to assure the House that during the last 12 months all that great work of agricultural research has been carried on unremittingly, and that research has enabled the losses from pests and diseases to be avoided, and, therefore, costs to be cut down in that direction. In another way producers in the Colonies have been enabled to cut down their costs by reorganising their marketing organisation, and altogether, if one were to study the figures of costs carefully, one would see that since prices began to fall the Colonies have made many successful efforts to meet that position by quite legitimate reductions of costs of production.<\/p><p>Then there has been a second line of attack against the depression overhanging the Colonies. That attack has been delivered by the United Kingdom, and by the Governments of other Empire countries in a very great effort to expand markets for Colonial products in the Empire countries. We have done it in this country by a very wide extension of the system of Imperial preference. After the Ottawa Conference other Empire countries also extended that system, and gave fresh advantages to the Colonial Empire. I would like to give a\nfew figures which suggest the very great success which this policy has met with in increasing purchases of colonial product in this country. I will give the figures with regard to certain commodities which we used to buy in years past, not entirely by any means from the Colonial Empire, but which we used to buy in large quantities from foreign sources. These figures show to what a very large extent purchases from the Colonial Empire have now been substituted for purchases from other overseas countries.<\/p><p>I will give the figures for the first six months of 1935. During these six months 84 per cent. of our banana supplies came from the Colonial Empire, 100 per cent. of palm kernels, 97&#189; per cent. of raw cocoa and 97 per cent. of palm oil. [<i>Interruption.<\/i>] I did not want to overload my speech with figures, and I am afraid I have not got the percentages for previous years written down on this small piece of paper, but I produced these figures after very careful comparison. The percentages a few years ago were very much less, and I thought these figures, because of the close way in which they approximate to 100 per cent., were very valuable indeed on their own. If I may finish the list that I have written down, in the first six months 100 per cent. of our supplies of copra came from the Colonial Empire and Papua; ground nuts, 99 per cent. from our Colonial Empire and India; and goat skins, 90 per cent. from the Colonial Empire and other Empire countries. That, I think, is a suggestion of the way in which, with regard to a great many commodities, we have so arranged our purchases that we get almost the whole of our supply from the Colonial Empire. The steps that we took to give Imperial Preference to Colonial products are very largely responsible for that result.<\/p><p>Then I would mention another line of attack that was developed during the economic depression with which the Colonies were faced. In the case of certain commodities the fall in price was so disastrous that something had to be done in order to restore prices to an economic level, and regulation schemes were instituted. There is a scheme for tin. We have had a rather unfortunate experience of it this week, but one which, I am advised, is purely temporary. [An HON.\nMEMBER: \"Not only this week!\"] I would remind the hon. Member that for a period of a great many months now, because of the operation of this scheme, the violent fluctuations in price which very often took place have been smoothed out and almost wiped out.<\/p><p>Then there are regulation schemes for tea and rubber. To indicate the value of those schemes to our Colonies, I should like to give certain figures with regard to tea and rubber exports from the two Colonies mainly interested, Ceylon and Malaya. Compare the figures for 1933 and 1934. The volume of exports of tea from Ceylon increased in that 12 months by only 1&#189; per cent., but the value increased by something like 20 per cent. It is of the greatest benefit to the producers in Ceylon, who are under the charge of the Colonial Office and whose interests my right hon. Friend was protecting when he took such an active part in establishing these schemes. Let me show the effect of the regulation scheme with regard to rubber. These are the figures of Ceylon. The increase in the weight of rubber exported in 1934 amounted to 20 per cent. The increase in the value of that export was 145 per cent. Take the experience of Malaya in the same product in the same period. The increase in weight of exported rubber was 10 per cent. and the increase in the value received was 100 per cent. That is an indication of the very successful effect in restoring prices to an economic level for the producers.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I beg to move, \"That the Clause be read a Second time.\"<\/p><p>I move the Amendment in the interests of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, whose revenue from this source has fallen year by year. In 1920 he estimated that he would receive about &#163;65,000,000 revenue. The duty was raised to its present high figure of &#163;3 12s. 6d. per gallon and the revenue has decreased from year to year. This year it is estimated that the amount will be under &#163;30,000,000. Formerly the whisky duty paid nearly 20 per cent. of the entire expenses of the country. But the industry has been killed by over taxation and the yield has now sunk to something like 4 per cent. of the country's expenses. That has brought about a very hard state of affairs, especially in the Highlands of Scotland. This is a peculiarly Scottish industry and peculiarly a Highland industry. It was one of the main sources of the prosperity in the Highlands in years gone by. When\nthe right of private distillation existed every little crofter and fisherman had a small still and sold part of his product, with the result that these men were able to remain on the land and were a happy and contented people. After the right of private distillation was taken away in 1825, I think a great hardship was inflicted on them, and also on the barley grower in Scotland. To the Scottish farmer in Aberdeenshire who sells a field of barley the Chancellor of the Exchequer says: \"If that crop of yours is taken and used for the object which nature has intended it to serve, I shall impose upon it a tax of &#163;350 per acre.\" That is monstrous. The result of this taxation has been to create great hardship to the farmers. My people in Argyllshire are suffering from it intensely. We used to have 18 or 20 distilleries going at full blast in Campbelltown. Now there is only one and that is working only half time. There are only about a dozen in the Island of Islay, and several more in other parts. Many of the good fellows who were once employed in this industry have been long unemployed and have had to try and get other occupations on the land or on the sea, and all because the cost of this particular commodity has been raised to an exorbitant height. The high price in this country has caused a\nlike price to be charged in other parts of the Empire. If you go to Shanghai and Hong Kong, you will find that they have raised the tariff on this article because the British are the consumers. This high duty on whisky and spirits is of no use to the Chancellor of the Exchequer from the point of view of revenue or to the advocates of temperance.<\/p><p>It is no use trying to treat this as a temperance question. A high duty does not promote sobriety. Those who over indulged in this article just took to something else. We had a debate in this House some time ago on the increased drinking of methylated spirit, and I notice that in Glasgow they have now adopted a method by which they take a jug of milk and then a gas pipe&#8212;with which so many people have been committing suicide lately&#8212;put the rubber end from the gas pipe into the jug of milk and so get a commodity with which they can receive all the undesirable results of indulging in drinking methylated spirits. It only shows that all these methods have no value whatever in the promotion of temperance. People are temperate now because they have something more to do. The President of the Board of Trade once said that beer has been replaced by petrol. That may be so, although I cannot congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on the change; for the beer drinker to excess may slowly accelerate his own end, whereas the petrol user suddenly puts an end to other people. Nevertheless, it is the fact that the duties on whisky have nothing whatever to do with an increase in the temperate habits of the people. The cause is better education, a larger number of amusements, cinemas, greyhound racing and motors. They have taken people away into more healthy ways of life. The dullness and sadness of their lives have been lifted.<\/p><p>Whisky was invented in the first place as a medicine by the monks in Scotland in the early middle ages. For those who practise total abstinence there is no finer medicine for influenza or colds or rheumatism. Of course, if a man does himself proud and has various drinks per day, then of course he is taking away the virtue of whisky as a medicine. I urge that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be wise to reduce the duty on spirits. What has happened in Canada?\nThe Canadian Chancellor of the Exchequer said as recently as the 22nd March:\n<q>With regard to Excise Duties, we are making an important change in order to protect our revenue. The present levy on spirits, which is seven dollars per gallon, is to be reduced to four dollars.<\/q>\nThat, I believe, is about 36s. per gallon, and it is to be reduced to about &#163;1.\n<q>Our revenues from spirits, including custom and excise duties, have fallen from 41,000,000 dollars in 1930 to 12,250,000 dollars in 1934.<\/q>\nWe have fallen from about &#163;64,000,000 in 1920 to &#163;29,000,000 this year.\n<q>It is apparent from these figures that drastic action is necessary. Not only from our own point of view is this reduction expedient, but many of the provinces also have indicated the extreme difficulty of maintaining revenues which it is claimed are being seriously undermined through the unduly high rates of excise now obtaining and the wide discrepancy which exists between our rates of duty and those which are in effect in the United States. This lowering of the rate will bring our levies on spirits into line with those which prevail south of the border, and should be effective in eliminating illicit sales which would otherwise continue as a constant menace to our revenues. Our object is to secure increased returns by diverting into legal channels purchases which are now made illegally. Our gain will be at the expense of the existing illicit trade.<\/q>\nI do not think that we can say that there is not a large amount of illicit trading going on in this country. I have the greatest possible respect for the law-abiding population of this country, but there comes a point when rebellion becomes almost a virtue, and it would be very sad if we had to wait for the release of Al Capone for help from the other side, where after the repeal of prohibition the illicit trading went down, to enable us to escape from these extravagant duties. I do not think that anything of that sort will be necessary, because I know that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is a reasonable man and looks on this duty as an inheritance he has received from his rasher predecessor; and I am sure that he will at the earliest possible date make some effort to reduce the duties on these articles. I would urge him to take his courage in his hands and do so this year. He may say that he would lose &#163;9,000,000 or &#163;10,000,000. He would lose nothing of the kind. I will guarantee that he would make up the loss in a year or two. The\nnumber of poor people who wish to purchase half a bottle of whisky for medicinal purposes is legion. On one occasion a doctor in the Highlands ordered whisky for an influenza-stricken family and the husband said that it took him two years' rent and more to cure his wife and family. His rent was &#163;2 10s. There are many poor people to-day who have to purchase whisky not for indulging in the drinking of whisky but for purely medicinal purposes, and whisky was invented for this purpose by the Holy Fathers. I ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be courageous. There would be a great psychological effect if people were able to buy two bottles of whiisky for &#163;1, instead of having to break a pound completely in order to buy one bottle. I am sure that the effect would be that if they found they could get two bottles for &#163;1 they would pay the &#163;1. The majority of our people are sober and temperate, and there is no question of this becoming a drink question. I have been for nearly 20 years trying to get some consideration for this problem, and surely at a time when cuts are being restored and all sorts of expenditure being incurred&#8212;&#163;35,000,000 for a very necessary improvement of our transport facilities&#8212;the price of this comfort for our old people should be reduced to a figure which would make it not only the particular commodity and refreshment of the wealthy classes but that those who are comparatively poor and humble will be able to get a little of this comfort which Scotland invented and which has made Scotland known throughout the whole civilized world.<\/p>",

I should be prepared to refer to the other matter, but I have given an undertaking to occupy the minimum of time. I should like to deal with the hon. Member much more exhaustively and much more faithfully, but having given an undertaking I must carry it out. I want to help the tinplate industry. My hon. Friend made the point that 300 men find work in producing 1,500 tons of steel, but it takes four times that number of men to produce 1,500 tons, or, rather 1,200 tons, of tinplates. I am really concerned about the export position, which is serious, and I\nwant to make an appeal for something to be done to help the export side of the industry. I want some answer to the appeal which has been made for a rebate on steel bars imported for use in the manufacture of tinplates which are to be exported. I want a drawback system. My hon. Friend the Member for West Swansea says, \"Ah, you are going to have an international agreement about the export of tinplates.<\/p><p>You are going to zone the world. Germany is to have this, Italy is to have that, and France is to have the other; and so on.\" That is all very well. I know that the tinplate industry in South Wales has been saved largely by increased purchases by Canada, South Africa and New Zealand. The exports to those countries have considerably increased, and if I were to state the figures they would warm the cockles of Lord Beaverbrook's Imperial heart. We have lost the European market, we have lost China, we have lost Japan, we have lost Malay, we have lost Hong Kong&#8212;we have had vast declines there&#8212;but there is no shadow of a doubt that we have improved our position very considerably in Canada, in New Zealand and in South Africa, and I do not want those markets to be lost. It is easy for hon. Members to say \"You are going to have this international agreement. We own Canada. Germany&#8212;hands off Canada!\" But what if Canada says that she is not going to be owned, and what if this international agreement means maintaining minimum prices? After all, the United States are not in the international agreement. At least, I do not think so.<\/p>",

There have been several occasions on which the depreciation of currencies has adversely affected British officers serving in the countries concerned. There is one case which is not a matter of personal recollection with me because it occurred before I was born, when the transfer from sterling to dollars in the Colony of Hong Kong was followed by a very rapid depreciation in the value of the Chinese dollar which had a very serious effect not only on the incomes but on the pensions of serving officers there. There is a more recent case which will be within the memory of the Committee, namely, that of the transfer which took place in East Africa from the rupee to the shilling. In some cases officers derived considerable benefit from the stabilisation of the rupee at 2s., but in other cases they were adversely affected. In this matter we should, if we can do so, protect officers, particularly British officers, from any possible adverse effect of the Federal currency policy.<\/p><p>It is no disgrace to the Federal currency Board or whatever the body may he, to say that it may depreciate the rupee. Whatever may be said by my hon. Friend the Member for East Edinburgh (Mr. D. M. Mason) the depreciation of the pound sterling has in fact been of considerable benefit in this country and it is quite possible that in India it may be found necessary to do the same sort of thing. It is likely that a Government which has been securing a comparatively favourable balance of trade only by a steady export of gold during the last three years, may have to indulge in some form of currency depreciation. I do not think it would be fair to compel India to put its currency permanently on sterling if it does not wish to do so, but I think that officers from this country who, on retirement, will come back to live in this country and who have to keep their families in this country, ought to be protected against any adverse effect arising from Indian currency policy. It is true that if the value of the rupee appreciated, they would derive consider-\nable benefit but in these days it is almost inconceivable to think of any currency gaining in value. There seems to be a race in depreciation and, therefore, I do not think that point arises. I hope my hon. Friend will be able to give some assurance that the Government will do something about this, possibly on the Report stage.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I want to take this opportunity to draw the attention of the House once more to the serious plight of the seamen in our mercantile marine. The position is so serious that there is something like 40,000 men out of work, and I am afraid that far from improving as time goes on the situation is likely to become worse. A few months ago we had a debate on this subject. The matter was seriously discussed, and we had a reply on behalf of the Government. Since then I have been making some inquiries in the port which I represent. I have visited a large number of ships and many local port authorities, and I have been convinced that the two main causes why there are so many of our seamen out of work are, first, the employment of a large number of foreigners, and, secondly, the employment of a large number of lascars and other coloured seamen. With regard to the foreigners, I understand that there is nothing to prevent the owner of a ship, or a company, employing as many foreigners as they like. They are signed on at foreign ports, come with their cargoes to this country, and then return to foreign ports. They are not discharged here, and therefore our seamen have no opportunity of going on board these ships.<\/p><p>These foreigners are employed because they are willing to accept worse conditions than our own men. I do not believe that they get the full salaries which are paid to our seamen. They are willing to work longer hours than our own people, but I do not believe that they work any better than our own seamen. They are\nalso employed because, coming from Asiatic ports, they can be got for longer journeys at much reduced rates of pay. In the port which I represent a census has been kept from 1930 onwards, and during the five years up to 1935 there have been 500 Asiatics coming into the port who have claimed to be of British nationality. On verification only 40 were found to be British subjects, the rest being foreigners. I do not think that any other industry in this country would tolerate the employment of foreigners in this way. I cannot imagine a building society or a large contractor employing a number of Italian workmen or French carpenters, or any other kind of foreigner, for a moment. Why then, in the chief industry of this country of which we have been so proud for centuries, should we tolerate foreigners on ships flying the British flag.<\/p><p>There are many reasons given why lascars should be employed. They are said to be British subjects. That is true. The same is true of a certain number of Arabs and Chinamen. They are also British subjects. It is said, therefore, that they have just as much right to be employed as our own seamen. I would have no objection whatever to their being employed provided they were employed under the same conditions as our own white seamen. In reply to a question which I asked a week or two ago, the President of the Board of Trade told me that the rate of pay of lascars was 27s. a month. We know that the National Maritime Board scale of wages for white seamen is not less than &#163;8 6s. a month. That is to say, the lascar receives only one-sixth of what the white sailor gets. Then I am told, \"But we have to employ many more lascars than white seamen for any given work.\" I am informed on very good authority that the proportion is three to two, that three lascars will do the work of two white seamen.<\/p><p>Taking the question as a whole, the ship manned entirely by lascars would pay one-fourth of the wages that the same ship would pay if manned entirely by white sailors. That is a, situation which should not be tolerated. Then I am told that the lascars are employed because they can do the work better in tropical climates. That is a matter of opinion. Those who have travelled in the Tropics\nhave seen many ships manned entirely by white sailors, and I think that the officers of the Royal Navy who are Members of this House will bear me out when I say that there are ships of the Royal Navy stationed in places like the Red Sea for years on end, and that there are no lascars on board. If the Royal Navy is satisfied that white sailors can do the work there is very little excuse for the merchant service employing coloured seamen.<\/p><p>I would not have any objection, even if the rates of pay were less, provided the lascars were employed only on ships that traded in the Tropics and did not come to European waters. They would not then come into competition with our own people. But when we see ships that are registered in this country, starting from ports in this country and proceeding to India, Hong Kong, Australia, and so on, passing through the Red Sea and Mediterranean, half their voyage being in European waters, I think we have a just cause of complaint that these lascars come here and receive only one-sixth of the pay of our own people. I am convinced that if their pay was similar to that of our own people and was regulated by the National Maritime Board, there would be no question whatever as to the number of white seamen that would be employed in replacement of the lascars. The situation is very serious from the point of view of the unemployed in this country. All of us who came to this House, I am sure, at one time or other gave pledges that we would do all that we could to reduce the number of unemployed in this country. I know that the Government have done their utmost in almost every industry to reduce unemployment, but in this one particular industry instead of unemployment becoming less I am afraid it tends to increase.<\/p><p>I asked the President of the Board of Trade a short time ago whether any steps were being taken to remedy this defect, and he told me that he was making inquiries into the matter. I hope that he will give this very serious question his utmost consideration, and not only that he will conduct inquiries, but that before long he will take urgent measures to reduce this evil. It is a very serious one, and we all as Englishmen feel it very strongly indeed, especi-\nally those of us who represent ports in this country.<\/p>",

Members will realise, when they see me on my feet instead of the First Lord, that it is no discourtesy to the House in general. It has always been the custom for the Works and Buildings Vote of the Admiralty to be the particular care\nand responsibility of the Civil Lord. I need hardly say that we do not in the very least resent the raising of any of these points. We are very glad indeed to give the House all possible information on this Vote. Hon. Members who have been in the House for some years may be aware that it was the old custom to devote one of the 20 Supply days almost entirely to the consideration of Vote 10.<\/p><p>The hon. Gentleman the Member for Aberdare (Mr. G. Hall) has asked a question which, as he said, might be described as a hardy annual. I am very glad he has done so, because it gives me an opportunity of correcting two errors which I inadvertently made in replying to the general Debate on the Navy Estimates last week. I stated then that we had received a contribution from Australia towards the cost of the Singapore base. That is not the case. The contributors are New Zealand, Hong Kong and the Federated Malay States. I also said that the site for the base had been given by the Federated Malay States, when I should have said the Straits Settlements. I hope that the House will forgive me for those mistakes, and will take into account the fact that it was late at night when I made these statements in a rather hurried endeavour not to trespass upon its patience. The Singapore base, we can say quite fairly, is progressing steadily. We are putting down in the Navy Estimates this year a smaller sum than was voted last year, largely because we did not actually spend the whole of the money which was voted last year, as the House will eventually see when they get the complete returns.<\/p><p>As those connected with large contracts for works will understand, it is extremely difficult to forecast a year in advance&#8212;and in many of these cases it has to be done 15 or 16 months in advance&#8212;how the work is going to progress and how much the contractor is likely to earn. I think, however, it is fairly accurate to say that the amount taken up for Singapore next year, the amount which we expect to spend, will closely approximate to the sum which will actually have been spent by 31st March this year. Messrs. Jackson's contract is due to be completed on 28th September, and there is no reason to suppose that they will be behind time. The graving dock should\nbe ready to function in September, 1937, and, as my right hon. Friend has already informed the House, the whole base ought to be ready by 1939 at the present rate of progress.<\/p><p>We have let a number of contracts which will result, directly and indirectly, in very considerable orders for materials in this country. We have placed the contracts for the steel work required for the workshops, storehouses, jetty, railways, fencing material, water tanks, etc., and further contracts still remain to be let from time to time. We have also let the contract for the caisson for the big dock. We are, of course, as Messrs. Jackson's contract comes to an end, substituting more and more departmental work which is being let out to smaller contractors. The sum which is down in the Estimates for 1935 to be paid to Messrs. Jackson includes &#163;90,000 out of the &#163;100,000 which they were obliged, under the terms of the contract, to deposit with us against contingencies. We propose to retain the odd &#163;10,000 until we have settled the hundred and one final details which as my hon. Friend must know enter into a contract of this kind. I will not say more about Singapore. I think I can sum it up in the one sentence, that everything is proceeding according to plan.<\/p><p>I turn now to the other question raised by my hon. Friend, namely, the Milford Haven Mine Depot. Those who study the Estimates with that minute care which the late Civil Lord always displays may have observed that in last year's Estimates the total sum to be spent upon this depot was &#163;246,000, and the total sum appearing in the present Estimates is &#163;376,000. It is only due to the House that I should give a brief explanation of the change. Shortly, the scheme is being revised to meet modern safety requirements. It is only those few words which have been inserted as an explanation in the printed Estimates. Originally, the scheme provided for the storage above ground of bulk explosives and of those mines which were kept ready for issue. We have come to the conclusion that that is not the best way, and the new proposals make adequate provision for the storage, filling, maintenance and handling of the filled mines under safe conditions. The scheme is conceived with particular\nreference to the danger of attack from the air. We shall now have underground storage both for bulk T.N.T. and for those mines which are completed and ready for issue. The modern mine is larger than its predecessor, and it is advisable to store the charges separately from the mine cases themselves.<\/p><p>The revision of the scheme has not unnaturally involved a certain delay in getting drawings ready and preparing contract particulars, but I hope that the first contract which will be for the earthworks and the underground chambers will be let in July. I cannot say that it is going to provide an enormous amount of work or to solve the problem of unemployment in Pembroke. I think this first contract will probably employ about 60 men to start with, rising perhaps to 150 and going on until 1936. The second contract for the repairs to the pier will employ 50 men for a year, and the third contract for buildings, which will start about the end of next year, will employ a number which I do not attempt to forecast. They will be mostly building trade operatives. We have spent to date on this scheme &#163;21,000 in the present year's Estimates mostly on the access road, repairs to swing-bridge and preparatory work generally. We are taking in these Estimates &#163;45,000 which will, of course, mean that more men will be employed in the financial year which is shortly beginning than were employed in that which is just ending. I want also to tell the House that the sum expended last year did not include the price of the land. The land purchase is shown separately under Sub-head G and was paid for in 1933 and 1934. It came to something over &#163;90,000 and it may be satisfactory to everybody to know that it has cost less than at one time I thought probable.<\/p><p>I hope that explanation in regard to the Milford Haven Mine Depot will satisfy the House, and it only remains for me to say a few words on the last subject raised by my hon. Friend, namely, Sub-head O, which deals with the dying annuities of the old Naval Works Loans. We have dropped this year from &#163;468,000 to &#163;248,000; next year we shall drop to &#163;128,000 and the year after that to &#163;78,000. In 1938, there will only be &#163;12,000 and in 1939 the whole of this long commitment will be finally extinguished.\nMy hon. Friend the Member for Aberdare asked me to be careful about committing the Board of Admiralty to a renewal of the policy which was thought right 40 years ago. I am in the fortunate position of being able to tell him that the Board of Admiralty are not contemplating anything of the kind. I do not imagine that it is really our business. Our business is to get the money for essential naval requirements and if there were any questions raised as to works loans, I feel they would have to be addressed to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I am grateful to the House for having let me down so easily on this long and complicated Vote, and since no reduction has been moved, I hope the House will allow us to have it without further discussion.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I beg to move, \"That Mr. Speaker do now leave tie Chair.\"<\/p><p>I have this afternoon to introduce, not only the Air Estimates for 1935, but also a Supplementary Estimate for the current year. This is for the sum of &#163;200,000, and consists almost entirely of the moneys required to get the expansion scheme under way. The largest single item is for the purchase of lands and the commencement of work at certain stations as part of the very extensive but necessary construction programme which will be carried out during the next few years. As a matter of fact, the only sum which we are asking for in this Supplementary Estimate under Vote 4&#8212;Works, Buildings and Lands&#8212;is for &#163;150,000. This is only the first instalment of a commitment which will eventually amount to several millions. I think otherwise the House will find that the Supplementary Estimate is self-explanatory, but, if there are any questions which hon. Members wish to put to me about it, I shall be glad to answer them at a later stage.<\/p><p>With regard to the Air Estimates themselves, these show a gross total of &#163;23,851,100 and a net total of &#163;20,650,000, representing additions to our anticipated air expenditure for the coming year of &#163;3,685,500 and &#163;3,089,000 respectively. For the first time since I have been privileged to introduce the Air Estimates, I am presenting Votes which show a substantial accession to the air strength of the nation. In past years I have regularly found myself in these Debates on the Air Estimates in the unhappy position of a kind of modern St. Sebastian, assailed indeed by arrows from all sides, but lacking the comforting assurance that I should in due course reap the rewards of martrydom. From one side of the House have come the\nclothyard shafts of those hon. Members who considered our provision for the air defence of this country inadequate; from another side the barbed bolts of those who would like to see the immediate abolition of all armed forces.<\/p><p>I do not expect to escape a similar fate to-day, and therefore, in anticipation of the attacks of the second category of my assailants, I would remind them that the small increase which was brought in last year was then plainly indicated to be an earnest of our intention to proceed to more serious measures if there did not shortly follow a general reduction of air armaments. A year has gone by and the reduction for which we have worked so patiently and so sincerely for so many years has not come to pass. The failure to date of the Disarmament Conference to achieve agreement made necessary the statement by my right hon. Friend the Lord President of the Council when he announced last year that the Government had no longer any option but to proceed with our very long-delayed programme. Since then, the questions of air strength and the air defence of these islands, have been the subject of much general discussion and in particular of a weighty Debate in this House.<\/p><p>These facts and events must have been present therefore to the minds of Members in this House, and must have prepared the way for these Estimates. We are not warmongers nor are we influenced by warmongers&#8212;if such anachronisms still exist in this country. We have deliberately allowed ourselves to sink to fifth place among the air forces of the world and postponed for 10 years a programme which in 1923 was declared to be the minimum one for the safety of these islands. We have done these things in the hope that other countries would have followed our example. We have done it in the cause of peace. What has been the result? We have stripped our defences to the bone, and the result has been that our weakness has not only become a danger to ourselves but a danger even to the cause of peace. We therefore are now pursuing peace by a new road without abandoning the old one. Surely, it is not without significance that the most promising step towards the elimination of air warfare in Europe was taken since the policy of expansion was announced. Until such time as we can persuade other nations to disarm, a\nstronger British Air Force will enable us to play our part more effectively in this Air Pact which is even now under discussion by the Western Powers.<\/p><p>Let me now deal with the other group of my critics. Are the arrangements for increasing the Air Force adequate? Again, I would refer to the speech of my right hon. Friend the Lord President of the Council in November last. He then went very fully and frankly into the whole question of comparative air strengths and showed that, so far as could be foreseen, the air strength of this country would be adequate for our needs in the immediate future. He showed that it was not practicable to look farther ahead than that. At this point I should like to digress for a moment and correct a perspective which I think has been rather distorted of late. A great many inaccurate figures have been bandied about and an unduly black picture has been painted of our weakness in the air. We have been told that we are eighth among the world's air Powers, and that our equipment is not nearly so modern as that of other European air forces. I have seen public statements to the effect that our air strength is no more than that of Rumania. As a matter of fact, in terms of first-line aircraft our strength is four times that of Rumania. I only mention that to show the lengths to which exaggeration will go.<\/p><p>Another thing which has caused a good deal of confusion in people's minds is the different methods which various countries adopt to state their aircraft programmes. For instance, when the United States of America announced their programme and said they were going to add several hundred aircraft to their air services, that did not simply mean additions to their first-line strength, but the total number of aircraft to be held, including machines for new formations, as well as those to be purchased to displace existing machines that have become obsolescent and those held in reserve against wastage, training machines, and so forth. The 41&#189; additional squadrons that we propose to add to the Air Force during the next four years have been described as an addition of 500 machines, and have been contrasted with the much greater American figures. As a matter of fact, if we adopt the American method\nof stating their intentions and include all the machines required for expansion, replacement and all other purposes in one comprehensive figure, we shall be ordering over 1,000 machines for the Royal Air Force in 1935 alone.<\/p><p>The fact is that we remain fifth among the world's air Powers in first-line strength, and we have made it clear that that is a position that cannot be allowed to continue. Of the four nations that outnumber us, there are two, the United States and Italy, which outnumber us by relatively small margins. It is only in relation to the air forces of France and Russia that we find ourselves in a position of serious numerical inferiority. France has a first-line strength of 1,650 machines. I do not know definitely what the exact figures are for the Soviet, but from what we can hear the corresponding Russian figure exceeds 2,000.<\/p><p>There is a further point that I should like to emphasise. First-line strengths form the readiest basis for a simple comparison between air forces, but they are far from being the only criterion. In all those other factors that go to make up a powerful and efficient air force our Air Force can still challenge that of any other nation in the world. Behind every one of our first-line aircraft there is a background of organisation of unrivalled thoroughness. We have always up to now built solidly, and we intend to continue to do so. It would be the height of folly to rush up a mere facade of numbers. If I may take a single illustration. I have just mentioned that two countries, the United States and Italy, slightly outnumber us in terms of first-line aircraft, but, as a matter of fact, the Royal Air Force to-day possesses more qualified pilots on the active list than either the American or Italian Air Forces. We have similar reserves of strength in other directions, while, in relation to France and Italy, our machines are of more modern construction and superior performance, although both these great nations have already embarked on very large programmes of modernisation and re-equipment. There has just reached this country a most interesting report by a powerful independent commission which has been investigating the whole field of aviation in the United States. It contains a passage which is so eloquent that I make no apology for reading it:\n<q>The past year has been marked by incessant attack, using every available medium of publicity, upon the quality of American military aircraft. It has been alleged that they are in every essential respect hopelessly inferior to corresponding machines of European origin. It is an interesting commentary on the state of the public mind that these charges seem to be essentially similar to those being made at the same time in the very countries which have been held up to the United States as examples to imitate. The Press of Great Britain has rung with assertions of the remarkable qualities of American aircraft and the inability of the available British military types to keep pace with\" the American commercial machines. In France a section of the Press has debated furiously the rumoured inferiority of French military aircraft to those of most of the rest of the world.<\/q>\nI take some comfort from that fact that our own, stern critics of everything that we do and are, and of everything that we have, have apparently their precise counterparts all the world over. So that, if those critics have their way and we are to be court-martialled because of the alleged deficiencies of the Royal Air Force, we may at least hope to face the firing squad in the excellent company of those who are responsible for the American, French, and other military air services. The House will, I hope, forgive this digression, in which I have endeavoured, in regard to these important matters, to throw a little light into dark places&#8212;or places which have at least been much obscured by ill-informed comment. I have done so in no spirit of complacence. Our numerical weakness is serious and cannot be allowed to continue; and we have much leeway to make up.<\/p><p>We have, further, a very strenuous programme of re-equipment before us; for aviation, both military and civil, is going through a period of rapid development. Aircraft which were quite adequate for the needs of yesterday are not adequate for the needs of to-day, still less for those of to-morrow. We have, therefore, had to take special steps to shorten the time hitherto taken to bring new types into production. That the British industry will rise to the occasion, I am quite confident. What the world thinks of their products may be judged from the fact that no fewer than 29 foreign countries use our aircraft and 33 our engines, and that our export trade in connection with these matters rose in 1934 by 31 per cent.<\/p><p>To return to my previous theme. His Majesty's Government are satisfied that, certainly for the present, there can be no question of any reduction of the minimum scheme decided upon last year. It will still be necessary to continue to scan the situation here and abroad with the same watchfulness at all times and to be ready to alter our programme as circumstances may require. The next obvious and necessary question is, Are we making sufficient headway and progress with the July scheme? The House will realise that it is no use providing personnel and technical equipment until you have the aerodromes and the stations for them. Nor is it policy to acquire aircraft and engines beyond the capacity of the personnel. The several tasks of acquiring aerodromes and stations, training pilots and mechanics and providing engines and aircraft each take different periods of time. It follows that the expansion of a highly technical service like the Royal Air Force requires a very delicate process of synchronisation. It follows, therefore, that a very large part of our attention is concentrated at present on the provision of stations and aerodromes, accompanied by a more modest provision for material and personnel. The proposals with regard to the increase of personnel are included in Vote A, but perhaps I may explain that the increase of 2,000 men there shown from 31,000 in 1934 to 33,000 in 1935, is really an increase of 3,500, because we did not reach our 1934 maximum.<\/p><p>As regards the immediate increase of our air strength, as the House knows, we are to have this year an additional 11 squadrons for home defence, and the equivalent of one and a half squadrons for the Fleet Air Arm. That will mean that the home defence force will consist of 54 squadrons in 1935, 13 of which will be on an auxiliary or cadre basis, and there will be 21 squadrons still to form to complete the present programme of 75 squadrons for home defence. The first line strength of the Royal Air Force to-day is 890 machines in regular squadrons, and 130 machines, approximately, in non-regular squadrons, which makes a total of 1,020 machines. At the end of this year, the figure will come up to 1,170, and the 1936 programme will bring it up to a figure of 1,310.<\/p><p>There is one point consequent on the growing strength of the Royal Air Force\nthat I would like to mention. It is in connection with the partial reorganisation of the Service side of the Air Ministry. As the House knows, we have now a fourth Service member of the Air Council. The reason for this addition has been to keep pace with the expansion, and to be able to give more time to the very great increase in administration which the expansion scheme entails. It will enable the Chief of the Air Staff to give more individual attention to the major problems of strategy and training, and the Air member for Research and Development to concentrate more effectively on his own current problems, progress in regard to which is so vital at the present time.<\/p><p>I will turn for a few minutes from the Royal Air Force to that equally vital sphere of air development&#8212;civil aviation. The year 1934 has been one of striking progress&#8212;a year in which, in fact, plans have been laid which promise still greater progress in the future. As regards our Imperial air services, we have seen, first, the extension of the Indian service to Australia, and, secondly, the duplication of the existing weekly services to the Cape and Calcutta. These are solid achievements, and reflect great credit upon the management of Imperial Airways, which company, while forging ahead with these Imperial developments, has maintained its commanding position among the European services. In fact, in 1934, as in 1933, Imperial Airways carried across the Channel a substantially larger number of passengers than all their foreign competitors&#8212;Dutch, Belgian, German and French combined. I submit that this is a striking tribute both to the efficiency of their organisation and also to the remarkable goodwill which they have built up among the travelling public. The weight of letters which was carried was larger than that which was ever carried in one year, namely, 122 tons compared with 85 tons in 1933&#8212;an increase of 43 per cent. I am told that 122 tons represents 6,000,000 letters, which shows that people have not given up writing letters for the moment, anyhow. The Christmas mails were also very heavy, and a greater weight of parcels was carried over the Channel than was ever carried before. I should like to pay a tribute to my right hon.\nFriend the Postmaster-General for the very great assistance he has given the Air Ministry in their task of developing civil air transport, by the forward policy he has adopted with regard to air mails.<\/p><p>Another very satisfactory development of the past year was the formal ratification with Italy of a 10-year agreement whereby Imperial Airways will be able to fly freely over Italian territory on our Imperial services. With regard to France, an understanding of a similar kind was arrived at just before Christmas. Within the next month or two Imperial Airways plan to operate an interim service through to Brindisi with small machines, primarily for the carriage of mails. A full service by large aircraft cannot be brought into operation until their fleet has been augmented. As hon. Members know, a very large demand has been made upon it as a result of the recent decision to duplicate the African and Indian services. The year 1934 also saw a very satisfactory development of our internal air services, no fewer than 17 different companies operating at one time of the year. In non-commercial flying, also, there has been a very satisfactory advance. As this matter is to be raised later in the Debate, I will not say anything more about it except to say that&#8212;contrary to the Jeremiads we have heard in some quarters&#8212;on a basis either of our respective national incomes, or of our populations, there are proportionately more private pilots' licences in this country to-day than in the United States of America. Not that we are satisfied with these figures. We want to see them very largely increased, and during the year we have taken very active steps to effect that, of which I will tell the House later.<\/p><p>The House will also wish to know something about our air transport plans. As regards the immediate future, we are taking money in these Estimates for a feeder service to connect the West African Colonies with the trunk route at Khartoum, and also to link up Singapore with Hong Kong and Bangkok on the Australian line. I am sorry that we have not been able as yet to inaugurate the Bermudan service, but hope, however, to be able to do it in a short space of time.<\/p><p>Turning to our long-range plans, as I announced before Christmas, the Post Office, the Air Ministry and Imperial Airways have been in co-operation for many months past on a scheme which represents the most far-reaching step forward in our Imperial air communications. Perhaps I may repeat its main features to hon. Members, although I believe they are more or less familiar with them. We aim, first, at a great increase on existing frequencies; secondly, at a striking acceleration of existing time schedules; and, thirdly, at the carriage of all first-class mail matter by air. There will be four or five services a week to India, three to East Africa and Singapore, two to South Africa and Australia, and seven or eight services a week to Egypt. We hope later on even to do better than that, but I may say that no other country in the world has yet formulated schemes for the carriage of the whole of its first-class mail matter by air without surcharge.<\/p><p>Since it has been suggested that this scheme owes its origin to the remarkable speeds achieved in the Melbourne race last October, I may, perhaps, be allowed to say that the Air Ministry, after a very great deal of preliminary spadework, had laid these identical time schedules and frequencies in full detail, together with the proposal for the carriage of all first-class mail matter by air, before the Government a year ago, and many months before the Melbourne race. Not that we have not lessons to learn from such races, and the House and country must indeed have been proud of the magnificent achievement of those two skilful and courageous aviators, Scott and Black. We have received invaluable help from the Post Office in the elaboration of these schemes. My right hon. Friend the Postmaster-General hopes that, in so far as concerns letters posted in the United Kingdom for Empire destinations, we shall be able to provide these immensely improved and accelerated postal communications in the region of 1&#189;d. per half ounce.<\/p><p>A scheme of this magnitude cannot be planned and brought into operation in a few months. In the first place, we have greatly to improve the existing ground organisation on our Imperial routes, especially for night flying. Plans\nhave been in preparation for many months past in these matters, and will entail a very considerable expenditure. Hon. Members who, later on, are going to complain that we are not spending enough on civil aviation, might remember that. These Estimates provide only for the first instalment of the commitments which we shall have to meet. Apart from that, first and foremost I may say that the scheme depends upon the full and willing co-operation of the Dominions, the Colonies and India, with whom we are continuing in satisfactory negotiations. It also entails the raising of &#163;2,000,000 of fresh money, most of which will be spent, of course, on a new Air Fleet. Therefore, in the light of all these considerations, on the most favourable hypothesis, I do not think that this scheme will come into full operation before 1937. That seems a long time off, but the years have a knack of going by very quickly. The development of our inland services also depends upon further ground organisation. During the course of the past year we have made very great progress with the establishment of wireless and meteorological facilities, and we hope that that progress is going to continue this year. Here, too, and in particular, we intend to make a beginning with the provision of the necessary equipment for night flying. We look for a steady growth of internal services, and here again we hope that the Post Office will be able to help us by giving these services the necessary minimum loads which might otherwise be lacking.<\/p><p>I think there is a great chance for the expansion of those services, but I should like to enter a caveat. Although there is great scope for their expansion it would be idle to expect to sec a development on the scale that we have seen in the United States of America, anyhow in the near future. The conditions there are fundamentally different. No amount of expenditure, even if the money were available, could reproduce them in this country. To begin with, the area of the United States is, I believe, 40 times that of Great Britain and Ireland, and we must not overlook the fact that the very large governmental expenditure of &#163;25,000,000 in the years 1927&#8211;33 have left American air transport in a far from healthy condition economically. This huge governmental expenditure is only the beginning of the tale. Over and\nabove it the investing public have put a far larger sum into American air services, and most of their money, I am sorry to say, has gone for all time. If I might quote again from the very interesting official report from which I quoted just now, it puts the capital losses in the aeronautical industries over the last few years at nearly three-quarters of the total amount invested. Those losses are apparently estimated at the colossal figure of 460,000,000 dollars, or &#163;95,000,000 at par of exchange. This vast sum has vanished like gossamer in the sun.<\/p><p>I suggest that while we must go steadily forward we should at all events do everything we possibly can to avoid a similar state of affairs in this country, for despite all this lavish private and governmental expenditure the same official reports brings out that in October, 1934, the latest month for which figures are available, the American air transport industry as a whole was still making collective losses at the rate of about &#163;750,000 a year. Not even the Post Office budget for air mail payments of over &#163;3,900,000 in the current year has enabled the majority of the services to break even or to get anywhere near breaking even. In the light of these figures the Commission sum up the situation as follows:\n<q>It appears, in short, that financial disaster is in the making for a large part of the present air transport system; whether it makes its appearance in six weeks or six months or longer, we cannot see how it can be postponed indefinitely.<\/q>\nImperial Airways, on the contrary, despite the very much smaller financial assistance from the State, continue to show a reasonable profit. If, therefore, we have not yet seen a development of our air transport system on the scale we should like to see it we can take comfort from the fact that we have built solidly if not showily, and on these solid foundations we plan in the next few years to erect a substantial superstructure. In short, whilst it would be folly to disregard the remarkable progress which American air transport, thanks to unlimited expenditure, has been able to achieve, and from which we have many lessons to learn, I submit that there are other lessons and that there are certain features in American air transport that we should be at pains to avoid in this country. There is one type of aircraft\nin particular in which American development has been very striking, and that is the fast medium-size commercial transport machine, although the majority, if not all, of these machines produced to date would be incapable of economic operation on our Empire routes. There has hitherto been no real demand for this type in the United Kingdom, but in the near future it does seem that there may be a definite scope for an economic machine of this character, though we shall continue to require larger machines, capable of carrying much bigger paying loads, as the main units for our Empire services. We have, therefore, decided to take special steps to encourage British manufacturers in the development of an economic aircraft of this kind, and I am in a position to announce this afternoon that we intend to offer a prize of &#163;25,000 for the best machine produced by any United Kingdom firm within a stated period of time and complying with certain broad requirements to be formulated by the Air Ministry. Further details will be made public in due course.<\/p><p>Stress has very rightly been laid upon the need of planning for our internal air services, that is to say the forecasting of the focal points of air traffic and the main lines along which it is likely to flow. The need of such planning was foreseen some time ago by the Air Ministry, and we have been in consultation for many months with the Aerodromes Advisory Board of which my right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for the Drake Division of Plymouth (Captain Guest) is Chairman. The board has put up a definite proposal to the Air Ministry for an air transport survey of these islands, which is now under consideration. I would like to pay a tribute to the Aviation Committee of the London Chamber of Commerce for all the preliminary work which they also did in this connection. The Committee under the chairmanship of Lord Gorell, which was still sitting when these Estimates were introduced last year, has completed its labours and presented a most valuable report. The thanks of the House are once more due to the three members who served on the committee for the work they have done for civil aviation. The Air Ministry have adopted the major recommendations of the committee, including those for the devolution of airworthiness work to a new and unofficial body and the institu-\ntion of a compulsory system of third-party insurance.<\/p><p>Civil aviation is so large a subject and at the same time so important a one that it would be impossible for me to traverse the whole of it without taking an undue proportion of the time of the House. Therefore, I will leave it to Members to raise at a later stage in this Debate any further points they wish to question me about, and proceed at once to a short survey of the individual Votes. I have already referred to Vote A. Votes 1 and 2 show no more than the normal increase which one would expect from the additional personnel we shall be entering in connection with expansion. Vote 3 not only provides for technical and war-like stores but also for the experimental and research services and for the purchase of new aircraft and engines. For the first time in our history the gross total of this Vote exceeds &#163;10,000,000. It shows an increase of &#163;1,300,000 on last year.<\/p>",

While the right hon. Gentleman cannot expect us to respond to the plea he made to us, or expect us to agree with a good deal of his matter, yet the least we can do is to say that the form of the speech and the explanation of the Estimates to-day has been admirable. I was very much struck by the first item with which the right hon. Gentleman dealt, the conduct of the troops. No words could be used which would do more than justice to the men of the British Army from the point of view of conduct, and, indeed, when reading the annual report of the British Army, I have sometimes wondered why the War Office did not make rather more of it than they do, instead of giving us a whole list of figures.<\/p><p>Those who know something of the general conduct as well as the standard of education of the troops, and know the work they perform, were not at all surprised at the splendid eulogies won by the troops who went to the Saar. The right hon. Gentleman was well entitled to make the claim that he did concerning their conduct. I talked to some of the troops when they returned, and I was impressed by the warmth of feeling they expressed for the people of the Saar. The impression I got was that we had sent to the Saar soldiers, but that they had turned out to be merely good neighbours and had earned the esteem of the people living there. If the statesmen of this country and the statesmen of Europe generally could aproach the problems that are upon them to-day, and that have been multiplied during the week-end, in the spirit and with the tact, good sense\nand feeling of neighbourliness shown by the ordinary \"Tommy\" in the Saar, there would be hope for a successful issue to our difficulties.<\/p><p>Every year we get a report dealing with recruiting, and I had expected the right hon. Gentleman would say something about that. We are told that out of 80,203 applicants to join the Army only 25,564 were finally approved. Approximately 68 per cent. were rejected on account of physical, educational or other defects. The report says:\n<q>It must, however, be remembered that the medical standard required of the soldier is equivalent to, if not higher than, that for a first-class insurance policy. It must be remembered also that many men are rejected for the Army on account of disabilities, which incapacitate them from the military point of view only, and which do not reflect on their general health. For this reason, the figures cannot be taken as an indication of the health and physique of the nation as a whole. Of the number of applicants to join, 45.5 per cent. were either in employment or had been so during the preceding three months.<\/q>\nI want to challenge that conclusion. The great mass of the men who have been rejected are aged between 18 and 20 years, and two out of every three have been rejected. One naturally expects that between 18 and 20 years the average person is what one might term Al for purposes of insurance. It must be borne in mind also that the great bulk of the men who go into the Army are of the more adventurous type, and usually consider themselves as physically fit for the job and of quite good appearance for the purposes for which they enlist. What is more significant still is that every year this goes on: 80,000 offer themselces to enlist and roughly 25,000 are accepted. Any hon. Member can take this report and look at the figures for the past 10 years, and he will find that this year's figures are pretty much what they have been for some years past, except that they are actually getting worse.<\/p><p>It is significant that the War Office find it necessary to state that something like 45 per cent. were either working when they enlisted or had been within the last three months. That means that 65 per cent. were unemployed, and, if the Government are so very serious about being efficient, about having the Army's stores made up, surely it is more import-ant that the Army's human equipment should be physically fit for the tasks that\nthey are called on to perform. It is a trite statement, but there is abundant fact in human history to prove it: that it is possible to keep external enemies out, and yet for a nation or an Empire to be ruined by being blind to the obvious facts affecting the physical, mental and moral life of the nation. I therefore hope that if the Government are in the mood to spend extra money on the Army, when it comes to the question of considering spending money to keep men employed and well fed they will show the same enthusiasm.<\/p><p>These Estimates amount to &#163;43,600,000, with an increase of something like &#163;4,000,000 on last year. When the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was making his speech on defence, I was very much struck by the fact that he seemed so hard put to it that he gave a good deal of attention to the items which come-under Vote 10 dealing with works and buildings. He seemed anxious to give the impression to the House that one of the great items was that which dealt with the housing of the soldiers, both single and married. But out of the &#163;4,000,000 there is only just over &#163;400,000 for works and buildings. It is about 11 per cent. of the whole. Indeed, I thought that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs found himself in great difficulties when he had to depend on that argument. But that &#163;400,000 increase is not just for the purpose of housing soldiers, barracks, married quarters and the rest of it; a great deal of it is for the purpose of housing new tanks, and various mechanical units. No one on this side would make the slightest complaint if the increase were for the purpose of housing soldiers. We certainly would not be a party to conditions which hardly reach the ordinary standards of the Ministry of Health. But that does not cover this Vote by any means.<\/p><p>If hon. Members will look at this particular Vote, they will see some very striking things in it. One of them, for instance, is a token Vote on page 203. It is a Vote of about &#163;2,250,000 for Hong Kong, but we only get a token Vote of &#163;100. I did think that the right hon. Gentleman would have given some attention to that item. I want to measure my words about this, but I do not think it is fair to the House and I do not think it is fair to the country that the War Office should try and push through a\nhuge vote of that description on a mere token Vote, and I think we were entitled to some more explanation. It is said that it is for the purpose of providing accommodation for three battalions. What sort of accommodation is that which is going to cost about &#163;700,000 for each battalion? I see that there is a new depot costing &#163;132,000. It is really extraordinary that we should have an item of this description pushed away in a corner without any attempt to explain it. I should like to ask: Is this in pursuance of further defences of a more militaristic character than appears on the surface? Then there is three quarters of a million pounds for Singapore this year. Those are some of the items that come into this Vote for works and buildings. So that when the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs tried to get away with this as an item for housing soldiers, doing the decent thing, keeping them up to healthy standards, he was not giving proper attention to it or else he had not been properly briefed.<\/p><p>I wonder why it is we get this expenditure on housing every year. We have now been spending money on this purpose for nearly 20 years. For the last 10 years there has been an average of over &#163;3,000,000 spent on works and buildings, and many millions have been spent on new conditions. The right hon. Gentleman may not know it, but for some years now I have drawn attention to this fact. I have always been led to ask myself the question: Are we really getting value for our money? Is it not time that, with the amount of money that has been spent, the soldier was guaranteed proper housing conditions, both married and single? A great part of that &#163;30,000,000 has gone for that purpose, and we ought not to be in the position at this time of day of saying that the Ministry of Health would condemn the great mass of the barracks and the housing standards generally of the troops. In fact, I am so concerned about this that I am wondering if the House would not think it worth while doing something about it. I think that we have spent over &#163;1,000,000 at Catterick, and yet there are old huts and all the rest of it in that part of the world still. It is high time that the War Office took steps to survey this business in order that the House may have a guarantee that its money is properly\nspent, and that there is to be an end to these insanitary conditions for soldiers.<\/p><p>But that is only one small item of the whole amount of the increase that we are asked to pass to-day. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs argued in the defence Debate that we have only so many soldiers now and that we had so many in 1914; that we have not as big an Army now as we had in 1914. The right hon. Gentleman has followed not exactly the same lines, but he has said that we need this &#163;4,000,000 in order that we shall have an efficient Army. I am astonished to hear that kind of statement from that Box. I have been listening here now for many years to speeches from the War Office representatives, and all along the line we have been told that we have not got a big Army but we have got an efficient Army. He is only a little fellow, but he is trained to the last ounce. That is the story we have heard continually. It is not worth while reading quotations from previous speeches, but that is the line that has been taken. If we take even the predecessor of the right hon. Gentleman, there is really not a word in his speech last year to demonstrate that the Army was not properly equipped. We were never given the slightest hint about that, and I can explain why. Comparison of the numbers, if nothing else, in 1914, with those of to-day, is simply ridiculous. In 1914 there were two machine guns to a battalion. Two was a magic word for the War Office at that time. I understand that we had 148 infantry battalions in 1914, with 296 machine guns altogether; in 1935 we have 136 infantry battalions with 5,712 machine guns, Lewis and other guns. That is a tremendous difference. There has also been enormous development of power. We have nearly 300 tanks. Comparisons with pre-war times, or even with last year or the year before, are ridiculous. Every year there is an increase of the fire power for the money spent, which is altogether out of proportion to anything that can be measured in money or men.<\/p><p>I remember when we got the new word \"mechanisation,\" I should not be surprised if it were not this country which coined the phrase \"mechanised army.\" We were told at that time that for the amount of money we had to spend we\nshould never have large numbers of men, and that as we had to have a small Army it was necessary to make it as powerful as possible. It appears to be assumed that Members of the House have not been following this matter very closely and that the modern man does not know anything, even in a general way, about the terrifically increased power for destruction of modern arms, as compared with only a few years ago. I have been very much surprised to find so much talk about lack of equipment, need for renovation, stores being under-manned, and that kind of thing. It is quite new, but it tallies with the story that is being told in other parts of the world to other nations. I noticed in the French debates on Saturday that the same terms were being used, and I suppose the Germans will be using them. There is the same round of terms and phrases that mean nothing in particular. The whole story in this Estimate is of armoured cars, tanks, tractors, artillery wagons, infantry transport, and such items. No one who has seen a modern mechanised army operating, with its series of terrifying steel towers ranging from a vast building of steel to the whippets around, will be in any way beguiled by the idea that we have only a small, inefficient, ill-equipped Army. That is not a good enough story for the Government to try to put across, when they want this increase of &#163;4,000,000, &#163;2,000,000 of which is going in this direction.<\/p><p>We ought to have a more explicit explanation as to the lack of stores. That is altogether new. The statement of the Secretary of State for War in his memorandum is that there is a new means of preserving stores. The Department have a means of examining stores in order to stop disease by means of radiology. I should think that we have led the van in the industrial life of this country in testing and experimenting in that direction. Not very much is said about it, and I shall not go into details, although there is no reason why I should not do so. In Woolwich a special department can test the condition of stores of almost any kind and radiate light through very strong solids. I want the case made out for the destruction of stores. It is said that there is a lack of stores. The right hon. Gentleman has said that we have not the same number\nof factories producing munitions as in the normal days before the War, but I do not think that there is anything in that. The potential productive power applies in that direction as it applies to anything else in the whole range of production. It applies also to Woolwich.<\/p><p>I do not know whether there is anything in the statement that Woolwich Arsenal is to be moved; I hope there is not. I do not know whether the Government have arrived at a decision in the matter, but, if the arsenal is unfortunately to be moved, I wish to make it clear to the Government that they must not do the same in respect to Woolwich as they did with regard to the Pimlico army clothing factory not very far from this House. In that case, the lease was up, and the Government simply scrapped the whole business. They simply abandoned the whole of the War Office experience in that direction and put themselves into the hands of private producers. It is not easy to obtain a comparison of what is happening under private production, but the War Office are certainly losing experience by which to test the private producers of army uniforms and safeguard themselves against those who would exploit the Department. If there is to be experiment and research for the production of stores and munitions and guns, it is to be hoped that the Government will do it themselves instead of letting the work go to private firms. I do not believe there is anything in the statement that power for the production of munitions is not as great as it was before the War. Factories and units are bigger and the productive capacity is infinitely&#8212;many times&#8212;ahead of what it was in years gone by.<\/p><p>There has not been by any means a satisfactory explanation of the increase which we are called upon to vote. We have not been told in what we are deficient. The right hon. Gentleman used that word continually. He said there was a deficiency in equipment. The Army was deficient in this, that, and the other, and he is asking the House to vote an increase of &#163;4,000,000 despite the continued statements that the Army, even if small, was very efficient. The fact is that the &#163;4,000,000 is part of a general increased expenditure on defence, and is of one piece with the increases in regard\nto the Navy and the Air Force. When we speak about the small unit of defence, such as our Army, we cannot dissociate it from the fact that we have to vote vast Estimates for the Navy and considerable Estimates for the Royal Air Force. The Government must face the fact that in asking us to increase this Estimate they have departed from the routine which has been followed by Governments for a number of years of doing their business along pacific lines and relying to some extent upon collective action through the League of Nations. It is significant that we are asked not merely for an increase of &#163;4,000,000, but that for the first time since the War there is a complete departure from reliance upon collective action and upon the collective wisdom of that organisation which was set up for the purpose of giving a sense of security to the peoples of the world.<\/p><p>The Government cannot be very satisfied of the effect of this increase upon the world at large. On this side of the House we are no more in love with the present creed of the Germans than is anyone else, but Governments in the past have withstood it to some extent, and have relied upon collective action to give hope of security to the world. If ever there was a time when the statesmen of this country and of the world should take note of the ordinary man in the street, it is the present time. Rather than trust the present Government or its policy, I should be prepared to trust a delegation from, say, the British Legion to meet the ex-combatants of other countries. I would rather accept the contribution that they would make than that of the statesmen who have been manipulating and manoeuvring things during the past few years. I remember, as a lad in the pit, thinking of the Foreign Secretary as a man very able in international law, as one of very great experience and status in both legal and social matters, and generally as a statesman to be looked up to; but, taking into account the experience of the British troops in the Saar, the experience of the various peoples of the world and the agony they have gone through in our lifetime, the gloom which now rests upon this and other lands, the almost despair that has settled upon the people of this and other countries, I should say it would be a good thing if statesmen generally would stand aside\nand let people meet each other. We shall vote against these Estimates; we shall take the consequences of that vote; but we would say to His Majesty's Government and to the statesmen of other countries: \"For God's sake get out of the light, and let the people see each other.\"<\/p>",

There is an increase from &#163;680,000 last year to &#163;1,767,000. I should like to know whether proper care is taken that we are not paying too much for the ammunition. One notes that the shares of the armament firms have been going up by leaps and bounds on account of the encouragement they have received from the Government, and I hope we are not making too excessive a contribution to that result.

Over and over again it has been decided that we were not going to proceed with the defences at Singapore. I admit that the present Government have reversed the policy of the previous Government, but I thought that the Foreign Secretary had established such friendly terms with Japan when he became their advocate at Geneva that it was not necessary to spend so much in the Pacific. We shall go into the Lobby against these Estimates as a protest against the policy which is being carried out by His\nMajesty's Government.

I am glad to see that the shortage of personnel is being dealt with by an addition of 2,000 men, and glad, also, from another point of view, that we are pressing on with the Singapore base. We must not shrink from facing realities. We in this country are to-day faced with two possible danger points in the world, one in Europe and the other in the Far East. Of these the most probable as well as by far the most difficult from a naval point of view is the Far East. If we were forced to face the situation of having to send the fleet to the Far East, thousands of miles from its home base, we should have to secure its lines of communication to the Far East. Our naval position in my judgment in the Far East can never be secure until the Singapore base is completed. The complexion of the world today would be very different if the Anglo-Japanese Treaty had continued, not so much as a guarantee for any specific object but as a form of mutual benefit and better international understanding between nations.<\/p><p>I am glad to see that the value of the capital ship has been recognised. The battleship is the backbone of the Fleet. Our entire naval power depends ultimately and always upon the battle fleet. I do not wish to discuss technical and expert points, but I do wish to discuss how this question affects the man in the street and the householder to-day. The first essential is to abolish fear and establish a sense of security and confidence. Now, when we have increased our Estimates, some little Englander is sure to ask why? It is time to bring home to every citizen in this country the vital part which the Navy plays in their lives and homes and to point out that if it is not strong enough to preserve our lines of communication starvation stares the people in the face. Before the Navy can keep our supplies intact it must see to its own oil supplies. The British Empire, unfortunately, only owns about 2 per cent. of the world's oil fuel supply. I believe that Burma and Trinidad are the only British owned sources of oil. For 300 years we have been the controller of the seas in all parts of the world, and if our communications are cut at any time we should be starved out in three months. We have to import three-fifths of our food and a large\nquantity of raw materials for the manufactures which pay for that food. It is therefore obvious to everyone, especially to those who have travelled in both hemispheres, that we are entirely dependent on our trade routes. For years our Navy has performed the policing of the seas, and as soon as we reduced our Navy piracy again came out in the Far East, and also after a long interval the slave trade as well.<\/p><p>Our present position in the world is an outstanding example of what can be created by the influence of sea power. In 1914 we possessed the most powerful fleet ever recorded in the history of the world. It is not an exaggeration to say that at that time British sea power saved the world from military aggression. History tells us that aggression is always founded on weakness, that if one nation knows that she cannot face the armaments of another nation she does not go to war. On the other hand, there are those who argue from a different angle, but if it is true that armaments are a cause of war then we ought to have been continually at war for the last 60 years when the British Navy was twice as strong as any other two navies. Since the War our naval supremacy has very sadly declined. Under the provisions of the London Naval Treaty we accepted 50 cruisers to do the work for which at least 70 were required. With 80,000 miles of trade routes to protect I trust Great Britain may never again agree to accept such a position of comparative naval inferiority. To us the command of the sea is vital and it is the duty of every citizen to see that no Government is ever allowed to forget that. The number of cruisers we have allotted to us is entirely inadequate, and when the present Treaty expires I sincerely hope that the people of this country will insist on adequate provision being made to remedy that deficiency.<\/p><p>There was a controversy some years ago when the \"gunnery\" school said that torpedoes were no use and the \"torpedo\" school said that the gun was obsolete. To-day there are some who say that the Navy is obsolete, and those who say that the air is a very exaggerated menace. The real truth, I think, is that the Navy and Air Force are complementary to each other. Obviously, battleships cannot prevent foreign bombers\nfrom reaching London. Alternatively, the Air Force cannot prevent attacks by foreign cruiser raiders upon the vessels upon our trade routes. The Naval Air Arm is just as much a part of the Navy as a flotilla of destroyers. Personally, if I were faced with the choice of the two evils I would rather take the chance of being bombed than the certainty of being starved.<\/p><p>I think in this country we ought to recognise&#8212;as they certainly do in America&#8212;the great power which propaganda plays in stimulating public support for our Services. No business can be carried on successfully without propaganda. And what business in this respect can compare with our Navy? I should like to see an active and vigorous campaign of naval propaganda started in the schools and throughout the country with the help of the Press and the British Broadcasting Corporation; and by so doing make the country not only Navy-minded but, what is more, Navy-proud. Throughout the world the British Navy is emulated as much as it is envied. Trade follows the flag, and wherever the White Ensign flies it commands respect as the emblem and symbol of freedom and justice. We can well understand and appreciate the jealous eyes of the foreigner when he travels from Bremen or Hamburg to the Far East and sees the Union Jack flying at Dover Castle, at Gibraltar, at Malta, at Suez, at Aden, at Colombo, at Singapore, at Hong Kong and at Shanghai.

Everybody knows that the best defence against the new terror is the air arm, but only one-sixth of the money is going to the air arm and the rest to services which are as obsolete as the beefeaters in the Tower. Most of the money is not going to increase the size of the Services but to material which may increase our defence against air attack. Does the First Lord of the Admiralty believe that you can defend a battleship against bombs from the air by anti-aircraft guns? Has his expert body at the Admiralty ever faced what it means when\na new and improved living projectile can be dropped from 20,000 feet in ten seconds on to a battleship, from so high that you cannot see the aeroplane? What on earth is the service which anti-aircraft guns can render against that attack?<\/p><p>The antiquity of the school can be illustrated by the question of the big battleships. The First Lord is a notorious defender of the big battleship as against cruisers and smaller ships. He has defended them for two years running, but his defence gets thinner each year. I wonder what possible defence there can be for the creation of a battleship costing &#163;8,000,000 which is so valuable that it dare not fight. During the War one of the biggest battleships was the \"Queen Elizabeth,\" but directly a submarine came inside the Mediterranean the \"Queen Elizabeth\" ran away, not because the officers were afraid but because the ship was so valuable that you could not risk her. At the battle of Jutland we found that the ships were so costly that you could not expect any man to risk their loss, it might be irreparable, and, moreover, these big capital ships are given such importance that the rest of the fleet, cruisers, submarines and destroyers have to be reserved to protect them in Scapa Flow or the Falkland islands and cannot get on with their work of defending the British seas.<\/p><p>Let me turn to the other side of the White Paper. It is intimately linked with the question of defence as a whole, and particularly the defence of London. I and my colleagues on these benches are in favour of collective security. We think that for that collective security we have to provide our share of the police force. We are proposing now to implement our share of that force and to make collective security more immediate both to ourselves and to other people by entering into two pacts, by making Locarno an air pact as well as an obsolete land and sea pact, and to supplement the Locarno of the west by an eastern Locarno pact. We have discussed the question of security in the Labour party for at least 12 years. During the years we were in office we had the problem of the <i>Protocol de Gen&#232;ve;<\/i> should we or should we not make the Covenant of the League a solid instrument for policing the world by pledging ourselves to fight whenever there was an infraction of the Versailles treaties against any aggressor.\nWhenever that problem came up I was always against it, and the right hon. Member for Clay Cross (Mr. A. Henderson) was always for it. Finally, I think that I carried the day, at any rate, the Labour party dropped the <i>Protocol de Gen&#232;ve,<\/i> as the Conservative party had dropped it before, because we felt that we should be taking a great many risks without materially protecting ourselves, and involving ourselves in wars connected with countries like Bessarabia and Transylvania without really having any advantage from the rest of the League of Nations, because we ourselves were in no danger.<\/p><p>Then came Locarno. At the time I opposed it. It was merely a small section of the <i>Protocol de Gen&#232;ve,<\/i> embracing England, Belgium, France and Germany. But it was the Protocol in small. It did imply definite responsibility, definite police action. I opposed it for the same reason as Lord Rothermere opposes it now. Why run into danger? Why pledge ourselves to maintain the Versailles Treaty when it was not our concern? Everyone who opposed it then is now in favour of it; we are all in favour of it. We believe that we are getting as much advantage out of it as France is or Germany is, that it is giving to us a certain degree of security, and that, therefore, there is something now to be said for it. It is no longer pure altruism but is something of value to Great Britain.<\/p><p>Now this air business has come along and shown us that war will not be like that of the old days, with lots of notice, with a formal declaration and mobilisation, but will come like a thief in the night from the air, and Locarno will be of no service unless it has an air counterpart. The Foreign Secretary is going to Berlin to see whether he can induce Germany to come into an extended Locarno dealing with the air and involving instant action instead of all the long preliminaries of co-operation. That is the principal, object of our foreign policy at the present time, I understand. It is to secure a Western air pact which will guarantee&#8212;I do not say any of these things the least offensively&#8212;that if Germans come over and bomb us without notice the French will go and bomb them without any hesitation. That is the basis of our idea; that is where we come in. In the same way if France is bombed\nby Germany or Germany bombed by France, we go for the aggressor at once without bargaining or waiting. Obviously the great difficulty in any guarantee of that sort is that we cannot trust them and they cannot trust us. <i>Perfide Albion<\/i> will always be <i>Perfide Albion<\/i> to the French. Can we be sure that if we are wiped out in 24 hours the French will come in and help? That is where the beginnings of the international force might come in. I do not say that you can rely absolutely on an international force, but you can rely on it much better than obligations under a protocol. It is absolute faith that is required in order to make this gradual extension of collective security work. We must have confidence.<\/p><p>The suggestion I have to make&#8212;I hope it will not appear too wild&#8212;is that if we get this air pact we might have a British air force in France, of course outside the Saar, as part of the International force in France, and likewise have a French force here. It has been objected to me that that would mean having a German force here too. Well, I do not mind. I think we should do them more good than they would do harm to us. If we had here in England a mixed force of Belgians, Frenchmen, Germans and English, and similar mixed forces in all the four countries, you would have the beginning of that international air force at which passivists should aim. If you really think that an international police is worth having, begin somehow. This is a way to begin which would be appreciated more than anything else by those other Powers.<\/p><p>The Lord President is right in saying that this question is so much a question of status. If Germany understood that her air force would be here and ours in Germany, the Germans would welcome the idea. See the additional security it gives. What is the first object that would be bombed if we had an aggressor who was determined to act without notice? It would be the aerodromes and the petrol tanks, not London. If you had there, not your own nationals, but mixed nationals, the reaction would be more certain, and the reliance upon the reaction of the Governments concerned would be equally certain. That is one of the points I wanted to make clear. The White Paper is intolerable as a\nconcoction of the War Office and the Admiralty, but the use that may be made of it may be all right if we can give to Germany and to France and to Belgium the feeling, not that we are playing with this great danger, but that we are providing absolutely the best possible defence against a breach of the peace. I think that that will do some good.<\/p><p>It is the Lord Privy Seal who is going to do the most ticklish thing of all. He is going to Moscow. Of course, he will not commit us in the least, but it is right that he should know that those of us on this side of the House who have gone into this question would honestly like to see an Eastern air pact just as we have a Western pact. We know the risks involved, but to my mind if we do not have some form of Eastern pact the risks are greater still. It is no use drifting into war in the East by no one ever knowing what we shall do, above all, by never letting other people know what we shall do. It would be invidious to give illustrations, but obviously the <i>Drang nach Osten<\/i> is far greater than the <i>Drang nach Westen.<\/i> Memel, Lithuania, Latvia, the whole of the land which the Teutonic knights conquered in the fourteenth century, could be conquered again to-morrow if the junkers wished it. There is nothing to stop them, except of course the uncertainty as to what Russia would do or what France would do. It is the uncertainty which makes the real risk.<\/p><p>I hope that the Lord Privy Seal when he goes to Moscow will see at least what is required if security is to be given to Russia. It is hopeless to consider securing Russia's Eastern Empire. It is hopeless, not because it was not right to support Manchuria and the Chinese against the Japanese but because we dare not do so. The moment that the Japanese&#8212;and theirs is an authoritarian government with a vengeance&#8212;choose to do so they could strike at Hong Kong and blow the place to pieces and sink every ship we have east of Singapore. I give them the East. We cannot touch that. But we can let the Russians know and we can let Herr Hitler know with the same frankness as that which we have shown in the West, what we are prepared to do. Are we prepared to take the enormous risk of saying that we would pledge ourselves\nfor the Baltic States&#8212;which I do not love although I do not know much about them. They are all authoritarians now. If they were good sound free states it would be different. But what is the position to be? Are we to say \"No\" that we will not do this, or are we to join with the French and try to get Poland and Germany into such a pact? I think we might have from the Lord Privy Seal some idea as to how far he will go. We cannot expect him to be definite on such an indefinite position but I think he ought to show the whole world any commitment which is definitely decided upon because I believe that in this case, above all others, publicity is the secret of safety.<\/p>",

It is obvious that the Governor-General can only fulfil his functions if he has full information from the whole of India which is under his charge and in respect of which his responsibilities extend. Consequently, he must be able to control, collect, and utilise information, and, if necessary, superintend the Governors in matters arising from dangerous, subversive, or revolutionary conspiracies, which are scattered about, not only in the Governors' Provinces, but may have their branches and their effects in the Chief Commissioners' Provinces, in an excluded area, in a federated State, or in a non-federated State. Those activities of the Governor-General for the defence of India must have some organisation at headquarters which shall be under his discretion, in order that he may be cognisant of what is going on and may be able to give, in discharge of that responsibility, special instructions from time to time to the Governors under him and to all other authorities, civil and military, under him.<\/p><p>I hope to secure that by the Amendment without trespassing at all on the question of law and order in the Provinces. Whatever may be the system there, it is certain that all these questions of revolutionary and subversive movements must be under one control eventually in order to secure that co-ordination and co-operation upon which successful operations to defeat such conspiracies must depend. I want to emphasise very strongly what will take place under this new Constitution in respect of that part of the work of the Government of India which is at present performed by the central criminal investigation department and, over it, by the home department. I shall not put forth a lot of imaginary dangers that might arise or difficulties that might be felt, but I will give my own experience of the dangers that arise in an appointment which I held for five and\na-quarter years, including over two and a-half years of the War.<\/p><p>We had conspiracies emanating, not all in India itself, but having effects in parts of India&#8212;conspiracies organised from outside which began to take effective forms within the country. We had to have information from Vancouver, Hong Kong, Siam and Japan itself, and all this kind of information related to organisations which were not confined to one Province. They may have appeared first in one Province, say Bengal, but they had their manifestations through branches, and even through outbreaks, it might be in the Punjab, at Lahore, or it might be at Delhi, or in the United Provinces, or Bombay, or Madras. We had conspirators who entered right away via Ceylon and so forth, and I can tell the Committee that the work of the home department in that one branch and in that respect was such as to occupy a great deal of time and thought and co-ordinated action, not only between the police who were charged with dealing with anarchy and crimes of that kind, but between the officers in charge of law and order all over India who might have to deal with attempts to seduce the troops from their allegiance, which, I take it, would be covered by the words \"conspiracy having a revolutionary tendency.\"<\/p><p>I will give an illustration of the cooperation which the army requires from the civil side and from officers, whether police, or executive officers, or magistrates, as the case may be. I was visiting Simla in 1907. That was the year which happened to be 50 years from the Mutiny and was, therefore, selected for movements of a seditious and subversive character. These were going on at the time of my visit to Simla, where I went to see Lord Kitchener upon the question of the location of the garrison, but in the course of that somewhat long conversation Lord Kitchener impressed on me the supreme importance of the civil authorities throughout India, wherever they might be, keeping level, and acquainted, with what was going on in matters affecting the army and the allegiance of the troops in the cantonments, infantry and cavalry lines, and so on. He said to me&#8212;and I shall never forget it&#8212;\" I get my information from various sources, from the staff or regimental officers or others who find\ninformation of this kind, and I hear of attempts made on the loyalty of troops. I get that information, but that is not enough.\" He said&#8212;and I am sure everyone in the Committee will agree&#8212;that it is very desirable that officers of the Indian Army should not act in any way to make the troops under them begin to feel that they are suspected. It was so in the Mutiny of course. There were officers who stood by their men and swore that their men, at all events, were absolutely trustworthy, and who were afterwards surprised by an <i>&#232;meute<\/i> among their particular troops.<\/p><p>We have to guard against that. If the officers were always suspecting their men it would destroy the complete harmony and the pleasant relations that always exist between British officers and the sepoys in the Indian Army. It is, therefore, all the more incumbent on the civil authorities to help us with every information that they can discover which we cannot find for ourselves. The opportunities to do that are many. The troops do not only get leave in bazaars, but they travel by train back to their homes on furlough, and these are the opportunities for the insidious and malignant men who pour poison into the ears of the troops in order to induce them to depart from their allegiance. They are occasions when their officers would hear nothing about it and are thus very dangerous. Similarly one of the ways in which troops are influenced in India is by agitators and others who persecute their families while the sepoys themselves are on service. It must be remembered, also, that there are all kinds of acts of murder or sabotage on railways, dacoities and so forth which, although they may seem to be ordinary crimes with the ordinary motives for such crimes, are proved to be part of political conspiracies and are intended to serve political ends.<\/p><p>It is essential that the Governor-General at the top should be acquainted with these crimes as they occur from time to time. If a magistrate or a police officer gets news of attempts at sedition or attempts at tampering with troops, it is his duty to communicate it to the local military officer, namely, the officer commanding the station or a brigade or a division as the case may be. It is all a question of civil help to the defence of India and of protecting the army from insidious\nattempts to weaken its allegiance and thereby to bring about the fall of the raj. These objectives are not stated in any way in the Bill, and it seems to me much better to put into the Clause the words of the Amendment rather than to leave only some vague reference to defence without any reference to the particular duties which will fall on the Governor-General. It must be remembered that under the new Federal Constitution it is a source of anxiety as to what happens to the Home Department. It now keeps a general superintendence over the whole of the police and gaols in the Provinces, but all that part of its duty will go with provincial autonomy and with law and order transferred to Ministers. There are other duties in connection with the Home Department which will likewise go, and the Department as such will have very little left. It has many special duties, but those connected most prominently with the Home Department, including, besides crime, the Press, the security services, and the Indian Medical service, rest not with the federal ministers but with the Governor-General.<\/p><p>My successor in office who was enamoured of a new constitution such as the one proposed in the Bill, told me he was very anxious about how the Government of India, and especially the Governor-General, would get on without this great Home Department upon which every Governor-General in the past had depended to acquaint him thoroughly with what goes on in every part of India in regard to conspiracies, subversive political moves and all sorts of events which have a grave significance. They must be ascertained and made known; otherwise, the Governor - General, especially now that he is left with only a private secretariat, will be unable to obtain information and take action in respect of these matters because of the vast burdens put upon him of other responsibilities and other branches of administration upon which his sanction or his discretion or his individual judgment will have to be exercised. This Amendment cannot be objectionable under the system which the Government are themselves setting up, and I hope that, as the right hon. Gentleman has accepted two of my Amendments, he will keep up the record and accept this one.<\/p>",

The expression is not an apt one, and has no accurate meaning, because nationality and domicile are distinct conceptions. The real misconception underlying many of the speeches in favour of the Amendment has been in seeking to make a differentiation between a coloured British subject and a white British subject, and between a British subject whose domicile is somewhere outside the United Kingdom and a British subject domiciled within the United Kingdom. No such differentiation is possible. A man either is a British subject or is not a British subject. The question of domicile does not and cannot come into the matter at all. It is a question of law and fact linking a person to a place, and has nothing whatever to do with nationality, while nationality is as regardless of domicile as domicile is regardless of nationality, There are stringent rules against the employment of aliens on British ships. The matter is governed by the Aliens Restriction Amendment Act, 1919, Section 5. The right hon.

He has presented his case with lucidity and clarity. We all agree that the shipping industry is in a parlous state. Many ships are idle\nand multitudes of good seamen are without work. In asking us to take these matters into consideration, the hon. Member was careful to forswear any disposition to embark on any enterprise smacking of national control or nationalisation of shipping. These fruits of scarcity, these rewards of shortage, which we are asked to vote; the spectacle of unemployed shipping, the millions of pounds lost by shareholders of shipping companies and the multitudes of unemployed sailors, are the glorious fruits of intensive private enterprise. Seeing the hon. Member's enthusiasm for this cause, it is a pity that he has not a more fortunate manifestation of its results to present.<\/p><p>The scarcity of tonnage is due primarily to the fact that fewer goods are purchased by customers, and I can believe that entirely apart from the manipulation of tariffs, for which the present Government are responsible, the difficulties of international exchange and, above all, the financial policy to which they are subject, which keeps down the purchasing power of the people, has more to do with the diminution of cargoes than anything that shipowners themselves may, or may not, have done. We are asked to vote for certain purposes &#163;2,000,000 subsidy for voyages which are to extend for one year. What is going to happen after that we do not know. It may be &#163;3,000,000, and if it is conducted on the same lines and, yields the same results as those with which we are called upon to deal, it may easily be &#163;4,000,000. Then there is the &#163;10,000,000 for new construction.<\/p><p>I will say something about the machinery of the Bill and the proposals in the White Paper later on, but I notice a very significant omission both in the Bill and in the White Paper, and in the speech to which we have just listened. There is not a word about the officers and seamen who work the ships in the White Paper or in the Bill. Shipowners depend on the seamen and officers to work the ships, but they are left out of account, like the cargoes which are discharged on the dockside. We want to put in a plea for them, and I shall not have much difficulty in showing that they are the most vital part of the whole industry.<\/p><p>It is unfortunate, to say the least, that in asking the House of Commons to make this grant of public money, the men who do the work on ships receive no manner of recognition at all. No conditions are mentioned which will affect them directly.<\/p><p>There does not appear to have been consultations with the National Maritime Board, which represents both parties in respect of certain matters. This is an omission which would not have been made in the case of any internal industry. When railway companies are considering any organisation of the undertaking it has always been the custom for many years past, where large sums of public money are expended, to take all the different parties, through their responsible representatives, into consultation. In this case it is the shipowners who have been consulted from start to finish. There are, as we know, some excellent shipowners, but there are others who do not justify that expression. Here is &#163;2,000,000 of public money which is going to be applied for by those who represent the owners, under conditions mainly fashioned by a committee of the owners. I think it is right that we should look a little closely into the administration of this vast sum, which may be greater in the future and which in effect is to be put into the hands of what is an owners' committee. We are entitled to examine their record a little more closely. In saying this I want to pay full tribute to those owners who served us so well during the war and who were associated with the father of an hon. Member whom I am glad to see opposite. I want it to be quite clear that I am only describing facts.<\/p><p>It so happens that by an unfortunate coincidence the right hon. Gentleman opposite was President of the Board of Trade in 1916, and in the early part of 1917 I was a member of a Cabinet Committee which had to investigate the operations and the profits of the shipowners. I do not forget that the other day in the House of Commons the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Board of Trade exhorted us to become adherents of his gospel of profits. Anyhow the shipowners, as far as we found them, or some of them, certainly worshipped at that shrine. In the early days of 1917, in company with my colleagues on that Cabinet Committee, I was\nconfronted with a statement that large numbers of ships somehow or other did not seem to be available. We were told that they could not be chartered or something of that kind. Then we came under the advice of a gentleman who is now Lord Maclay. When we decided to mobilise these ships we found hundreds of them in distant waters all over the world, earning sometimes on a voyage, we were told, enough to pay for the whole ship. There were hundreds of them, As time went by and von Tirpitz got busy, we were only too glad that, on the advice of Lord Maclay, we had brought these ships into our service.<\/p><p>At that time Sir Josiah Stamp was at the Inland Revenue. He furnished us with a statement of their profits, and it is the lesson of these that I wish to bring before the House. In the first 26 months of the War, with insurance at pre-War values, owners of ocean tramps netted a profit of &#163;135,000,000; and it was estimated that the shipowners' cargo and passenger liners in the first 26 months of the War, even allowing for insurance at inflated values, had netted no less than &#163;300,000,000 of profit. It was not until after we had snatched the ships from the greedy hands of their owners that the nation was made more certain of being able to survive.<\/p><p>It is right to remember this lesson when we are asked to hand millions of public money into this kind of charge, and to remember too that it was this section of shipping which was the greatest culprit in 1917. They were the men who were preventing their ships, hundreds of them, from ever coming to a British port, while the nation was periously short of food. What was the seamen's record at that time, the record of the men who are left out of account altogether? What did they do? There is not a Member anywhere in the House who would not pay tribute to what they did. It was their endurance and heroism that saved the nation. They were not asking for profit, and they are entitled to be safeguarded now. There would be no difficulty in doing it. Every public authority has a fair wages clause in its contracts. There is nothing fresh in it. It would be perfectly easy to put such a Clause into this Bill and to get a composite body arranged which would devise fair and just conditions.<\/p><p>Some very startling statements were given last week on the subject of the manning of our ships and the displacement of domiciled British sailors by non-domiciled British sailors or by aliens. In his reply, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade rather questioned some of the figures. For that reason, I and others have given a good deal of time since then to an investigation of the facts, as far as we were able to do so. We got into contact with the Seamen's Union, who are in daily touch with what is happening. There is undoubtedly proceeding, especially in certain lines trading East, a considerable displacement of British sailors, either by aliens or by non-domiciled British seamen. I have here a letter which I will hand over to the President of the Board of Trade, because I cannot express any opinion upon it first-hand. It gives a detailed statement as to the name, etc., of a Chinese agent in Rotterdam who at this moment is arranging for the transfer of 15 Chinamen from Rotterdam to Liverpool to be put on a British ship. It would appear from this letter and from other information that the regulations as to alien immigrants are being very largely lost sight of. I have chapter and verse. I suggest that the right hon. Gentleman should have the matter investigated by an impartial body, and see to what extent British seamen are being displaced, by various subterfuges, by men of other nationalities, mainly of course because those other men are paid lower wages.<\/p><p>When you come to examine this matter, the number of Chinamen who were born in Hong Kong is perfectly staggering. Every Arab who wants to join a ship seems to have been born in Aden. So it goes on. There are a great many British ships which have got such crews are under the British flag, and are getting all the benefit of our consuls and all the services that we pay for, and they have not a Britisher of any sort serving upon them. I have here the details of a number of cases. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will have some of these cases investigated. Here is a ship, a British-owned ship under the British flag, the \"Horus.\" It is owned by the Maritime Transport Company, of 36, Camomile Stret, E.C. Here are the names of every one of her crew. They are mainly Italian, and I do not profess to be able to pro-\nnounce their names, but there is not a Britisher among them.<\/p><p>Here is another ship which is owned by a British firm and registered here and on that ship no fewer than six nationalities are represented. I have here a list of their wages. I will pass over these details to the right hon. Gentleman if he wants them. On this particular ship the master is Giovanni Pidatelli whose wages are not stated. The mate is Furroccio Frizzi who was receiving &#163;7 14s. per month instead of the Maritime Board's rate of &#163;16. The boatswain Andrea Apostolov, a Rumanian, was paid &#163;5 10s. instead of &#163;13 1s. and so it goes on through the whole lot&#8212;Rumanians, Italians, Russians, Yugoslavs and the rest of them. We are entitled when we are voting a subsidy for British shipping to be assured that there is a fair proportion of British-born sailors employed on the ships. It is not much to ask and I suggest that the hon. Gentleman who replied last week was not fully informed and that this information, which we investigated with great care before I ventured to make these statements, is correct information. At all events, whatever may happen under this glorious system of private enterprise we are entitled when we are spending &#163;2,000,000 of public money to see that the kind of ship which I have described is not the kind of ship on which the money is to be spent.<\/p><p>There is one other thing which I will ask the right hon. Gentleman and his Department to take into account. The House will remember that I asked him to say what he meant by modernisation. He told us that he meant certain kinds of improvements in machinery and so forth but he did not say anything at all about the accommodation for the seamen. I would like to pay a tribute to the improved standard of accommodation which Lord Maclay introduced into many of our ships. Some of the tramp steamers have always been the worst in this respect, and I have collected some information on this point which I shall venture to give to the House. In connection therewith, I am glad to see that the Lord President of the Council has been good enough to come here, because I have here a reference to a promise which he made when he was President of the Board of\nTrade. I see that in 1906 a special committee of the London Port Sanitary Authority specified certain conditions which should apply to the provision of accommodation on board ship. There were nine suggestions and I shall not repeat them all, but they related to such matters as living quarters, ventilation, accommodation for food and so forth. Of those nine suggestions only one has been fully carried out which is the provision of the cubic space per man recommended. Two others, namely, those relating to a separate room for messing and crews being berthed aft, were included in the standard ship which Lord Maclay encouraged. The rest of the provisions are as yet not adopted.<\/p><p>Here is a description, not by a landlubber such as the hon. Gentleman opposite told us we ought to avoid, but by a sailor. Incidentally I must plead guilty to being a \"landlubber,\" but I would point out that it is the landlubbers who are finding this money, and it is quite seemly that they should have a say as to how it is to be spent. This is a description by Rear-Admiral Boyle Somerville who is not a landlubber anyhow. It is a description of a ship of the better type, a ship that was taken over to be adapted during the war. The Rear-Admiral was doing the usual Sunday round, which is the established practice in the Navy and this is his account in Blackwood's Magazine of February, 1920, of what he found on this ship:\n<q>The first and worst and rudest shock reached us all on the first Sunday on which we went 'rounds' of the living quarters allotted to the deck hands and firemen of the ship's original crew. All of the men who would 'join up' for temporary service in the war had been taken over, together with their ships&#8230;and we saw them in their native and accustomed haunts&#8230;We were conducted into the very 'eyes' of the ship&#8212;to the forecastle and the narrow depths beneath it, to the part which in the great Atlantic liners dips, shuddering, into the monstrous head seas; bears on its front the first and worst of the furious impact &#8230;<\/q><q>No place this at any time for men;<\/q>\nThis is not from a landlubber, but from a life-long sailor&#8212;\n<q>but especially not for men tired out in long watches below among the boilers or on deck &#8230; Yet this was the region allotted to the crew, squeezed here into the least possible area by the greedy owners of the ship\"&#8212;<\/q>\nThis is a British Admiral&#8212;\n<q>so as to permit of more space elsewhere. The word 'Bolshevik\" had not at that period of the war been invented; but that is what we felt like when we entered those quarters.<\/q>\nThere is much more that is worse which I could quote, were it not that I think I have given the House a fair sample. There is another circumstance which arises out of this defective accommodation and that is its effect upon the health of the crews. Some very startling figures emerge from an examination of the records of the health of merchant seamen. I have spent a little time looking into the statistics relating to mortality in the mercantile marine issued by the Board of Trade in 1932. The number of seamen who died in that year was 3,166, and of these only 642 were \"occupied\" seamen. That seems a relatively small proportion, but when we look a little further into the matter it turns out that no less than 625 men of those not returned as occupied died within 12 months of leaving the Service and 295 died within three months of retirement. In other words, they left to die. We find that 20 per cent. of the total deaths were of men who died within a year of leaving the Service. I notice that there is a staggering record of mortality from tuberculosis and other respiratory diseases. No less than 611 out of 3,000 died from those causes, and, of course, that is associated with the kind of accommodation which Admiral Somerville described. It is the inevitable result of such conditions, and when we give a subsidy of &#163;l0,000,000 for building more ships we are entitled to secure that men shall not be subject to the sort of accommodation on them which gives those results. I am well aware that we cannot do impossible things with ships that are on the sea, but we can at least make provision with regard to the ships that are to be built. In this connection I will ask the House to refer to two expressions used by the hon. Member in his reply last week, because it is that that we are challenging to-day. He said:\n<q>What I am saying is that the grant or refusal of a subsidy has nothing to do with the men or officers being entitled to have the rate of wages laid down and declared by the National Maritime Board.<\/q>\nHe was quite frank about it, and I honour him for being frank. He went on:\n<q>I am pointing out that it is not a relevant consideration on the question of the grant or refusal of a subsidy to discuss wages, which are already dealt with in the industry by the appropriate machinery.<\/q>\nWe say that it ought to be a relevant consideration. We differ fundamentally.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I will come to the points in regard to foreign sailors in a moment. It is quite irrelevant to the point that I am making. But I should\nlike to ask in return: Do hon. Members opposite really want to nationalise the shipping industry to-day? Do they think it would be good for the nation? If they do, they will put a very largely increased burden on the backs of the taxpayers. It may be that to-day shipowners are coming to the House and asking for &#163;2,000,000, if you like to bolster private enterprise, although it is through no fault of their own but by reason of the action of other nations that they are having to make that request. If the industry is nationalised, it will not be a question of &#163;2,000,000 but of &#163;20,000,000 or &#163;200,000,000 to bolster up the inefficient management which is bound to be the result of State ownership.<\/p><p>In speaking of the losses which shipowners have made recently, I am reminded of statements which I have heard with regard to the War profits of shipowners. I am certainly not going to deny that the profits of shipowners were large during the War, but I am certain that they are greatly over-estimated in the popular mind. No fleet was so completely controlled as was the British mercantile marine, no fleet suffered greater losses, and, where profits were high, a very large percentage of the profits was taken through Excess Profit Duty. Even in spite of those restrictions and that high taxation, there is no doubt that those who sold their fleets at the boom period that followed the War sold out at enormous figures. They finished with the industry. But the story is very different in the case of those who not only hung on to what ships remained but made some effort to replace ships that had been lost. Long ago, any profits that were made during the War have gone. Many shipping firms which were in business have gone bankrupt during the last few years, and I do not believe that there is any shipping firm in existence which is any better as the result of large profits made during the War. Their position would be infinitely better to-day if they had been able to go on at the level of profits which they were making from 1900 to 1914, and there had been no disturbing influence of either War, the boom period or the slump that followed.<\/p><p>With regard to the question of wages, as in the case of coal, British shipowners are open to the competition of the world, and, however much we may desire to raise\nwages, it would actually be a fatal policy to the wage earners themselves if we raised them beyond a certain level. It is always possible to argue that whatever level you reach is either too high or too low, but I can assure the House, and hon. Members opposite in particular, that, allowing for differences in the value of exchange, the British rate of wage is the highest in the world, and, even when exchanges are not taken into account, there are only two nations, neither of which has a mercantile marine anything like as large as we have, which pay higher wages. There is a very large number of nations which pay wages less than half those paid to British seamen. This &#163;2,000,000 will not bring great wealth to tramp shipowners. The National Maritime Board for the last 15 years has worked in a splendid spirit of mutual conciliation, and the House may rest assured that this wage fixing machinery, which has worked so well in the past, will work equally well in the future.<\/p><p>I hoped that when the hon. Member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood) spoke he would give me instances, as he promised, which would give some foundation in fact for the ridiculous statements made in the circular which I received this morning. It was sent by the Trade Union Parliamentary Committee to the shipping and water-side industries. To read it, you would think that the conditions on British ships were intolerable both for sailors and firemen, that their work was nothing more nor less than sweated labour, that men on board every British ship lived in pigsties. That simply is not true. The conditions on British ships in every respect are second to none in the world. I am not going to say that a ship built 30 years ago but still running comes up to present day standards. It does not any more than houses built 300 years ago come up to present standards. The sentences to which I should like to draw the attention of the House are that\n<q>the decisions of the National Maritime Board are being flouted.<\/q>\nIf they are being flouted, it is the duty of hon. Members opposite, if they know of actual cases, to give the widest publicity to those cases. It is no good the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Greenwood) coming here\nand making general statements of this sort. It says that\n<q>alien seamen in great numbers are being employed.<\/q>\nI have looked up the figures, and I find the alien seamen who are employed are.actually 2 per cent. of the whole and that this figure includes foreign stewards which owners are forced to take on board some ships which carry emigrants; for instance, from Europe to the United States. That figure also includes alien seamen on ships working permanently in the Far East where all other British firms, not only shipping firms but firms operating on land, employ a certain number of foreigners. Where a ship is working between Hong Kong and Shanghai for its whole working life a certain number of Chinamen are included in the crew. I am bound to say that this is something of which I have very little experience. Every case quoted this afternoon has been the case of a, liner, and, in point of fact, none of the provisions affect liners in any way. If there are any allegations of breaking agreements in connection with granting a subsidy to tramp shipping, it would be better if the faults on the part of tramp owners and not liner owners were brought before the House. This document also says:\n<q>While many vessels are seriously undermanned, the accommodation provided is frequently of the meanest.<\/q>\nThose are points with which I have tried very briefly to deal, and neither statement is generally true. The more publicity that can be obtained for the cases which are true the better. I can assure the House that it is the constant desire of shipowners, consistent with the present state of affairs when very heavy losses are being sustained, to build as comfortable ships, to give as good a rate of victualling and to pay as high a rate of wages as is possible.<\/p>",

I think it would be infinitely better if Germany were to state specifically what she is spending and let us know, but the hon. Member must also realise how difficult it is. There is no doubt at ail about her building up an army, of her conversion of the 100,000 long-service army to a 300,000 short-service army, which is of course a breach of the Treaty. Everyone knows she is doing that. It is thoroughly well known, but if Germany were officially to avow it, were officially to give the figures, the difficulty would be that France would then be confronted with what appeared to be a challenge. I do not believe French statesmen want trouble; in fact, I am perfectly certain they do not. I believe the vast majority of the people of France are pacific, but there is no one who knows better than the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary that there are powerful elements in France who say that war is inevitable, and that it would be far better to take it now before Germany arms. If you get Germany giving these facts officially, which would he an exposure of a breach of the Treaty, I should not envy the position of the French Prime Minister in those circumstances. Therefore, I am not at all sure whether it is advisable to press them, inasmuch as the right hon. Gentleman knows quite well that on the whole we know the facts.<\/p><p>May I just come back to the question of air. What really matters with regard to air is the power of rapid expansion. The right hon. Gentleman has given us figures of hundreds here and hundreds there. That is not the real peril; that is not the real method of assessing the peril. When you come to a war basis, it has little reference to your peace establishments. It is the reserves of every country that matter. My right hon. Friend pointed out that the surprise at the beginning of the War was the French reserves. I do not know what army figures are quoted; they vary according to the purpose, say, half-a-million, or it is sometimes put at 600,000. That does not represent the army of France. If there were a war France would have over 4,000,000 of trained men in reserve, every one of them trained, every one of them with a rifle there ready, with formations of machine guns and their complement of machine guns, light and heavy artil-\nlery, tanks, aeroplanes, everything that would enable France to bring an army of millions into the field. I would say that France is better equipped for a great war at this moment than in 1914. It is the reserves that matter. That is why I would advise no one to look at the League of Nations book on armaments. It is stuffed with the kind of information that nations think they can impart, and conceals all the information that matters.<\/p><p>Germany is not the only country that has a cloak between realities and the published facts. It is the same thing with regard to our Navy. Anybody who knows realises what immense reserves we have in our sailors and fishermen who made their contribution to the winning of the War. That is our great reserve. The question is whether you have got available the same kind of reserve here when you come to the air. My right hon. Friend says that Germany is working up her reserves, which is a more formidable fact than the few hundred aeroplanes which she has. Why is she doing it? Because she is developing her civil air force, her commercial air lines. Why do not we do it f know the answer given is that we have not the distances. There are three things that matter; one is the machine&#8212;you should have machinery ready, though it is not the deadly thing&#8212;you should have mechanics which means three years' training, and you should have the pilots. All these reserves you could have had, and you could have if you developed your commercial air lines not only in this country but in the Empire. Distances are short here, and you do not want high speed machines to carry you to Birmingham, Bewdley or even Criccieth, to which as a matter of fact you could get in a high speed plane in an hour. In Karachi, Rangoon, Singapore, Hong Kong, Melbourne, Capetown and Montreal, you have every reason for developing a great commercial air service, for bringing our Empire together. I think the Government could spend more usefully in many ways by developing a system like that. There you would have your mechanics which would have to be provided; there you would have your pilots. I do not say that there you would have your machines, because that must not be discussed. At any rate, I leave it there. In the matter of air\nservice, I would recall a famous phrase of the late Mr. Joseph Chamberlain: Let the Government think Imperially.\"<\/p><p>I would have liked to venture to throw out a suggestion that you should utilise your territorial system more for developing your air system. Thousands of very venturesome young men would be only too delighted to be trained to be available for any emergency that arises. But this brings me to what I consider the most important consideration&#8212;that armaments depend on policy. There can be no doubt as to the terrible devastation that could be wrought in the event of a war by attack from the air. I do not agree that whatever precautions you take you can escape it. There is a terrible menace about which I have heard little discussion. If the merchant marine were attacked by submarines during the War, to what extent would they be damaged by attacks from the air? That is a problem which ought to be considered. There are ways of meeting this form of attack; myself I would put two or three suggestions before a committee. Though I think it would be most difficult, I think it could be met. But it all depends on your policy. If the menace is in Europe, you may say that the air is most important; if the menace is in the Pacific, it is a naval question. Therefore, what are your armaments going to be? The direction in which you develop depends on what your policy is in Europe and in Asia.<\/p><p>There are two dominating paramount questions upon which the whole problem of disarmament turns. One is that Germany is a distracting force and is one of the most powerful people the world has ever seen&#8212;highly trained and with a genius for war. The other is the Pacific. These two problems are paralysing every effort for disarmament. The right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister went about 18 months ago to Geneva with a project for disarmament. It was a practical and concrete proposal, which, if it had been accepted, would have advanced the whole question of disarmament several stages. It would have been a beginning, but it was a hopeless task because there were unavowed things behind.<\/p><p>What is happening at the present moment? I want to speak with great reticence because that Conference is still proceeding, and I should be sorry to say\nanything that would add the slightest to the difficulties of the Government. There are certain things which are obvious. Japan is demanding equality with Great Britain and the United States. If the Conference fails&#8212;and everybody must earnestly hope that it will not&#8212;there is no doubt that there must be the same old competition in the construction of ships. Take Europe. France is increasing her armaments enormously. Germany is rearming. France is increasing armaments because Germany is rearming. Germany is rearming because France is increasing instead of decreasing as she promised. Here are we discussing the question of increasing our armament's again for exactly the same reason. You must deal with the problem itself before you can handle disarmament. There is more security in disarmament than in rearmament. The building of the Dreadnoughts is the best proof of that. We had complete security. Then we built a Dreadnought, and instantly began the great competitive building which had the effect of disturbing everybody. It was the costliest and silliest ramp in history. We must avoid that.<\/p><p>The Lord President of the Council made an appeal to Germany. It was eloquent, moving, and, I think, kindly and sympathetic. Could he not extend that appeal to other countries? Is there no other country to whom an appeal of that kind might be addressed? It is difficult to put the German case at the moment, because the German Government have for the last 18 months been doing their best to work up a bad Press against themselves. It has offended every kind of sentiment&#8212;Jew and Gentile, Protestant and Catholic, Communist, Socialist, trade unionist, the Constitutionalists who believe in constitutional government and in law and order, and those with Liberal sympathies. There is no sentiment which they do not seem to have set themselves to exasperate and outrage. The right hon. Gentleman used the word \"revolution\" in reference to what has happened in Germany. I think it is the right word. It is a revolutionary temper, and a revolutionary temper is the temper of a fever, and a fever-stricken person is not an easy neighbour. He is not normal for the time being. But a revolutionary country is a very dangerous country to treat as a pariah. Europe discovered\nthat with the French at the end of the eighteenth century, and although the outrages in Germany this year have offended every sense of decency they were no worse than the September Massacres, which drove us to a war which lasted 21 years.<\/p><p>You want time for them to calm down, and meanwhile, let us make it clear to them that we mean to give fair, impartial and judicial consideration to their grievance. What is it? It is that they were promised solemnly by the signatories of the Treaty of Versailles that if they disarmed the rest would follow suit. That was the promise. For 14 years they waited for a redemption. They had a succession of the most pacific Ministers in the world&#8212;Ebert, Stresemann, Rathenau, who was assassinated very largely because of his pacific views, and, one of the best, Braining. They entreated the great Powers to begin redeeming their bond. They were mocked by a succession of pacts and pacts outlawing war, and meanwhile every country except Britain increased its armaments, piling on guns and reserves, and money was lent to Germany's neighbours to build up formidable armies right on her frontier. Can you wonder that at last they were driven into revolution, driven into this revolt against what they regarded, and which I cannot call by any other name, as this chronic deception of the great countries? You must put that right. You will never get disarmament in Europe until you do it. Do not forget what General Smuts said in that remarkable speech the other day, that Germany is very largely the key of our difficulties in the East. We failed very largely there because Europe had its attention so diverted and concentrated on the German difficulties that it did not feel free to handle that proposition as a body.<\/p><p>Just think for a moment what has happened with Russia. It is full of meaning. It is a great lesson. It is a tragedy which has ended in one of the greatest and most joyous comedies in history. I remember very well when the Russian army was a mere rabble, ill equipped, and yet all Europe was trembling. It was just imagining hoards of Lenin's banditti tearing down and trampling over Europe. There has been no feeling like it since the days of Attila and the Roman Empire. They invaded Poland\nand they came within a few miles of Warsaw, but could not get any farther because they had no wagons. They had no equipment. Now they have equipment. In the French Chamber the other day the Rapporteur of the Army Commission said that Russia had one of the finest armies in the world and that their air force was the best in the world. Was there a shudder? Not at all. The whole French Chamber burst into acclamations. Russia, they said, the hope of the world. The Russian army, with its terrible air force, its fine equipment, the guarantee of peace, good order&#8212;and property. It is infinitely the best army they have had in equipment, in training; still more, they have a better transport, which is where they broke down before. In addition to that, they have developed their manufacturing capacity in such a way that if there were a war they could supply unlimited munitions for themselves. Russia is Communist at this hour.<\/p><p>This gentleman from the right who made the speech the other day hailed Russia as the deliverer. He saw Communist Russia on the one hand and poor Germany on the other, violently anti-Communist, with its Communist leaders in gaol and scattered, and their newspapers suppressed and everything done that we could do under a Sedition Act in this country by a stroke of the pen. He saw immense Russia standing large over anti-Communist Germany. It was not merely France that welcomed it. I was very sorry to see that my right hon. Friend had fallen from grace and also welcomed it&#8212;that Russia was coming to the aid of the peace of Europe.<\/p>",

This arrangement, coupled with the adoption of a system of grilles on board, has been in operation since 1930 and has worked satisfactorily. Hitherto, it has been confined to ships trading to southern Chinese waters and has not as yet been extended to ships trading to Northern China, since they have not up to now been subject to this form of attack, but I see no reason why this or some similar arrangement should not be adopted in their case also. Before 1930, as a temporary arrangement pending the introduction of police guards, naval or military guards were supplied. The re-introduction of such guards as a regular arrangement is not considered to be necessary, but the local naval and military authorities are fully alive to the possibility that the provision of such guards may be necessary in special emergencies, and I understand that a military guard has in fact been supplied\nto a passenger steamer which left Shanghai for northern ports on the 19th June.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I beg to move, \"That Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair.\"<\/p><p>A few weeks ago I was asked at Question Time to explain the reasons for which the British Army existed. I declined at that time to answer that question, but, in reply to a supplementary question, I said that I would endeavour to deal with it when I came to speak upon the Army Estimates. Certainly it would be a good thing to preface my remarks this evening by clearing our minds as to the reasons for which the Army exists. To-day we are going to vote money to pay for the Army, and it would obviously be undesirable that we should pay for anything the reasons for the existence of which we were not clear about. In my opinion, the Army exists for four different, separate, and specific purposes. If I enumerate those purposes, I wish to make it plain that they are not counted in order of merit, because they are all equally important. The four corners of a house are all equally important to the maintenance of the structure. If one of them falls down the whole building collapses in ruin, and, equally, if the Army fails to fulfil any one of the four purposes for which it exists, then the British Empire itself is in danger of collapse.<\/p><p>One of the first purposes which the Army is there to perform is the protection of our naval bases. It is true that the British Empire depends upon sea power. I do not think that my friends from the Admiralty will be offended if I say that the Navy itself depends to some extent upon land forces. Ships cannot be at sea all the time. They have to come into harbour. They have to be assured of reception, of fuel, of safety all the time, and the means for refitting and refuelling; and those bases to which they return must be protected from land\nattack. And so, just as the Empire is held together by the protection which our Navy affords to our trade routes, just as those trade routes are like the invisible steel girders which hold together a great edifice, so those harbours, to which they are obliged to come from time to time, and which are protected by British soldiers, form the joints and the hinges of the vast structure of the British Empire.<\/p><p>Too little is known about this great work which the Army annually performs. Every year the troopships go out unannounced, unostentatiously, without any public manifestation of the vital work which they are carrying on. They stop first at Gibraltar, the gateway of the Mediterranean. Two battalions are left there. They pass on to Malta, in the very centre of that great sea. Again, two more battalions form the garrison. The normal garrison is four, but two battalions are engaged at present in Palestine. They pass on to Egypt and the Sudan, where there are only seven battalions, from whom a small contingent is stationed in the Island of Cyprus, down through the Suez Canal, through the Red Sea, emerging into the Indian Ocean at Aden, which is another vital point, where there is a garrison of some 200 men. Thousands of miles to the South&#8212;in the same Indian Ocean&#8212;lies the Island of Mauritius, where there is yet a smaller garrison of British troops. Continuing eastward we come to the subcontinent of India and the Island of Ceylon&#8212;there again there are ports of vital importance&#8212;and, further East, to Malaya, where again one battalion only is left, and so on to China, where at Hong Kong and other stations five battalions are distributed. There we return and begin the process of coming back bringing home the soldiers who have been relieved. Even then they have not completed the orbit of the British Empire, for on the other side of the Pacific Ocean there is yet one more battalion guarding our possessions in the Western Hemisphere at Jamaica and Bermuda. That is one only of the purposes for which the Army exists and is carrying out all the time.<\/p><p>Another purpose for which the Army exists is the defence of certain frontiers and the maintenance of order in certain\nterritories where we have undertaken a serious obligation. By far the most important of these is India. In comparison with the size of our Army, India occupies an enormous proportion of our forces, but in comparison with the size of the native population and the work they have to do, the number of troops there is infinitesimally small. In Egypt and the Sudan there are battalions to protect those countries, and they are responsible also for the protection of the Suez Canal, that vital link between our eastern and our western Empire. In Palestine there are, as I have already said, two battalions. Here I might remind the House that in 1929 there was disorder in Palestine, riots occurred and the whole matter was inquired into, and when the report was made to the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of Nations this country was censured for not maintaining more troops in Palestine than we were maintaining at that time. We probably hold the unique privilege among the nations of the world as being the only country that has ever been blamed by the League of Nations for not maintaining adequate armed forces.<\/p><p>Thirdly, the Army exists to protect this country. When I say \"thirdly,\" I should like to emphasise the warning that I gave at the beginning of my speech that I am not enumerating the purposes of the Army in the order of their importance. There is, obviously, nothing of greater importance than the protection of our own homes, the great reserve of the Empire, the arsenal of the Empire and the centre and heart of it. In addition to the three great purposes which I have already mentioned, we have to provide a force which may be called upon to defend the interests of the Empire outside these shores, perhaps in Imperial territory, perhaps in some foreign land; a force which may be called upon to fight in a country which nobody can foretell and under conditions which nobody can foresee. When we read, in the Press and elsewhere, criticisms of the British Army, they are nearly always based upon a view which regards the Army as existing for one only of these four purposes, not remembering the other three, and the last purpose that I have mentioned is the one that is usually uppermost in the minds of the critics. They nearly always write as though the Army existed only to fight a war with a great civilised Power, of which the first\nbattle would be fought upon Salisbury Plain one day next week.<\/p><p>Let me deal with the various purposes for which the Army exists and in the order that I have enumerated. First of all, there is the protection of naval bases. We are this year spending an additional &#163;450,000 in providing works and buildings at Singapore. The desirability of having a naval base at Singapore is not a matter which we can discuss this afternoon. It has already been settled earlier this week and has been approved by the House. If you have a naval base, you must have troops there to protect it. You need antiaircraft, artillery and men to man the artillery. You also need barracks and houses, buildings of various kinds, schools and other places which the men will require. Upon these things we are spending a comparatively large sum in the present year.<\/p><p>With regard to the movement of troops from place to place, we occasionally meet with criticism. We are asked: \"Would it not be better, instead of continually moving the troops, to leave them in one place until they come home again?\" That is not an unnatural criticism to spring to the mind, but it is not a good thing for one unit to remain in one place. They may get to think that it is the only place in the world or, on the other hand, the climate may not be suitable for a long stay. More important still is the fact that our Army has to be trained for every need, and, seeing that at many of the stations I have mentioned, there are only small contingents of troops they cannot enjoy the training which they require and they cannot have an opportunity of training on a large scale. For that reason, it is essential, if the Army is to serve every purpose for which it exists, that we should be continually moving troops from one place to another. It would be so much simpler if we could have a large number of armies to carry out different jobs.<\/p><p>There are some individuals who are so fortunate as to be able to afford four motor cars, one for London, another for the country, a third for carrying heavy luggage, and a fourth, a little car, perhaps for work on a farm or some other specific purpose. Those individuals are as fortunate as they are few. A large number of people can afford to have one car, and when they buy it they have to\nbear in mind the many purposes for which they may need it, and the result is a compromise. They buy a ear which is not ideally suited to any one purpose, but which, on the whole, will best suit the various purposes for which they may be called upon to use it. In the same way, if we were a country of unlimited means in wealth, in man power, and in material, it would be very convenient to have four armies, one for each of the purposes I have described, but we can only have one Army and that one Army has to be designed on the basis of compromise, with the idea that it has to fulfil all the four purposes for which it is designed.<\/p><p>When we have a small body of troops in a small station far away, we have to remember that that unit may one day be called upon to do exactly the same duty as another unit which is enjoying the best of training at Aldershot, in India or elsewhere, and therefore we cannot always leave that unit in one place. The movement of troops is necessarily complicated and difficult. It needs a great deal of calculation and hard work. If, for instance, a regiment is moved from the West Indies to Egypt and the troopship happens to call for a few hours in a British port, it seems to sentimental people&#8212;our people, I am glad to say, are mainly sentimental&#8212;a shame that the troops should not be allowed a few days' leave so that they might visit their homes, their native counties, or travel about the country, but if that were allowed it would upset the whole trooping programme at the expense of the taxpayer&#8212;although our people are sentimental, they are not very fond of paying taxes, and, although they are continually complaining about necessary expenditure, they are always urging it&#8212;it would hold up the ship; it would send the various soldiers who wished to travel across the length and breadth of England to their homes; it would send them away from their regiment for a few days, while the majority probably would not want to travel and would not want to spend their money in that way; and at the end it would always be possible that all the men might not rejoin exactly at the moment when the whistle blew, and that some might be left behind, which would be a loss to the taxpayer, to the British Army and to the men themselves.\nBut it would also mean that if that was done once it would have to be done on every occasion, and the only result would be that never again would a ship coming from the West Indies be allowed to touch at an English port, and never again would the soldiers enjoy, as they certainly did on this occasion, owing to the admirable arrangements of the railway companies concerned&#8212;never again would they be allowed to enjoy a few hours with their own friends and relations. It is not the case, as some hon. Members and some writers think, that every man who joins the Army is separated from his wife. Most people know that a percentage of married soldiers are married \"on the strength\" of their regiment, and that they take their wives and families with them wherever they go.<\/p><p>So much for the Army abroad. With regard to the Army at home, I am sorry to say that I can no longer give the House a satisfactory report with regard to recruiting. Recruiting was excellent, or at least satisfactory, up to the end of last September. Since then it has fallen off and fallen off very badly. I would like to make an appeal to Members of the House. I know there are some people who think that we should not have an Army, nor a Navy, nor an Air Force&#8212;nor, of course, an Empire either, for we cannot have that without the others&#8212;and that we should allow anyone, any foreign country, to interfere with our liberties if they wish. Of course, you must surrender what you cannot defend. But I do not think that that view is held largely in this House. It is a logical view and more comprehensible to my mind than the view of some who recognise the necessity for an Army and a Navy and an Air Force, but who do everything in their power to discourage anyone from joining them.<\/p><p>The right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition, whose prolonged absence from the House and the cause of it we all regret, is one of the principal offenders in this respect. He uses his great influence and eloquence to dissuade people from joining any of the Defence Forces. Perhaps there is still present in the minds of many people who take this attitude, a remnant of the old belief that the Army is not a career for a respectable man. We all suffer for the misdeeds of our ancestors. The soldier of the eighteenth and even of the nineteenth\ncentury was a very different individual from the soldier of to-day. Wellington, whose armies performed such remarkable feats, used the most scathing language in which to describe the character of the men he led. But the modern soldier is a different man. He is not the hard-drinking ne'er-do-well of the past.<\/p><p>I suggest to hon. Members that in these days, when so many boys are faced, almost on leaving school, with the prospect of going straight into the melancholy and tragic army of the unemployed, there still exists a splendid alternative, and that the Army provides a career which any man ought to be glad to see his son embrace. Look at the figures accompanying the Estimates. See how the figures for crime, for instance, that is to say offences against the military code, have fallen. And this is only a continuation of a prolonged decline. The figure is the lowest yet reached. At the same time we see the figures of health better than they have ever been. That applies not only to the Army in England but to the Army in India and abroad. It is quite wrong and misleading to suggest that young men entering the Army and going to India put themselves into any peril in the way of health. On the contrary, the health of men in the Army is a great deal better than the health of the general population outside the Army.<\/p><p>Then take education. It will be seen from the figures how large a number of private soldiers pass high tests in education to-day. The record with regard to vocational training also shows an improvement. More men are passing through these vocational training centres that give a man during the last six months of his service a chance of learning a trade, so that when he comes to the end of his time he does not become a useless supernumerary in the army of the unemployed, but a man who can earn his living in skilled labour. The number this year shows an improvement; more men have passed through the centres, and the number who have gone straight from the centres to employment has risen from 77 per cent. to 85 per cent. That is a very remarkable improvement even in a year of general improvement.<\/p><p>Hon. Members ought to realise what a good life the Army does provide for a young man. When I am asked, as I so\noften am, to consider what is called compassionate discharge in the case of young men who have joined the Army in a hurry and want to get out, the main consideration which appeals to me in such cases is whether it can be proved that by their discharge their family will materially benefit. So far as the boy himself is concerned, I have not the slightest doubt that in every case he is much better in the Army than out of it, because of the life in the open air, the attention to health, the good food, the exercise, the splendid comradeship and the great traditions. When a soldier leaves the Army he has behind him the support of his regiment or regimental association, to which he can turn in difficulties. I cannot think of a better opening for a young man to-day, if he means to work and to prosper within the Army. I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that any young man joining the Army, even in these hard times, if he is a worker and means to do well, can look forward to a future of complete security.<\/p><p>Having spoken of the men, there is one point in connection with the officers with which I would like to deal. In the Debate last year I was approached by many hon. Members in different parts of the House with a suggestion that it would be a good thing to amalgamate the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich with the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. Again, that is one of the reforms for which on the face of it there is a good deal to be said. The question is asked, \"Why have two institutions when you might have one? You can always economise by combination.\" I undertook on that occasion to have the matter inquired into before I spoke on the Army Estimates again. My Noble Friend the Secretary of State was good enough to set up a committee, of which I was chairman, to inquire primarily into the financial aspect of the question, as to how much money could be saved and as to whether it was feasible. We sat for some time, and we went very carefully into the matter. We visited both institutions and called for reports from both Commandants and asked them to give evidence, before us.<\/p><p>Let me say here how deeply the Army Council deplore the sudden and premature death of General Wagstaff, who was; then at the head of the Royal Military\nAcademy. We finally reported to the Army Council that the scheme was, in the opinion of those best qualified to know, perfectly feasible, and that a very large saving of money would result. The Army Council, having considered the report, decided finally to leave matters as they were. I will not disguise from the House that there is plenty of room for two opinions on this question. There is division of opinion between military authorities as well as between civilians. But I am glad to say that personally I entirely concur in the decision arrived at by the Army Council, and I am very glad to be able to recommend it to this House.<\/p><p>The military argument in favour of the amalgamation was that it is better to produce all your officers of one type, to get them together early, to let them make friends early, not to split them up into separate cliques, to let them know one another, let them start with the same training and the same traditions behind them. That seems to me rather more a military argument from the drill sergeant's point of view than from the civilian point of view. By the drill sergeant I mean the military class which does always exist, based largely upon uniform, wishing to see uniformity in everything, everybody doing things at the same time and in the same way. I think, on the other hand, that it is a good thing to have officers of as many different types as possible, of as many different traditions, brought up under as many different systems. Not only does that inspire a friendly and useful spirit of emulation, but variety in itself is a good thing.<\/p><p>When I look into the records of recent years I find rather striking confirmation of my opinion. Take six of the most distinguished field-marshals who have died in the present century. You will find a very great difference in the education which they had before they went into the Army. Take, first, Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener. One went to Sandhurst and the other to Woolwich. Lord Haig took a degree at Oxford before he went for a short period to Sandhurst. Sir Henry Wilson failed to get into either Sandhurst or Woolwich, but passed into the Army through the Militia. Lord French started as a cadet in the \"Britannia\" and went straight from that training to his regiment. Sir\nWilliam Robertson rose from the ranks. Those facts are rather interesting as showing that field-marshals do not always come from the same origin.<\/p><p>A stronger argument for the decision of the Army Council is this, in my opinion: The type of education at Woolwich is admittedly higher than that at Sandhurst. It is no reflection on Sandhurst to say so, because the branches of the Service for which Woolwich prepares cadets, demands greater technical knowledge than is required in the cavalry and infantry. The proportion of instructors to cadets is larger at Woolwich than at Sandhurst, and the classes therefore are smaller. If you amalgamated the two and, as was proposed, slightly increased the ratio of instructors to cadets at Sandhurst, even though it might be possible slightly to raise the level at Sandhurst, it is really unarguable that you would be obliged slightly to reduce the level of education of the Woolwich cadets. In these days, in military affairs nothing can be of greater importance than the education of officers. Slightly to lower the level of education of the officers of Artillery and Engineers&#8212;that idea alone would seem to be a conclusive argument against the amalgamation.<\/p><p>There is one other argument, for which I do not apologise. After all, the British Army is built up on tradition, which not even Governments can create. It takes years, generations and centuries. For 200 years the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich has been in being. If anybody has any doubt about the strength of the tradition which hangs about that place they have only to walk into it and they will feel it immediately. They have only to look at the names on the wall, where they will see the names of the same family, generation after generation, who have been to the Academy, and an old official will probably show the book in which the misdeeds of General Gordon as a cadet are recorded. All over the world, British officers look back to Woolwich with the affection with which a man looks back to his home or his school. No doubt a strong case can be made out on the grounds of economy for amalgamating Eton College and Harrow School&#8212;[An HON. MEMBER: \"Withdraw.\"]&#8212;but, however strong that case might be, there would be Old Etonians and Old Harrovians who would be blind to all the advantages and who, owing\nto narrow prejudices perhaps, would prefer to keep to themselves. The same is true of Woolwich. I am a Conservative, but there is, I think, one conservative principle which many who are not Conservatives will support, and that is that if there is one thing worth preserving and conserving, it is an ancient, honourable and useful tradition. Places like Woolwich are the shrines of such traditions and I hope that I may never be instrumental in destroying such a tradition or such a shrine.<\/p><p>I come to the defence of these Islands, the third of the purposes for which the British Army exists. The House is aware that the coast defence of Great Britain has been handed over to the Territorial Army. The Territorial Army suffered severely from the decision in 1931 to go without camps for one year. It saved the country nearly &#163;1,000,000. It was realised that it would affect badly recruiting for the Territorial Army, but perhaps it was hardly realised how great a blow it would strike to the sense which the Territorial Army have as to their importance to the country. That has always been the danger. Just as the regular soldier suffers from the traditions of his ancestors, so does the Territorial suffer from his traditions. There was always associated with the Volunteers a certain spirit of comradeship, and in some people's minds there still remains the idea that the Territorial Army, upon whom a great deal of ridicule was heaped when they came into existence, at their best are only a lot of jolly fellows playing at soldiers during the summer months.<\/p><p>I want to get rid of that impression once and for all, and to say to the House that the Territorial Army is just as essential a part of our Defence Forces as the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force, or the Regular Army. By that I mean that we cannot get on without them. If there is no Territorial Army we shall have to review entirely the whole position of our voluntary defence scheme. If that were realised, perhaps more would be done for recruiting all over the country. I appeal to hon. Members to use their influence in their constituencies, and above all with employers of labour, who can do very much to encourage people in setting an example in joining the force. I would press upon hon. Members that the\nTerritorial Army, which is based on patriotism, is the cheapest army in the world, that the country relies upon it, and that if it fails we shall have to resort to some other system which would be less satisfactory and certainly more expensive.<\/p><p>There is one particular branch of the Territorial Army to which I want to refer, and which I think suffers from people not knowing enough about it. I refer to the air defence formations. These formations work in conjunction with the Air Force, and they are primarily designed for the protection of London. There are some people who profess to be both pacifists and patriots, who say they will never join anything which might lead them to take part in an offensive war, but they love their country just as much as their fellow citizens. Here is a unique opportunity for them to prove their sincerity. They are only asked to defend their country. They will never be asked to go overseas or to interfere with anybody else. If people come and attack London, drop bombs on their homes, on their own families, their wives and children, on their own town, they are asked to do their best to destroy that invader. It is interesting work which demands a considerable amount of skill, knowledge and education. The batteries are there, but the numbers of men are short at the present time, and perhaps if more were known about these air defence formations we should get the number of recruits we need.<\/p><p>I have also an announcement to make with regard to the creation of a new branch of the Territorial Army, to be called the Royal Defence Corps. It will be recruited from men who are no longer fit for active service owing to age or some infirmity but who can be used in an emergency to protect vulnerable points in this country from any attack by persons of ill will or foreign agents inside this country. They will be enrolled under the Territorial Association and will not be called upon except in case of an emergency; but they will be under an honourable undertaking to come up when called upon and will receive a bounty of &#163;5, and after that the normal rates of pay. They will relieve active bodies of people who are fit for active service from these duties in case of emergency, fill a gap which has hitherto\nexisted in our defence forces and provide an opportunity for people who are anxious, when an emergency occurs, to help their country but who often complain that their country has no use for them. It will provide them with a valuable service which they can perform in protecting vulnerable points, bridges and railways, and thus set free younger men for more active work.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>In relation to disarmament, and we can see the effect of that mentality in the observation of Herr Frick so frequently quoted by critics in all parts of the world, when he said:\n<q>We admire the League, but we thank Japan for her example.<\/q>\nThat was to say, that the Germans felt that what Japan had been allowed to do was something which Germany ought equally to be allowed to do. Whether that reaction was justified or not, it is not for me to say. I will add this observation from Herr Von Papen who claimed in a speech that since the Covenant had not been applied to Japan it could not be applied against Germany if she rearmed. I merely cite these instances in order to show the effect upon the mentality of other nations.<\/p><p>I think that in general I could summarise the result of the policy of the\nGovernment in this way. I suggest that it might be held that by allowing the Covenant to be violated in Manchuria the National Government have very seriously damaged British interests. The Manchurian market which was capable of very great expansion has been closed to British trade very largely. The Japanese militarists are now openly aiming at securing a similar monopoly in the rest of the Chinese market and have advanced beyond their hopes by their success in Manchuria. Thirdly, I would suggest that the future of the international settlements of Shanghai, and of Hong Kong may be seriously prejudiced as well. The British position there has been based upon international treaties, European prestige and the Chinese fear of European armed forces. But as the restraining power of all these motives has been undermined if not destroyed, and if China should cease to fear Japan, or should decide to ally herself with Japan, the future of the settlements would appear to be extremely precarious. We see something of the reaction of those settlements in the preparation for the defence of British Dominions, especially Australia and elsewhere. I think that the world balance of power, of naval power certainly, is seriously threatened. I understand that the Japanese do not now intend to renew the London and Washington Treaties unless they are granted parity. Great Britain would be hard put to it, I fancy, to stand the pace of competition both in Europe and in the Far East.<\/p><p>Lastly, I submit that owing to the rise of the Hitler movement Europe is now faced with a very real danger of war in which Great Britain might only too easily be involved. We may all draw our own conclusions from those facts, but as to the reasons for the existence of those facts the National Government must take their share&#8212;I am not suggesting more than their share&#8212;of responsibility for that situation. We can have little satisfaction, after all, from a review of the past. Whether the Government have blundered in the past or not cannot help us at this moment. We are concerned with the future. I should like to know from the right hon. Gentleman whether there is any prospect of a re-assembly of the Economic Conference or something akin to it? I saw a paragraph in the Press towards the end of last week&#8212;\nit was only a news paragraph and not official in any way&#8212;to the effect that there was some suggestion that perhaps the United States of America might presently ask for the re-convening of some such conference. I do not know whether there is anything in it or not, but I should be very glad to know what would be the attitude of the Government to the reconvening of the Economic Conference. Whatever we may feel and whatever our differences may be concerning disarmament and other problems relating to it and to international problems generally, we all will admit, I think, that at the bottom economic causes play a very big part in the international unsettlement at this moment.<\/p><p>As to our attitude towards international treaties generally, Members of this House can be divided pretty well into three groups. There are those who are frankly isolationists. I am not of that group, but, if I were an isolationist, I confess that I should be very strongly, and perhaps even enthusiastically, on the side of those demanding better armaments of every sort. I believe that isolationism must necessarily involve that policy in relation to armaments, but as a policy I think that it is impossible. After all, the nature of the Empire makes isolationism a policy thoroughly outside the pale of acceptance. The second alternative is the policy of alliances. That was the old policy in Europe before the War. The grouping of Powers on the one side and the other, each side being attended by vast accumulations of armaments, is the old system which inevitably must lead to war sooner or later.<\/p><p>There are tendencies, it seems to me, in Europe at this moment in the direction of certain groupings. There was a reply given at Question Time to-day to a question put by the hon. Member for East Wolverhampton (Mr. Mander) in relation to Italy, and the same applies there, but I would ask the right hon. Gentleman whether there is any information available as to the purpose of the Conference about to take place in Rome at which representatives of Austria and Hungary are to take part with Signor Mussolini? It is a subject of some importance to us as well as to the rest of the world. The third alternative is that school which believes in pooled security. For my part, I feel compelled to come\ndown upon that side. It was inherent, as I understand it, in the Covenant; it is certainly in the Protocol of 1924. I do not know what the present opinion of the Prime Minister is about the Protocol&#8212;I would not venture even to guess&#8212;but I think that, sooner or later, governments will be compelled to come back, if not fully, at least in part, to some of the ideas contained in the Protocol of 1924.<\/p><p>Lastly, on the question of Russia I believe it is true that at this moment there are no longer any territorial questions outstanding. Are we now to take it that His Majesty's Government are about to work heartily with the Russian Government in the direction of peace and co-operation? I rather like an idea&#8212;I do not say that I commit myself entirely to it, but I was intrigued by it&#8212;which was thrown into the arena, as it were, by hon. Members on more than one side of the House a week or fortnight ago in which a suggestion was made that those nations which are prepared, through the League of Nations, to accept the idea of pooled security, should associate together, and, if I remember rightly, some three or four were cited as likely to associate, namely, Great Britain, the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and, I think one hon. Member said, Sweden. It is just possible that an idea of that kind might even commend itself to France&#8212;I do not know. Anyway, the idea was not developed very fully in the House, but it does seem as though there might be something to be said for availing ourselves of the cooperation of all nations who are prepared to accept collective security. I beg the House to understand that I am not asking for an initial step to create a new alliance&#8212;far from it&#8212;but for leaving the door open to all nations to associate themselves together in the direction of establishing the idea of pooled security in the world.<\/p><p>Lastly, I want to say this about the German position as I see it. Some months ago I ventured to ask the Foreign Secretary what was the attitude of the Government in relation to German equality. For myself, I see no escape from granting equality of status to Germany, but that equality in relation to disarmament can only take one of two forma. Either you must bring down the armaments of other nations steadily, gradually if you like, to the level of Germany,\nand achieve equality in that way, or, if you do not disarm, you must allow Germany to rearm up to the level of other nations. The second alternative would not be disarmament but rearmament, and rearmament is not what the nations of the world desire. I would, therefore, urge upon the Government that no stone should be left unturned in order to give effect to what I conceive to be the real desire of the people of this country, namely, not increased expenditure on armaments, but the actual achievement of a measure of disarmament among the nations of Europe. Surely we ought to be able to look forward confidently to the time when this perpetual divergence of views between Germany and France which is leading almost inevitably to further exacerbation in Europe, should be brought to an end. I was going to suggest that, perhaps, the three rivers, the Rhine, the Seine and the Thames are symbolic of what we would desire in our international relations. Each has different sources. They irrigate different territories; they pass through divergent landscapes, but they pour their waters into the same sea. The ships that ride them carry merchandise over all the world; they make their common contribution to the world's trade. May we not hope that in the near future the great streams of British, French and German culture and ideals, deriving their inspiration from varying sources, and serving peoples of divergent outlook, may also contribute to the great ocean of human activity, wide as the world in its service, and contributing to the happiness and contentment of all mankind?<\/p>",

I do not blame people for making mistakes about this very complicated treaty. I myself was guilty last week of giving a wrong answer to a supplementary question about it. It has been apparent lately that a great many people are under the impression that the Admiralty this year are free, and that the Navy is no longer subject to the many restrictions which are placed upon it by the treaty. This is very far from being the truth, and I shall try to clarify the position, first with regard to the cruisers, as that is the type of vessel about which there is the most controversy. The only restriction from which we are free this year is the one that limits the tonnage laid down since the signing of the treaty, and completed before the end of 1936, to 91,000 tons. This limitation, of course, did apply to the last programme, to 1933, and when, as I explained to the House, it became necessary to increase the size of our larger 6-inch cruisers we had to reduce the number of cruisers in that programme from four to three. Otherwise, the total tonnage to be completed by the end of 1936 would have exceeded the figure allowed to us under the treaty.<\/p><p>That restriction has gone, but two most important restrictions remain. The first is the one that limits the total amount of cruiser tonnage, both under and over age, that we may have at the end of 1936 to 339,000 tons. The other restriction, and this is the one about which there is the most misunderstanding, limits the cruiser tonnage which may be laid down in 1934, 1935 and 1936, to the tonnage becoming over-age in 1937, 1938 and 1939, plus tonnage over-age by the end of 1936 and still in existence.\nThis gives us, as the total tonnage to be laid down for 1934, 1935 and 1936, 86,350 tons. But it is also stipulated in the London Naval Treaty that replacement cruiser tonnage cannot be laid down more than three years before the year in which the tonnage to be replaced becomes over-age. The effect of those two restrictions, which sound rather complicated, is that in 1934, this year, we could lay down 67,350 tons. That is made up of 62,500 tons of tonnage remaining over-age and in existence at the end of 1936, plus one ship of 4,800 odd tons which becomes over-age in 1937. The total cruiser tonnage that we are proposing to lay down this year is about 32,000 tons. This, as the House will see, is a generous third of what we are allowed for the next three years, and this building programme is in accordance with the carefully considered Admiralty policy of replacement, a policy which is designed to pursue a steady annual programme.<\/p><p>A steady annual programme has very many advantages, and to depart from that steady programme would create many difficulties. The two chief difficulties would be the question of manning and the inability to take advantage of the latest development in any ship designed. If we laid down, as we are entitled to this year, 67,350 tons, we should have only 19,000 tons of cruisers for the two following years, 1935 and 1936, and, of course, this allowance would be quite inadequate to allow the Admiralty to pursue their steady replacement programme. Some people may contend that we should use all the replacements to which we are legitimately entitled this year, because they say the Naval Conference, which is to be called next year, in 1935, might break down and might end in disagreement. My answer to that is this: This country has made tremendous reductions in her armaments in trying to bring about a general limitation. People may argue whether that was done rightly or wrongly, but we have done it, and we are still pursuing that end. We have not given up hope, we are still trying, and I think the House will agree with me that it would be quite impossible greatly to extend our cruiser programme this year, on the eve of the Naval Conference, and on the assumption, and only on the assumption, that that Conference is going to break down.<\/p><p>Moreover, as the House well knows, this country has put forward proposals for qualitative disarmament. If those proposals should be successful, or other arrangements be agreed to at next year's Conference, we should be in a very unfavourable position if we had exhausted all the tonnage to which we are legitimately entitled this year, because we should have only 19,000 tons of cruiser tonnage for the next two years, and would be in a very bad position to take advantage of any scheme that may be arranged, and in a bad way to make any start on a new basis that may be adopted. I want to make it perfectly clear to the House that, by the end of 1936, we shall have the full cruiser tonnage that we can have by that date. Included therein will be the full amount of new tonnage which is allowed by the Treaty. As the House will know from my printed statement, our programme includes four cruisers, one of the \"Arethusa\" type of about 5,200 tons, and three of the \"Minotaur\" type of about 9,000 tons.<\/p><p>With regard to destroyers and submarines, the limitations in the London Naval Treaty affecting those two categories are in the main the same as those affecting the cruisers. Here, again, our programme has been based upon a deliberate policy of replacement. We are asking the House to authorise one flotilla leader and eight destroyers, and three submarines, one of which is of the mine-laying class and two of the \"S\" or patrol type. The numbers are the same as in previous years since the Treaty, and they represent the steady annual programme of replacement which best meets our requirements.<\/p><p>It is true that in destroyers we shall be short, by a little over 60,000 tons, of the under-age tonnage that we might have had under the treaty. In regard to submarines we shall only be short of about 4,000 tons of the under-age tonnage that we might have under the treaty. There is no deficiency in the total permitted tonnage in either category. To sum up: By the end of 1936, in all categories we shall have the full tonnage that we are allowed by the treaty.<\/p><p>In regard to aircraft carriers, it has long been recognised that the construction of a vessel of this type could not much longer be delayed. The House is\naware that we in this country were the pioneers in this type of vessel. Of the six aircraft carriers that we possess today, three were experimental types and, according to modern requirements, no longer have the speed necessary for a craft of this sort. Neither have they power to operate the number of aircraft of the modern aircraft carrier. The tonnage of aircraft carriers was limited by the Washington Treaty to 135,000 tons. We have at the moment 115,350 tons, and when the new ship is finished we shall scrap one of the old ones. We shall then still be well within the tonnage allowed in the London Naval Treaty.<\/p><p>The House may be interested to know where the ships of the new programme are to be built. The \"Arethusa\" cruiser will be built at Portsmouth; one \"Minotaur\" and two sloops at Devonport; one \"S\" submarine at Chatham; Malta and Simonstown will have some small craft to build, and the remaining 20 ships and the rest of the small craft will be built by contract. The principal function, as the House well knows, of our dockyards is maintenance and repair. We have a big programme of repair work for the dockyards, and I can assure hon. Members who represent those most important seats that the men in the dockyards will be fully occupied for some time to come.<\/p><p>If I may revert for a moment to the question of submarines, I think that this is the appropriate occasion to inform the House and the Navy of a very important decision which we have come to with regard to saving life from a sunken submarine. After exhaustive and anxious consideration we have come to the conclusion that the raising of a submarine in time to save life by that means is not a feasible operation, and that the only practical as well as the most certain method of saving life is by the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus which is now fitted to all submarines. For the future we propose to rely only on this for saving life. This conclusion was reached only after most careful investigation of all submarine disasters that have occurred in this country and other countries, in the light of the experience gained by the United States naval authorities, who have gone very deeply into the question and in the light of our own experience of the escapes made by means of the Davis gear from the \"Poseidon\" in 1931, and even from the negative results which we\nobtained from the attempted salvage of the M.2 in 1932.<\/p><p>We are fortified in the decision that we have taken because only recently the United Staes have come to exactly the same conclusion and have decided to adopt for the future exactly the same policy as we are going to adopt. Officers and men are all trained in the use of the Davis escape apparatus. There is a tank now at Gosport, one is being built at Hong Kong and a third will be built at Malta. The reason for our decision is that if it was thought by men imprisoned in a sunken submarine that salvage operations were going to be attempted, it might have the very grave effect that the men, although trained in the use of the Davis gear, might postpone using it until they saw the effect of those salvage operations. Waiting for hours, perhaps for days, under most intense strain, might so weaken their strength and their will that eventually they might not be able to make use of that escape gear at all. Escaping by the Davis escape gear is an act which requires great resolution and coolness. It must not be postponed too long if it is to be a success.<\/p><p>Accordingly, we are just about to issue orders to the Fleet that we do not intend for the future to retain a salvage organisation, as we have done in the past, with the object of salvaging submarines only. The existing organisation provides for cruisers and all surface craft available being sent as quickly as possible to the scene of the disaster. We are amplifying those orders by giving instructions that certain signals shall be made to the submarine when the surface craft have located it, and that when the submarine receives those signals the men have to make their escape by the Davis gear, when they can be picked up by the surface craft. The Admiralty have had to face facts in making this decision, and it is a fact that there is no hope of saving life by salvage. We have to make up our minds as to that, and we have come to our decision because we are convinced that it is in the best interests of the personnel of the submarine service.<\/p><p>To turn to a more cheerful subject: one of the most satisfactory features, to my mind, in these Estimates is the increase in Vote A, that is, in the number\nof the personnel of the Navy. Last year I explained from this Box that we had reached the nadir in the numbers of men, and that from that moment the numbers were going to increase. Doubts were cast upon my statement by various news papers&#8212;I do not blame them&#8212;because the method we have of computing Vote A apparently failed to bear it out, but it was true, and this year there is a further increase, the numbers having gone up by 2,057 men. So the curve of the numbers of men is now definitely ascending, and with that curve two other important curves must rise, representing the efficiency of the Service and the comfort of the men.<\/p><p>I should like to tell the House what we have been trying to do to improve the conditions and prospects of men of the lower deck. I have nothing at all spectacular to report, but I cannot help thinking that the cumulative effect of a number of small things we have been able to do in this direction is not inconsiderable. First of all, the increase in Vote A, which will increase what we call our margin, is going to make a great difference in the comfort of the men. It will mean, first of all, that they will not have to be moved about from ship to ship as much as they have been, and, besides that, there will be a better distribution of shore and sea service and foreign and home service. With regard to pay, we have done something in that direction. We came to a decision last year that men entered on the 1919 scale of pay should retain that pay when re-engaging for pension until they got a further rise on the 1925 scale, that is, they should retain their existing rate until they became entitled to a higher rate on the 1925 scale. The same with the pensions of the same men. A decision was also made whereby that part of the pension of such men which is in respect of their first engagement is to be calculated on the scale in operation when they joined the Service. In addition to that, we have recognised the very high qualifications necessary for what we call the communications department, that is, the signal and wireless branches. We have recognised that by giving these men non-substantive pay, and so putting them on the same footing as gunnery and torpedo ratings.<\/p><p>The victualling of the Fleet continues to be improved, general messing having been one of the greatest factors in this\ndirection. Much more consideration than formerly is now given to the accommodation for the men on board ship. Shore station barracks are replacing hulks, and existing shore stations are being constantly improved and renovated. Steps have been taken to improve the selection and training of officers promoted from the lower deck, so as to put them on more level terms with ex-cadet officers in obtaining higher promotion. Every sort of facility to-day is given for games and recreation, and when the sailor comes to the end of his active service career, he finds that there are better facilities for vocational training and arrangements for re-settlement in civil life.<\/p><p>As I told the House, there is nothing sensational in any of these things which I have reported. Nevertheless, all of them touch aspects of life which most concern the sailor from the time he joins the Fleet to the time he leaves it, and they all help to ease what is, and should be recognised, as a hard life. I am quite sure that this House will never grudge any small concession that we are able to make to the sailor to ease his life. When he is afloat, the sailor is always on active service. He leads a crowded communal life. He has no barrack square in which to kick a football about during the dinner hour. If he is married, he is separated for a very long time from his wife, and has, in a sense, to maintain a dual establishment. He has to sleep in hammocks, sometimes so close as to touch each other, so that when a man turns the whole row feels it. What is worse than anything, it is almost impossible for the sailor to get any privacy, which at times all creatures want. For these reasons, I am sure the House will never grudge any small concession that we can make to improve his conditions.<\/p><p>I do not want the House to think, from what I have said, that the Navy is an unattractive service. Recruitment shows quite the opposite. Barely 80 years ago we were using the press gang to man our ships; to-day we are able to take only one in 14 of the men who want to join the Service. I think I ought to warn hon. Members who, later on, may wish to reduce my salary either for sins of omission or commission, that our right to use the press gang has never been abolished.<\/p><p>While we are getting over some of the difficulties of having too few men, we have still the difficulties in the Service of having too many officers in certain ranks. Owing to the large numbers of officers entered when the Navy was larger, and Treaty restrictions were unforeseen, there has been, and unhappily still is, a surplus of lieutenants and lieutenant-commanders. Several ill effects accrue from this surplus. It prevents a number of junior officers from taking command and exercising control which is so necessary to their future careers. It has meant that prospects are bad in the promotion of these officers. It has involved unemployment and early retirement, and I am afraid that some people outside may doubt very much whether the Royal Navy affords adequate prospects of a reasonably assured career for their sons.<\/p><p>Therefore, we are taking active measures to meet these several difficulties. Various ships in the Navy are now working on considerably reduced complements of officers, that is in addition to the reduction we made in lieutenant-commanders last year. In the light of the experience which we are gaining we shall adjust the numbers of lieutenants and lieutenant-commanders, and, at the same time, adjust the entries of cadets into the Service, so that we shall be able to offer definitely better prospects of promotion in the future. We have already considerably improved promotion from commander to captain, and I hope that in the future we shall have a considerably higher proportion of officers promoted from lieutenant-commander to commander. To those who may think of sending their sons into the Service, I have no hesitation whatever in saying that the prospects of a boy entering the Royal Navy to-day as a cadet have never been better since the War.<\/p><p>Last week my right hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Air, at the end of his very admirable speech in introducing the Air Estimates, said:\n<q>I am sure that the House as a whole realises that the Royal Air Force is now, alongside the Royal Navy, the first line of defence of these Islands and of the Empire.\"&#8212;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th March, 1934; col. 2041, Vol. 286.]<\/q>\nI am sure that not only the majority of the House, but the whole House realises that, and I may say that the Navy has realised it for a very long time.\nI want to say here that I deplore very much a growing tendency to indulge in controversy on the respective merits of the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force for the protection of our Empire. I think that such controversy is wholly mischievous, and can only do harm to both Services and also to our country. Both these Services are vitally necessary for the defence of our Empire. In my opinion, the two Services are peculiarly complementary, and, if I see the future aright, I think that they will become more and more complementary as time progresses. The Fleet depends more and more upon our Naval Air Arm. We regard it as the spear-head of the Fleet, and we are prouder of it than of any other branch of our Naval Service.<\/p><p>It is equally true that the Air Force depends on the Navy. Without the Navy, the fuel which the Air Force uses, and indeed every other thing that is water-borne, would be in jeopardy. I am sure that the Air Force, as time goes on, will help more and more in the defence of our commerce in narrow waters. But the House must remember that to-day, at any moment, of the tremendously large number of British ships all over the world carrying our commerce, something like 85 per cent. are outside the scope of land-based aircraft, and I cannot help thinking that, until commerce flies altogether, you must have a Navy to defend it. It is perfectly true to say that the Navy can do nothing to protect London against an air attack, but a blow at the heart is not the only way of killing a country. A country can be killed, if more slowly, just as surely, by attacking its extremities, and sinking its merchandise and provender upon the high seas. Death by a thousand cuts is just as sure as death by a knock-out blow. It must be apparent that both of these great Services are required for our defence, and, in my opinion, they will work more and more closely together as time progresses. I am sure the House would like to know that, at those places where they come most closely in contact, that is to say, in the aircraft carriers and at the shore bases, there is the most perfect comradeship and co-operation between them.<\/p><p>If it is essential, as I think this country will always hold, for England to have a Fleet, I should like the House to realise and understand that it is just as essential\nfor the Navy to have battleships. A dangerous heresy has appeared in certain naval circles which states that a battleship is an anachronism, and is unnecessary to-day. This question is even discussed as though there were two schools of thought in the Navy upon it, but I can assure the House that that is not so. I do not believe that it would be possible to find a Board of Admiralty who would not say that the battleship is, and must remain, the backbone of our Fleet. I see in his place my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for North Portsmouth (Sir R. Keyes), and I should very much like to obtain his support for this thesis. I am sure I may take this opportunity of saying on behalf of the House how delighted we are to see among us a very distinguished Admiral of the Fleet who will bring great practical experience and knowledge to our Naval Debates.<\/p><p>This heresy about battleships has gained a good many adherents recently, because, in our up-to-date journalism, orthodoxy is no longer news value. It is only the hetrodox who obtain the headlines, as the hon. and learned Member for East Bristol (Sir S. Cripps) well knows. Besides this, those who, like the First Sea Lord, have supreme responsibility for these things, are not supposed to take part in public debate, and cannot rebut theories that are put forward by people who have no responsibility whatsoever, and so it is left to me to try to make the case for the battleship, which I shall attempt to do. The argument is usually put in this way, that battleships should be reduced to 10,000 tons, and I propose to deal with the argument in that form.<\/p><p>The argument is advanced from three quite different points of view&#8212;by those who think that a reduction to 10,000 tons will mean economy for this country; by those who think that a 10,000-ton ship will be of a size sufficient strategically for the defence of this country; and by those who think that the 10,000-ton ship will make for peace, because it reduces the power of aggression. I think I should here state what the Admiralty consider to be the qualifications of a battleship. The first is that a battleship should be powerful enough to remain afloat for a reasonable time against any form of attack&#8212;from gunfire, from torpedoes, from mines, and from aerial bombs; and it would be\ntechnically impossible to incorporate the necessary protection against all these forms of attack in a ship of 10,000 tons. But there is an overriding consideration, and that is that a battleship should be overwhelmingly more powerful than the next type of ship with which it is likely to come in contact.<\/p><p>Taking first the economy argument, let me say that we at the Admiralty have every sympathy with the idea of economy; indeed, we have put forward plans for reducing the size of the capital ship very considerably, though I may remind the House that up to date those suggestions have not met with very much response. If the capital ship were reduced to 10,000 tons, or if the gap between the capital ship and the cruiser were unduly reduced, all the smaller Naval Powers which at present have not any ships bigger than cruisers would immediately be in a position to upset all the carefully calculated ratios and relative strengths of the other Powers, either by forming combinations among themselves or by re-inforcing one of the larger Powers; and it is only our possession of capital ships overwhelmingly more powerful than cruisers that enables us to accept so low a strength as is represented by a one-Power standard. Were our interests threatened in any distant part of the world, instead of sending, as we did in the War to the Falkland Islands, two ships of a far superior type against the concentration of enemy cruisers, we might, if we had not ships of that superior type, have to send perhaps double the number of ships of the same type. The result would be that we should want so many 10,000-ton ships that the Navy would be far more expensive than it is to-day.<\/p><p>As regards the strategical aspect, suppose that all nations were limited to ships of 10,000 tons, and that a country which had parity, or something like parity, wished to attack us. This country must always have a very large percentage of its cruisers on the trade routes, because our position with regard to the protection of trade is unique. That would mean that, at his selected moment, an enemy could concentrate the whole of his cruiser force against only a fraction of ours, either at home or anywhere else in the world. If it were at home, and he effected that concentration, he would have the whole converging traffic at the\nmouth of the Channel, and, indeed, the whole of this country, at his mercy. That would be making aggression easy; that would be making attack simple. But now suppose each of these countries to have a small battle fleet as well as cruisers. An attack on this country then would become a very much more difficult and hazardous enterprise, because the concentration of cruisers of which I have spoken could do nothing really effective while our battle fleet was in being, and it would be necessary for any enemy to move his battle fleet, working, perhaps, many miles from its base, before our battle fleet could be challenged.<\/p><p>The enthusiasts for the 10,000-ton capital ship are those who want to stop aggression in all its aspects. They think that by reducing the offensive power of a nation, and strengthening its defensive power, greater general security would be brought about. I agree absolutely with that, but one of the greatest difficulties has been to define what is an offensive and what is a defensive weapon. I think the only definition that finds universal agreement at Geneva is one that says a particular type of weapon is offensive if you are standing in front of it, and defensive if you are standing behind it. But, surely, this plan of reducing the capital ship to 10,000 tons would be deliberately playing into the hands of the aggressor, and dangerously reducing the defensive power of any country attacked. I will try to sum up these arguments by saying that neither technically, strategically, economically, politically, nor even pacifically, could we accept a 10,000-ton capital ship, and this is probably why all investigators who have studied the suggestion have unanimously turned it down.<\/p><p>Two years ago, when I first presented Navy Estimates to the House, I very regretfully explained that the Estimates of the Navy were at a very low ebb. The provision made in 1931 was lower than it had been for nearly 20 years, and, in spite of the very high hopes of general disarmament and general appeasement in the world that were held in those days, I realised that the money voted for the Navy was not sufficient properly to finance it. We were starved for stores and many other requirements; we were living on what was rapidly ceasing to be our own fat. It is true that the Navy Estimates in the last two years have risen by a little over &#163;6,000,000, but, honestly, I do not\nbelieve, looking round at the general state of the world to-day, that anybody who had my job, who had the tremendous responsibility of answering for the efficiency of the British Navy to the British people, could possibly ask for a penny less.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>We have listened to the varying opinions of experts, ex-experts\nand ex-statesmen this afternoon. I am merely a humble student of the sea and sea power. I am merely an observer and not a pilot. I do not see any reason why the Air Force should get the whole of the lime-light, although I consider that, as has been said already, we should welcome the closest co-operation and co-ordination between the two Services. On last year's Estimates I ventured to draw attention to the difficulty that there was in finding men for foreign service without interfering with and drawing men from the Home Fleet in the middle of a commission. Unfortunately, that difficulty still exists to-day, and for some time the Home Fleet will suffer by periodically losing its men, with the result that it will have to be manned by young and untrained ratings, making it practically a training Fleet. Security of tenure is as essential for the men as it is for the ship or for the Fleet. I also ventured last year to draw the attention of the First Lord to the dangerous shortage of men. Now, I am glad to say, the \"St. Vincent\" and Shotley are full of seamen boys, and recruiting for the special service ordinary seamen class is in full swing at Chatham, Portsmouth and Devonport; but for some time, I fear, we must suffer from a lack of qualified men, as it takes about three years to make a fully trained naval seaman. This is a legacy which has been left to us by the last Government.<\/p><p>I am also glad to see that two other points which I raised have been very satisfactorily dealt with. The new conditions of advancement and the revised scale of pay for the signal and wireless branches is a very well deserved concession, in my humble opinion, to a most important section of the Service. The other point is that the shortening of the time for which men in the seamen branch now have to wait for advancement, after having qualified for higher rating, will undoubtedly produce very good results. Further, the new scheme of retirement and gratuities in the case of junior officers is a great improvement on all the other schemes. If I may say so as the representative of the senior dockyard, I welcome the First Lord's assurance that the repair work will keep the Royal Dockyards in full employment in the future. Last year mention was made of the \"Frobisher.\" I would welcome another \"Frobisher\" for boys as well\nas for cadets, and, if possible, a training ship, so that they might fill in by a three months' cruise the interval between leaving the training establishment and joining the Fleet.<\/p><p>In 1936, and immediately after, we shall have to bring our Battle Fleet up to date. To-day, with the exception of the \"Nelson\" and \"Rodney,\" all our battleships are old ships. In pre-war days a battleship was out of date in 10 years. To-day all except two are nearly 20 years old, and even if, by prolonging their lives under the London Naval Treaty, they are now brought up to date at very great expense, their serviceable lives are necessarily limited. But the battleship still remains, and must remain, the backbone of the fleet. By all means limit the size and armaments, provided always that there is a clear margin of superiority over any corresponding foreign ships. It is superiority that we must have, and not parity. I regard the battleship replacement programme as the most important naval factor to-day. Supremacy in any other class of ship will never make up for weakness in our capital ships. A new ship once built is far more economical in both fuel and upkeep than an old ship. It is also interesting to note that not one of our battleships was sunk by submarines during the whole War. Nelson said that a line-of-battleship was the best negotiator in the world. If it were known that Parliament would, if necessary, grant supplies for a battleship programme, it would prove an invaluable bargaining weapon at any future naval conference, just as powerful a factor as the tariff weapon is commercially.<\/p><p>We have suffered for 10 years in conferences. It is cruisers that we want, and not conferences. We are woefully short of cruisers, and the shortage is increasing, and not decreasing. A large proportion are worn out, and ought to have been replaced long ago. A squadron of cruisers is far more valuable to the Empire than any number of conferences, and, in the long run, a great deal cheaper. It is no good waiting until we are faced with the actual threat of war. We must either have cruisers adequate to our needs, or be prepared to climb down if any one cares to argue the point with us. A great many people have their wishbone where their backbone ought to be.\nOn the 6th instant, the United States Senate passed a Bill for a naval programme of &#163;150,000,000 covering a period of five years, consisting of six cruisers, 65 destroyers, 30 submarines and one aircraft-carrier. Senator Hales said:\n<q>It is the duty of Congress to maintain an adequate Navy. If we make any mistake in our Estimates, it is better that the mistake should be one providing too large than too small a Navy.<\/q>\nIt is maintained that they are only building up to treaty limits by which they cannot increase their armaments or the elevation of their guns. Be that as it may, the moral effect of such a large and rapid expansion is bound to create an adverse atmosphere for the reduction of armaments elsewhere in the world. If it is a matter of necessity and not of prestige to America, we can only assume that the menace is the Pacific, whereas to Great Britain with 80,000 miles of trade routes to protect, it is one of vital necessity. We cannot afford to take risks with our lives, and we cannot afford to gamble with our existence. No country since the world began was ever ruined by expenditure on armaments. It is not armaments. It is the mind behind the armaments that makes for racial antagonism. If we want peace, it is the causes of war and not the instruments of war that must be abolished. Aggression is always founded upon weakness. If one nation knows that she cannot face another's armaments, agreement will very soon be come to. If it is true that armaments are a cause of war, for 60 years, when the British Navy was twice as strong as any two other Powers, we ought to have been continually at war. Little Englanders and scaremongers say we have outlawed war, and, therefore we do not need a Navy and we ought to disarm. We might just as well say that, because we have made burglary illegal, we ought to abolish the police force. After all, the Navy is the police force of the sea. Our Navy does not exist for the protection of this country alone. The Dominions, the Colonies, and the Protectorates are equally dependent on it for their lives and their protection, and they should be encouraged to contribute their fair share.<\/p><p>The Pacific is now the focal point, and it is impossible to exaggerate the enormous importance of the Singapore Base. Singapore is not only the gateway to the Pacific, but it commands the Indian Ocean, round which are three-quarters\nof the land territory of the Empire, and three-quarters of the population of the Empire live in that territory. The volume of trade through Singapore is just as great as through Suez and Panama, and it is the only port from which a battle fleet could reach Australia and New Zealand, and give them the same assistance in time of crisis as they gave us during the Great War. An area of 3,000 acres was presented by the Government of the Straits Settlements and the cost is shared by New Zealand, Hong Kong and the Federated Malay States. I do not think there has ever been a greater harvest of achievement reaped at the price of so small a draft on the National Exchequer.<\/p><p>It has been frequently said by responsible and reliable people that we have disarmed to the edge of risk. We have disarmed far below the safety margin. We have reached an utterly unsafe limit. I pause to reflect upon the consequences of these statements in some quarters. In my many extensive journeys abroad I have been profoundly impressed by the effect that such statements have made upon certain foreign countries, which are inclined to consider that they can now afford to leave us out of their calculation. We ended the War as the greatest sea Power in the world. Now this one-sided disarmament has reduced us to a position totally unworthy of our great traditions. Dignified isolation is a two-edged weapon. Dignified isolation may be very well but to refuse to follow the example of other nations is to isolate ourselves from safety and common sense. It is not so much armaments <i>qua<\/i> armaments. It is prestige and dignity, and respect for the flag. Those of us who have travelled over the world know full well the confidence and respect which the White Ensign always inspires wherever it flies, and which always receives a great welcome by all our kith and kin in every part of the globe. That also applies to the Red Ensign and the Blue Ensign.<\/p><p>I would like to see more armed liners than we have at present. How often in far-off corners of the world have threatened risings and insurrections, which might have involved us in serious trouble and even international complications, been avoided by the presence of a cruiser, a gun-boat or a sloop. It did not matter which, for the presence of\nthe ship and of the flag was to them a knowledge of the warning that behind that flag lay the authority and the great naval power of Great Britain. The British Ensign has always been regarded as the emblem and the symbol of freedom, justice and peace. The British Navy does not exist, and it never has existed, to attack, but to protect British lives, British territory and British trade. The British Empire is the British Fleet. If we are to preserve the one, it is essential that we must maintain the other.<\/p>",

It is true, as the Noble Lord the Member for Horsham (Earl Winter-ton), has said, that this has been an age-long controversy. In the subordinate position which I held in India and in serving the War Office at home, I only heard from time to time that this question was being discussed between the India Office and the War Office. The first actual statement or the subject which I happened to see was when reading and toiling through the evidence of the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State before the Joint Select Committee. I think it was after Sir Malcolm Hailey's statement of the financial situation as regards the White Paper had been put before the Joint Select Committee, and the Secretary of State was trying to give some crumb of comfort regarding the rather difficult financial situation in which India would be. I have not looked it up, but I remember that he said, \"There is just a hope&#8212;I will not put it at more than a hope&#8212;that the tribunal which is now sitting may afford the taxpayer in India some measure of relief.\" Undoubtedly the Secretary of State did not then know how much money was going to be given by the British taxpayers in this country for the relief of the taxpayers in India, or, as I contend, for oiling the wheels by which the White Paper policy will be introduced into India. He could not tell then, but he knew perfectly well when he said that the recommendations of the tribunal, because the date of the report of the tribunal was 4th January, 1933, though it was not printed until December, 12 months later. No doubt at the time the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State was discussing this matter he was urging on the Government to make a generous contri-\nbution towards India's need, or towards the implementing of this new system of democracy in the East.<\/p><p>I agree with the Noble Lord the Member for Horsham that it is perfectly true there is nothing to be said against the fact that this tribunal was set up, though as a soldier, it seems to me rather extraordinary that you should have five legal gentlemen to decide on a question which, in its essence, is purely military. I am told that very eminent counsel on both sides argued the question in front of this legal tribunal, and no doubt the Secretary of State and the India Office put up their best case. But the question is purely military in its essence. I should like to ask whether India is not indebted to Great Britain for the large number of men maintained continually in India, like a dumb-bell held at arm's length, as the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Epping (Mr. Churchill) said on our organisation at home? I remember that Sir Charles Dilke was in favour of a scheme of short service of 10 years in the Army, two years with the Colours, and eight years with the Reserve at home, which would have given us a large Reserve at very small cost to meet our commitments in Europe and in the West. The whole of that scheme had to be scrapped owing to the necessity of finding the troops for India. India cannot pay for the transport of frequent drafts under any real system of short service.<\/p><p>Our Army in India has a three-fold task to perform. In the first place, it has to defend the North-West Frontier of India against a major attack, say, by a European Power. Secondly, it has to be prepared to defeat a minor attack by any of the tribes on the North-West Frontier of India, and, thirdly, and most important of all, it has to maintain internal order all through India. Lord Kitchener foresaw the danger of a Russian advance through Afghanistan and he regrouped the Indian army so that it would be immediately available to repel a Russian advance from the North-West Frontier. Since those times, we have had the revolution in Russia and the whole problem as regards Russia has completely changed. There is not the same danger from Russia in the military sense, as in the old days. A single propagandist passing through the Hindu Kush could do\nfar greater harm than a large invading army. Astute people like the present rulers in Russia would never think of sending a million men through the passes of the Hindu Kush.<\/p><p>Although the danger of a Russian attack on the North-West Frontier has been removed, we have to face increased danger internally in India where the Bolshevik enemy, if it attacks us, will operate by undermining public confidence in India. Therefore, more British troops are required to maintain internal order in India. On the other hand, a tribal rising on the frontier can be met by India's present resources, the British Army allied to the Indian troops at present there. They do not require reinforcement from this country. In the great rising in 1897 in Tirah, there were no reinforcements sent from this country to any large extent.<\/p><p>Certain processes have been going on in India lately which have increased the need of British troops in that country. It is ridiculous for anyone who knows that enormous country to think that the small handful of British troops there, 58,000, can really control by force, a population of 353,000,000. They never did. We have always held India by prestige. Certain features of the policy of the Government of India and of our own Government during the last few years have tended to lower our prestige, and for that reason British troops are far more necessary in India now than they were five or six years ago. As a soldier I look upon it as absolutely impossible to imagine that any large proportion of our troops in India could be sent to China or Hong Kong or anywhere else in the East where they might be required. If the Committee of Imperial Defence looked into that question they would find that our troops are tied down to India. Communal riots have enormously increased since the promise of democratic reform in India, and in communal riots British troops are essential to put down the rioting, if possible, without bloodshed.<\/p><p>It is part of the new policy in India to go in for what we call Indianisation. A certain number of units have been in process of Indianisation for several years. That process is depriving those units gradually of British officers and re-\nplacing them by Indian officers. We know now that a whole division has been handed over to this process of Indianisation. The process of Indianisation is decreasing, as it goes on, the fighting value of those units. If you hand over a whole division of the Indian Army to Indianisation, you will reduce the fighting value of the Indian Army for many years by a whole Indian division. There is, therefore, all the more reason why India should draw troops from this country in order to help her to maintain order and to preserve her strength on the Frontier.<\/p><p>There are many ways in this country in which we could use the &#163;1,500,000 which is proposed in this Vote. Take our own Army. Have we had proper manoeuvres year after year? What about the Territorial Army? Is it not discouraging when one attends territorial dinners to learn how difficult it for the handful of officers to get recruits, and also to learn how the Territorial Army is being starved by the Government? Yet, in a fit of open-handedness, the Government are handing over &#163;1,500,000 in perpetuity to India. I hope that the Committee will take into consideration some of the points raised by the right hon. Member for Epping and that they will think twice before they tie down this country to contribute &#163;1,500,000 annually to India in the way proposed.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>Doubtful company for once. Many of us are perturbed about a new form of competition, the competition of manufactured goods made in tropical and sub-tropical countries. We thought, rightly or wrongly, that this was a development which we should not see, because conditions there are in many respects not favourable for factory work, and those countries have the advantage that they can produce a vast range of primary products which cannot be produced in this country. They have an\nobvious natural function, the production of things like rubber, cotton, many fruits, tobacco, many kinds of oilseed&#8212;a whole range of foodstuffs and of primary raw materials which we cannot produce; and we have thought that those countries would confine themselves to the production of those things&#8212;that we should, in the main, be producers of manufactures, and that there would take place the most desirable form of trade, the exchange not of competing commodities but of complementary commodities. We are finding that there is a development of manufactures in tropical and sub-tropical countries under wages conditions so different from ours that they represent a dangerous form of competition to our national life and to our standard of living. Some of it comes from foreign countries and some, I would remind the House, comes from possessions of the British Empire.<\/p><p>That is a new development and is something which I believe was not contemplated when the Import Duties Act was passed. Hon. Members have only to read Section 5 of that Act which guarantees, until that section is amended, unrestricted importation into this country of goods produced in and consigned from British non-self-governing possessions. I was never an Empire Free Trader; I was always an Empire preference man, because I have always taken the view that in this country we are entitled to protection where necessary against other parts of the Empire while always giving to other parts of the Empire a big advantage over foreign countries. That was not the policy adopted by His Majesty's Government, and for the moment we are in a world, so far as we are concerned, of Empire free trade, instead of a world of Empire preference. I regret the decision that was made, but it was made, and it may have to be undone in part.<\/p><p>May I just quote one example which comes from the answer to a question which I asked in this House a few days ago. It will be remembered that manufacturers of rubber boots and shoes in this country complained very bitterly about Japanese competition, and that they ultimately succeeded in persuading the Import Duties Advisory Committee to make a recommendation whereby a duty\nof 9d. per pair&#8212;I speak from memory&#8212;was imposed on rubber footwear. As a result of that, the imports from Japan, which a year ago were very high, fell. There were 750,000 pairs imported from Japan in January, 1933, and only 27,000 pairs in 1934. Nineteen out of 20 were shut out. Last year, from British Malaya, there were 1,600 pairs; this year 14,000; from Hong Kong last year, 50 pairs; this year, 212,000. In other words, to the extent of nearly a half the Japanese competition which was wiped out by the action of the Import Duties Advisory Committee has been replaced by a new competition coming from British possessions in the East. It may well be that the conditions of employment of the workpeople in the factories in Hong Kong and Singapore are satisfactory to those people from their point of view, having regard to the standard which they have enjoyed, but those conditions do not represent fair competition with our workers in this country.<\/p><p>Up to now, so far as I am aware, the only serious competition in manufactures from the Crown Colonies has been in respect of rubber footwear, but we know only too well that India is now one of the most important suppliers of pig-iron to this country. That is a kind of competition against which we are entitled to protect ourselves. I am in favour of doing everything possible to improve the standard of living in India, and to give that country every kind of preferential advantage over foreigners, but we are entitled to protect ourselves against other Empire countries just as other Empire countries can legitimately protect themselves against us so far as that may be desirable. It is because I hold those views that I was very glad to associate myself with my hon. and learned Friend, and I congratulate him upon having introduced this Bill. The hon. and gallant Gentleman who may speak for the Government may tell us, for reasons which I have already mentioned, that this is an instrument which he cannot use for the moment, even if Parliament approves of it, but I ask him not to refuse this weapon&#8212;he never knows when the day may come that he will need it&#8212;if Parliament gives it to him to use, as soon as he has liberated himself by administrative action from the restrictions which limit him at the moment.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I would like to explain to the hon. and gallant Member for Wellingborough (Wing-Commander James) that I was only referring to a former Parliamentary success of the hon. and gallant Member for Bournemouth, and it had no special reference to the subject of India. I was going to say that the Island of Ceylon is many times smaller than India, and it has already been the subject of constitutional change. The problem of its good government raises principles which are equally important with those of India, and which are equally proper for discussion by the House of Commons. The hon. and gallant Member for Bournemouth has given us a very moving picture of conditions of all kinds in Ceylon, and the way in which those conditions have very definitely changed for the worse since the inception of the constitution of 1931.<\/p><p>There are only one or two points left for me to refer to in supplementing what he has said, and one is in regard to the commercial position which the State Council of Ceylon have elected of their own accord to take up within the Empire. Perhaps I should have said the position that they have elected not to take up. Many of us will recollect the glow of satisfaction that was upon the countenance of the Secretary of State for the Colonies&#8212;who we all hope will have a speedy recovery&#8212;when he came back with his colleagues from Ottawa, and announced that he had been able to achieve the most far-reaching results for the Crown Colonies, which it had been his special charge to represent. Soon we began to notice that there was an exception, that there was a flaw in the picture, and that he was not able to bring to maturity what seemed a certainty when he left Ottawa. Questions have been asked in this House as to whether the\nCeylon Government intended to implement the Ottawa Agreements. I recollect that in July last the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in answer to a question, replied:\n<q>The Governor of Ceylon informs me that his Ministers are still considering the possibility of granting further preferences to Empire goods, but he is at present unable to state that they will take the necessary steps within any definite period, or that the State Council of Ceylon would agree to any proposals which they may make.\"&#8212;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 26th July, 1933; col. 2612, Vol. 280.]<\/q>\nThere is in that a <i>non possumus<\/i> and unwilling attitude on the part of the State Council to take any action. The Constitution passed in 1931 provides for remedies in a state of affairs like that. I ask the indulgence of the House if I remind hon. Members what is the specific remedy provided for a case of this kind. It is contained in Clause 22 of the Order-in-Council of 1931, and is as follows:\n<ol><li>\"(<i>a<\/i>) it shall be lawful for any Officer of State, acting by the authority and under the instructions of the Governor, to propose any such Bill, motion, resolution or vote to the Council and the same shall have priority over all other business of the Council;<\/li><li>\"(<i>b<\/i>) The Governor may declare that any such Bill, or any part of any such Bill or any such motion, resolution, or vote is of paramount importance or is essential to give effect to the provisions of this Order, and thereupon such Bill, part of a Bill, motion, resolution, or vote shall have effect as if it had been passed by the Council.\"<\/li><\/ol>\nClearly we there have a safeguard. Why is this safeguard not being used? We know that the Secretary of State for the Colonies is only too anxious to have this final link in the chain of his section of the Ottawa Agreements completed. He has made statements and given assurances in this House that he is doing all that he can to have the position put right. Can it be that the Governor, although invested with these powers and safeguards, deems it unstatesmanlike to use them? Can it be that he thinks that if he puts forward his power of initiation of legislation under this \"paramount\" Clause, it would precipitate a crisis in the island which, if it were thoroughly explored and ventilated before the public of Ceylon, might show to the people of Ceylon that their State councillors were not their true servants? I can only think that there must be some reason of that kind, as the cause of this failure to take\naction, whether it be action under the Constitution of Ceylon or by the Colonial Office in London, to explain why the agreements are not implemented.<\/p><p>The hon. and gallant Member for Bournemouth dwelt upon the growth of anti-British feeling in the island, and he gave us some striking instances, which I do not propose to supplement, of the way in which that anti-British feeling is operating. It is worth while mentioning that several people familiar with the island, in which some of them have been on plantations, have said that they are unwilling to send their own sons there to take up positions, so bad do they consider the state of affairs in the island. They would rather sacrifice or sell out in the country in which they have invested capital and which they have built up over a great many years, in order to put those who follow them into some other perhaps humbler and less lucrative position in this country.<\/p><p>The position in business, trade or commerce in the island is bad, but in the administrative services it is even worse. The State councilors and the chairmen of the executive committees, who are in fact the Governor's Ministers, show, according to reports that I have received, a veiled insolence towards tried and trusted servants of the old Ceylon Civil Service. I cannot give any definite and specific instance now, and I would only say that I have seen literature which leads me to take that view. I have seen none to contradict it. It was significant that last September the Chief Secretary in the State Council said that for the last two years more than 150 officers had retired, which was equal to 22 per cent. of the whole Service. Also 103 officers drawing salaries of over &#163;600 a year have retired, or have given notice of their intention to retire, under the provisions of the Order-in-Council. If further evidence were wanted, we had it from the mouth of the Secretary of State himself, when, in answer to a question in this House on the 3rd May, speaking of the number of retirements of British employ&#233;s from the Government service, he gave the following figures: 1928, 17; 1929, 16; 1930, 12. In 1931, during the latter part of which year the Constitution was introduced, 29 officers retired, and in 1932 the number was 62. That must show that there is grave dissatisfaction with the way in which the administrative ser-\nvices of Ceylon are being carried on, and it must show that all those pinpricks are only having the effect of making the Ceylonese and the British, whose<span class=\"obscured\">[...]<\/span> co-operation and partnership is to my mind essential, fail to work together. That can only mean that sooner or later this state of affairs&#8212;a dyarchy which is no dyarchy&#8212;must come to an end.<\/p><p>In the Donoughmore Commission's Report emphasis was laid on the fact that the Constitution which they proposed, and which was afterwards adopted, might be successful because there were no political parties in Ceylon. The Donoughmore Commission saw, on the one hand, a sort of host of would-be legislators of the type often described in this House as of no fixed views, but only anxious to be good public servants; and this host was supposed to be going to carry out the Constitution as a solid bloc, almost a National Government, behind the officers of State and the Governor. So sure were the Commission in their view that they said in their report, at page 19:\n<q>If we survey the political field, we find that there is a complete absence of any party system among the elected representatives of the people.<\/q>\nBut, if there is no party system, and if we find now an anti-British feeling expressed in the State Council&#8212;the elected body&#8212;as I believe all the evidence shows to be the case, how can we hope that there will be any change from that hostile opinion to the British idea? We cannot hope that, if the present Ministry, as I will call it, becomes discredited, the result of a fresh election would be to return another political party anxious to co-operate with the Governor and his advisers. It seems to me that there can be no redress under the present political system, that no swing of the pendulum is possible that could change this apparently hostile bloc, in the case of which, apparently, nationalism has run to its head and judgment gone out; and that some urgent inquiry should be started in order really to investigate these conditions.<\/p><p>I see that there is an Amendment on the Order Paper which suggests that the desire expressed in the Motion is premature&#8212;that, when a Constitution has been in operation for 2&#189; years, it would, on principle, be premature to make any inquiry into its working at all. Before\npassing judgment on that question, it might be worth while to repeat once more what have been the historic precedents in the Island of Ceylon itself in regard to changes of Government. I think it would be right to say that our datum line, so to speak, starts in 1815, when \"the Kandyan Convention guaranteed to all classes of people the safety of their persons and property, with their civil rights and immunities,\" and that anything which has taken place as far as British administration is concerned must be dated from that point and must have those principles in mind. In 1833, Executive and Legislative Councils were first set up. There was a change again in 1837, another in 1845, and another in 1889. In 1910, after a lapse of 21 years, there was a further change, and then came a period when a new factor was introduced, and you began to get pressure from bodies and associations to try to demand from the home Government what they would describe as a more generous constitution.<\/p><p>The next move took place in 1920, after the lapse of only 10 years. In December, 1921, when the ink was hardly dry on the paper of that Order in Council, Sir James Pieris, the President of Congress&#8212;which is the most important, I will not say political party, but I would call it the party of agitation in the Island, a party which, from all that one reads about it, is similar in name and in character to another party in India&#8212;in December, 1921, Sir James Pieris moved in the Legislative Council Amendments to the Constitution, and so strong were the representations that by December, 1923, after a lapse of only three years, a sweeping change was again made in the size and functions of the Legislative Council, and also of the Executive Council. Since 1923 there has been a constant repercussion of fresh agitation for more and more concessions, and, after only eight years, those concessions were given, culminating in the final great concession, the most sweeping one of all, which not only established, on the face of it, an ultra-democratic Constitution, but had great experimental features about it, and, in particular, the feature of government, not by Ministers, but by the chairmen of committees, somewhat on the French model. That was a great experiment in itself, and, in my belief, it has failed. But, if such a great experiment has been\nmade, I think we are entitled, even after only two and a-half years, with all the signs, which have already been brought out in this Debate, of disquietude, dissatisfaction, and lack of smooth working, to make an inquiry of the kind that only a Parliamentary Commission can make.<\/p><p>I should like, if I may, to dwell for a few moments on the present situation. Unfortunately, the late Governor, Sir Graeme Thomson, died suddenly last year, but since then the Island has been fortunate in securing the services of one of the most experienced Colonial civil servants in the service, a man with a brilliant record of success both in the Colony of Hong Kong and later in the island of Jamaica, and who was for a short time in Cyprus. He has now gone to take up what was his old charge, the government of Ceylon, after having been Colonial Secretary there in 1913. All hon. Members in the House will appreciate that a Governor is always free at any time to make a report back to the Home country, both on administrative affairs and also on the working of the Constitution. But a Governor is not free to make a report back so that that report will be available to all people in this country who may wish to take an interest in it. Any report that he makes only goes to the Colonial Office, and it may there be deposited in a pigeon-hole until such time as the Secretary of State, with his many preoccupations, has time to deal with it. A Parliamentary Commission, however, which could go out and find the actual facts, would be able to present those facts to the Parliament of this country, and Members both of another place and of this House would then have the opportunity, which they ought to have, of judging of the working of this experimental Constitution. If we do not keep ourselves informed of constitutional experiments and their working we are not able to judge them and we are not exercising that vigilance which is the price of Empire. If we do not watch, it will avail us nothing merely to pray.<\/p>",

The very first threat given, the first shot fired, would immediately have led to the loss of Hong Kong and of the Malay Peninsula. That would have jeopardised our Far Eastern trade, and resulted in unemployment and starvation in this country. The same fact applies to the Mediterranean. Malta is protected by one flying squadron supported by the \"Glorious.\" Within an hour's flying of Malta there is Italy with 750 first-line aircraft. If we took strong action against Italy they could immediately cut off Our food supplies from coming through the Mediterranean. The same thing applies to Gibraltar. There we have no aircraft of any description, but across the water is France with her entire North African air force. That fact must influence the statements of the Foreign Secretary when he discusses the international situation with the Foreign Ministers of Italy and France. The whole of our foreign policy is thus painted with the brush of expediency. The hon. and\ngallant Member for Lewes (Captain Loder) has put down an Amendment to this Motion, and I believe that that Amendment has the support of the Government. He ends his Amendment with these words:\n<q>that it is inexpedient to adopt any resolution which might prejudice the success of international discussions now proceedng.<\/q>\nOur Motion ends with these words:\n<q>urges His Majesty's Government to pursue a course which will adequately safeguard our industrial, political, and national existence.<\/q>\nCan the safeguarding of our industrial, political and national existence possibly jeopardise the international situation? Therefore I would ask the Lord President of the Council, who, I believe, is going to reply to this Debate, this question: Why should an increase in the armaments of other countries, particularly American naval armaments, be hailed as a constructive Measure to cure unemployment, but that if we put down a Motion to suggest that our forces are inadequate, it is stigmatised as an action liable to lead to war? Japan has increased her Navy by 37 per cent., the United States of America by 29 per cent. and Italy by 20 per cent. Why do not hon. Members opposite get up and say that it is those countries, and not us, who are reducing our Navy, that are making for the disruption of Europe? I am not one who believes that this country can cut herself off from the rest of the world as the owner of the \"Daily Express\" seems to imagine.<\/p><p>I believe that we have got to have some form of international agreement, but I doubt very much whether an international police force would be of any value. In my view, there is no possible connection between the functioning of an international police force and the functioning of a national police force in individual countries, and for this reason. The police forces of individual countries take action against either an individual or individuals who do or say anything which they think will lead to a breach of the peace; in other words, they take action before anything has happened. Are those who are in favour of setting up an international police force advocating that when Herr Hitler sends a note to Dr. Dolfuss which might lead to a breach of the peace, immediately that note is sent an international police force laden with lethal weapons and bombers should take action?\nThe mere suggestion of such a thing is the most bloodthirsty supposition which has been put forward in history. Therefore, this international police force, if it could function, would have to act after the event it should have prevented had taken place.<\/p>",

I hope that the Secretary of State for India will set up a small committee to go into the whole question of Indian defences, in order to see if more substitution can take place. I believe that, if that were done, great economies could be effected. We know that, as a consequence of the White Paper, expenses may be incurred, and we should look round and see where economies could be made. The Royal Air Force cannot do much in the great cities, but they could do something in distant parts of India to relieve our military units, and so save money. Royal Air Force units have great speed and great range, and they can cover far greater areas than military units. I believe that money can be saved in that direction.<\/p><p>In regard to other parts of our Empire, like Gibraltar, Malta, Singapore, Hong Kong and so on, one of my colleagues wants to speak, and I will leave that part of the subject to him. I will only say that I have pressed the Under-Secretary of State for Air many times about the defence of Malta. I have asked him questions about the breakwater, and whether he is satisfied with the defence of Malta. I am rather perturbed. I know the Mediterranean very well and what is happening out in the Mediterranean, and I think that the air defence of Malta needs looking into. I should like the Government or the Under-Secretary for Air to assure me that the air defence of Malta is satisfactory. If the Under-Secretary is satisfied, I will ask him whether the Governor out there is satisfied.<\/p><p>I pass to the last portion of my Motion, which is in regard to Imperial air routes. I hear on all sides nothing but praise for Imperial Airways, under the able chairmanship of Sir Eric Geddes, and his managing director, for the way they are running air lines for peaceful penetration right down to Africa and now well on the way to Singapore. All that we need to do is to have feeder lines to link them up, and to send fast aircraft out, carrying mails, light transport and so on. Quick communication is essential for the business men of this country. I hope that a little more money will be spent upon Imperial Airways, to enable them to de-\nvelop those linking-up lines in the air routes. As we form these air routes, we ought to protect them from anybody who has hostile intent, and I ask the Government whether that is being looked into, and whether they can assure me that those air routes are being properly protected, in case anybody should attack them from the air. I believe in this peaceful penetration, and I also believe that Imperial Airways are doing great national work in carrying on their efficient services.<\/p><p>I think that everybody in this House believes in peace, but just as we believe in the principles of peace we believe in the principle of defence. I submit that every hon. Member has a responsibility in this question of defence. Even the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Morgan Jones), who is a well-known pacifist, has, I believe, a responsibility, in this House, to see that this country and the British Empire are safeguarded from aerial attack. The duty of hon. Members in the next few months should be to examine the Estimates very carefully indeed, to work through them line by line, and to see that the Naval Estimates give the First Lord the most efficient cruisers he wants&#8212;let him scrap all the old ones&#8212;and sufficient aircraft to work with the Fleet. The Army Estimates should be scrutinised very carefully, in order to give the Army all it wants in the way of mechanisation and sufficient aircraft for meeting its needs, in case of emergency. Our Air Estimates should provide that we are able to engage any single air-power, with every prospect of success.<\/p><p>I am proud this evening, because I have, as the Seconder of my Motion, the hon. and gallant Member for the Isle of Thanet (Captain Balfour). He is a flying man of great experience, and a skilled pilot. He flew some of the naval machines that I provided for General Henderson at the Front. It is because I gave the hon. and gallant Member a good machine, and not a \"dud\" one, that he is able to second my Motion tonight. He owes his life, I think, to me. He is a young man&#8212;a much younger man than I am&#8212;and he will put the case for aerial defence from the young man's point of view. He has experience in war. He has been bombed, and has bombed. I think we will listen to his\nviews with very great interest. I have put my case for adequate air armaments from the experience gained in the hard and bitter school of pioneer work, in connection with submarines and in the air. The late General Sir David Henderson, who was in charge of the military wing when war broke out, and myself, had to make bricks without straw, because this House never voted sufficient money for our air forces. We had to provide air machines, not only for the protection of this country, but for the Front, right, out to the Rufiji River in East Africa, for the Dardanelles, and up as far as Basrah. I do not want to see any other air-commanders put in the same positon as General Henderson and myself. It killed him. I know that it would be his wish, and it is my duty, to submit to this House that we should have a sufficiently powerful Air Force to protect our homes, our great cities, and our dockyards, shipyards and industrial centres. Our Air Force should be powerful enough to drive off enemy submarines that attacked our trade and food ships, and also to drive off enemy aircraft that attacked our trade and food ships. If anything happens to our food ships, we starve; if anything happens to our trade ships, all our people are thrown out of work. Therefore, we want an efficient Air Force to protect these items which I have mentioned, to protect the great places in our Empire that are open to air attack, and also to protect our air communications. believe with every fibre of my being in Holy Writ, and Holy Writ says that\n<q>When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace.<\/q>\nI submit that we should have in this country at least a one-power air standard. We do not know what is going to happen in the unsettled state of Europe; no man knows the combinations that might be against us in Europe, or what jealousies might arise in the Far East. We may have to hold the balance of power in Europe and in the Far East. For that we want at least a one-power standard in the air, and I ask every one of my colleagues in this House to see that we have it.<\/p>",

Two-thirds of the time of the speeches to-day has been devoted to that one colony, and I now ask the Committee to direct their attention for a moment to general trade matters affecting not only the interests of one colony, but this country as a whole. Certainly, among other trades, the Lancashire cotton trade is very vitally affected by matters arising on this Vote, and coming within the administration of the Colonial Secretary. I would ask my right hon. Friend, in his reply, to deal with some of these important matters, with all of which he is very familiar, and on which he has received numerous representations from\nthe trade. They arise mainly, though not entirely, in connection with the very serious question of Japanese competition. This is probably the most serious question affecting the future of this country. It is at once a very delicate and a very broad question, and it is one on which the Government will have to come to a clear decision, or not only the cotton trade, but many other trades in this country, in their most important markets, will be completely destroyed.<\/p><p>I only need mention such facts as the trade figures of Ceylon. In 1932, the imports into Ceylon of cotton goods from Japan were 33,556 packages, as against only 8,730 from Great Britain, and 1,404 from the rest of the world. Therefore, Japan is importing into Ceylon, of cotton goods, three-fourths of the total purchases of Ceylon, and that in spite of the fact that practically the whole of the exports of Ceylon are taken by us, and we give them a preference, while they have refused to give us a preference on cotton goods. That is the situation which exists at present, not only in regard to the question of Japanese competition, but also in regard to the implementing of the agreements to which Ceylon was a party at Ottawa, which were made by the Colonial Secretary on behalf of that Colony, and which are not at present being carried out.<\/p><p>This Japanese competition is not at all comparable with the competition of any other country in the world to-day. Certainly the standards of living in Japan are lower. I know that in Safeguarding inquiries there used to be many disputes as to what was the actual level of wages in one country as compared with another, but nobody can doubt that in Japan the wages are not more than a quarter, or certainly not more than a third, of what they are in this country, while the hours worked per week are 60 as against 48; and, on the top of these unfair conditions, there is the Government's deliberate policy of depreciating the yen in order to get trade advantages. So much is this the case that the industrialists in Japan were warned beforehand when the Government contemplated deliberately depreciating the yen. That is shown by the fact that, in the first six months of 1932, the imports of raw materials into Japan increased very much. During that period, the yen was at the old parity with sterling. But in the last six months of\n1932, when the yen was depreciated until its value was 20 per cent. below that of sterling, we find that the imports did not increase, but the exports increased by 50 per cent. That shows that there was a deliberate policy on the part of the Government, both by subsidies and by this depreciation of the yen, to get an unfair advantage in the markets of the world.<\/p><p>This matter has got to be tackled. I understand that the Government are at present in negotiation with Japan with a view to arriving at some arrangement on the basis of quotas&#8212;apportioning different markets. It may be that that is the most practical method of getting some alleviation of the present troubles due to the ridiculously low prices of Japanese goods, and of our own difficulties due to the presence of the most-favoured-nation Clause in our treaties. I would urge on the Government, before these negotiations are completed, to see that their hands are not tied by existing treaties, surely it would strengthen them in negotiation and it would clear the ground for the full consideration of these questions if the existing treaties which stand in the way were denounced.<\/p><p>I was glad to hear the hon. Gentleman who has just spoken say that the Congo Basin treaties should be put an end to The Liverpool Chamber of Commerce have been very reluctant in aligning themselves with the Manchester Chamber of Commerce in asking the Government to denounce the Congo Basin treaty and the Anglo-French Convention as it affects West Africa so that in the negotiations in the World Economic Conference, and in the bilateral agreements, which we are told are the basis of the Government's policy, we should have the ground completely cleared. It is not clear at the moment. India has denounced her trade treaty with Japan, which is a step in the right direction, and we have been told recently that we have also denounced that portion of our own treaty with Japan which affects West Africa, but there still remain the Congo Basin Treaty and the Anglo-French Convention and the other portions of our own commercial Treaty with Japan. I urge on the Government that these Treaties should all be firmly denounced so as to give them complete freedom in the negotiations that they are conducting with Japan.<\/p><p>Ceylon has not given the preference on Lancashire cotton goods which she agreed to do at Ottawa. The right hon. Gentleman has made representations by telegram, but we have not heard what reply has been received and we have never been informed as to the exact constitutional position in the matter. Ceylon has a constitution which was passed by this House and under which the Governor General has the power not only to promote but to pass legislation where he considers it of paramount importance to the interests of the country. I should have thought that, if there was one matter of paramount importance in the interests both of Ceylon and of this country, it was implementing the Ottawa Agreement, which was certainly entered into in the interest of both countries. I should be glad if the right hon. Gentleman would deal with that. When we come to Jamaica, we have completely the other side of the picture. Jamaica is only too anxious, from what we hear and see reported. I read, I think in the \"Manchester Daily Despatch\", that one of the representatives of the Jamaican Government said they were only too glad to give a preference to English goods, and particularly to Lancashire cotton goods, and to put on stiff duties against this unfair Japanese competition which they are suffering from as well as Lancashire, and yet we are told that our own Government is hesitant to give them the power or to encourage the Legislature to put these duties on Japanese goods and to give us a preference because of the delicacy of the political situation with Japan.<\/p><p>I should like to say one word on the Chinese tariff. The Chinese have increased their tariff, particularly on cotton goods, by as much as 50 to 100 per cent. That has been put on ostensibly as a retaliation against Japan for the troubles which have arisen between the two countries. Apparently, because China is bound by the most-favoured-nation clause in her treaties, in order to inflict hardship on Japan we are having intolerable hardship inflicted upon the cotton trade and other trades in this country through these increased duties. The right hon. Gentleman was asked this week to give the recent figures of our trade with Hong Kong, which comes directly under his administration, and they showed an alarming falling off in\ntrade due to those increased tariffs. I am sure that the cotton trade would be beholden to the Minister if he would tell us what steps or negotiations are taking place on his behalf in regard to the Chinese tariffs.<\/p><p>In the various trade agreements which have been entered into by this country so far a great deal of solicitude has been shown on the part of the Government for the coal trade of this country, and rightly so, but I submit that the coal trade is not the only important trade in this country. The cotton trade is nearly as important as regards numbers, and just as important as regards our export trade. It is also in one of the most acute of the depressed areas, and the Government, in formulating their policy with regard to trading agreements, should turn their eyes for a moment from the interests of coal and devote a little more time to the interests of cotton.<\/p>",

These were sent to the Governor of the Colony, who presented the chronometer to the captain, but by that time the mate had left for England. Accordingly, the American binoculars were consigned by the Governor of the Colony to this mercantile marine officer, care of the Board of Trade. The binoculars were dutiable articles and\nwe witnessed the anomaly of a man who was receiving a gift from a foreign Government for an act of great gallantry being called upon to pay duty. Obviously, we could not ask him to pay the duty, but hon. Members will appreciate that the Board of Trade legally had no funds whereby to pay the duty. I am not going to explain in what way the difficulty was overcome. There was no particular generosity, but we conspired over the matter, and the man received the binoculars.

            "body": "<p>I should like briefly, without any undue repetition of\nwhat my hon. Friend the Member for Elland (Mr. Levy) has already so ably stated, draw attention to the bare facts of Japanese competition in the Cotton Trade. I need not stress the importance of Lancashire and its staple industry to Members of this House. Hon. Members know that during last year Lancashire exported one-sixth of the total visible exports of the country; a total of some &#163;62,000,000 out of &#163;365,000,000. Hon. Members know likewise that out of some 12,000,000 insured workers in this country no fewer than 518,000 of these find their livelihood in the cotton trade. Hon. Members likewise know that a sum of no less than &#163;500,000,000 or more is invested in the various enterprises scattered throughout Lancashire. It can therefore be seen that the prosperity of England cannot be thoroughly restored unless this most important lynch pin in its economic structure can be brought back to some form of prosperity.<\/p><p>The prosperity of Lancashire has been seriously shaken during the last quarter of a century by what I might call the rocket-like outburst of Japanese economic activity. Only a quarter of a century ago Japan exported some 40,000,000 yens' worth of goods, and to-day she exports 1,200,000,000 yens' worth. It was only in 1853, some 80 years ago, that Commander Perry of the United States Navy first entered the harbour of Tokio. From that date Japan has been steadily forging ahead, especially in the cotton trade, where a quarter of a century ago she only had some 750,000 spindles, and now has 6,750,000.<\/p><p>It was during the War, when our manufacturers were concentrating upon fulfilling the needs of our troops on the Western and Near Eastern fronts, that Japan launched her big economic offensive and snatched from us our most potential Eastern markets but, unlike the tailor of Hong Kong, who, when asked to copy a pair of trousers, included the patch as well, the Japanese avoided many of the mistakes which we may possibly have made in our Lancashire cotton industry. They have followed a severe system of rationalisation and centralisation. If we look at the bare facts of the position we see that 70 per cent. of the raw cotton imported into Japan is manipulated by three big firms. We see that the Japanese Cotton\nSpinning Association controls no less than 97 per cent. of the spindles in the whole of Japan, while the export of 40 per cent. of the finished yarn is controlled likewise by three big companies. I understand that negotiations are now proceeding with Mr. Matsuoka, the Japanese Ambassador. If so, I presume they will fall within the structure of the World Economic Conference. I presume they will centre round the stabilisation of currencies. The stabilisation of the yen might certainly do something to check Japanese competition, but it can of itself do nothing to check those longer hours and lower wages which place the Japanese in a position of advantage against the skilled and experienced Lancashire workers.<\/p><p>If an agreement cannot be reached&#8212;and I see enormous difficulties in its way &#8212;is it too much to ask that the Empire should take a united stand against this frontal attack? At Ottawa a new idea was formed, a new economic cement was cast between the British-Speaking nations in the four corners of the globe. This new idea was to pool their resources and to pull together for the common good. If we realise that throughout our Empire there are numerous rich and splendid Dependencies which rely upon us both for Aerial and Naval defence in time of need, is it too much to ask of them that, in consideration for what we give to them, they should give preference to our goods? I will quote only the case of Ceylon. I know that numerous difficulties stand in the way of my right hon. Friend, but when we realise that Ceylon exports to us 112,000,000 rupees worth of goods and takes only 42,000,000 rupees worth in return, while Japanese goods, especially cotton goods, are mounting rapidly month by month in that market, is it too much to ask that the people of Ceylon should give some better consideration to the great Power which protects them and looks after their welfare?<\/p><p>The Lancashire cotton industry, which I say without hesitation or flattery is the most skilled in the world, cannot stand this Japanese onslaught of longer hours, lower wages and reduced standards of living. In this country, throughout 100 years, we have struggled to maintain humane conditions for our workers. We have struggled, often with bitter industrial strife, to maintain a fair ratio of\nremuneration, but all these advantages obtained after so much effort and striving will be bound to go by the board if we cannot do something to resist this Japanese competition.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland,(Sir R. Hamilton) in referring to the speech of the Foreign Secretary said he knew the Free Trade arguments. I also may claim to know them. Not only was I familiar with the Free Trade arguments when I had the honour to belong to the party of the hon. Member who has just spoken, but, since I left that, party, some seven years ago, I have tried to keep myself familiar with the Free Trade arguments. There is hardly a textbook on the subject which has appeared since then that I have not carefully perused and all I can say is, that the more I read of the Free Trade arguments, having regard to present conditions in this country and the world, the more convinced I am, not only of the\nsoundness but of the absolute necessity of the Government's policy. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland referred in somewhat contemptuous tones to the structure and draftsmanship of the Bill. He said in effect \"Never was such a thing heard of as that the Treasury should have the power to put on or remit taxes.\" He spoke with great assurance on that point. I presume he is referring to Clause 1 of the Bill but the proviso to that Clause says:\n<q>Provided that nothing in this Subsection shall authorise any such duty to be charged at a rate higher than the rate specified in Part I of the Second Schedule.<\/q>\n6.0 p.m.<\/p><p>The hon. Gentleman himself was a member of a Government which passed the Abnormal Importations (Customs Duties) Act, and that Measure gave power to the Board of Trade, by Order in Council, to impose or reduce or remit taxes within the limit of 100 per cent. duty. That power was absolute, and the tax came into operation before it was approved of by the House of Commons. I presume that this is the new constitutional issue which is being raised by the hon. Member. He says \"Never did a Bill give power to a Government Department to affect a tax.\" Why the limitations in this case are precise and the proposal is mild compared with the Act which the hon. Gentleman allowed the Government of which he was a Member to carry into law. To my surprise, he also referred in scathing terms to the quota and said that nobody could consistently support a quota who was not also in favour of the nationalisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange Am I right or wrong in saying that the hon. Gentleman was a Member of a Government which passed the Wheat Quota Act? That was not so long ago&#8212;at any rate it was during the period when the hon. Gentleman was a Member of the Government&#8212;and I am surprised to hear that, by having given his imprimatur to that Measure, he has committed himself for the remainder of his political life to approval of the whole programme of Socialism. I want now to refer to the letter which was written by the right hon. Member for Darwen (Sir H. Samuel) and his colleagues when they resigned from the Government on the issue of this Ottawa Agreements Bill, and there was one phrase in that letter which ran like this:\n<q>The policy of Protection by limiting imports has cut into our exports, reduced by one-fourth our valuable re-export trade, and increased unemployment.<\/q>\nOne would think, on reading that, that the clear implication was that the statistics of our trade showed, with the force of an irresistible conclusion, not only that there had been a fall in our export trade, but that that fall was attributable to the policy of Protection adopted by the Government. What are the facts? In the nine months of this year our exports have fallen by &#163;21,000,000; in the nine months of last year, under Free Trade, our exports fell by &#163;150,000,000. Is there any conclusion to be drawn from that that the small fall of &#163;21,000,000 is entirely attributable to Protection, when under Free Trade we had a fall of &#163;150,000,000? Our re-export trade, which, according to this letter, has been destroyed by tariffs, has fallen &#163;9,000,000 this year, and fell &#163;20,000,000 last year, under Free Trade. Where, therefore, is there any evidence for such a sweeping assertion as is contained in that dogmatic sentence of the right hon. Member and his colleagues when they resigned?<\/p><p>So far from there being a fall in our export trade under the Protective system adopted by the Government, the contrary is the fact. In the first six months of this year&#8212;and it is a very astounding thing, when I give the figures of world trade by comparison&#8212;the volume of our exports was actually greater than it was last year. Both figures appear in the \"Board of Trade Journal.\" There is a 2.6 per cent. increase in the volume of the total trade of this country during the first six months of this year. There is a 6 per cent. fall in value, as compared with a 35 per cent. fall under Free Trade, but, in spite of a 6 per cent. fall in value, there is actually a 2.6 per cent. increase in the volume of our exports. What is the position with the rest of the world? During the same six months the total world trade has decreased 28 per cent. in value, while our own decrease was 6 per cent., with actually an increase in volume.<\/p><p>Hon. Members may say that the first six months' period is too early to judge by, and that I should take a period a little later, when Protection had had a little longer application. Let us then take the latest figures that are available,\nthose for the second quarter of this year, and compare them with the corresponding period of last year, and we shall find that the figures are still more against the contentions of the right hon. Gentleman and his friends in their letter. In the second quarter of this year the exports in value are only 1 per cent. down on the second quarter of last year&#8212;that is practically the same&#8212;and, of course, much greater in volume, and in that same second quarter the world trade diminished by the same percentage as I have given, namely, 28 per cent. I ask, in the teeth of those statistics, whether anyone who is not completely blinded by prejudice could be guilty of such an assertion as is contained in that letter of resignation of the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues. Really, I find it extremely difficult, even making the fullest allowance for prejudice, to be convinced of the intellectual honesty&#8212;I qualify it with that adjective&#8212;of my hon. Friend's argument.<\/p><p>Let me take some more statistics, and I do not want only to mention these in connection with the arguments of my hon. Friend, but I want to mention them as of great importance to this country as a whole and to the trade on which my constituency depends more than on, any other, and that is the cotton trade. It must be a trade which my hon. Friend will agree is relevant in considering what effect tariffs have had on the trade of this country, because it was always thought, 'or at least said, that if there was one county in this country that had kept this country to Free Trade, it was Lancashire, dependent as it was on its cotton trade&#8212;Lancashire, 80 per cent. of whose total production used to go abroad, almost completely dependent on the export trade, which was always given as the one example of a trade which would be damnified by a system of tariffs in this country.<\/p><p>What are the facts with regard to Lancashire? You would have thought that at least Lancashire would have benefited less than the rest of the country, if the arguments with which we were so familiar in the past had any basis in fact under present conditions. The statistics are amazing, because during the first nine months of this year the exports of cotton goods from this country have increased in value by 20 per cent. and in volume,\nwhich is far more important, as directly affecting employment, by 32 per cent., as compared with last year. Those are really astonishing figures. I will not venture to be so bold as to assign the precise causes for that increase in trade&#8212;[HON. MEMBERS: \"Hear, hear!\"]&#8212;but I shall have a word or two to say about it, and I advise hon. Members who say \"Hear, hear\" not to be too pleased at my reticence. At least, I shall not fall into the error of attributing a fall which they thought was existent, but which was in fact non-existent, to tariffs. It is significant that the industry which they relied on as their best proof of the damage to be done by Protection has, under Protection, had this very extraordinary revival in trade.<\/p><p>Look at the individual countries to which these increases in cotton exports have taken place, and the facts there also are very illuminating. I have been through them all very carefully, and analysed them. The largest increase in the exports of our cotton trade is to British India. That was only to be expected, because India was the largest market for our cotton goods, but the next largest increase was to Australia, the third to British Africa, the fourth to Hong Kong and Malay, the fifth to China, and the sixth and seventh to New Zealand and the British West Indies. There were relatively large increases to all these countries, and of all that I have mentioned there is only one that is not in the British Empire, and that is China, where we know that the increase in the value of silver has had a good effect on our trade.<\/p><p>Although there is a general increase in cotton exports there have been some decreases to individual countries, and it is very significant to look at this, particularly in the light of some of the arguments that we have heard from those benches. The decreases in the cotton exports are to the Gold Standard countries, and that is a very significant fact. The decreases are to Germany, the United States of America, Belgium, France, and Switzerland. I think I am right in saying that every one of those countries is a Gold Standard country, and yet we were told by the hon. Members sitting there, \"Oh, because we have gone off gold, that is an additional reason why we must not have tariffs. There might have been something to be said for them\nwhen we were on the Gold Standard\"&#8212;although one never heard any arguments for even temporarily abandoning Free Trade when we were on the Gold Standard&#8212;\"but the moment we go off the Gold Standard we are all right, we have an automatic check. Automatically our imports will diminish and our exports will increase when we are off the Gold Standard.\"<\/p><p>How then is it that our exports in the cotton trade, one of the main exporting industries of this country, have gone down to the Gold Standard countries? And, remember, the premium on exports applies only to the Gold Standard countries; it does not apply to those countries which have linked their currencies to sterling at all. It is only with regard to the Gold Standard countries that the bonus or stimulus to exports applies at all, and yet in the case of the cotton industry we find, in the case of every one of those Gold Standard countries, there has been a decline in our exports to them, and, with regard to the countries to which there has been an increase in exports, they are most of them linked to sterling and are within the British Empire. I think those are very significant facts as to the success of the policy which has been adopted by the Government.<\/p><p>There is one more thing with regard to, the cotton trade which I wish to mention, and here I think I speak the voice of those engaged in the industry. It has been said that Ottawa has been a failure with regard to the cotton trade because in respect to India the question of cotton goods was not specifically dealt with at Ottawa, and also, with regard to Canada the cotton delegation came back before the Conference took place. In fact, I believe that the cotton trade and those certainly who are best informed in it are delighted with the Agreement with India which was made at Ottawa, and they are delighted for this reason, that there has been established for the first time with India the principle of preference, and that they regard as of the greatest importance. It is true that cotton goods were not dealt with specifically, because that, matter was <i>sub judice<\/i> and had been referred to the Tariff Board in India, but can there be any doubt, if the Agreement as a whole with India is ratified by the Indian Legislature, that the result of the adoption of the system of preference will\nbe that there will be considerable advantages to Lancashire with regard to the export of cotton goods to India? Anyway, I am full of hope on the subject, and I shall be extremely disappointed if, as a result of Ottawa, there is not a very considerable advantage to the cotton trade of this country.<\/p><p>I have referred to the question of going off the Gold Standard. It was the argument that was raised by the Free Traders against our adopting Protection that we had this automatic balance which would inevitably come about through being off the Gold Standard. I have shown that it has not operated with regard to the cotton trade, but even if it had, I ask them to consider how that would have acted. They will admit, at any rate, that the tariffs which have been imposed&#8212;and remember that we had the abnormal duties of 50 per cent. for some months&#8212;must have acted as some check on imports, and fortunately they have not acted as much as a check on exports. Suppose we had not got these tariffs. We have got the obstacle to imports in the present depreciation of sterling operating in addition to the tariffs. Without those tariffs, there would have had to be a much greater fall in the value of sterling to have had the same check upon imports.<\/p><p>Even now I doubt very much whether we have not got an adverse trade balance to-day, taking into consideration invisible exports as well. That has been masked to some extent by the revival of world confidence in the future of this country. We know that one of the purposes of the establishment of the Exchange Equalisation Account was rather at that time to prevent sterling going up, because the short-term foreign balances were coming back into the City of London, but if you had not had any system of tariffs instituted as a remedy for our adverse balance of trade, you would have had none of this revival of confidence on the part of the foreigner, and you would not only have had a further fall in your exchange to compensate for not having the assistance of tariffs as a check to imports, but you would have had this non-revival of world confidence in this country, and you might have had a very serious fall in the value of sterling.<\/p><p>What would have been the effect of that? It would certainly have checked\nimports, but it would have checked them by increasing their value all round. It is all very well to-day to attack the Ottawa Agreements, and to try to tell the masses of the country, \"Your food will cost you more for there has been a whole imposition of new food taxes.\" The whole policy of the Liberal party was to let the pound drop and drop until there was an automatic balance of foreign trade; as a result of that, it would not have been a 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. ad valorem; you would have had a very high percentage tax on the food of the poor. The policy of the Liberal party, which was no remedy, was to leave things to find their own level with this country off the Gold Standard. The result would have been a tremendous real tax on the food of the poorest people.<\/p><p>Nobody will deny that the tendency today is towards the development of science and the improvement of machinery and to render less advantageous the natural advantages which those countries which have hitherto been the main manufacturing countries have enjoyed. The cotton trade was first established in Lancashire because of the advantages of the climate. To-day, the humidifier in a mill almost does away with any advantage that may be attributable to climate. In fact, it is rather an advantage to rely on a humidifier than on the actual climate, because you have it under greater control and can regulate it and adapt it to the particular needs of your product. The tendency must be throughout the world for there to be no special advantages in any one given country in the production of manufactured goods, because machinery and science will counterbalance natural advantages and the human element to a great extent. That is one of the tendencies which the Free Trader has entirely ignored because the economics of the Free Trade system were built up on the reliance of other countries on the manufactures of this country. Other countries have been refusing to take these manufactured goods, either by putting up higher tariffs against us, or by developing their own industries.<\/p><p>If we are to be wise as a country and to take a long view, we must adapt ourselves to these facts. It will not be wise to try to rely entirely on being able to sell our manufactured goods abroad and to buy all our food from abroad.\nWe must develop our agriculture as well so as to get a more balanced production in this country. Furthermore, we must seek markets for our manufactured goods where we are likely to find them. I have heard many arguments raised against the Ottawa Agreements, but I have never heard it said that there are any countries in the world which are more likely to be potential customers of ours than the countries whose main production of wealth is in primary and not manufactured products. Obviously, we are more likely to find markets for our manufactured products in the Empire than in almost any other foreign country. If there is one territory which is fruitful soil for our markets in manufactured goods, that territory is pre-eminently the Empire. On their own arguments, members of the Liberal party ought to support the policy which has been started at Ottawa.<\/p><p>There is another fact which, I think, most people will agree is the real basic difficulty in the way of world trade to-day and the proper functioning of an international monetary system. If there is one basic fact more than another, it is the attempt which is being made by countries to-day to maintain export surpluses and favourable balances of payments without a corresponding lending on the other side. When we were the one creditor nation and the one great exporting nation, the international monetary system of the world, though it was based on gold, worked quite smoothly because we were always prepared to re-lend the balance of our surpluses. That does not apply to the United States of America to-day. It is all very well saying that it ought to apply. Surely America will gain sense and see the true light of wisdom, but we know how difficult; it is to get democracies to move, and we have heard a great deal about the extraordinary difficulty of showing the ordinary voter in the Middle West what may be in his ultimate interest 20, 30 or 100 years hence. But we must try to base our policy on the assumption that America will not see the truth of that of her own accord immediately as the result of some fine international agreement which admittedly would be in the interest of the world at large. We must assume that they will come to the realisation of the truth only by bitter\nexperience. The way is not to fold our hands and say that we will open our ports to goods coming from America and allow them to maintain a favourable trade balance with us, as the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs told us in his marvellously powerful speech. America would allow the favourable balance to go on, and the result would be that sterling would go to nothing and there would never be a chance of restoring the world.<\/p><p>There is only one practical way of dealing with America on this question, and that is the way which the Government have announced as their policy. If America will not relend her export balances, she must be brought to the conclusion that she cannot have any surplus balances. She must lose her export trade if she tries to maintain a position which is contrary to natural law. This is not a subject of economics upon which there might be some differences of opinion. It is a basic principle of natural law that you cannot maintain a surplus without relending the balance. It may be difficult to get America to realise that. In the meantime we must make America realise it in the only way it can be done, and that is by practical experience. Her trade will fall off, and we can go to America and say, \"You sell us &#163;100,000,000 more than you buy from us. If you will not buy more from us, we will buy less from you.\" She might then be prepared to take more imports and that, in itself, would stop this basic difficulty, which, I believe, is the cancer at the root of the world economic system to-day.<\/p><p>It has been said over and over again with absolute truth that Ottawa will help the World Economic Conference. I believe that it will, but I take the view that it will be foolish of us to fold our arms and wait until wisdom has come to either the United States or to France. It may take time for these things to be fully realised by these two great countries, but, in the meantime, we must take such steps as will allow us to weather the storm. World prosperity will inevitably return. Until this Government came in, I was terribly afraid that this country would not share in a return of world prosperity, but as a result of the policy which has been adopted by the Government, I am certain that we shall share fully in that return to prosperity. In the meantime,\nwe have taken such steps as will enable us to weather the storm.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>The Ministers who are attending at the Lausanne Conference have a difficult enough task in dealing with War debts, which amount to some &#163;2,000,000,000 or so, and involve annual transfer payments in the neighbourhood of &#163;100,000,000. But the task of the Ministers who go to Ottawa will be very much more difficult than that which has to be fulfilled at Lausanne. There Great Britain will be a creditor country, which is owed by the rest of the world, on capital or loan account, a sum of something in the nature of &#163;4,000,000,000 on which the transfer payment and interest amount in a normal year to some &#163;200,000,000. A large part of the money owed on that account is owed by our Dominions and our Colonies.<\/p><p>One of the subjects which must be discussed at Ottawa before any policy on tariffs or quotas can be made effective at all is as to how existing interest payments can be made by debtor countries, and whether the present trade policy of this country is adapted to facilitate payments by debtor countries. Our trade policy at the present moment, as I understand it, and I think it has been so for a generation past, is to desire to build up a favourable balance of payments. Before the War we were able to build up a position in which the favourable balance was as much as &#163;200,000,000 in a year. At the same time it has not been our policy to accept payment in gold because that would have blocked the world's monetary system. What we have done has been to take interest payment clue to us on our favourable balance and re-lend it either to the Dominions or to foreign countries. That might fairly be described as a policy of compound interest. If you take the interest payment in any one year and then re-lend it abroad you are in fact re-lending compound interest.<\/p><p>I believe that that is the fundamental factor to-day in the trade depression throughout the world, for will the Committee consider for a moment what a powerful engine compound interest really is? I asked a friend of mine in the\nHouse the other day whether he had any conception of the power which compound interest has as an engine, and whether he could tell me roughly what he thought, say, a penny invested at 6 per cent. compound interest would become in amount if it had been invested at the beginning of the Christian era. A penny is not a large sum. Invested at 6 per cent. at the beginning of the Christian era the general answer I got was, \"Oh, it may be &#163;1,000,000,000 or &#163;2,000,000,000.\" In fact, so powerful and tremendous is the weapon of compound interest that the actual sum is almost past belief. It is ingots of gold the size of the earth arriving at the rate of one a second over a period of three hundred thousand million years. That is the tremendous power of cumulative compound interest.<\/p><p>That is our trade policy to-day. Our trade policy is not one based on a penny invested at compound interest; we have &#163;4,000,000,000 invested which before the War was accumulating at the rate of &#163;200,000,000 a year. I would not like to go into an era of the length of the Christian era but at the end of the century it would involve a capital payment owing to this country of no less than &#163;500,000,000,000, and an annual interest payment of &#163;26,000,000,000. When one realises that we are not the only creditor country, and that the United States of America and France, the other great creditor countries, are probably owed on loan account as much as we are, one can see that by the end of the century,, if we and they pursued the trade policy we are all pursuing to-day we should have accumulated at least double the amount. That is the real crux of our policy, which must be examined either before we go to Ottawa or when we get there. In connection with the private accumulations of wealth, we have discovered that it was disastrous to accumulate private fortunes at compound interest, but we do not seem to have discovered that fact yet in our dealings with international or inter-imperial trade. In this country a private individual named Thellusson attempted to accumulate his fortune on compound interest, but a special Act of Parliament was passed to prevent those accumulations for a period longer than the life or lives in being, and 21 years thereafter. In addition, modern society has put on Surtaxes and Death Duties to prevent\ngreat accumulations of wealth; but there is nothing of the nature of Surtax or Death Duties in regard to the compound interest policy internationally.<\/p><p>The only barriers that have prevented these vast accumulations from becoming absolutely insupportable and intolerable in the past have been the very barriers which the world wants to break down&#8212;wars&#8212;following wars countries have repudiated, as Germany and France did in the Great War&#8212;ordinary repudiations or, so to speak, national bankruptcies, where a nation defaults, or cannot pay, or asks for a moratorium. Then there are the bankruptcies of individual companies operating in foreign countries or in the Dominions. These have been the forces up to date which have prevented enormous accumulations in one country of the vast interest payments that have to pass through the channels of monetary mechanism and through the channels of international or imperial trade. The world does not wish to follow the path of war in settling these vast international debts, nor do they want to pursue the policy of repudiation. The number of committees that have been set up recently to follow events in Chili, Brazil or Mexico is clear proof that the modern investor does not particularly favour repudiation. But our trade policy, as I understand it, the classical trade policy of this country, which is to re-lend abroad every year the interest that we receive from abroad, does drive these countries into the very position in which in the end, they must, I think, repudiate, because the sums become larger than they can possibly pay.<\/p><p>One asks the question: Is there no means which the Ottawa Conference can devise to avoid this difficulty? These vast payments are absolutely clogging the new production that the world ought to be making now. We might be paid in gold or in commodities. Strictly, we cannot be paid in gold, because we should have to re-lend it on compound interest, and the difficulty would again arise. We could be paid in two commodities, firstly, those which may be called perishable, which are consumed and the debt is paid. That would be the best form in which we could accept payment. Take such perishables as meat, wheat and so on. But we are anxious now to develop in our own country the production of those commodi-\nties. Even if we were to receive from abroad far more than we are now receiving of perishable commodities, it still would not enable either the Dominions or those foreign countries to meet their liabilities to us. I believe that in the end we shall have to face this situation&#8212;either they must to some extent repudiate by cutting their interest rates or they must repudiate altogether, or we shall have to find a form of payment which they can make to us, and a form which is not in perishable commodities.<\/p><p>The only thing that I can think of is that the great creditor countries for a time will have to pile up within their own country non-perishable commodities, such as metals of various kinds, anything which is non-perishable, take them in stock and store them. I believe that is the only way in which they can do it. That would be analogous to what happens in time of war. In the old days of war the victorious country took from the vanquished country a valuable piece of territory, possibly containing mines. We no longer do that. We do not take territory, but what we could very well do would be to take the products of mines and accept them as a capital payment. Every year we are exhausting our own coal mines. Every year there is a capital asset which is vanishing. The only thing that we can do is to let these foreign countries and Dominions, who have difficulty in paying what they owe us, to pay us as I suggest on capital account any non-perishable products that they may be able to pay, so that we can store them. If we still pursue the trade policy of re-lending at compound interest there can be no solution other than repudiation.<\/p><p>9.0 p.m.<\/p><p>Many speeches were made during the Finance Bill on the question of raising the price level. No doubt that is a question that will be discussed at Ottawa. In many of the speeches that were made to-day reference was made to the silver question. I have some personal interest in that matter, because I am connected with those who mine silver and other metals, but what I have to say is not of necessity anything which is said merely and solely by those who are interested in the production of precious\nmetals. In any case, as the House knows, the vast bulk of silver that is produced is produced from lead mines. Therefore, people are much more interested in the price of lead than in the price of silver. In regard to silver, I would suggest that the Government might take action even before the Ottawa Conference if they could induce the Indian Government to give a lead to the world on this matter. If the price of silver could be raised slightly there is not the slightest doubt that it would greatly improve our trade in India and the Far East. That is a matter that has been disputed by those who have trade connections with the East. Therefore, I venture to quote from the Report of the Commission which was recently sent to Hong Kong to inquire into the Hong Kong currency. In regard to the question whether or not the value of silver has an effect on our trade with the Far East, the Report says:\n<q>If, for example, the Straits Settlements dollar had remained on a silver basis, the dollar prices of Malaya's principal exports, rubber and tin, would have remained much steadier than they have been in recent years, and the contrast between the high values of the post-war boom and the low values of the present slump would have been much less pronounced. Similarly, Indo-China's rice crops would to-day be worth nearly as many piastres as they were two or three years ago instead of little more than half as many.<\/q>\nThat is from the report of a commission which was sent to Hong Kong quite recently.<\/p><p>There is one other way in which the fall in the value of silver has affected our trade in the Far East. The figures of our total export trade for the years 1923 to 1925 were 27 per cent. greater than in 1930. That is to say, that by 1930 the fall in our total export trade had been 27 per cent., but the fall in our trade to China was 52 per cent., to Hong Kong 35 per cent., and to India, 40 per cent. In the case of these three, China, Hong Kong and India, there was a vastly greater fall in our export trade than in our export trade to the world as a whole. Those figures cannot be explained on any other basis that that the fall in the value of silver profoundly affected our export trade to the Far East. The suggestion I make is that if the Indian Government would announce now, or at the Ottawa Conference, that they are prepared for\none year to withhold their sales of Government demonetised silver, it would be a lead which the rest of the world might very well follow. A truce declared by the Government which has been the principal seller of silver&#8212;it was Great Britain and India which started the sale of Government demonetised silver, followed by France and Indo-China&#8212;would be a lead which would be readily followed in the United States and France. The British Empire, according to the latest figures of production, has a greater production of silver than the United States of America, and accordingly we have an interest in this matter; but I think that the lead should be given by the Indian Government, if it is given by anyone.<\/p><p>I was glad to hear the Secretary of State say that we must not be unmindful of our own industries, and that he did not omit agriculture. But he did not mention the one word I should like to have heard him mention, and that is beef. All through our discussions on the Finance Bill and yesterday and to-day we have heard about pigs and milk and mutton and lamb, but beef has never been mentioned. I take it, and I hope, that whenever negotiations are opened for the restoration of agriculture within the Empire beef will not be forgotten; and more particularly the home producer of beef in this country.<\/p><p>For the last five years I have gone about the country working on behalf of an organisation under the leadership of the Noble Lord the Member for Fylde (Lord Stanley) and I have come in contact with the youth of the country. The organisation for which I have been working, the Junior Imperial League, has about 2,000 branches and probably 250,000 members, and if there is one thing in which they are taking a greater interest than any other it is in the development of inter-Imperial relationships and Empire trade, and they are looking to the Government and to the Ottawa Conference to do something in laying the foundation of an inheritance for the future. In the meetings I have held no question has aroused greater interest than the development of the Empire and the Conference that is to take place at Ottawa, and I am positive that if the National Government elected on a national vote can lay the foundation stone of an Imperial building the\nyounger generation of this country, when they come to this House and take our place, will be ready and willing to lay the coping stone of that Imperial building which we hope the Government will commence this year at Ottawa.<\/p>",

He also said that if we stopped these fluctuations of silver it would improve our trade with China very much. The idea at the bottom of this Amendment is to put up prices and our Eastern trade right, but I disagree with my right hon. Friend about China; I do not think the Amendment would help the China trade a bit. China buys about &#163;124,000,000 worth of goods from the rest of the world, and we trace that she sells about &#163;84,000,000, but some more goods go out via the north by caravan, which we are not able to trace. If by this Amendment the price of silver goes up, it will make it twice as dear and difficult for us to buy the goods which China wants to sell in order to pay for the goods which she buys from us. If my right hon. Friends repeat that our Eastern trade will benefit by putting silver as one of the metals for the equalisation of the exchange, I reply that thorn will be created no Eastern price stabilisation, and no good done to China.<\/p><p>Here is a speech made by the Chairman of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank at Hong Kong a few weeks ago, which I think will interest the Committee and supply the answer, without the slightest doubt, to my right hon. Friend the Member for Sparkbrook. On this speech I base my opposition to his proposal, and not only on my own opinion, and therefore I shall vote against the Amendment. The Chairman of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank says:\n<q>Many Chinese as well as foreigners hold the view that the stabilisation of the rate of exchange between silver and gold would be a mixed blessing to China, and that a sudden artificial rise would have extremely harmful results. It is frequently argued that a rise in the purchasing value of silver would render China a better customer of the world's goods. This is true to the limited extent to which silver might be brought out of hoard for the purchase of foreign products, but &#8230; China, like all countries, buys her imports by means of her exports, and it is upon the quantity of the latter, and not on the price of silver, that her capacity to buy from abroad really depends. Silver is merely the medium of exchange, the intrinsic value of which is of purely temporary importance.<\/q>\nThat puts my right hon. Friend's China argument out of court&#8212;that alone. If he says that we shall help our Eastern trade by the use of the silver Amendment, quite apart from my own knowledge of the Indian aspect of the question, I think this argument of the Chairman of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation is sufficient reason for opposing the Amendment.<\/p>",

Ceylon was not mentioned in the speech of the Colonial Secretary, and perhaps the Under-Secretary will tell us something about it. Ceylon has a new constitution to which all parties agreed, and I would like to ask how it is working. It was understood that Ceylon would have a large measure of self-government. We had a wonderful report which was accepted by all parties, and I remember the Secretary of State said:\n<q>The domestic interests of the people of Ceylon would be in the keeping of its elected representatives.<\/q>\nIs that so to-day? Has the right hon. Gentleman seen in the Ceylon Press reports complaining that the decisions of the State Council are too often negatived by the arbitrary exercise of the Governor's power of veto? I understand that there is a widespread indignation in regard to that action, and I would like to ask the Under-Secretary of State to tell us what is the position there, and to say whether it is possible to have the matter complained of remedied.<\/p><p>Another matter in which I am particularly interested is the present state of affairs in Hong Kong especially so far as mui-tsai is concerned. During the time that I was at the Colonial Office I remember on one occasion the right hon.\nGentleman, the Member for Epping, said in 1921 that nothing short of the abolition of mui-tsai would meet his wishes. In 1923 registration and inspection was set up in an ordinance issued by the Duke of Devonshire, and only a year ago the present Foreign Secretary raised the debate in this House on mui-tsai in Hong Kong, which, in my opinion is child slavery, and I have no doubt that it ought to be abolished. I agree with the Foreign Secretary's statement on this subject in which he said only a year ago that there should be more inspection and better registration, and that we ought to see that, as far as possible, mui-tsai was abolished. The right hon. Gentleman is now in the Government, and those who spoke in support of him are also members of the Treasury bench. I wonder what has been done in regard to this subject since the present Government were appointed? What have they done to deal with mui-tsai in Hong Kong? What is the position at this moment? Has mui-tsai in Hong Kong been in any way decreased, or are we moving to the time when it will be abolished which is the only satisfactory way of dealing with it.<\/p><p>My last point concerns working and labour conditions in another part of the Empire, namely, the South Sea Islands. I want to ask a few questions about the labour conditions in the group of islands centred by Fiji. Those at the Colonial Office know that contract labour still prevails there, and men are being taken long distances away from their wives and families to other distant islands. The conditions there are bad, and I would like to ask if the Governor of Fiji, in his visit to these islands at the end of last year, investigated the labour conditions there, and if he has made a report thereon? Has that report been received and what is the nature of it?<\/p><p>I have now finished my inquiries into these particular matters. I look upon it as our duty in this House, irrespective of party, to work towards the end of Empire co-operation and development and to care for these peoples. We need to encourage elementary, technical and scientific education so that the natives may take their fair and just part in the economic and political government of each colony. It is necessary, if we are to combat successfully all the known diseases of human\nbeings and animals in the tropics, that there must be greater progress made to get the natives to take up medicine, agriculture, veterinary and other services. So long as we are their trustees we should have more opportunities for debate in this House on Colonial development and progress and a full and free ventilation of all their problems. I welcome this debate. I know how inadequately it deals with this vast subject, but I hope that we shall have further opportunities of debating not only the problems which the right hon. Gentleman and myself have mentioned, but also those affecting many other parts of our Colonial Empire.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I desire on this Vote to ask the First Lord whether he will make as full a statement as possible with regard to the progress of the works that are being carried out in connection with the all-important Naval strategic base at Singapore. Neither in the White Paper nor in the speech that the First Lord made in bringing in the\nEstimates was this important base mentioned at all. I do not think the importance of the construction of the base is fully realised by the House or the country. I do not think it can be stressed too often why this base is necessary. I do not think any foreign Power considers its construction as a menace. They fully realise that it is necessary for this country to be able to maintain the security of its vast interests in Far Eastern waters. Singapore is the greatest port in those Far Eastern waters. In 1926, some 25,000,000 tons of shipping used it, 11,000,000 tons of which was British shipping.<\/p><p>That shows the vast importance of our trade interests in the Far East. Geographically, Singapore is situated midway between India and China, and on that account it obtains a very great strategic value for the defence of our vast interests, not only from the trade point of view but from the point of view of our Dominions and possessions in that part of the world. I do not think there can be any difference of opinion amongst Members as to the immense importance it is for this country to continue the construction of that base, and have it brought to completion as soon as possible. In the mind of those who are on the spot, there is not the slightest doubt on this important point. The Federated Malay States, Hong Kong and New Zealand have up to date contributed no less than &#163;2,022,000 towards the construction of the base. That sum was provided in order that the work might be accelerated, but I am sorry to say that has not been done.<\/p><p>At the Imperial Conference of 1930, it was agreed that the ultimate establishment of the base should be maintained, and that the work should be proceeded with in connection with the Jackson contract, and also with the air base. I should like the First Lord to tell us how far the work in connection with the Jackson contract has gone. I put a question yesterday as to the construction of the graving dock, and received the reply that the entrance to the graving dock was about one-half completed and the excavation for the body of the dock, had been commenced. After all these years one would imagine that the progress of the work should have been far greater than that. There is nothing being done with regard to the construction of the air\nbase. I should like to ask when this work of the Jackson contract is likely to be completed, and when it is completed, whether it will then be possible for a fleet of heavy ships to be sent out to operate in those waters should the occasion arise. At present, it is impossible for a fleet of heavy ships to be sent out to the Far East to defend our immense interests, because they would have to rely upon Malta as a base, which is 5,000 miles away. I understand that the Jackson contract consists only of work to be carried out on the graving dock. The graving dock by itself is quite useless, unless there is also carried out the construction of the dockyard workshops to enable the fleet to be refitted and repaired as necessary. I would ask the First Lord to give some information on that very important point.<\/p><p>There was also at the 1930 Conference a recommendation that the expenditure for the equipment of the docks and for defence work should be postponed for five years, when the matter would again be reviewed in the light of the relevant conditions then prevailing. That means to say that, so far as the construction of the base is concerned, nothing whatever is to be carried out except the construction of the graving dock. That is a very serious condition of affairs. It means that only in 1935 the question is to be reviewed as to what is to be done with regard to the construction of dockyard workshops and of the air base and land defences of Singapore. It may mean that four, five or more years may then pass before the base can possibly be completed. The country is, therefore, in this position that for about another 10 years, if this policy is pursued, there will be no base in the Far Eastern waters where a fleet of heavy ships can be sent in order to safeguard our immense interests in that part of the world. I hope that the First Lord will be able to give some assurance to the House that this policy will be brought up for review and will be reversed, and that we shall go ahead with the construction of this most important base, in order to be in a position to send out a fleet of heavy ships to defend our interests in that part of the world.<\/p>",

It may be difficult to define exactly what a pacifist is, but at any rate he was a Socialist and a representative of his party. He described the Army as an armed police force. In the opinion of Mr. Shaw, the maximum of economy had already been achieved; but within six months of that date the Army Council were asked by His Majesty's Government to make further reductions in expenditure of &#163;3,500,000. These plain facts will give the House some idea of what was put before the Army Council in the autumn of last year, and what they were asked to do becomes still more stupendous when we remember that out of the &#163;40,000,000 which last year represented the Army Estimates &#163;8,750,000 was for non-effective charges for pensions, etc., with which the Army Council could not interfere.<\/p><p>I think it is very much to the credit of the Army Council that they were able to achieve the economies demanded of them, in view of the fact that the economies already made had, in the opinion of Mr. Shaw, reached the maximum. All credit should be given, especially to the military members of the Army Council, without whose cooperation, and without whose suggestions and advice, often given much against the grain in advising things as to the desirability of which they had the gravest doubts, these economies could not have been achieved. They acted in the desire to carry out the orders of the Government, orders which they understood were necessary for the welfare of the country at the time. With other members of the Army Council they assisted in attaining the results, and I think a real debt of gratitude is due to the military members of the Army Council from the House of Commons and the country. These economies are a result of the events of what has been an exceptional and, as we hope, a unique year in our annals. They must not be taken, they cannot be taken, as the standard to which any future Estimates can be expected to conform. I will deal very shortly with some of the principal economies which have been made this year and the House will then see how impossible it will be for any Army Council to achieve similar economies in another year.<\/p><p>This is the first time since the economies of last autumn were introduced that a Minister representing the War Office has had an opportunity of addressing the House, and perhaps it would be as well if I were to explain, briefly, the nature of some of these economies, because I think a great deal of misunderstanding still exists with regard to them. One of the principal economies has been in connection with the pay of the Army. There seems to be an idea in the minds of some people that everybody's pay has been reduced, and that the Army is now being paid at a rate which the Army Council consider too low, of which they do not approve, and which they would like to raise at the earliest possible opportunity. That is not the case. As the House will remember, in 1925 a committee reported on the pay of the Army, and recom-\nmended that, in their opinion, at that time, the pay of junior officers and other ranks should be reduced. The rates had been fixed in 1919, when the cost of living was very high. They did not then recommend, that is, in 1925, that any reduction should be made in the pay of senior officers.<\/p><p>The Government in 1925 acted on their suggestion, and introduced the new rates of pay which they recommended. It was a question at the time whether those new rates should apply to the whole Army. The Government, rightly, in my opinion, took the view that it would be very hard on those who had joined the Army on the understanding&#8212;a tacit, implicit understanding, but nevertheless an understanding&#8212;that the rates of pay prevalent at the time they joined would be continued, if their pay were reduced in accordance with the recommendations of the committee. Therefore, it was decided that the new rates of pay should apply only to those joining the Army after October, 1925, when the new rates came into force. It was not that the new rates were too low, but it was felt that those who had joined at the old rates would have a legitimate grievance if they were reduced suddenly to the new rates. That decision was reversed in September of this year, when it was decided that everybody should be put upon the same rate of pay. Those who had joined before 1925 receiving the same rate as those who had joined since. It was a very severe hardship, an unmerited hardship for a man to be told suddenly that his pay was to be reduced after he had, possibly, entered into obligations on the justifiable assumption that his pay would continue at the old rates. That very real hardship was realised at the time, although it is not to be supposed that in our view anybody in the Army is receiving a rate of pay which is too low. Of course, by a subsequent decision of the Cabinet all reductions in pay were limited to a maximum of 10 per cent. of what they previously received.<\/p><p>The spirit in which those reductions were met is, in my opinion, worthy of a tribute from the Members of this House who voted for those reductions. Not only has there not been, in any unit of the Army, in any part of the world, the slightest manifestation of any open dis-\ncontent, but, so far as it has been possible to ascertain, there seems to have been a very great lack of that natural outlet for the relief of grievances such as grumbling, letters to the Press, and letters to Members of Parliament which have to be handed on to the Minister responsible. That applies to both officers and men in the Army. Really, I think that in September of this year there was in the British Army something of the spirit which possessed it in 1914. Once again the men of the Army felt that the sacrifices demanded of them were demanded in the interests of the whole country, and were necessary for the sake of the country, and when that is understood such sacrifices are always made generously and ungrudgingly. Lest there should be any misunderstanding with regard to senior officers, I would like to point out that, although no reduction has been made in their rate of pay as none was recommended by the 1925 committee, their pay was reduced by a further 3 per cent. in October, 1931, although it had already been reduced by one per cent. so short a time ago as July, 1931, making a reduction of 11 per cent. in all since 1919. This matter was not due to be examined again for two years, and therefore, as a direct result of the economies of September last, all senior officers have suffered a reduction in their pay, not to mention any who were in receipt of salaries of &#163;2,000 a year or over whose pay was reduced by a special cut of 10 per cent.<\/p><p>There has been some suggestion that the Reserve have been unfairly treated in this matter. May I point out that reductions in the pay of the Reserve have, when examined on a percentage basis, been larger than those in the pay of the serving soldier. The facts are, of course, that the Reserve receive their pay not in return for any work that they are actually performing at the time, because they are free to spend their whole time in any other employment, but merely as a retaining fee for their services should the need for them arise. It is well known that before the War a man on the Army Reserve was receiving 1s. or 6d. according to class. Last year he was receiving 1s. 6d. or 1s. Under the present arrangement he receives 1s. 3d. or 9d. Even allowing for the cost of living he is still receiving at least as much as before the War, and I cannot believe that any\nmember of the Reserve, with those facts and figures before him, can maintain that he has any legitimate ground of grievance.<\/p><p>Another very large economy has been effected by the decision that no annual Territorial Army camps will be held this year. This will save the country very nearly &#163;1,000,000. This decision was taken by the Army Council with the very greatest reluctance, because it was fully realised how valuable the Territorial Army is to the country. It was a heavy blow to ask the Territorial Army to give up their camp even for one year, because these camps are something to which they look forward from the beginning to the end of the year. It was almost as great a hardship as if the Estimates of the Fighting Forces were passed without Debate, which would deprive the responsible Ministers of their one annual chance of addressing the House of Commons. I think that what has been said about the Territorials is a wonderful tribute to that force, and I hope that they will accept this decision in the same spirit as other sacrifices have been accepted by the Regular Army. It should be clearly understood that, so far as it is possible to speak for the future, the Territorial Army will not be asked to repeat this sacrifice next year, because, if the Territorials were to go without the camps for two years in succession, that would be almost equivalent to disbanding them. I do not think that there is any danger of that happening, and in the Army Estimates for next year there will be &#163;1,000,000 required which there is no prospect of being able to save from any other source. Arrangements have been made to hold short week-end camps, and assistance in that direction will be welcomed by the War Office, because we want to give the Territorials as much encouragement as we can.<\/p><p>Another small matter in connection with the Territorial camps which appears to have caused some little feeling is the decision of the War Office to charge for the tents and camp equipment, and also to charge for the damage done to them by the Territorial units concerned. I think the best way to allay that feeling is for the people concerned to realise that they are not being unfairly treated. In order to dispel that feeling, I would like to explain that it was at first proposed\nthat the annual grant should be &#163;45,000 instead of &#163;50,000, and that tents and camp equipment should be issued free. It was calculated that the cost of this last concession would amount to between &#163;3,000 and &#163;4,000, and those concerned felt that they were doing a generous action in saying that they would increase the training grant to the round sum of &#163;50,000 and charge extra for tents and equipment instead of haggling over this small sum of money. Fortunately civil servants are not politicians. To them two and two invariably make four, and &#163;50,000 is always a larger sum than &#163;49,000. The politician knows better. My view is that if it had been decided to limit this grant to &#163;45,000, and to issue the tents and equipment free, no complaint would have been heard, and the sense of injustice which now exists would have been avoided. If hon. Members who receive these complaints from their constituents will be good enough to convey to them this explanation they may be persuaded that, after all, they are not sufferers by a decision which increased their grant.<\/p><p>4.0 p.m.<\/p><p>Before I leave the question of the Territorial Army there is one other matter which I should like to mention. The question of coast defence has been occupying the Army Council for some time, and a decision has been reached with regard to it during the last few months which materially affects the Territorial Army. Ever since the War there has been a lack of co-ordination with regard to this important matter, and it has now been decided to hand over to the Territorial Army practically the entire responsibility of defending the shores of this country so far as land forces are concerned. I hope that the confidence which the Government thus display in the Territorials may have some effect in convincing them that the sacrifice they have been asked to make this year with regard to their camp was not due to any lack of appreciation on the part of the Government of their great importance, and of the part that they must always play in the great task of Imperial defence. It seems peculiarly fitting that the defence of our territory should be handed over to the Territorial Army&#8212;a high responsibility for which, I am confident, they will show themselves to be\nin every way fit and competent. It is not only the Territorial Army who have suffered in their training this year; &#163;30,000 has been saved on the training of the Regular Army, and the House may be sure that that &#163;30,000 has been given up with the greatest misgiving by those who are responsible for the efficiency of the troops. The expenditure on training has been reduced so far as it is wise to reduce it.<\/p><p>Those who have been Members of this House for any length of time have seen Minister after Minister standing at this Box regretting that recruiting has not been satisfactory, and hon. Members have shown their ingenuity by suggesting year after year new ways in which recruiting might be encouraged. This year, for the first time for many years, we have been obliged to fix a limit to the numbers that we were willing to receive. We have been able also to raise the standard of height and weight of those who have been selected from among the men who have come up to other conditions. Even so, we have got all the men that we require. We have got a sufficient number of men of a higher quality than have been recruited in previous years.<\/p><p>There is another matter in which we have made a great saving this year, but which we have been very reluctant to make, and that is in the housing of the troops. The standard of houses in this country has, I am glad to say, advanced a great deal during the last 100 years, but I am sorry to say that housing in the Army has not been able to keep pace with that advance. In many parts of England and abroad our troops are housed in conditions which are really unfit not only for troops, but for any British subjects. We are now reducing this year, as far as possible, the expenditure upon them. We have got hutments in various parts of the country such as Larkhill, Colchester and elsewhere which are so flimsy that it is possible to pass an umbrella through the walls. We have got huts in places such as Longmoor and Bordon dating from the South African War, and at Chichester there are some which date from the year 1803.<\/p><p>We are building new barracks this year at Aberdeen. I am glad to say that Aberdeen is the one place where we are not economising this year, but their barracks date from 1789, the year of the\nFrench Revolution. If they had been continued any longer, they might have caused a revolution in Aberdeen. At Carlisle, I am told, the barracks are infested with rats, and at Malaya the barracks are infested with white ants, which eat through the structure and may be responsible for a collapse at any moment. At Pontefract, owing to mining operations under the barracks, they are on the point of falling down, and this year at Armagh some did actually fall down. I am not mentioning these things in order to discourage recruiting, but to show that we are doing everything possible in every department of Army administration to effect economies, and there is, as far as I am aware, no suggestion that can be made for saving more money on Army Estimates which has not been thoroughly examined, and, if feasible, has not been put into force. It is that kind of condition which justifies some of the economies we have made.<\/p><p>There has been one economy which has been a good deal criticised, about which I have had to answer many questions in the House and about which many Members, no doubt, are occupied in their mind. I refer to the decision to close down the Royal Army Clothing Factory at Pimlico. That factory was set up in the year 1855 at the time of the Crimean War, in the Golden Age, or rather the many-coloured age before khaki, when every regiment wore full-dress and each had its separate uniform to distinguish it, when, rightly or wrongly, the highest importance was attached to the correctness of uniform, to the perfection of fit, and when it was held to be sacrilege for the clothing of the troops to be entrusted to the hands of ordinary tradesmen. So far as I am aware, there has not been a special factory for the manufacture of any other clothing of the servants of His Majesty, whether in the fighting forces or elsewhere, but the Royal Army Clothing Factory has grown up in that way, and I may say that at the time no more suitable site could be imagined for a clothing factory than the banks of the Thames, within about a mile from this House, and about the same distance from the richest residential quarter of London. At the time that the factory was set up, it was considered necessary, and large stores of uniforms were collected there before the War.<\/p><p>Year after year since the War the question of disposing of these uniforms has come up for decision by the Army Council, but there have been always a few optimistic reactionaries who have cherished the hope that the day might come when the whole Army would go back to full-dress. I, myself, have the greatest sympathy with the people who held that view, or at least cherished that hope, but in September of last year it was realised that the time had come to make a decision, and although sentimentalists would boggle at the thought of handing over to the theatrical costumier And the producer of films uniforms originally meant to be worn by His Majesty's troops, they were obliged to give way, and the whole stock of uniforms is now to be disposed of for the benefit of the taxpayer. Bright uniforms are no longer in the picture, which becomes drabber and easier for the change.<\/p><p>One of many factors which led to a reconsideration of the whole problem of the Pimlico Clothing Factory was that, unfortunately, it was, and is, the case that the factory does not manufacture the ordinary dress worn by the greater part of the Army to-day as cheaply or conveniently as it can be purchased from the trade. This is due to a variety of causes, partly to heavy overhead charges, partly, perhaps, to old-fashioned methods of manufacture, and partly to the old-fashioned construction of the factory itself. An effort has been made to introduce, into the factory a more modern method of manufacture during the last few years. The experiment has been tried for all it was worth, and to a large extent it has given satisfactory results, but not so satisfactory as to make the manufacture of any article in the factory as cheap as the manufacture of it outside. There is a tremendous saving by purchasing all that we have to purchase from the trade.<\/p><p>These arguments alone would have been insufficient to drive us to adopt the policy which has been adopted but for one very important factor which has been largely overlooked, or, perhaps, not known by those who have complained about the decision to close the factory, and that is that the lease of the factory will come to an end in 1937, and there is no prospect whatever of our obtaining a renewal of that lease on terms which the War Office\ncould possibly accept. It is obvious that it is not an ideal site for a clothing factory, and we have carefully gone into the question whether to set up a new factory. If it had been decided to set up another factory, it would probably have been somewhere in the North of England, And those who are suffering from the closing of the Pimlico factory&#8212;and I do not want to under-estimate the suffering of those affected&#8212;the blow would have fallen upon them later rather than sooner. During the years that intervened they would have benefited, but the country as a whole would have suffered. The taxpayers would have suffered considerably, because the economies would have been put off for many years, and when the time came for handing over the lease, the taxpayers, again, would have had to pay, probably, heavy dilapidation charges, instead of receiving, as they are to receive, a substantial sum for surrendering the lease four years before its time.<\/p><p>In spite of all that, the decision was come to by the Government with great reluctance. It is always unpleasant and painful to close down a factory, and put a number of people out of work, and I may say, for my own part, that the fact that this factory was in my own constituency did not make me the more eager to recommend, as r did, this decision to the Secretary of State. The clothing depot and inspectorate will be removed to Didcot. As far as the manufacture of full-dress for the Brigade of Guards is concerned, we are making experiments to ascertain whether this can be performed by the trade satisfactorily or not. If the experiments are not successful, it may be necessary to consider the possibility of setting up a small clothing factory for this purpose elsewhere. It is impossible to make any further statement with regard to that until we know how far the experiments are successful or the reverse.<\/p><p>These are some of the economies we have effected, but by no means all. I have not time to go into them all. We have economised even in such matters as research. In these days nothing could be of greater importance to an armed force than keeping up with scientific development. We have saved &#163;22,000 in this direction. We have economised also in education. We have saved &#163;35,000 in that direction. I am glad to say that, although we have cut down expenditure on re-\nsearch, we have been able to go on with our programme of mechanisation. There has been no alteration in the programme as originally laid down. The Cavalry have been experimenting this year with a new light machine gun, and their experiments have been so satisfactory that they are to be extended and tried upon a broader basis. The Artillery have been testing the practicability of the new light dragon, and this also has been sufficiently satisfactory to warrant the adoption of this machine for a complete brigade. Further mechanisation has been introduced into the organisation of the Divisional Royal Engineers. The Infantry have been practising with small armoured machine gun carriers, and there is to be an increase in the number of mortars issued, in order that as many battalions as possible may take part in this experiment There has been an increase in wireless signalling experiments, and an inquiry with regard to tanks, to ascertain the proportion of tanks of various types which should form part of a tank battalion. It is intended this year again to form a tank brigade for purposes of training. If our savings do not include a reduction of expenditure in regard to the mechanisation programme of the Army, I think the House will recognise that this was a wise decision, since an army that is old-fashioned and out of date is worse than no army at all.<\/p><p>I have spoken of the decrease of &#163;35,000 in expenditure on education, but I am glad to say that, in spite of that decrease, we have been able to keep going our three centres for vocational training at Chisledon, Hounslow and Aldershot, and during the past year more men have passed through those centres than in any previous year. I will not disguise from the House the fact that during recent months the numbers of men applying for these courses have been steadily going down, and the situation is being carefully watched by the Army Council. It may be largely due to the fact that the new rates of pay have just come into operation so far as men leaving the Forces are concerned, and that, under the new rates of pay, the fees which they have to pay for these vocational training courses are too high. I am not sure of that, but we intend to inquire into it, because we fully realise the im-\nportance of these vocational training centres.<\/p><p>The ideal at which we are aiming, and which is not impossible of realisation, is to ensure that every young man who joins the Army shall, while he is in the Army, be able so to equip himself that, at the end of his period of service, he will have certainly a better chance of employment than if he had not served in the Army. There ought almost to be a feeling of certainty that such a man will readily obtain employment in civil life, and, if we can once attain that level, it will be a double benefit, from the point of view of the Army and from the point of view of the country as a whole. We should then be able every year, during our recruiting period, to choose from the best of the young men of the country, because, instead of feeling that the Army is a sort of last resource, they will feel that it is a splendid training, giving them seven years of vigorous, healthy, active life, and leaving them at the end of the period fitted and almost certain to obtain employment. At the same time, every year there would be coming into the industrial market these men who had been through this period of training, and who would be not only skilled craftsmen, but also disciplined soldiers. I hope that employers will realise that such men are the best men that they can get. I do not think it is possible to exaggerate the importance of this vocational training scheme, and it is hoped that nothing will ever be done that will cause it to lose the position which it already has in the Army, and that there will be no failure to impress the men with its importance and its good effects. Even in the depressing circumstances of the past year, the proportion of men from these vocational training centres who have obtained employment is as high as 75 per cent. If the advantage of the courses were really known, I feel sure that men would come forward very freely to take advantage of them.<\/p><p>This leads me to mention an important decision which the Government have taken, and which, perhaps, should be explained to the House. I announced it shortly before Christmas, and it was so well received that perhaps no explanation is necessary. I refer to the decision to grant full recognition once more to the Cadet Corps. This decision reverses the one taken by the previous Government,\nbut I do not want the House to think that it was just taken on the spur of the moment, in the spirit that anything done by the last Government was wrong and the sooner we altered it the better. On the contrary, full consideration was given to every aspect of the case before the decision was arrived at. It was felt, and I think rightly, that the decision of the Labour Government to withdraw recognition from the Cadet Corps had been taken as a gesture towards the pacifist feeling in the country. Many of that Government's supporters had doubtless been disappointed with their record on the question of Disarmament, and I think it was felt that there was some need for a gesture, and this was the gesture which was decided upon.<\/p><p>It is not the wish of His Majesty's Government to do anything to outrage or hurt that section of opinion which demanded, and was pleased by, this decision. It is only because we feel that it was a wrong decision, ill calculated even to achieve the object for which it was designed, that we have decided to go back upon it. When it was taken by the Labour Government, there were protests all over the country from religious and teaching bodies, headmasters of every type of school and religious leaders of every denomination from the Archbishop of Canterbury downwards, saying that the Cadet Corps fulfilled a most valuable function in the training of boys in this country, that in many cases it gave boys in the towns almost their only opportunity of healthy exercise and of getting into the fields, and that it would be a great disaster to withdraw recognition from it, or do anything to discourage it.<\/p><p>In my opinion, it must be the first object of every Government to avoid war, and the abolition of war between civilised countries is an ideal that every rational man must sustain. But it is no use trying to stop war by hushing it up. It is no use, in my opinion, trying to educate children in ignorance of the evil that exists in the world, and treating war as if it were one of those unpleasant subjects which could only be mentioned among grown-up people, and must not be spoken of in front of children. That really was the meaning, so far as I could ever see any meaning in that decision of the Labour Government&#8212;that it was terrible for children to know that there\nwere such things as armies, although, on approaching the age of 17, the full truth might be broken to them. The time may come when we shall be able to do without armies, but I do not think the time will ever come when we shall be able to do without the military virtues&#8212;courage, loyalty, the qualities of leadership, the spirit of self-sacrifice&#8212;qualities that are best taught through experience of discipline and the habit of obedience. It is because we believe that it will contribute to engendering these qualities in the youth of the nation that we have decided to extend recognition once more to the Cadet Corps. No grants have been made to them this year, but I understand that those who are at the head of the movement are entirely satisfied with the action that has been taken.<\/p><p>During the last few weeks the attention of everyone in this country has been fixed on the small detachment of the British Army which is carrying out a very grave responsibility in the Far East. It has had to perform the most difficult duties that soldiers can be called upon to perform&#8212;to maintain neutrality among bitterly hostile factions, and to maintain calmness and coolness in times of danger and good humour under pro-vacation. To say that these duties have been carried out in a spirit worthy of the traditions of the British Army is, I think, sufficient; to say more would be unnecessary. Owing to the incidence of the trooping season, we have been able slightly to increase the garrison without in any way altering our arrangements. The battalion of the Wiltshire Regiment which was going to relieve the Second Battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers has arrived, and the Scots Fusiliers have remained in addition. We have transferred from Hong Kong one battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, together with a mountain battery of the Hong Kong&#8212;Singapore brigade. We now have four infantry battalions and one battery at Shanghai.<\/p><p>It may be that, when the history of what has taken place in these recent weeks at Shanghai comes to be written, it will be found that to nobody is greater credit due for what we hope will be the comparatively happy outcome of these events than to the British officer commanding on the spot. Brigadier Fleming has been asked, as so many British\nofficers have been asked in the past, to show not only the qualities of the soldier, but those of the diplomatist and statesman, and I think it will be found when the full story is known, that he has shown those qualities to a degree of which anybody might be proud. As for the troops themselves, I was told the other day by someone who had come back from Shanghai, and who knew China well, that five years ago the anti-British feeling in China was extremely bitter, but that in the town of Shanghai, of which he spoke, it seemed to have disappeared altogether. He put this down very largely to the competence and behaviour of the British troops on the spot. That has happened before, and here again the British soldier has shown himself to be one of the best ambassadors of peace. I am sure that the whole House will join with me in sending a message of congratulation and good will to this small detachment who, so far away from their own country, have been upholding so nobly during the last few weeks both the cause of peace and the honour of Great Britain.<\/p>",

His Majesty's Government regard these events with grave concern both in the general interests of peace and owing to the proximity of the International Settlement with the consequent danger to the lives and property of British nationals. We\nhave lost no time in making pressing representations, more than once repeated, and have urged the Japanese and Chinese Governments and their commanders on the spot to accept a scheme, which has been put forward as a result of the efforts of the British and United States Consuls-General in Shanghai, for the establishment of a neutral zone between the Chinese and Japanese forces. This zone would have to be occupied by troops of the neutral Powers which have forces in the International Settlement. Instructions have been given for British troops to co-operate if the zone can be established. Owing to the efforts of the Consuls-General a truce was arranged on the evening of the 29th of January, but I regret to see in the latest Press reports that fighting appears to have broken out again. His Majesty's Government have further urged upon both Governments, with the utmost earnestness, to do what lies in and upon them to remedy the existing situation.<\/p><p>As regards the military and naval position, in addition to the three British battalions already at Shanghai, His Majesty's Government decided on Sunday to dispatch His Majesty's Ship \"Berwick\" from Hong Kong, carrying a battalion of infantry arid a battery of artillery as a reinforcement; she is due to arrive to-night. The naval forces, consisting of His Majesty's Ship \"Cornwall\" and His Majesty's Ship \"Sandwich,\" together with two gunboats, will shortly be reinforced by His Majesty's Ship \"Kent,\" due to arrive on Friday, while His Majesty's Ship \"Suffolk\" arrived on Sunday.<\/p><p>His Majesty's Government has throughout acted in closest consultation with the other Powers primarily concerned. This course is being and will be actively maintained. His Majesty's Consul-General is similarly co-operating closely with the representatives of the other Powers at Shanghai.<\/p><p>A word about Nanking, although it is not in the question. About 11 p.m. last night Japanese men-of-war on the river opened fire with several rounds of live shell in the direction of the city of Nanking. Our latest information is that all is quiet for the moment and that all British subjects are safe.<\/p><p>A statement similar to the above is being made this afternoon by the Secretary of State for the Dominions at a specially convened meeting of the Council of the League at Geneva.<\/p><p>I would now add, and this is of great importance, that instructions were sent to His Majesty's representatives at Tokyo and Nanking to deliver this morning to those Governments the following proposals, and press strongly for their acceptance, indicating that they are being simultaneously urged upon the other party. These proposals have been concerted with the United States Government, and the French and Italian Governments are being asked to act similarly. Since this answer was prepared for me, I have received information that both the French and Italian Governments consent to do so.<\/p>",

I will, with the permission of the House, deal with the condition of depressed people in the Colonial Empire. I hope to make some remarks about the condition of affairs in some of our Crown Colonies in the Caribbees. The right hon. Member for Spen Valley (Sir T. Simon), in speaking in the Hong Kong Debate proved to the House, that although there were no votes attached to the question of Colonial administration, and therefore no popularity, and not much interest, this House has a special responsibility in regard to these Crown Colonies, because the proletariat, the ordinary citizens, had no power in the administration of the Colonies, and no power over the legislation there. I know that the Under-Secretary of State is going to tell us that the conditions in the various Crown Colonies differ, that in some they have power and that in others they have not. He used the term \"more or less autonomy.\" I dispute his claim that in regard to the islands which have asked me to raise this matter they have anything like \"more or less autonomy.\" On consulting the dictionary I find that autonomy means self-government, the power to act for oneself. In these Crown Colonies with the exception of three, Barbadoes, Bahamas and British Honduras, there is an official and nominated majority as against the elected members.<\/p><p>I know that Rome was not built in a day and that a Labour Colonial Empire cannot spring up in a night. I want to pay my tribute to the work of the Colonial Office and the Labour Government\nsince they have been in office. They have done exceptionally well. They are doing very good work, and I hope they will continue to do so. Although I shall be throwing some heavy bricks later on, I do not want it to be supposed that I am casting any reflection upon the staff of the Colonial Office. They are a very excellent staff of men, their ability is undoubted and their efficiency unchallenged. My grievance against them is that sometimes they seem to be stagnant, undemocratic and inclined to think that the Colonies should be under their parentage and supervision and should not be allowed expansion and scope. Having thrown that bouquet, I am going to throw a brick. I will give a case which the House may not regard as typical but of a type which is happening much too frequently in the Crown Colonies.<\/p><p>Here is a case which happened exactly two years ago in one of the Crown Colonies in the Caribbean Islands. For some reason not proffered to the public the Governor decided&#8212;he may have been acting on advice from the Committee of Imperial Defence or perhaps on instructions from the Colonial Office, or on his own initiative&#8212;to produce an ordnance to resuscitate the volunteer movement. There is no social legislation there, no workmen's compensation, no factory laws, no women's lights, very poor elementary education, very limited secondary education. The people protested against the ordinance. They said, \"We cannot afford it. We have a huge list for payment of the bureaucracy. We have to pay salaries to the Governor, the Secretary and other Colonial officials, and we cannot afford this legislation.\" The protests were made in vain. The Governor passed the Bill with the official majority in the Council.<\/p>",

But for the moment why should she be asked to walk before she is really able to waddle. It is our duty to teach India control, and to guarantee before all things order. It is not illegitimate to point out that up to now His Majesty's Government have not maintained order in India. Hon. Members opposite forget all that we have done for India. The other day Mr. Gandhi made a speech attacking our missionaries and saying that he did not wish to see them there any longer. In that connection I should like to remind the Committee of all that we owe to the British connection in India, and particularly to the missionaries. I remember the days when the car of Juggernaut was driven by Hindus through their villages and children thrown in front of it in the name of the Hindu gods. Only recently I read accounts of widow-burning. Who put a stop to that? It was the British connection, reinforced by the missionary spirit. Follow it up. Mr. Gandhi I believe was married at the age of 12 or 13. Child marriages were contracted at an earlier age still before we arrived upon the scene and started reform.<\/p><p>It is not for me to urge the claims doctrinally of religion. Let us leave out of the question all the dogmas of Catholics or Protestants and Nonconformists. The fact still remains that a Christian spirit has worked through our Government in India. [An HON. MEMBER: \"Hong Kong!\"] It may not be fully working in Hong Kong, but I hope the present Government, which is a Christian Government, will find a remedy for the grievances in Hong Kong. That spirit has for generations underlain British democracy, and the Christian doctrine of equality underpins the foundation of our rule. When Mr. Gandhi talks about tyranny and slaves, the truth is that he is living in a glass house. It is not for him to offer to release India from the so-called British yoke when he keeps 60,000,000 of his coreligionists in the foulest spiritual fetters.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I am most grateful to my friends on these benches who have the opportunity of selecting the subjects for Debate to-day for providing some time for the discussion of a matter of importance and of urgency which has several times been the subject of question and answer in the House, but which, I think, calls for more continuous treatment, and will give an opportunity to the Under-Secretary to make a statement. I am also very grateful to the Government for co-operating, as they have done, in enabling the Debate to take place. The matter to which I should like to call attention is the present condition of the problem which has been recognised for some time past to exist in connection with children in the British Colony of Hong Kong. I think they are called mui-tsai. I will not occupy time by discussing whether technically they should be described by one term or another. The fact is that there are thousands of\nlittle girls at Hong Kong who are in homes other than their own, and who are rendering service there under arrangements which they themselves have had nothing to do with making, and under conditions which certainly have sometimes led to the most deplorable circumstances of cruelty. I know it has been contended in some quarters that this system of mui-tsai should not be regarded as in any way analogous to slavery, and indeed some six weeks ago I read a statement by the Colonial Secretary in which he described it&#8212;I thought the description rather surprising&#8212;as the Chinese system of the adoption of young girls. The first matter I would ask the Minister to consider is whether really that description is justified, and in due course I will ask the Under-Secretary to deal with the point.<\/p><p>It is a system, undoubtedly, which has existed and does exist as an ancient and widespread Chinese custom, and everyone ought to recognise how very difficult it is for our Colonial authorities to get rid of it. Can it be fairly described as a system of adoption? I have made some inquiry and such study as I could, and I believe I am right when I say that those who have studied this subject with attention would be very surprised indeed at the description which Lord Passfield recently gave of it, as a Chinese system of adopting young girls. In the first place, adoption and domestic servitude are not synonymous terms. In the second place, genuine adoption in the East is a very well-known institution, but it is nearly always the adoption of boys for the purpose of perpetuating a family. There is a Cantonese pocket dictionary written in English. The author of it is an English member of the Civil Service in Hong Kong, and, if that dictionary is consulted, you will find that it has for the definition of mui-tsai \"equivalent to a girl domestic slave.\" These mui-tsai, as I understand, are girls. They are not the subject of adoption. They are the object of purchase, and the excuse that these little girls are adopted daughters is sometimes put forward before a magistrate, but it is not an excuse which is accepted by anyone who knows the facts on the spot.<\/p><p>I have been looking through cuttings from Hong Kong newspapers and I find that an English magistrate who had one of these cases before him, and to whom the excuse was offered that the girl was\nan adopted daughter said&#8212;this is from the \"South China Morning Post\" of 29th July of last year&#8212;he always held that there was no such thing as an adopted daughter, and, if he were asked to decide otherwise, he would have to know some reason why a girl had been adopted, and also that she had been treated as a daughter. No one who does what I have done, and reads the two principal Hong Kong newspapers which are printed in English, and which constantly contain references to mui-tsai, can possibly be left in any doubt that the cases which have come to the courts are cases of little children who have been acquired, and treated, it may be, kindly, or it may be unkindly, but acquired as the cheapest of cheap labour. They are often little drudges, entirely at the mercy of those who have paid for them. I am not saying this from any powers of my own, but because I have been doing my best to master, and am in a position to reproduce, the facts as they are reported in Hong Kong. I have quoted one Hong Kong paper, and I will quote another. Just at the very moment when Lord Pass-field was making his statement that this mui-tsai system is merely a Chinese system of adopting children, it happened that the \"Hong Kong Daily Press\" was writing a leading article on the subject. I will read a passage:\n<q>It is a curious thing that some English people who know a lot about Hong Kong should have sympathy with this form of slavery. There is no disguising the fact that a mui-tsai is a slave. She is transferred from her natural parents to another family on payment of money, and becomes the property of her purchaser, subject to the ordinary law of the land, and certain conventions about her marriage on reaching a certain age. Under British law the transaction is null and void. The girl so disposed of can return to her parents, and her parents can claim her any time they like. The purchaser acquires no rights whatever. That is the law, but law and social custom do not coincide. Many Chinese families have a mui-tsai, though at the present time it may often be declared that the girl in question is an adopted daughter&#8230;. The real as apart from the canting defence of the system is that you can get the services of a young girl (and absolute power over her person) at a dirt cheap rate. It is a good business proposition. We all know the arguments in favour of slavery and every civilised nation rejects them.<\/q>\nI have quoted from what, I believe, are the two principal Hong Kong newspapers\nprinted in English, and, in both cases, from quite a recent issue. In fact, I think I can show the Committee that these little girls are frequently the subject of a bill of sale, just as the negro slaves were subject to bills of sale in the 18th century in the West Indies and the Southern States of America. I have here both the original and the translation of such a bill of sale. Here is the Chinese original, and I have done my best to make sure that it is properly translated. I do not suppose that there are many Members in this Committee who could check it, but there it is. I am going to read to the Committee the translation of this document, and we will see whether it is as an adopted daughter or not. I have every name here, and, of course, they are available to the Committee if it is desired. This is a deed of sale entered into at the end of the year 1929 by the parents of a little girl whose name is given, and they say that they are the\n<q>joint makers of this deed for the sale of our daughter. Being in need of funds, I have consulted with my wife to sell our young daughter &#8230;. <\/q>\nthe little girl's name is given&#8212;\n<q>aged 9, born on the 13th day of 12th moon \"&#8212;<\/q>\nwhich, I am told, according to our reckoning, is the 21st January, 1921. If there is any Member now sitting in this Committee who has in his own family a child of that age or a grandchild, he will know why some people condemn such an adoption as this. She is sold through the intermediary of an agent, whose name is given&#8212;Ho Kwai Tse&#8212;to a woman, whose name is given, residing at a particular address in Hong Kong, and the document goes on:\n<q>who agreed to have her and subsequently paid him the purchase price of 110 dollars Hong Kong currency, including remuneration to the middleman.<\/q>\nAnybody who has ever studied the history of slave trading transactions in the century before last knows very well the part that the middleman played. This transaction, it goes on to say, was mutually agreed to and completed in the presence of the three parties. I ask hon. Members to observe who are the three parties, the sellers of the child, the purchaser, and the middleman. But the little girl is not a party to the transaction\nat all; and it was not for the purpose of settling debts or any other account. The girl was handed over to the purchaser, and the deed goes on:\n<q>who shall have the right to change her name. In case of any misfortune, each party shall acquiesce in Heaven's decree. Should there be any mystery as to the origin of the girl or she may desert home with her mother, the intermediary is held responsible to search for the girl and restore her to the owner without fail. To avoid any the unreliability of a verbal promise, this deed is made as proof.<\/q>\nIt is then executed by the parties. That is not, to my knowledge, an isolated transaction. You will observe that it is quite modern in date, because it bears the date of 4th October, 1929. But in reading through the Hong Kong papers of the last year or two, I am in a position to inform the Committee of the sort of price that prevails when you deal with somebody for a little girl of this sort. Here is a case where the price was 141 dollars, another where it was 150 dollars, and another where it was 145 dollars, and a fourth where it was 120 dollars. There is a case in which there were three girls, one sold for 80 dollars, one for 130 dollars, and the third for 150 dollars, and the child parted with for 150 dollars was resold for 300 dollars. Everyone of those cases has happened, as I can show from those papers, within the last two or three years. I would ask the Committee to observe how serious this is if the excuse is to be that this is a mere form of adoption. The price is paid to the so-called seller. The girl gets nothing whatever. There is an intermediary or a middleman, who, apparently, is engaged in the transaction, because I have a second photograph which, translated, says the same thing. No consent from the girl is needed or given, and all these provisions about the rights to change her name and the selling of the poor thing, as you say when selling a horse, with all faults, quite plainly show that the excuse that it is nothing more than an Oriental system of adoption is a very poor excuse indeed.<\/p>",

In other respects it carries out, substantially, the policy of my right hon. Friend the late Foreign Secretary. In order to explain the Amendment may I summarise what the Bill does. We are handing over &#163;11,500,000 to the Chinese\nGovernment at once and during the next few years, and this sum is divided into four parts. We are giving &#163;265,000 to the Hong Kong University&#8212;with which I agree&#8212;&#163;200,000 to the Universities' China Committee in London, &#163;7,000,000 to the China Purchasing Commission, and the residue, to the extent of &#163;4,000,000, we are handing over to the Board of Trustees in China for purposes of mutual benefit to Great Britain and China. That, shortly, is what the Bill does. I have absolutely no objection to the first three purposes. In regard to the &#163;7,000,000 which is being handed over to the China Purchasing Commission, the British Government will have a voice in the way that money is expended because the Commission will be nominated from a Board of Trustees, from a panel, recommended by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.<\/p><p>My Amendment merely applies to the &#163;4,000,000, that is to say, to the residue of &#163;4,000,000 which is being handed over to China to be expended on purposes mutually beneficial to Great Britain and China. In regard to this &#163;4,000,000, and this is really the main point, not only is the British Government not going to have any voice or say in the matter at all but there is nothing in the Bill to say that any British subject is going to have any voice in it. These &#163;4,000,000 are to be absolutely under the control of the board of trustees, and the board of trustees is to be appointed by the Chinese Government. To be perfectly fair I should say that in the Notes that have been exchanged between our Minister in Peking, Sir Miles Lampson, and the Chinese Secretary for Foreign Affairs, this question of British subjects is mentioned. In the Note addressed by the Chinese Minister to Sir Miles Lamp-son there is this sentence:\n<q>For the control, apportionment and administration of the above-mentioned endowment the Chinese Government will duly appoint a board of trustees in China which will include a certain number of British members.<\/q>\nBut that is a very casual and perfunctory statement put in at the end of a sentence. Sir Miles Lampson, when he replied to that Note, merely reiterated in identical words the promise made by the Chinese Government. Surely, when you are handing over &#163;4,000,000 of British\nmoney \"for purposes mutually beneficial to this country and China,\" statutory provision ought to be made for the inclusion of British members upon that board. I do not doubt in the least that the Chinese Government made that promise in perfectly good faith. I am sure they did. But Governments pass away in China as they do in this country, and in future a Chinese Government may arise which will put a different interpretation upon those particular words in the Note.<\/p><p>The difficulties of interpretation have already arisen in China in regard to the handing over by the American Government of their share of the indemnity. What happened was that a board was set up in China, composed under an agreement, of American citizens and Chinese citizens. Gradually as time went by all the American citizens were ousted from that board. I think I am right in saying that. At any rate, I know that when was in the Foreign Office that was the case. I do not know whether the Americans have been re-admitted, but when I was in the Foreign Office that board was composed solely of Chinese members. This is British money, to be used for the benefit of this country and China, and surely it is common sense that British members should feature as one of the provisions of the Bill.<\/p><p>The Bill is founded on the report of the Willingdon Committee and the subsequent report of Lord Buxton's Committee. At this late hour I do not want to trouble the House, but I could quote passages from both those reports showing that it was their intention that in the distribution of this money in China the board of trustees should consist of British members as well as Chinese members. This is the point where the Government have definitely departed from the policy laid down by the late Foreign Secretary. In the Bill which was prepared by my right hon. Friend, British members were included in the committee. Under that arrangement, the British Government were to have a voice, not only in the expenditure of the money upon railways, but in the expenditure of the money upon educational and cultural objects. I cannot believe that the Chinese Government would object to these words being inserted in the Bill. I should like to ask the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign\nAffairs whether the Chinese Government were ever asked, if they did object and, if they were asked, whether they declined to assent to this proposal? I do not believe that they would object to the promise which they made being put into an Act of Parliament. I know that the Under-Secretary may say that if we do insert these words here, they will not be binding upon the Chinese Government. I quite realise that. They will not be binding upon the Chinese Government, but I look upon them AS very valuable as a declaratory statement, and, if the terms made on these Notes and the promise included in our Act of Parliament should be violated at any time by the Chinese Government, this provision will give our Government a <i>locus standi<\/i> to make representations and protests. Without that statement in our Act of Parliament I do not think our Government would have any <i>locus standi<\/i> at all. As I have said, this Bill, in other respects, carries out the policy with which my right hon. Friend, the ex-Foreign Secretary and the late Government completely agreed, but Parliament ought not to pass this Measure without including definite words to embody the pledge given to our Minister in Pekin that British subjects should be on the Committee.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>The hon. Member for South-West Hull (Mr. Arnott) has, like so many hon. Members who have spoken during the course of to-day's Debate, left his attitude to this Bill somewhat vague. When the Home Secretary introduced this Bill, there was a certain amount of enthusiasm for the abolition of the plural vote, there was perhaps a little more enthusiasm for the abolition of university representation, there seemed to be little or none for the alternative vote, and I did not gather that there was any great enthusiasm for the remaining provisions of this hotchpotch which the Government have seen fit to put in front of the country. I am sure that the hon. Member for South-West Hull will forgive me if I do not deal with his speech in detail, because upon his arguments on the alternative vote, I shall have something to say later.<\/p><p>I should like, at the outset, to deal with university representation, because\nin this matter I speak from rather a different angle than my hon. Friends who have spoken in the House in support of it. I represent a constituency which houses an ancient university and which, as this House has been told, has been represented here since 1603. I am bound to say that, taking my constituency as a whole&#8212;and we have had a very long experience of the university representation&#8212;there is no hostility to that representation in any shape or form, except in a very small part of my town. I represent, and do my best to represent as far as the ordinary concerns of politics are concerned, the university, but there are branches of our business as a nation in which I cannot represent the university with nearly the same degree of accuracy as those who are its representatives. To begin with, as the hon. Member for the University of Wales (Mr. Evans) has said, there are thousands of constituents who go abroad and live abroad, partly on Government service and partly on private business, to whom their university Member is the one and only person in this House to whom they can go to put their grievances before the Government of the day. If you ask any university Member whence does the greater part of his post-bag come, he will tell you that it comes from overseas.<\/p><p>I speak, for the moment, both as one who represents a university constituency and one who is proud to have, been at the university himself, when I say that there are thousands of our people serving His Majesty's Government in India, Hong Kong, the Colonies all over the world, and there are thousands more who represent industry and commerce of this country abroad who are, at any rate, temporary domiciled in a foreign country, to whom the action of His Majesty's Government, at any moment, may be of great importance. To whom do these people appeal? May be they have no connection with any constituency in this country, and if they write to any one of us in the country, having no local ties and having no particular reason why they should choose one Member rather than another, are we not rather apt to think, \"Surely, after all, perhaps this is not, strictly speaking, my business\"? But in the university Member they have someone to whom they can appeal, someone who represents them, and, if necessary, can voice their opinions in the House of\nCommons. I submit that with an imperial Parliament such as this, a Parliament not solely exercised with the domestic concerns of this country, but exercised with problems that are of interest all over the world, the university representation at least fulfils one useful purpose.<\/p><p>There is also another purpose. It was claimed by my hon. Friend the Member for the Scottish Universities (Mr. Buchan) that the universities represent the professions, and it was argued that on the whole the professions are not unrepresented in this House. With regard to the learned profession, I submit that that is true. But, after all, there are many problems with which universities have to deal which have little or nothing to do with the learned profession. There is, as one hon. Member pointed out, the claims of the scientists. We have had far too few Members in this House with scientific attainments, but I believe that those who have come in have come in as representatives of one or other of the universities. In these times, when science plays an ever-growing part in our daily life, that avenue of approach to this House should not be banged and barred in their face.<\/p><p>There is one other argument. It was argued by my right hon. Friend the Member for Chelsea (Sir S. Hoare), who was putting up the case for the universities, why not give the trade unions representation as such? Speaking solely for myself, I can see much to be argued for the representation in this House of trade unions as such. At least, their representatives would represent something very real. I have heard many members of trade unions in this House claim that they represent the trade unions. They represent something real, living and vital in our national life. How many Members of this House can claim that they represent anything? A few Members like myself, representing as I do one of the ancient boroughs of this country, can at least claim that we stand and represent a living entity. How can any hon. Member who represents one-fourth, or one portion of a borough arbitrarily divided in order to produce something approximately representing electoral equality, claim that he represents a living entity? He does not. Nor does any Member who represents some district arbitrarily cut\nout of the country represent anything real. The old Members who sat for boroughs and counties represented real entities, and I believe that there is much to be said for giving better representation to real things in this House instead of the somewhat artificial units that we represent to-day. The old boroughs and the old universities represent something real, and if for that reason and no other I would urge the retention of the university representation.<\/p><p>10.0 p.m.<\/p><p>The Home Secretary dealt somewhat delicately with the question of a mandate. He said that the Bill was mentioned in the King's Speech. I agree that an Electoral Reform Bill was mentioned in the King's Speech, but I have taken the trouble to look up what was said by the Prime Minister on the subject. Speaking in the Debate on the Address he said that he would introduce a Bill \"to deal with the escapades of parties who are too wealthy to observe the law with strict accuracy.\" I do not doubt that that may be an admirable method of looking at this Bill which the Government have seen fit to inflict upon the House of Commons, but I am bound to say that I can find little in its provisions to carry out that undertaking of the Prime Minister. But even under this Clause it is not the existing law which is altered; it is merely an alteration of the amount to be expended, and the way in which the wealthy observe the strict letter of the law will be no more hindered under Clause 7 than it has been hindered under the existing law. So far as that is concerned this Bill does nothing to carry out the pledge given by the Prime Minister in his speech on the Address. The Home Secretary did not seem particularly keen in regard to the alternative vote. He referred very briefly to the Ullswater Conference. The Ullswater Conference, if it expressed an opinion at all, expressed the view that in the event of any change proportional representation was the only change that was advisable. The right hon. Gentleman based his case on the Commission of 1910, but I would remind the right hon. Gentleman that a good deal has occurred since the 1910 Conference. In 1910 the Parliamentary system was still in its heyday. It enjoyed the confidence of all nations. Nations were prepared to copy the Parliamentary system of this country,\nof which we have been so proud, and we as a nation were engaged in supporting the Parliamentary system in every way at home and in encouraging its adoption throughout the world. Can anybody say that that is the opinion of the world to-day? Several European countries, certainly two or three of them, have abolished the Parliamentary system, and others are wondering, and wondering gravely, whether the Parliamentary system is really feasible. We have had recently a series of revolutions in South America as a method of getting rid of a Government elected under the Parliamentary system.<\/p><p>Can anyone say in view of these facts that the Parliamentary system occupies the same high and unchallenged place that it did in the peaceful days before the War? The Commission of 1910 reported at a time when the Parliamentary system had been growing in prestige in this country and all over the world. Today, that prestige is no longer maintained. We read in our newspapers such headings as these: \"Is Parliament doomed?\" \"Can Parliament do its job?\" In view of that change of opinion, I suggest that the opinion of the Commission of 1910 on the present situation is about as valuable as the opinion of Noah would be on a modern battleship.<\/p><p>A most remarkable speech was delivered by the right hon. Member for Darwen (Sir H. Samuel). I had the pleasure of serving with him for several months on the Ullswater Conference, and I feel certain that he will not think I am discourteous when I say that we had that speech or the bulk of that speech delivered at the Conference. The remarkable thing about his speech was that it had nothing on earth to do with the Bill before the House. His speech was an eloquent plea for proportional representation. He based the whole of his argument on the fact that under the present system minorities do not get the representation to which in accordance with the number of votes given to them in the country they might reasonably consider themselves to be entitled. He pointed out with great eloquence and fervour that under the existing system it was possible for a Government returned by a minority of votes in an election to pass&#8212;he said, Protection, I might say\nSocialism&#8212;something opposed to the wishes of the majority. There is not one single word in this Bill to prevent that state of affairs occurring in the future.<\/p><p>The right hon. Gentleman seems to assume that under some magical dispensation of Providence the alternative vote will, somehow, give minorities representation, and he repeated an argument the fallacy of which I should have thought was universally recognised long ago. The Government of 1924 did not command a majority. I remember making a few remarks in this House on this subject during that Parliament. In 1924 there were 131 members elected to this House who did not command a majority vote in their constituency. Of that number 79 were Conservatives, 12 were Liberals and 36 were Socialists. What the right hon. Gentleman seems to have omitted altogether is the fact that, even if it assumed, and it is an assumption which it would take a very bold man indeed to make, that all those minority representatives had belonged to one or other party in opposition&#8212;it is no part of my argument to say to which party&#8212;the Government would still have had a majority of 44 over the combined opposition and would, therefore, have been in exactly the same strong position to pass any protective Measure they pleased, although the right hon. Gentleman says that it was in a minority in the country.<\/p><p>That is the fallacy underlying the whole of this Bill. If you want a Government, a House of Commons, which represents accurately the feeling of the country so that every section of political opinion is represented as closely as possible in its numerical strength in this House, you must go to a system of proportional representation, because no other system will do it. I do not know whether proportional representation is altogether an unmixed benefit. At the commencement of the Ullswater Conference my own personal opinion was strongly opposed to it, but I came to the conclusion that although it has many contradictions and faults yet, if it is the desire of Parliament and the country that this House should be an accurate representation of the different strengths and shades of political feeling, no other system is of the least use; that it is the one and only system that can possibly produce that result and the only system which can give any sane protection to\nminorities. The difficulty with regard to proportional representation and I am not quite certain that this is not also true of the alternative vote seems to me that it necessitates a considerable number of changes in our constitutional theory and practice.<\/p><p>One thing is certain, if you are going to have a Parliament representing closer the opinion in this country, such as you get in Germany and other continental countries, you will have to get rid once and for all of the doctrine of Cabinet responsibility. No Cabinet, no Government, can hope to hold office if it has to depend on different groups, each of whom may move one day in support of the Government and the next day the reverse. No Government can hold office in such circumstances. I do not think in any form of election to this House which perpetuates the idea of two, three or four parties can you allow the Prime Minister to retain the prerogative of advising His Majesty as to a dissolution. Every Government, every Parliament, abroad, in which the system of proportional representation obtains, has got rid, to a greater or a lesser extent, of the right of His Majesty the King or the Government of the country to demand the dissolution of the House. In France, which works under a second ballot, a dissolution can only be granted with the consent of the Senate. Germany has a fixed Parliament, but I am not certain that the President has not the overriding prerogative to dissolve Parliament.<\/p><p>If you are going to get the group system in the Parliament of this country the first and inevitable thing is to get rid of the present constitutional theory that the Prime Minister of the day has the right to advise dissolution. There is nothing which does more to strengthen the party machine in the House, but when, instead of having two party machines, you have five or six party machines it is obvious that this power cannot be entrusted to whoever may temporarily hold the office of Prime Minister. That is a point of view which the Government have not faced in this Bill. They have not started with the idea of what is best for the country, what kind of House of Commons is required, and, having settled that broad point of principle, brought in their Bill. The Bill is framed with the desire of getting\nthe biggest amount of compromise between themselves and hon. Members below the Gangway. If it is desired to have a House of Commons representing so closely the opinion of the country then proportional representation is the only method.<\/p><p>Do we really desire it? Do we want a House of Commons in which each shade of political opinion is accurately and numerically represented in this House? There is no difficulty in drafting a Bill to achieve that purpose; in fact, in Holland the system is already in operation. But I think the evils attending it far outweigh its advantages. It means weak Governments; and we are not a small country merely concerned with our domestic affairs which can afford to entertain weak Governments. We are an Imperial Power, and an Imperial House. We have many big burdens on our shoulders, which most foreign Parliaments escape, and for that reason alone a strong Government supported by a majority of this House is essential for our well-being. That is one thing. Is it also to be argued that the present system does not give us on the whole a pretty fair mirror of the country? I admit, I am not prepared to deny, that the swing of the pendulum one way or the other will give distinct advantage at this moment to one party and at another moment to another party, but it does not really strengthen the country, and can it be said that hon. Members in this House, representing many interests as well as many constituencies, do not on the whole give as fair a representation of the feelings of the people of this country as you will get by any other means?<\/p><p>I come to the proposal of the Government. My right hon. Friend the Member for Chelsea has already quoted the opinion of Professor Ramsay Muir on the alternative vote. With that opinion I am in wholehearted agreement. There is no guarantee under the alternative vote of any representation of minorities. But it has far greater evils even than that. If it did something to represent minorities there would be a case for it, but I want the House to consider, first, that under the alternative vote there is no real choice before the elector at all. Take an extreme, case, and sometimes an extreme case serves to point out the futility of a proposal. Take the case in which there\nis put up, and it is not such an unreasonable case after all, the representative of extreme prohibitionist views. The other two candidates both represent the ordinary view that a man should be entitled to have a drink if he wants it. It is easy to imagine that such a candidate would not succeed in polling one-eighth of the votes of the constituency, he would forfeit his deposit, and yet those who supported him and hold views to which both the other candidates are opposed would have the choice of selecting whether A or B really represented that constituency in this House. I admit that the case is extreme, but it shows the fatuity of the proposals of the Bill. Take also the position at another by-election which has been mentioned&#8212;North Paddington. The choice of a third party elector would have been whether he preferred an Empire Free Trader who was pledged to tax everything, or an official Conservative who was pledged to go rather less far in Protection.<\/p><p>But by far the greatest evil of the alternative vote is this: We all know that there are certain seats in this country, and they are common to all parties, in which it does not matter how many candidates are put up, for the candidate who represents the dominant party in that constituency is certain of being returned. Such constituencies are not many. I believe they are most common in the areas represented by hon. Members of the Labour party. But that does not matter. In every other constituency in this country the candidates of the two great and powerful parties are going to calculate who they think will be at the bottom of the poll. I happened to have a clear majority in my election, but I cannot guarantee it, and if this Bill came into force I should b ebound to consider which of my opponents would be at the bottom. Other candidates will have to make a similar calculation elsewhere. What will be the result? You will have Members angling for the bottom vote in nearly every constituency in the country. You can wipe out a few which are so certain in their choice as not to matter. But what will be the effect on this House of the Bill's proposal?<\/p><p>Take the electoral situation in the South and West. You will have hon.\nMembers of the Liberal party and hon. Members of the Conservative party angling for the votes of the Socialists. There are parts of England in which Liberals invariably are at the bottom in present conditions. You will have hon. Members of the Labour party and Conservatives angling for the votes of the Liberals. In other parts of England Conservatives are always at the bottom. You will have hon. Members of the Liberal and Labour parties angling for the Conservative votes. What will be the condition of the House of Commons returned in those circumstances? Two-thirds of the Members are going to be cross-pledged on every question&#8212;pledged by their own party point of view and by the point of view of the party whose votes they have been hoping to carry in order to get their seats. You might find that the exact contingency that the right hon. Member for Darwen is so anxious to avoid-that Protection would be brought in by a minority Government&#8212;will be the exact condition under which hon. Members opposite will get a majority, because in places they have angled for the Protectionist vote in order to make quite certain of their seats, or conversely because we have angled for Socialist votes. The Bill is a protection against nothing. The Home Secretary made a great claim that he had abolished plural voting by this Bill. He proposed on the one hand to take plural voting away from the direct taxpayer, and on the other hand to give it to the representatives of the smallest party in any constituency. By this Bill the right hon. Gentleman is not abolishing plural voting but is merely changing its incidence. He made out some case, or tried to make out some case for the abolition of plural voting but I would remind him in reference to the long historical disquisition to which he treated this House, of the old principle of no taxation without representation. The danger to-day seems to be that you are going to get representation without taxation.<\/p><p>There is another feature about this very remarkable Bill on which I should like to say a few words. That is in reference to the use of motor cars. As the right hon. Gentleman said we had an interesting Debate on that subject not so long ago and I do not wish to weary the\nHouse by repeating any of the remarks which I made on that occasion. I would only remark that if this Clause comes into operation I for one shall reflect with sorrow that I am not a keeper of a public-house. The Bill says that you must not take voters to the poll, but I can see nothing to prevent anybody taking people to the \"Blue Pig\" or the \"Spotted Cow\" or whatever public-house happens to be conveniently adjacent to the polling place and depositing them there. I have no doubt that those who wish to bring voters to the poll will do it with immense benefit to the licensed vintners but very small benefit to anybody else. This provision, I believe, to be unworkable. It can only be enforced by the total prohibition of the use of all vehicles other than those required for trade purposes on polling day. It may or it may not be a good thing to prevent riding to the poll but I do not think that any legislation which we are asked to pass in this House, short of the total prohibition of the use of cars for all purposes on polling day, is going to achieve that end.<\/p><p>I wish to make one remark on the subject of election expenses. I notice that the Government proposals include a proposal to reduce expenses both in counties and boroughs. In the last Parliament I was partly instrumental in effecting a reduction in the expenses in counties, and, as far as that is concerned, I would point out to the Government that we have had only one election since the 1928 Act and that election was in the summer. The counties in many cases are scattered areas, and I ask that we should be content with the reduction that has taken place for the present; that we should wait and see whether or not that reduction will prove sufficient in a campaign fought during the winter months. With regard to the boroughs I take the same position as I took in 1928. I would put this point of view to the Government and their supporters. A reduction in election expenses is very often for the benefit of the sitting Member, and against a candidate who has not previously represented the constituency posters are expensive, and a sitting Member whose name, as a rule, is well known in the constituency, does not require posters. But the same thing is not necessarily true of a candidate appearing for the\nfirst time, especially if he comes in at the eleventh hour.<\/p><p>The Government have introduced this Bill at a time when, as my right hon. Friend said, the country is thinking of unemployment and of the economic position. There is not a single provision in this Bill which will give any assistance to those who are out of work. We on these benches may believe that the Bill is introduced as the result of a compact between the Government and those below the Gangway on this side. That may be so or not, but this Bill is not required. There is no mandate for it from the country, and to introduce it now is an outrage upon our Parliamentary procedure.<\/p>",

Friend the Foreign Secretary, who is at Geneva, it falls to me to move the Second Reading of this Bill, I will endeavour to give the House an account of the facts which have led up to the introduction of the Bill, and some particulars of the Bill itself. The object of the Bill is to implement the friendly agreement which was reached last September between the Government of China and His Majesty's Government in this country. This Bill repeals the China Indemnity (Application) Act, 1925. That Act, passed in the last Parliament, never came into effective operation owing to the disturbed condition of China in 1925 and the two\nfollowing years, but since 1928 a considerable and fortunate change has come over the Chinese scene, and the provisions of the Act of 1925, for reasons which I will endeavour to explain, are no longer applicable to the new situation.<\/p><p>The past history of this question is summarised in a White Paper which was issued last November, Command Paper 3715, which I have no doubt will have been studied by hon. Members who are interested in the question. In that White Paper there is an outline of the history of the indemnity from 1901, when it began to be paid, until December, 1917, when the situation was altered by the entry of China into the War on the Allied side. Payments were then suspended until 1922. On 20th December, 1922, when the payments were on the point of being resumed, His Majesty's Government of that date informed the Chinese Government that they had decided to devote the proceeds of the British share of the Boxer Indemnity to projects mutually beneficial to China and this country. That declaration is of primary importance in the development of this question. The Act of 1925 was designed to give effect to the pronouncement of December, 1922. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, under the Act of 1925, was to decide what projects were mutually beneficial to this country and China. He was to be assisted by an advisory committee. The advisory committee was duly constituted, and included three distinguished Chinese citizens. Its chairman was Lord Buxton, and one of its leading members was Lord Willingdon, who went out to China at the head of a delegation of six members of the committee to examine on the spot the requirements of the situation and to study Chinese opinion on the subject.<\/p><p>I should like to pay a tribute to the long, arduous and valuable labours which Lord Buxton performed from the moment he accepted the onerous post of chairman of the advisory committee right up to the conclusion of the negotiations conducted by His Majesty's present Government. Throughout that time, despite advancing years and in spite of, at times, I regret to say, considerable ill-health, Lord Buxton always gave fully of his knowledge, his energy and his time to this project, to which he was so much devoted. I should not like this occasion to pass without his knowing that this House\nremembers, and thanks him for, his work. The report of the advisory committee over which Lord Buxton presided was issued in 1926 as Command Paper 2766. It is a valuable document and, although in certain respects the situation has changed since that time, it lays down very important outlines of policy, and gives a great deal of practical information which might well be studied by any hon. Member who is following this matter closely.<\/p><p>Why is it that the Act of 1925 has now become inapplicable? Primarily for this reason, that whereas in 1925 there was no national government of China recognised by His Majesty's Government, and the Act consequently did not represent negotiated settlement, there has been since 1928 a national government in China recognised by His Majesty's Government. Consequently, it became necessary to substitute, and we have finally succeeded in substituting, a negotiated settlement for a uni-lateral decision by His Majesty's Government. That is the fundamental reason why the Act of 1925 no longer fits the present situation. Under the Act of 1925 the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had himself to determine the mode of expenditure of these moneys. He was required under the Act to provide for applying the money \"to such educational or other purposes\" as were in his opinion beneficial to the mutual interests of the two countries. The Chinese, under the Act of 1925, had no direct share in deciding how the money ought to be spent, and partly for this reason discussion took place in this House in. 1925 on the adequacy of the guarantees contained in the Act of 1925 that the money would be spent primarily upon educational purposes.<\/p><p>7.0 p.m.<\/p><p>There were some hon. Members, of whom I was one, who had doubts. I made a speech of six words, which I have no doubt will be quoted later on. I frankly say that I had doubts at that time, and for that reason I seconded an Amendment moved by one of my hon. Friends, although we did not press it to a Division. That belongs to history and to a different situation. A number of hon. Members, of whom I was one, had doubts at that time, but I hasten to add that the position has completely changed, and changed for the better, and our\ndoubts have now been resolved, for reasons which I will explain. The Chinese Government has been recognised since the end of 1928. It is increasingly in control&#8212;I will not say absolutely and completely in control&#8212;of the Chinese situation. The destroying flames of the long civil war have sunk to flickering embers in outlying provinces, and we hope that they will not flare up again. The prospects of peace and recovery in China seem brighter now than they have done for many years. This settlement is not an imposed, but a negotiated settlement to which the Chinese Government. recognised by our predecessors, have freely assented. I should like to pay a tribute to the work done in connection with these negotiations by Sir Miles Lampson, our representative in Peking, and by Dr. Wang, the Chinese Foreign Minister. All the moneys covered by this Bill are to be devoted to education, either by direct grants or by the creation of educational endowments. The Bill deals, in the first instance, with accumulated funds of something over &#163;3,500,000 now on deposit in a bank at Shanghai. This sum is to be transferred to London, and out of it two direct educational grants are to be paid, one of &#163;265,000 to the Hong Kong University and one of &#163;200,000 to the Universities' China Committee in London. That leaves a residue of something over &#163;3,000,000 which is to be paid over to the Chinese Government Purchasing Commission constituted under this Bill. It is constituted as follows: The Chairman is to be His Excellency the Chinese Minister in London, and there is also to be a representative of the Chinese Ministry of Railways and four other persons described in the Bill as being persons of standing, with wide experience in business matters. They are to be chosen by the Chinese Government from a panel which will be submitted to the Chinese Government by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I, too, very much welcome this Bill. It is something like 20 years since this subject was discussed in this House, and in the interval we have had great troubles, which have given many of the Colonies an opportunity to show that they are prepared to do their utmost to provide defences, and very efficient ones in many instances. This is an opportunity for increasing the popularity, and even for increasing the knowledge of the names, of many of our Colonies, which to-day are not sufficiently well known in this country. Subjects like this seem to be dealt with very quickly in this House. That must be either because of the apathy of the people or because of their unshakable belief in the sufficiency of the Admiralty. I think it is the belief in the Admiralty. I may not be believed when I say that people do not know very much about the Colonies. It is on record that a Royal Commission suggested even the giving up of the whole of the West African Colonies not many years ago. I am glad to see that the Bill gives the Colonies an opportunity of providing themselves with a defence and of combining in that admirable project.<\/p><p>Although I know the names of all our Colonies, I am not sure whether all of them come within the scope of the Bill. I do not know whether there exists a Parliamentary definition of a Colony, and I shall be glad of information on the subject. There are all sorts of small places and some very large places with immense revenues. There are smaller Colonies like the Bahamas, Barbados, British Guiana, Trinidad, the Leeward Islands and Mauritius; then in West Africa there\nare Nigeria, Gambia and Sierra Leone; and there are places like the Straits Settlements and Ceylon. I would like to know whether the Federated Malay States are in fact a Colony or not. If so they are in a very strong position to help towards the expense of providing naval defence. Clause 1 of the Bill refers to the expense of maintaining and using vessels of war. The Straits Settlements have a revenue of nearly &#163;7,000,000; Hong Kong, &#163;2,750,000; the West African Colonies, Nigeria, Gambia and Sierra Leone, have between them an annual revenue approaching &#163;12,000,000; and even Trinidad and British Guiana have about &#163;3,000,000.<\/p><p>If we can impress on the Colonies the necessity for their own defence, and how welcome would be their aid in the event of the Empire getting into trouble, we shall do a great deal of good by discussing this Bill. At the present time something like 25s. a head is paid for the naval defence of the country, but in many of our Colonies vast sums of money are made by people who live and have their business in those Colonies and in most instances do not pay anything directly towards the defence of this country. and of the Empire and of the Colony in which they live. I am delighted to see in this Bill the two provisions which have been mentioned, one empowering the Colonies to combine and the other in regard to the training of naval ratings and officers from the Colonies. I think that those parts of the Bill are altogether to the good.<\/p><p>I wish to put one or two questions upon the actual terms of the Measure. I am anxious to know what are the limits of the conditions mentioned in Clause 1? What are the conditions which would not be approved? Are they actually laid down or is this merely a wide expression which has to await events before being brought into play? I should also like to know whether there has been in fact any actual combination of Colonies in connection with the question of their mutual defence and, if so, what Colonies have made such combinations? I also hope that the hon. Gentleman will be able to give us some indication of what sort of ships are kept by the Colonies at the present time and the numbers of men and officers which they have enlisted for manning those ships.<\/p><p>Clause 2 dealing with Colonial naval forces opens up the vast question of the naval defence of the territorial waters of some Colonies. In the case of the Straits Settlements, for instance, if carried to its logical conclusion, the question of the naval defence of the Colony, albeit within its own territorial waters, is a very large, important and technical subject which I trust is being carefully studied. Such a matter might easily include the provision of torpedoes, aircraft, wireless telegraphy, booms and even submarines. That I hope will be borne in mind by the hon. Gentleman, realising the great scope which this Bill gives to the Colonies.<\/p><p>I have one small doubt about paragraph (<i>b<\/i>) of Clause 2, Sub-section (1), as to whether or not this means that the officers and men belong to the Colony, or whether the \"establishments or other places\" belong to the Colony. I think the Bill is not only timely, but useful, and I would congratulate the hon. Gentleman and the First Lord and the Department on introducing it. If the Bill has the effect of making the Colonies realise that it is their duty to combine for their mutual defence and to standardise methods, material, personnel and equipment and also if it will infuse into the people of this country a greater knowledge of and interest in our possessions, then it will have served a great purpose and will redound to the credit not only of the hon. Gentleman who has introduced it, but of the Department with which he is connected.<\/p>",

We seem to have given up the short-term policy and the idea of concentrating our efforts on the making of roads and bridges, and we are concentrating upon what has come to be regarded as long-term proposals for dealing with unemployment. I think that is all to the good. We have been concentrating on roads and bridges long enough, and the time has come when we should get to the root of the unemployment problem. I hope in the discussion that will take place between now and the termination of the debate on the Address and the amendments which will follow we shall deal with what I regard as the vital fundamental considerations affecting this great problem.<\/p><p>We have been called upon to defend, on behalf of the Government, works which have been undertaken and schemes that have been approved in order to find employment for the unemployed. After a careful examination of the work done by successive Governments for the last 10 years in the realm of public relief works, I have no hesitation in saying that the Labour Government have a record with which there is no comparison. I state emphatically that no Government since the year 1920 has accomplished anything like what has been achieved by the present Government in providing employment through the medium of public works. Schemes of one kind and another have been approved amounting to no less than &#163;135,000,000. It is quite true that all those schemes are not yet in full swing, but we have at present 150,000 workmen employed directly and indirectly in this country on schemes which have been approved and set in motion by this Government. No less than &#163;28,000,000 has been sanctioned under Part I of the Development Act quite apart from schemes sanctioned by the Unemployment Grants Committee. Every scheme that is approved for grant under that Act has a time limit, and, on the basis of the schemes approved and the time for which they will be in operation, all the evidence goes to show that by the end of this year we shall have employed, directly and indirectly on schemes of\nwork promoted by the present Government, not less than 200,000 workpeople. I say without fear of contradiction that no such record can be traced during the last 10 years as a result of the efforts of any other Government, and I say that having gone through every year's programme of each of the Governments that have been in office during the last 10 years. I have no hesitation in saying that, if all that we had to do were to prove that in that realm we could do, and have done, as much as and considerably more than any previous Government, our task would be a very easy and light one.<\/p><p>I am not, however, so much concerned about the progress that we are making in that direction as I am anxious about the policy that is being developed in the industrial realm. When we look at the unemployment statistics, we find that, roughly, 2,200,000 people are unemployed. We can trace them all in the industries; we know exactly where they are unemployed; we can examine the industry and find out why they are unemployed; and we ought to be able, at least to some extent, to develop a policy for dealing with this problem at its source. That is a matter in which the Government have already done a very important piece of useful preliminary work. We have to endeavour to appreciate the real nature of the problem with which we are dealing. To what extent are the causes permanent in character? To what extent are they beyond our control? To what extent is unemployment measured by the contraction of our markets abroad, and to what extent is that contraction permanent? We have to ask ourselves questions of this kind, and to find answers to them.<\/p><p>When we examine the problem from that standpoint, we shall find that a very substantial number of our army of unemployed are where they are through permanent causes, causes over which we have no control, causes which nobody in this country can counteract. I will give one or two illustrations of what I mean. It does not matter which of the big staple industries you take, they all tell the same tale. Let us take cotton as an example. We have employed in the cotton industry about 554,000 workpeople, of whom, I believe, nearly one half are at present on the live register. I have been looking at this problem of cotton. It is\ntrue that at present a very considerable number of the persons unemployed in the cotton industry are idle on account of political unrest due to conditions over which we have no control; but, apart altogether from that political unrest, we have an army of unemployed in the cotton industry which cannot be accounted for by that phenomenon. In pre-War days, in 1913, we exported from this country 7,000,000,000 yards of cotton cloth. Last year we exported 3,700,000,000 yards. Nearly half the total export trade in cotton cloth from this country was lost between 1913 and 1929. We have to inquire why we have lost that trade. When we look at the markets, we find that in India, Japan, China, Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements we had a market representing about 62 per cent. of our total foreign markets for cotton, and 77 per cent. of our loss of markets is accounted for out there. What is the explanation of that? Have we lost that because other people have taken it from us? Have we lost it because they are not consuming as much cotton now as before, or has it gone because they are producing their own, or it is partly due to each of these causes?<\/p><p>Let us take the case of India as an example. In 1913 we sent to India 3,000,000,000 yards. Last year we sent 1,200,000,000 yards. We have lost substantially more than a half of our Indian market. We have lost 1,800,000,000 yards. I want to know, why did we lose it? We lost it for this simple reason, that out there in the East a great industrial development has taken place right at the very heart of our market. Whereas in 1914, in India, Japan and China, there were 10,000,000 spindles, to-day there are 21,000,000. As against 130,000 looms, there are now 278,000. India is not consuming less cotton, but she is producing for herself 1,600,000,000 yards more now than she did in 1913. That market has gone to that extent, and it has gone further than that. We have that fact to face, and we have this further fact to face, that we have not held our own in cotton in any country in the world, and it is largely due to the fact that you have this big industrial development going on right in our own markets. It means that we are not going to employ as many people in future in produc-\ning goods for consumption abroad as we have done in the past. The same tale is told in the coal industry. The same lesson is to be learned from the iron and steel industry, and I think there is no doubt that we shall have to employ more of our people in producing for the home market in future than we have been employing in that direction hitherto.<\/p><p>But, while I say that, I want to make my position very clear. Not only are we losing our markets abroad owing to the kind of cause I have mentioned, but if we are going to retain what we have and in any way improve our position, we shall have to concentrate upon creating a higher standard of efficiency in industrial undertakings than exists at present. That is a matter to which the Government have been devoting an enormous amount of time and attention. We have had the advantage of the assistance of an Economic Advisory Council. We have had inquiries into coal, into cotton, into iron and steel. Negotiations have been proceeding between representatives of the Government and those great industries with a view to putting them on a more efficient basis than they have occupied for some time past and, in doing that work, the Government are engaged in real, solid, substantial work for solving this great unemployment problem, and finding work for the people.<\/p><p>It may be said that is a slow process, but we are dealing with the results of a slow test which has been in operation for a good many years, and it is going to take time. I have heard nothing in the House to-day that indicates how we are going to solve this problem except by a gradual process. In order to do everything that it is possible to do you must get down to the root causes and replace inefficiency by efficiency and by that means try to build up our industries in a more effective manner. I said just now that we shall have to develop our home markets. We are consuming in this country every year something like &#163;50,000,000 or &#163;60,000,000 of what are called hog products, bacon, ham, pork, lard and that kind of thing, and also eggs and poultry&#8212;&#163;140,000,000 worth of stuff for which we have a market and which we could produce for ourselves and thus find employment for 200,000 people. I see no reason at all why we should not develop that home market and\nfind employment there for our people in the production of the necessaries of life for the people in this country. We are endeavouring to develop an agricultural policy along those lines which will undoubtedly place a considerable number of people on to the land. The extent to which that policy will make progress will depend, to some degree, at any rate, upon the co-operation we get in this House in carrying our measures through.<\/p><p>It is not merely our agricultural products to which we shall have to pay attention. We shall have to pay more regard to our home market for our industrial products. I should be one of the last men in this House to urge anything in the nature of protection for inefficiency. Whatever else comes along we cannot have that. But I do hope that we shall hammer out the matter in this Debate, everybody taking their turn or their responsibility in trying to find a solution, and how best to apply any sort of method that can be devised towards making our own home industries as highly efficient as possible, and at the same time maintaining our home market as fully as possible for those who may be employed in our own country. It is along those lines that I feel convinced we shall find the best results for the unemployed workers in this country. We may go on finding, as we hope to do, as much work as possible in the kind of schemes which have been promoted hitherto. We shall give every encouragement to the local authorities to do all that they can in that direction, together with such grants as we can assure them, but I am hoping that that is not the direction in which Parliament will look for a satisfactory solution to our troubles. I am very much afraid that in the past we have concentrated so much on 'schemes of public work that we have been drawn aside from a study of the real problem with which we are confronted. If in some of our industries we have to face a contraction, and a permanent contraction, as I think is the case, it is no use trying to meet that situation by talking about longer hours and lower wages. Those devices will not make the markets of the same dimensions as in pre-War days and any attempt to expand them to that magnitude by the method of low wages and longer hours must be regarded as a delusion, while arty policy based\nupon a delusion is bound to lead us in the wrong direction.<\/p><p>When the debate began to-day I understood that it was to be devoted to unemployment insurance, but I think that only about two references have been made to that subject. There will be other opportunities for discussing that matter. The Minister of Labour will deal very fully with it when she speaks. So far as the question was dealt with to-day, we were told that the scheme as an insurance scheme has been smashed to smithereens, or that the bottom has been knocked out of it, that the contributions of the employers, the workmen and the State total &#163;45,000,000 per annum; that the payments being made out of the Fund total &#163;70,000,000, that the &#163;25,000,000 difference has to be made good by borrowing and that the Minister of Labour will have to come to the House to ask for a further loan. The suggestion was made that instead of doing what is suggested in the King's Speech, namely, referring that issue to a Royal Commission, something ought to be done now to rectify matters. We were told that the thing ought to be made to balance, Mat it ought to be put upon an actuarial basis, but no one undertook the task of saying how that was to be done. Is it proposed to reduce benefits? I am afraid we shall not be able to lend much support to that. If it is a matter of increasing contributions, that is a very serious thing for industry. The burdens upon industry to-day are by no means a matter of indifference, and to add to those burdens would have very serious results. It could not be done without very serious consideration as to its effect and its reactions.<\/p><p>The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Carnarvon Boroughs (Mr. Lloyd George) said that he knew of a case whereby working short time, men, I think he said at the docks, had been able to earn &#163;4 10s. a week and afterwards get unemployment benefit. The suggestion was made that the Minister of Labour ought to make provision against that sort of thing in the Bill which she will have to introduce in the near future for dealing with a further loan. wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman would be satisfied if we provided in a Bill that anyone who earns &#163;4 10s. in three days is not entitled to get any\nunemployment benefit afterwards. Of course, he would not. Nobody would be satisfied with any such proposals. If you go to South Wales among the miners you will find thousands of men who do not get more than 7s. 6d. or 7s. 9d. a shift and when they work three days a week they have 22s. or 23s. By the time their unemployment and health insurance and other insurance deductions have been made they have about &#163;1 left, and when they pay at least 10s. for rent they have 10s. left for the purposes of life.<\/p><p>It is all very well to talk about &#163;4 10s., but, if you are going to apply any rule, you must be very careful that you are not, in the process of removing one evil, or one abuse, or one injustice, reintroducing a dozen difficulties and injustices in its place. If there are cases where it can be shown that people are drawing benefit who ought not to be drawing benefit, if it can be shown that there are abuses of the kind suggested, no one in this House, no matter to what party he may belong, will want to bolster up anything of the kind; but before any change can be made we want to have the light of publicity thrown upon the allegations that are made throughout the country on a very broad scale. For three or four months I have been in close touch with the Minister of Labour in the matter of unemployment, and every case we have seen in the newspapers, every rumour and allegation that has been made, we have checked and tested and tried to trace its source, and I am amazed at the very small amount of evidence that we can get in support of the allegations that are being made. As a Government we say that if the people making these allegations can substantiate them let them go before a Royal Commission and let the light of publicity be thrown upon them. If there are abuses of any kind, if someone is getting something to which in fair play and equity they are not entitled, let the matter be made public. Let those who have evidence of these abuses bring it forward. We do not suggest that there should he a report at the end of a year or two years, but that an interim report should be made dealing with the most pressing matters.<\/p><p>It is not merely a matter of the difference between the contributions to the Insurance Fund and the amount of pay-\nments out with which we have to deal. Next March or April we shall have to deal with 340,000 people who, unless Parliament does something in the meantime, will be deprived of benefit altogether. They have nothing at all upon which to fall back. Will anyone in this House say that these 340,000 people should be put on the Poor Law? The Poor Law authorities would not undertake the obligation, and I doubt whether there is any responsible member of the Liberal or Tory party who would advocate it. Everyone agrees that it simply cannot be done. We think, having regard to all the facts, to the way this matter has grown up and developed, that it is of first class importance that the whole matter should be referred to a Royal Commission, that a complete survey of the whole scheme should be undertaken, and when the reports are received that they should be considered with a view to introducing any legislation Which may be necessary in order to bring the law and the scheme into harmony with the best interests of this people of this country.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<\/p><p>I am very glad to be associated with my hon. and gallant Friend in this debate on recruiting, and I would like to deal with the subject from two other aspects. I will deal first with the influence of recruiting on our Army abroad. We have many commitments in the rest of the world. Take first the question of India. It is common knowledge, and we have had an instance of it in our debate earlier to-day, that tremendous difficulties confront the Government with regard to India at the present time. There are in India some 60,000 Regulars who are recruited from this country, and the welfare of these effectives is clearly in the hands of the War Office. Anything that lessens the quality or the quantity of the\nrecruits will have a deep significance in the deliberations that are before us in the coming year. Not only is the British Army concerned in India, but it is also concerned in Egypt. I should not be in order in going into these questions, except from the point of view of their influence upon recruiting. It is well known that what keeps the Empire together, from the point of view of India, Australia and this country, is the free passage through the Suez Canal. Therefore, while we have 6,000 troops on the Suez Canal and 1,700 in the Sudan, it is obvious that there, again, recruting in this country has a great effect on the British Empire.<\/p><p>I should like to know what the Secretary of State is doing to promote recruiting. We have had troubles in Palestine; and they are likely to break out again. The Army, together with the Air Force, has been called upon to step in these. Then, in China we have a situation which is a drain on our resources. The Government has seen fit to maintain garrisons at Shanghai and Hong Kong. All these matters are affected by the state of recruiting in this country. The state of trade is also indirectly affected by the presence of a strong efficient garrison in these parts. When I say \"strong,\" I do rot mean strong from the point of view of numbers, but a garrison which is effective and efficient. Take the question of Malta, which is the centre of a different kind of disturbance. It is a very handy place in which to keep troops because you can send them to many other parts quite easily. I want to know how these places are being affected by recruiting in this country, and to emphasise as strongly as I can the danger of a shortage of recruits in maintaining these many important garrisons abroad, which are so essential to the trade of this country.<\/p><p>Let me take another aspect of this question. For many years past the housing conditions in the Army have not been up to standard, but since the present Government have been in office they have been accentuated by the crowding caused by the troops being brought back from the Rhine. I say it with regret, but the Government do not appear to know whether the housing conditions meet the requirements of the troops, and especially the requirements of married\nsoldiers with families. It is rather unusual that a Socialist Minister should not have the facts as to the housing of the Army at his disposal. I regret it very much and I hope we shall not hear from him that it is not his fault. There is a tendency on the part of the present Government to blame the last Government for any neglect. What is the case with regard to housing? There are 2,000 married families in quarters which are altogether too small. When the Government say that they are out for a large building programme we must judge them by their actual deeds, and I suggest that as the facts with regard to the housing of the Army become known it will have a serious influence on recruiting. There are at the present time, due to the recent additions, some slum conditions in the Army&#8212;<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I wish to take the opportunity to raise upon this Vote a matter that has been before this House several times since the year 1922 and which has not yet been satisfactorily solved. I refer to the question of mui-tsai in the Crown Colony of Hong Kong. I am well aware that the majority of hon. Members in the Chamber know perfectly well what mui-tsai is, but in the event of new Members not realising what the system is, I want to say quite clearly that it is a matter of slavery which still exists under the British flag and in one of our Crown Colonies. It is a system whereby little girls from seven and eight, years upwards are deliberately sold for certain sums of money. I have a list here of the prices that are paid for little girls in the Crown Colony of Hong Kong. Sometimes the price is 96 dollars, and at other times it is 80 dollars. But it is a question of selling little girls into slavery. It is not my desire to attempt in any way to harass the feelings of hon. Members by describing what the slavery is. There is no doubt that in certain cases, perhaps, the little girls are well treated, but there have been cases again and again of revolting cruelty in the Crown Colony of Hong Kong. Sometimes they are beaten, and I have instances where little girls are cruelly tortured by being burned by hot coals. It is quite obvious that the selling of little girls into slavery is a system which should no longer exist under the British flag. It is a crime to enslave man. How much greater a crime is it to enslave children! In 1880, when Sir John Hennessy was Governor of Hong Kong, he wrote these words:\n<q>I had from time to time made some efforts to expose and check the form of slavery and of the buying and selling of children in connection with the brothel system in Hong Kong.<\/q>\nHe went on to say:\n<q>The more I penetrate below the polished surface of our civilisation the more convinced am I that the broad under-current of life here is more like the Southern States of America when slavery was dominant than it resembles the all-pervading civilisation of England.<\/q>\nSince then ordinance after ordinance has been passed to abolish that evil, and they have been ignored. There are difficulties to overcome. In 1922 or 1923 this matter was investigated, and its abolition was ordered as being contrary to the principles of British law and justice. At\nthat time, the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Epping (Mr. Churchill) was the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and he took energetic steps to do away with the system, but unfortunately that system still exists. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Epping wrote to the Government of Hong Kong in February, 1922, as follows:\n<q>I am not at all satisfied. Unless I am able to state that this institution does not involve the slightest element of compulsory employment (which is the essence of slavery) and that every mui-tsai of a certain age is in law and practice free if she wishes to leave her adopted parents or employers. I cannot defend its existence in a British colony. So far as administration measures can make it so this freedom must be real.<\/q>\nAfter that energetic steps were taken, and then, to the complete surprise of everybody, it was found six years afterwards that the ordinance had been ineffective, and had not worked at all. It is astounding that a system of this kind should be allowed to exist so long in one of our Crown Colonies. A Bill dealing with this question was passed in 1926, and the present Secretary of State for the Colonies has stated that it has been entirely ineffectual.<\/p><p>I wish to draw the attention of the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies to another evil system which is closely allied to the one I have already mentioned, and it is the selling of young girls under the system of tolerated houses, which still exists in the Crown Colony of Hong Kong. It is well known to everyone who has studied the League of Nations Commission on the Traffic in Women and Children that where tolerated houses exist and State regulation of vice, as in Hong Kong, there is always a sale of girls. One way of dealing with this question is to abolish tolerated houses. I call the attention of the Under-Secretary to the fact that this evil still exists in the Crown Colony of Hong Kong, and I wish to know whether the subject of tolerated houses is one which is going to be considered at the coming Imperial Conference. I do not wish the House to think that no steps have been taken to deal with this question. The Secretary of State issued an ordinance last year to the Government of Hong Kong which stated:\n<q>It now appears, however, that six years from the passing of the ordinance, the most\nthat can be said is that there is no reason to believe that the number of mui-tsai in the colony has increased.<\/q><q>After making all allowance for their difficulties in bringing the system to an end, which are described at length in your despatches, it is my duty to inform you that public opinion in this country and in the House of Commons will not accept such a result with equanimity.<\/q>\nIt may be assumed that very little of this evil is known outside the Crown Colony of Hong Kong. I would like to point out that from my own constituency I have received letters urging me to bring this matter before the House of Commons. I admit that the last Ordinance has been more effective than the previous one, and it was decided that a report of its working should be sent to England every six months. I would like the Under-Secretary to tell the House whether the first report has yet been received, because the Ordinance was put into force in December, 1929, and I want to know if the report will be made public when it has been received by the Colonial Office. The present position is that the Hong Kong Government have dishonoured their pledge on this question by allowing this evil to continue uninterrupted. I agree that if this new Ordinance is put into force it will do much to deal with the evil, but experience on these questions in the past shows that it is absolutely necessary that public pressure must be brought to bear if such Ordinances are to be made effective. I have brought this question forward, because I believe it is the earnest desire of every Member of this House that this state of things should be blotted out.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I should like to make a few remarks on civil flying. It is obvious that we have fallen behind in our civil aviation, compared with other great Powers. I have heard nothing to-day to convince me that we are going to redress the balance, and that that balance will not increase against us as time goes on. The right hon. and gallant Member for Ripon (Major Hills) tried to disparage some of these remarks, but later on he called attention to the fact that the Germans were selling far more aeroplanes than we are, showing that Germany is going well ahead of us.\nWithout fear of contradiction, I can say that just after the War we were in the most advantageous position of any nation. We had the largest resources, we had the finest airmen and the finest mechanics. There must be some reason for this country having got behind, and I think the reason is that, although we had a good start, physically and materially, we made a bad start in principles.<\/p><p>In 1918, a Committee was appointed to inquire into civil aviation transport, known as the Civil Aviation Transport Committee, and the principles laid down by that Committee were hopelessly wrong. They laid down the principle that civil aviation, which is peculiarly within the province of the Air Ministry, is a military question. Had we started that way when we invented steam engines&#8212;a far greater revolution than aviation&#8212;and had we put all steamships under the Admiralty, the Mercantile Marine would never have developed in the way that it did. The second principle laid down by the Committee was that it was vitally necessary that airmen should conform fully to military requirements. Had we laid it down that railways should conform to military requirements we should never have got the fine system of railways that we have to-day. The Duke of Wellington and the War Office violently opposed the building of the London to Portsmouth railway on the ground that it would facilitate the invasion of this country&#8212;a perfectly hopeless proposition.<\/p><p>When we allowed our cables to be unrestricted we got a monopoly of the cables of the world, and it was only when people began to interfere with our cables on the ground of strategy and all-red cables that we began to lose our monopoly of the cable service. The third principle laid down by the Committee was that types of commercial craft should for a long time be governed by their effective military use and that this requirement should be satisfied even at the cost of a serious diminution in the commercial value of both routes and craft. Could anyone conceive a more intolerable military proposition in regard to civil aviation? The two things are utterly incompatible. Military enterprise ever tends to discipline and rigid methods, while civil enterprise means the very breath of freedom. There is a great deal of philosophy in the saying:\n<q>High o'er the fence leaps Sunny Jim,<\/q><q>Freedom's the force that raises him.<\/q>\nThe result has been that all lines, clubs, aerodromes and companies depend upon the nod of the militarists and have become parasitic. In regard to the development of railways, steamers and road transport, there have been no subsidies, but payments for services rendered. The Lusitania and the Mauretania were the only exceptions where subsidies were given. The railways were, however, assisted to acquire land. The steamers found ports already in existence. The aeroplanes leapt into the air, so to speak, and they did not find aerodromes ready, and they did not find resources on shore ready. It was in these directions that the Air Ministry might have assisted far more than they did.<\/p><p>For instance, take Hong Kong as a shipping port. Some years after we acquired it the \"Times\" contained an article which stated that the place was not the slightest use and that no shipping was going there or could go there. We then provided resources for the shipping, and the port became one of the biggest in the world. We ought to have spent liberally on aerodromes, landing grounds and research, and especially on research. The Navy Estimates are down by &#163;5,000,000. How has that been done? The Government gave an assurance to the Admiralty that we were safe from a first-class war for 10 years. The Air Ministry have had the same assurance. Lord Trenchard as Chief of Staff told us that the wastage of aeroplanes is 30 per cent. in peace time. That is to say, the life of an aeroplane is 3&#8531; years. If we are not to have a war for 10 years would it not have been much better to have spent a great deal of the money that is available on civil aviation instead of on military aviation?<\/p><p>There is absolute inconsistency in the way we act with regard to disarmament. We demanded of Germany complete severance of all military ties. She is not allowed any military training in aviation in the agreement of 1926. But when we made an agreement by which Germany was disarmed the European nations said that they would disarm themselves. Surely we ought to apply to our civil flying exactly the same standard as we apply to Germany with regard to civil\nflying? What has been the result of military control? We had Lord Trenchard, Chief of Staff in 1022, making a speech at Glasgow in which he said that money spent on civil aviation had much better be spent on purely military effort. He changed his mind about that, I know, and the Secretary of State for Air in that year also changed his mind later and is now engaged upon increasing civil aviation in this country. The same Lord Trenchard told us that the wastage of aeroplanes in war would be 80 per cent. in the first month of war. Does not that point to the wisdom of building up more reserves through civil flying, as would be done if we had many aerodromes and civil aeroplanes? Even in the improbable event of war the civil part is of a great deal more importance than the military part because of the resources that it builds up.<\/p><p>10.0 p.m.<\/p><p>I must say a few words more in regard to inquiries on these matters. We have had no public inquiry in this country. We have had private inquiries. The Americans carried out a thoroughgoing inquiry into the whole question of aviation, including civil aviation. It was carried out under the direction of Mr. Coolidge and was under the chairmanship of Mr. Dwight Morrow, the present American Ambassador to Mexico, who is now at the Naval Conference in this country. He has a very brilliant American brain. That Committee reported that:\n<q>The union of civil and military air activities would breed distrust in every region in which commercial aviation sought extension.<\/q>\nIt went on to say:\n<q>The peace-time activities of the United States have never been governed by military considerations. To organise these peacetime activities, or what is thought may ultimately be one large branch of them, under military control or on a military basis, would be to make the same mistake which, properly or improperly, the world believes Prussia to have made in the last generation.<\/q>\nThose are very grave words which reflect on our system. On 19th July, 1927, I asked the then Prime Minister if he would have an inquiry on civil aviation and its association with the military department. I was refused that inquiry. I do not think that the question will brook delay and therefore I do not now ask for\ninquiry. The party opposite which has no responsibilities in this matter, might well insist, as it is the party professing the most pacific intentions, on the two being separated to-morrow.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>Then I will leave that subject severely alone and will come to the first of the hon. Member's remarks with which I do not agree. He was talking about the doctrine of needs, and be said that we needed widows' pensions and we needed unemployment pay. I would say this, that when we do need widows' pensions, when we do need money for social services, we do run up against the stingy mind that will object to the spending of money on these social services, but, as soon as you begin to talk about our naval or military needs, there is an open purse and we cannot spend too much. I would remind the hon. Member that since the Armistice, since the War to end all wars, since the War that was going to produce peace on earth and good will to all men, we have spent &#163;1,600,000,000 on armaments, and we have not spent nearly so much as that upon the more necessary social services. The hon. Member says that we have to spend money on need and we have to spend an adequate amount on a common Navy. What is an adequate amount? He went on to talk about American naval needs and French naval needs. But if France is to have adequate armaments, if the United States are to have adequate armaments, if Japan is to have adequate armaments, and if we are to have adequate armaments we are going to have cruisers all over the ocean, the world will be enormously more armed, and everybody will be enormously more insecure than they are at the moment. The more we arm, the more other nations arm, the more suspicion there is in the world and the more hatred there is in the world; and, when there is more suspicion and more hatred all that is necessary is something like the assassination of a Crown Prince, and then there is another Armageddon.<\/p><p>It is not good enough, now that there is a naval conference sitting, and particularly when the situation is precarious and difficult, for the hon. Member to get up and throw sand into the bearings and a monkey wrench into the machinery. This is not the place or the time, and even if it were it is certainly not helping what is perhaps the most historic Conference in naval history, upon which the whole world is waiting for practical results, to talk about France not paying her debts and all that sort of thing. If\nI am to say what I want to say on these questions, I hope it will help and not hinder the very delicate negotiations that are going on at this moment. The hon. Member spoke about what our Navy can do in regard to security, and how our armaments make for peace. If our armaments make for peace, then French armaments make for peace, French submarines make for peace, Italian submarines make for peace, Japanese Rodneys make for peace. If armaments make for peace, we should be intensely delighted if the Americans want to build more cruisers, and we might even allow Germany to build some, and also Russia, which, by the way, is the only country that is not joining in this armaments scramble. If armaments make for peace, let us encourage the other fellow to build all the armaments that he possibly can.<\/p><p>There is no security for France, or for this country, or for Italy, or any other country in the world, as long as we depend upon armaments for defence, and, as far as we are concerned, we are in the most desperate condition of any country in the world. It is true that our trade routes must be kept open. We have to buy and sell goods if we are to live, and we are desperately dependent upon the different countries in the world and upon the trade routes being kept open; but I wish that some of the people who depend upon navies and upon more cruisers for defence would consult some of their own technicians. The truth is, whether we like it or not, that the Navy cannot keep our ports open, that the Navy cannot defend us. No matter how many Dreadnoughts we have, no matter how many Rodneys we build, they cannot keep our ports open against the long-range aeroplane and the depth charge. The modern weapons of attack would put the Navy into the condition of bows and arrows. We could not keep our ports open, and there are a good many people who know that, but not so many who want to talk about it.<\/p><p>How are we to defend ourselves? We cannot defend ourselves by armaments. If the United States wanted to attack us, they would not have to indulge in any actual belligerency, they would not have to let loose the dogs of war. All that they would have to do would be to declare a financial and economic blockade, and we should soon sue for terms of\npeace. We are desperately dependent financially upon America, as far as our gold standard is concerned. It is not a gold standard; it is a dollar standard. As to raw materials, Lancashire is more desperately dependent upon Louisiana and Texas than upon Yorkshire. If America wanted to use her economic weapons, she would have us at her mercy. We cannot think in terms of keeping our trade routes open, we cannot think in terms of buying and selling goods, if we are going to think in terms of the old-fashioned militaristic methods of defence.<\/p><p>There is a real defence&#8212;to persuade the other fellow that there is nothing to be gained by attack. If we could only persuade the other fellow that winners were losers, that the world, economically speaking, was one country and that we were merely one county in the world, that any war was a civil war and, no matter how victorious we might be, or the other fellow might be, all we should have at the end of it would be a graveyard, a war debt and unpaid butchers' bills, if the peoples of the world understood that we were inter-dependent, that all the interests of the nations were harmonious and were not antagonistic, if they only understood what the real interests of nations are, no nation would make an attack and, if no nation made an attack, surely that would be our best defence.<\/p><p>I do not know whether I am making myself clear, but I am suggesting that never were we in such a dangerous position as we are at this moment. Never were lethal weapons so terrible and so shocking. When we think of the possibilities of a future war, the imagination of anyone owning an imagination sickens. We cannot defend ourselves. We cannot keep our trade routes open. We can go on spending our millions, but in the end we are all less secure. Our real defence is to understand the true relations that exist between nation and nation. I agree with General Smuts that this is a very dangerous world. I do not believe that the last War has ended the possibility of war, but I know that my best pals are dead, and that they gave their lives in exchange for hope. Those Tipperary singing lads died in the hope that that would be the last war. Now we are told we live in a dangerous world. What are we going to do about it? The\nvery fact that there is danger means that men and women of goodwill should think in terms of alternatives and of scattering the real truths of international relations, and of perfecting international machinery so that never again shall we have another war. If we had right thinking, there would be no war. What shall we use our Navy for?<\/p><p>I want hon. Members who will follow me to tell me who is the possible enemy. I know alliances are slippery things. They do not last long. We can love France yesterday and be suspicious of her to-day. We have loved and hated every country under heaven. We have fought with the Russians and against them, with the French and against them. We have boxed the compass in our likes and our dislikes. I want to know now who is the enemy. I know the \"Daily Mail\" will provide us with one. Hon. Members opposite would love a Sermon on the Mount, Christian war with Russia. If there was a change of Government there we should soon have another enemy. I want to know now who is the enemy against whom we are to build a navy. Then I want to know why that enemy will attack us, what will be the purpose of the attack and what are they going to gain out of it.<\/p><p>A lot of flap doodle is talked about the Empire. There is a story told about the Empire by the hon. Member for North Bradford (Mr. Angell), my intellectual godfather, the author of \"The Great Illusion,\" the greatest book on international relationships ever written, a man who has never had to apologise for a single line he has written, a man who has been pathetically right. If the world had been advised by him, it would have been a much happier world than it is. This is the story. There was a Cockney who was listening to a patriotic speech at the time of the Coronation Procession. He walked away and soliloquized thus. \"I am a great man. I am a member of the greatest Empire the world has ever seen. I am an Englishman, and England owns Canada, Australia, Uganda, Nigeria, Hong Kong, Timbuctoo, and many other places, and, therefore, I own part of Canada, part of Australia, part of Hong Kong, and part of the biggest Empire the world has ever seen; but, in spite of the fact that I own so much, I have nowhere to\nsleep to-night and I am very hungry. I wonder if any pawnbroker will advance me anything on my property.\" The story is that we are supposed to own the Empire. The fact is that the Empire is owned by the people who live there and by the international pawnbrokers. If we are going to think in terms of Empire, let us hope the people of Canada and Australia, and the people who want navies, here and elsewhere, will pay for their patriotic prejudices. I hope men will bend their minds to the problem and realise that the only solution is that the nations of this earth will realise their mutual interest, will perfect their international machinery, get rid of their armies and navies, and co-operate in order to produce more happiness for their common peoples.<\/p>",

Speaking for a moment in regard to the personnel, may I recall what I think is in the minds of most of the public, not only in this country, but in countries abroad, and particularly in those parts of the Empire where there is a very keen interest in the Navy? The one question they ask, the one question which interests them very vitally, is whether the numbers provided for in the present Estimates are adequate. I think it is true to suggest that most people in this country would welcome any agreement which may be made for the reduction of armaments, and any agreement that would tend to lessen international complications with regard to armaments, but I think they would make one important proviso to the effect that, first of all, those responsible for the submission of those agreements should be satisfied that there is security for the mother country, security for our Empire, and security for our trade and commerce. That is the test which I would suggest that the First Lord of the Admiralty should apply. There is one thing which the people of this country are always ready to do. They will trust the\noccupant of the high office of First Lord of the Admiralty, to whatever party he may belong, provided that he does not allow himself to be persuaded by any arguments which do not take account of the fact that we are exceptionally placed, and that our needs are greater than any other country in the world in regard to naval matters.<\/p><p>Great though the cry may be, and sound though the cry may be, that the financial position is really stringent, I hope the First Lord of the Admiralty, when he comes to the real test, when he comes to making an actual decision as to whether he will take as his slogan, \"Safety First\" or \"Financial Economy First,\" will not hesitate to take \"Safety First.\" May I take advantage of the wide Ruling which has been given on this Vote to ask the First Lord what amount has been paid in connection with the Singapore Base by the Malay States, New Zealand, and Hong Kong. I understand that we are partners in that enterprise, and that the Malay States have offered &#163;2,000,000, New Zealand &#163;1,000,000, and Hong Kong &#163;250,000, or a total of &#163;3,250,000. That is a very large sum, and I should like to know-how much of that sum has been received, and especially if, in connection with the decision to delay the work, the opinion and the unqualified consent of those contributors were obtained. I would like for a few moments to devote myself to a question which is of a more domestic character. I suppose all dockyard Members of this House are regarded on this question by the Government as something of a nuisance. They have, of course, a great responsibility in the sense that they represent dockyard towns.<\/p>",

The hon. and gallant Member for North-East Bethnal Green (Major Nathan) asked the Secretary for the Department of Overseas Trade whether he had \"inspired the new officers.\" My right hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hacking), who held the office of Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade in the last Government, made a remark with which I entirely\nagree.

I listened to the Minister's speech, and its effect upon me was that I was utterly amazed. It contained no note of inspiration. Here is the most romantic Department of the whole of our Government, dealing with the whole export trade of Britain, representing &#163;800,000,000 a year, a larger sum than the revenue, a Department which calls for the full play of imagination and initiative, embracing trade to all parts of the world from the Moluccas to Vancouver, London to Singapore, Cape Town to Hong Kong, Sydney to Liverpool, and I felt as I listened to the Minister that if he went on much longer I should want to go and hang myself on the upper gallery rail: it was so depressing, and he was speaking in such an atmosphere of gloom. Why should he be so depressing, so dismal? Inspired me, indeed! No, he depressed me.<\/p><p>He went on to give us a bald statement of expenditure on what is nothing more than establishment matters. He did not tell us for what particular purposes the money was being spent. Dealing with the consular service, the commercial diplomatic service and the trade commissioners he went on to say that in that connection confusion has sometimes arisen owing to different terms. Confusion has arisen about the statements made in relation to these officers in the Department of Overseas Trade. I thought that he was going to give me a courteous reply to a question which I had intended to raise, and of which I had given notice to the Lord Privy Seal, owing to the fact that on 20th December the Lord Privy Seal made a statement on which I wrote him a private letter. I told him that I intended to raise it in this Debate, and he replied that he was sorry that he would not be present, but that the Secretary for the Overseas Trade Department would deal with the point.<\/p><p>6.0 p.m.<\/p><p>I do not know where the Minister has got his savings. There is a saving shown in the Supplementary Estimate amounting to &#163;700 under Item C 1, \"Commercial Diplomatic Service,\" and there is a saving of &#163;850 under the Item D1, \"Trade Commissioner Services.\" A statement was made in this House on\n20th December last by the Lord Privy Seal that at one fell stroke the Conservative Government wiped out trade commissioners in 22 different countries in order to have &#163;1,000 here&#8212;is the saving in this Supplementary Estimate that &#163;1,000&#8212;or &#163;2,000 there, and where was actually sacrificed trade amounting to &#163;2,000,000 or &#163;8,000,000 a year. I asked the Lord Privy Seal to give me the information, and he has deputed that task to my hon. Friend the Secretary for the Overseas Trade Department. Where are the 22 posts which have been wiped out in one fell stroke among the trade commissioners in 22 different countries? I have charged my memory. I was at the Department for three years, and all that I know is that we wiped out one trade commissioner at Singapore&#8212;he is being restored&#8212;that there were eight commercial diplomatic service men abolished in Bulgaria, Colombia, Hong Kong, Persia, Peru, Portugal, Switzerland, Uruguay, not trade commissioners. It is true that we terminated a post in Cologne after the end of the military occupation, and one at Denmark in 1926 and two posts in 1927 in Russia on the termination of diplomatic relations. Staffs were reduced in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Spain, Turkey, United States, hut all the posts were maintained. These two Russian posts have been restored. I submit that while we have reduced staffs in the Argentine, Brazil, Belgium, Spain, Turkey and the United States, there has been no wiping out of 22 trade commissioners at one fell stroke such as was indicated by the Lord Privy Seal. I want to ask for the justification for this statement of the Lord Privy Seal, who told us that he had examined the figures and found that the Conservative Government at one fell stroke had wiped out trade commissioners in 22 different countries, and had actually sacrificed trade amounting to &#163;2,000,000 or &#163;8,000,000 per year. I heard the speech in which he made that statement and I should like to hear the justification for it. The Lord Privy Seal is a grave and dignified Minister of the Crown and is engaged on a very important task. He is trying to do his work in a dignified way, and but for the fact that I know that he does not talk with his tongue in his cheek or try to\nbluff anyone, I should say that he was trying to bluff the House when he told us on 20th December that 22 trade commissioners have been wiped out at one fell stroke.<\/p><p>I now pass to what is a much more serious matter&#8212;the Report of Lord D'Abernon. It is a lucid, succinct, brave and definite Report, and like everyone else I wish to be allowed to thank the gentlemen who took the trouble to go abroad on the Trade Commission, and who have drawn up such a Report for our benefit. On the cover might be written the slogan which we adopted in the Department of Overseas Trade in my time. It amplifies what we then said, and what the manufacturers and merchants of this country will not fully realise in these changed conditions; that goods do not sell themselves. That was our slogan. There is a great deal to be learned from this Report if we read between the lines. The <i>leitmotiv<\/i> of the Report is that we must get on our feet, travel abroad and get in personal touch with our customers, and not depend upon agents and overseas exhibitions. We must depend more upon ourselves, as I had to do in my young days, and get face to face with our customers. We can read in this Report that rationalisation does not only mean the rationalisation of production but also of the selling end of your business. It shows how unwise we are not to group our trades and firms and rationalise the selling end instead of having half a dozen overlapping firms filching trade from one another in Argentine or Brazil. They should be grouped under one selling agency, and by this means would be more efficient to capture more trade between these countries and ourselves. As shown in the Report, the personal factor still plays the paramount part in the selling of goods.<\/p><p>I have had a good deal of experience myself and I know something of what exhibitions abroad mean. I also had three years at the Department of Overseas Trade, and had to think out these same problems for myself. Let me give this warning to hon. Members. We often exhibit in foreign exhibitions to please friendly nations. They wish us to help them to make a good show in the exhibition, but from my personal experience as a private trader and as a\nMinister of the Crown, I do not believe very much in exhibitions abroad as a means of increasing our exports. Merchants and manufacturers would do much better with their time and money if they went abroad themselves on their own account, carrying and exhibiting their own samples. They should visit their overseas customers themselves. The Report also shows the type of man you want in these countries. That is a very valuable section indeed. It hints that while education at a university is all very useful and delightful, and that it is desirable to have a commercial education, to write shorthand and speak Spanish, yet it is the live young man of initiative who sells the goods who is going to capture or create the trade; and the best training for that lad is not in a university or over a text book. There is nothing more fatal to trade than the text book expert on economics. We have seen that recently at Geneva. The President of the Board of Trade has done infinite mischief by his simple text book knowledge of economics and his lack of experience in the export markets. In this Report we can see that it is the man who knows his job, who has started on his job early in life, who is going to succeed as a trade winner. Give me a well-educated, eager boy who goes into trade before he is 18 years of age, not at 22. If you are going to send young men abroad, to Argentine or Brazil, to win back our trade position, the best university you can send them to is to send them out at 17 to learn business in the market places.<\/p><p>Let me now direct the attention of the Committee to the recommendations in the Report concerning Brazil. I am a little timid about Brazil. With all the natural wealth of that great country I cannot divest my mind of the knowledge&#8212;I will not press my point too far&#8212;that it does not pay to press trade too much with Brazil. We have made many bad debts there recently. The amount of bad debts we have made there in the last few years has probably put the balance on the whole into such a shape that we may sometimes fear we are getting a pound's worth of business for 30s. Therefore, I think we should not take steps to press credit business with Brazil too much. But there is a side which may be developed with considerable advantage.\nThere are three or four products of Brazil which might be developed, and we might finance the purchase of these things in such a way that we might have it harnessed to our selling to Brazil the goods she wants and which we make. We could take a couple of million bales of cotton from Brazil, and more fruit without injuning our trade with our Colonies and Dominions. We could take more of the high grade iron ore of Brazil, which would be very useful for our steel manufacturers. There is a good deal of high grade iron ore deposits in Brazil which could be developed. There is here at the moment a shortage of meat, and prices are rising. We cannot get the same quantity of meat from North America or from South America which we used to get; and if we could finance the improvement of the herds and the refrigerating processes for the production of beef in Brazil we might arrange for a contra sale of our goods to Brazil. This would result in a considerable increase in our mutual trade with that country.<\/p><p>Let me now turn to another page of the Report&#8212;and this is something which should be brought to the notice of the Brazilian Government. It is at the root of our trouble. Lord D'Abernon in his Report says:\n<q>Our capital investments in Brazil are estimated at a sum of the order of &#163;300,000,000. &#8230; Brazil's need for foreign capital is pressing, and the country which supplies the capital will get the contracts. Naturally the investor will look for a sound and continuous financial policy on the part of the Government. On this point it may he said that although some States and municipalities have overborrowed, and some are still in default, the assets of the nation are so vast that its present liabilities should prove no undue burden.<\/q>\nThat is all very well, and all very good, but Brazil must realise that if we are going to lend money, she must treat the confidence of the British investor in an honourable and generous way. There must be no defaults. We have put something like &#163;150,000,000 into Mexico. As we invested our money in that country, in the same way as we are now asked to invest money in Brazil, the exports of Britain to Mexico rose. We lent money to the Mexican Government for the building of Mexican railways. That money enabled them to purchase the goods they needed in Britain. That helped our exports. We received in return paper and bonds, and those bonds to-day are not\nworth, the paper on which they are written. The net result is that the &#163;150,000,000 worth of exports went to Mexico as a gift. We must be careful how we lend money abroad, lest when we part with our goods, which appear as exports, they are nothing more than gifts to our foreign borrowers. Lord D'Abernon in his Report says:\n<q>In this connection we express the opinion that British trade with other countries will also benefit if our lending is concentrated on the countries where a commercial return is probable and where high tariffs do not constitute an impassable barrier.<\/q>\nI remember, and probably the Secretary for the Overseas Trade Department remembers also, that the Brazilian Tariff of 1900 injured us a great deal. It is no good lending money to Brazil if a tariff like that of 1900 prevents our goods going in. Some fiscal consideration must be given to us if we are to follow out the recommendation of the Commission and help Brazil with the development of her natural wealth. We should be allowed a chance of selling our goods to Brazil. We ought not to be kept out by a tariff which renders it impossible for us to have any trade in return. There is another very interesting paragraph in this report. I hope I am not wearying the Committee, but I have taken a great deal of interest in it; I have read it two or three times. It says:\n<q>The question arises whether it would be expedient to stimulate emigration from this country to South America. &#8230; Naturally, emigration to Argentina would contribute, if successful, to future friendship between our two countries. &#8230; \"We hold that the attempt to discover suitable methods for the promotion of British emigration should not be abandoned. Further experiments should be made on new lines, possibly on the basis of assisted settlement.<\/q>\nI cannot pretend to give any opinion on this matter, but I would rather see emigration to His Majesty's Dominions. So far as the Argentine is concerned, there are &#163;300,000,000 or &#163;400,000,000 of money invested by British subjects in the Argentine railways and other undertakings and, I think, administered from London; and the addition of hard working Englishmen and women in the Argentine would strengthen the good feeling between ourselves and the Argentine, and to that degree would also assist trade between us.<\/p><p>I want to know also what the Government are going to do with this Report. I remember the Balfour Report, which took four years to produce. Everyone felt that he must have the Balfour Report, just as everyone thinks that he must have well-bound volumes of Burns and Shakespeare on his shelves, though they are seldom opened. Many offices had a copy of the Balfour Report. I wonder how many times it is now opened in any office. What are the Government going to do with the D'Abernon Report? I think that the Department; of Overseas Trade and the Board of Trade and the Treasury should each depute one man to sit down and analyse this Report and put into operation some of its recommendations. On page 36 there is a matter which should be dealt with at once. I refer to the very excessive duty upon bunker coal which goes into Brazil. I see that the Customs and bunker duty on a ton of coal is 10s. 10d.&#8212;a paralysing figure. With our coal trade needing outlets overseas, here is an occasion when the Minister could get into touch with the Secretary for Mines and the Foreign Office and see what can be done to get the Brazilian Government to reduce this burden on export of the coal to Brazil. There is another thing which might be dealt with by the Treasury, though I do not know off-hand how it could be done. On page 16 of the Report I find this:\n<q>We recommend that these aspects of British taxation should receive further consideration with the definite view of facilitating the participation of South American investors in British enterprises, especially when those enterprises are carried on in the investor's own country.<\/q>\nThat means that we should do all that we can to help or induce the Argentinian or Brazilian investor to join their capital with ours.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I beg to move,\n<q>That, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable that the Empire should be developed as a single economic unit with internal free trade as the ideal; and that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom be urged to open negotiations with the other Governments of the Empire with a view to the formulation of a policy designed to secure that the purchasing power of the Empire shall he directed primarily to the full employment of the inhabitants of the Empire.<\/q>\nIn moving the Motion which stands in my name, I think most Members of the House know that I am not a new convert to this cause. There appears in my Election Address at the last General Election these words:\n<q>IMPERIAL PREFERENCE AND EMPIRE DEVELOPMENT.&#8212;I also stand for the continuance and extension of Imperial Preference. It has proved to be of immense value to our export trade, and I sincerely hope that by pushing forward the ideal of Joseph Chamberlain we may achieve his ultimate aim of Free Trade within the British Empire.<\/q>\n4.0 p.m.<\/p><p>Most Members of this House are well aware of a book which was written by the great Conservative leader Benjamin Disraeli, called \"Endymion.\" One of the characters of that book is a thinly-disguised replica of Richard Cobden, and that character is made to say that if the Corn Laws were repealed, in five years the hostile tariffs of the world would come tumbling down. In my copy of that book there appears, in my father's handwriting, the statement: \"Forty years have passed, and the hostile tariffs are still there.\" Ninety years have passed, and the hostile tariffs are very much worse than they were in my father's time. I have been told by many people that this scheme is impossible. To the faint-hearted all things are impossible. I have been told that there are difficulties. Difficulties are things made for statesmen to get over. This is a great problem, and I ask the House to approach it, not in a party spirit, but in the spirit which the Prime Minister referred to at the opening of this Parliament, in a council of the nation, forgetting shibboleths which are 90 years old, forgetting quarrels which are 40 years old, even forgetting quarrels of last May, and to approach this sub-\nject in a big, statesmanlike way and try to find in what way we can help our industries, our country and our Empire.<\/p><p>The first question I was going to ask the House to consider is: Is it worth while? The British Empire is the largest fiscal unit in the world, and it can be made the largest economic unit, covering as it does 12,500,000 square miles, populated by 440,000,000 people, or one-fourth of the territory and one-fourth of the population of the world. Quite apart from the &#163;300,000,000 of manufactured goods which come to this country from foreign countries, there is the great flow of foreign goods into our Crown Colonies and Dominions. If we examine the raw materials, we find that the Empire produces 24 per cent. of the coal of the world, 71 per cent. of the gold, 80 per cent. of the nickel, 99 per cent. of the jute, 58 per cent. of the rubber, 62 per cent. of the palm products, and 22 per cent. of the wheat. The annual imports into the British Empire amount to no less than &#163;2,200,000,000, and it is important to note that out of that figure foreign countries supply as much as &#163;1,400,000,000, or very nearly two-thirds. I would like hon. Members to compare that figure of &#163;1,400,000,000 with our total exports of &#163;750,000,000.<\/p><p>Let us consider our Crown colonies and Dominions. Take, first of all, the Crown colonies and the non-self-governing colonies. For the purpose of convenience, I am going to divide the colonies into three groups. There is, first of all, the American group composed of the West Indies, and the two territories in the South American mainland&#8212;British Guiana and British Honduras. There is the African group, with ports on the East and West coasts of the continent of Africa, and there is the Asiatic group composed of the Malay States, Hong Kong, Ceylon and Borneo. I am dealing with these first, because here we are seeing the greatest development and the greatest increase of trade. These territories are being developed by our brains, our resources, our initiative and our capital, and they have been established by British pioneers. What are we doing it for? Apparently, at the present time we are developing those territories solely in order to find trade for our foreign competitors, for, if we\nexamine the figures, we find that out of the total imports into those territories, this country sends only 26 per cent., and those territories are rapidly increasing in their trade. If the rate of increase that has taken place during the last five years is maintained, the present figure of imports into those territories of &#163;250,000,000 will reach in the year 1932 the figure of &#163;430,000,000, and in 1940 as much as &#163;1,000,000,000. I ask the House to compare those figures with the total exports of this country amounting to &#163;750,000,000.<\/p><p>I would like the House to turn its attention for a few moments to the great Empire of India. When Joseph Chamberlain started his campaign in 1903, there was an Excise in the Bombay cotton mills of 3&#189; per cent. There was an equivalent import duty of 3&#189; per cent. also on goods which Lancashire sent to India. To-day the Excise has gone, and the cotton goods from Lancashire and all other countries going into India pay an import duty of 11 per cent. What has been the result? In 1913 the proportion of Lancashire trade which was secured in cotton in India was 43 per cent., and Lancashire sent to India as much as 3,000,000,000 yards of cotton cloth. In 1928 Lancashire was able to send to India only 1,500,000,000 yards of cotton cloth. Where has that trade gone? Hon. Members may think that it has gone to the Bombay mills, but a close scrutiny which has been made by economists shows that this trade has very largely gone to Japan and also to Italy and other Continental countries. Japan sent to India in five pre-War years an average of only 3,000,000 yards, whereas last year the figure was 357,000,000 yards. I have here an extract from the \"Financial Times\" of Monday last, which I propose to read:\n<q>At an extraordinary meeting of the Cotton Federation, at which the President, Mr. Fred Holroyd, presided, called to review the state of the trade, a statement was made that in the coarser counts of cotton margins had a tendency to get worse. This they were inclined to attribute to the activities of Japan, particularly in the Indian market. During the eight months ended October last, while our imports of cloth to India declined by over 40,000,000 square yards, the imports of Japan increased by 116,000,000 square yards, or more than a third of the total British imports.<\/q>\nI have extracted some figures as to Japanese wages which have been taken\nfrom a book published by the International Federation of Master Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers Association by Mr. Arnot Pearse, on his visit to Japanese and Chinese cotton mills, with a preface by Mr. Frederick Holroyd, president of that federation, which it would repay all hon. Members on the opposite side interested in trade unionism to read. The conclusion which Mr. Pearse arrives at as to the comparison between British and Japanese wages is that, taking into account the welfare system in Japanese cotton mills, the wages in the Japanese mills are less than one-half what they are in the British mills; and let it be noted that, in spite of the fact that the Japanese mills have announced to the League of Nations that they have abolished night work, the women and children at the present time work in those mills from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. in two shifts. [An HON. MEMBER: \"Under Protection!\"] If we look at the importation of Japanese cotton goods into East Africa, it is sufficiently alarming, and I am quite satisfied, from the investigation I have made, that the main cause of the trouble in Lancashire at the present moment is the serious Japanese competition which is taking place all over the world. In this country at the present moment, Japanese cloth is being sold even in Manchester. I think that if our forefathers had heard of cotton goods being sold in Manchester, let alone talking about taking coals to Newcastle, they would almost have said that such a thing was impossible and unbelievable.<\/p><p>The second question I ask the House to consider is: Can if be done? It can be done, and it must be done. In the French fiscal system all colonies and territories in a similar position to Crown colonies have been placed in the French Fiscal Union. Turning to the United States of America, where years ago tariffs existed between State and State, to-day there is complete Free Trade within the entire unit of the United States of America. In addition to that, included in the United States fiscal system are the islands of Porto Rico and Guam, and also to a very large extent the Philippine Islands. If I may take as an example the island of Porto Rico, which is in close proximity to Jamaica, we find that the value of the trade of that island was four times as great as\nthat of Jamaica, and that 86 per cent. of the imports were taken from the United States of America, while in the case of Jamaica only 28 per cent. of her imports came from us. Take the case of Algeria: 79 per cent. of its imports came from France, while Madagascar took 81 per cent. Compare the figures of that one island with the imports to our own colonies of only 26 per cent.<\/p><p>I would ask the House to turn its consideration for a moment to Canada. By joining in she would have the resources of the colonies at her disposal equally with Great Britain, and their wide and great markets open to her. Moreover, there is only one country in the world capable of absorbing the wheat surplus of Canada, namely, Great Britain. Until the flow of cheap wheat from the Argentine and dumped wheat and flour from the continent of Europe is checked, the Canadian farmer, as well as the British farmer, will be faced with ruin. I ask the House to consider for a moment the question of wheat. In 1928, we purchased from Canada &#163;22,000,000 worth of wheat, and we purchased from the Argentine &#163;14,000,000 worth of wheat. In 1929, we purchased only &#163;14,000,000 worth of wheat from Canada, but our purchases from the Argentine went up to &#163;23,000,000.<\/p><p>Let us consider for a moment the position in Australia. I have been told that Mr. Scullin, the Prime Minister of Australia, is one of the greatest dangers to this scheme; but in my opinion a far greater danger is the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who seems to worship every morning at the shrine of Cobden with the fervour of a religious maniac. There have been signs in Australia within the last few days that, in that colony, there is a considerable body of opinion in favour of the principle of Empire Free Trade. Although the country party have not as yet finally passed this Resolution, we have reason to believe that they will take up this cause with enthusiasm. Australia could not fail to benefit by Empire Free Trade because 95 per cent. of her exports may be classed as primary products. Like Canada, Australia has been driven out of the British market by the imports from the Argentine. As Canada has been suffering in the case of wheat, so has Australia been suffering in the case of meat, Before the War Australia sent us 170,000,000 lbs.\nof beef per year, and since the War those imports have dropped to an average of 100,000,000 lbs. per year. It is important to note that under the new Government of Australia great efforts are being made to make Australia a great wheat-producing country. There are also some other minor Australian industries, such as wine and fruit, which are capable of great development.<\/p><p>Let me now turn to South Africa. It can be similarly said that South Africa would benefit to a very material extent by this policy. If we examine her imports, and leave gold, silver and diamonds out of consideration, we find that South African exports amount to &#163;33,000,000, and there is great anxiety in the Union to increase its agricultural wealth. In the Union, there are 10,500,000 head of cattle, and yet South Africa only exported to the value of &#163;170,000 in 1927. An Empire Free Trade market, involving, as it would, a tariff on foreign beef would give South Africa the opportunity to market more beef in this country. South Africa is exporting more and more fruit every year, and her exports in this respect have exceeded &#163;1,000,000. There is an added advantage in assisting this fruit business, because we know it is grown, packed and shipped under wholesome conditions which is not always the case with the goods shipped from the Near East. There is also the sugar industry of Natal, which an Empire Free Trade market) would do a great deal to assist. Her exports of wool do not exceed &#163;17,000,000, and yet Great Britain paid &#163;15,000,000 to foreign countries for wool in 1927. Now I come to the Dominion of New Zealand. It should be noted that this island gives the largest preference and more trade per head of her population than any of our Dominions and Colonies; and yet, in spite of this, there is not one single item in our fiscal system which gives New Zealand assistance of any kind.<\/p><p>My third question is: How can my object be carried out? It can be done immediately. It can be done immediately by the formation of what I am going to describe as the British Empire Fiscal Union, and that Union would embrace, not merely these small islands, but all the non-self-governing Colonies, and that plan could be put into operation at once. It could be put into operation by placing\na tariff on all foreign goods, so that these non-self-governing Colonies would be inter-trading between each constituent part and the Motherland. Look at the advantage that would be to this country! Not only would there be &#163;300,000,000 worth of manufactured goods from abroad coming into this country, but also &#163;200,000,000 worth of merchandise which comes into our non-self-governing Colonies. We should have greater scope for our manufacturers and producers of raw material and food in those non-self-governing Colonies. The House may ask: What are you going to do about the self-governing Dominions? We have given them self-government, and we cannot interfere with their discretion, but we can negotiate. They would say that their infant industries need protection against British competition. It is no part of this scheme that we should attempt in any way to crush any industries within the British Empire. There are many precedents which can be turned up where a tariff has been raised within a customs union.<\/p><p>May I now turn back for a moment to India. It might be said that the Bombay Mills would need protection of some kind, brut I have the highest authority for saying that the Bombay millowners are not in the least afraid of British competition. What they are really afraid of is Japanese competition. In the negotiations which our Empire would undertake, it would be the obvious duty of the British representative to suggest that the way in which we could help British trade would be to place a higher tariff on foreign cotton going into India than is charged upon British cotton, and that would enable our own mills to secure more trade. It may be asked: What is India going to gain in exchange I We would offer to India a great free trade market in the British Empire Fiscal Union which I have described. We should secure advantages for the Lancashire cotton spinners and weavers, which would be of untold value to all the workers in that industry. After all, India is losing the British market. In 1924, we bought &#163;24,000,000 worth of Indian tea, and more than &#163;6,000,000 worth of Indian wheat. In 1929, we bought only about &#163;20,000,000 worth of tea, and practically no wheat at all. Given a fair chance in\nthe British market, I think India could steadily increase her agricultural production and forestry products, and in that way she would increase the purchasing-power of her people.<\/p><p>It has been said by a well-known economist that, if the purchasing power of the Indian people was increased by one shilling per head per annum, India would be able to take &#163;7,500,000 worth more goods annually. I well remember the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Farnham (Mr. A. M. Samuel) saying in this House that if John Chinaman could be induced to wear his shirt an inch longer all the troubles of the cotton industry would be at an end. That may be regarded as humorous, but it is sound economically, because, if we can by any means increase the purchasing power of the people, it will mean increased trade. The difference between those sitting on this side of the House and those sitting on the benches opposite is that on this side we want to make all these things economic while hon. Members opposite take no steps of any kind to make them economic. This scheme has been proved to be founded upon sound economics, and it has proved successful wherever it has been tried.<\/p><p>I want hon. Members to turn once more to Canada. Canada imported last year &#163;5,000,000 worth of anthracite coal. If Canada would put a duty of one dollar per ton on anthracite coal coming from the United States of America and leave free the exportation of coal from this country, there would be an additional trade of &#163;5,000,000 a year for the South. Wales coalfields. If we consider structural steel and steel plates, of which there is very little production of any kind in Canada, we find that last year Canada bought from the United States &#163;10,000,000; worth of these two items. That would mean &#163;10,000,000 more trade for the workers in this country, who want work so badly at the present moment. I am told that &#163;10,000,000 worth of structural steel and plates would amount to about 1,000,000 tons, and that means at least 3,000,000 tons of coal. What has Canada to gain from offering us these advantages? She would gain by the free importation of Canadian wheat here, and she would also gain by the free importation of other products, such as timber, newsprint, and wood pulp into the British\nEmpire fiscal union. Furthermore, our Colonies would buy more agricultural machinery and motor cars from Canada than has previously been the case.<\/p><p>Australia has the greatest advantage of all by coming into the fiscal union, because she would have a free market for wheat, wool, and beef, providing that she was able to give us something substantial in the way of benefit for our manufacturers. South Africa, with sugar, wool, and other products, would get the free importation of those goods into our country, providing, also, that our negotiators were able to secure corresponding advantages in South Africa. Little New Zealand, also, would, I think, gain at last a recognition of the great services which she has rendered for so long to the cause of the Empire. What is our advantage, summed up? It is that we should by this means maintain a material increase in the exports of our manufactured goods, or, in other words, a large share of that &#163;1,400,000,000 which is at present supplied by foreign countries to the Empire, to add to our present exports of &#163;750,000,000.<\/p><p>Doubtless many will be asking the question whether I am in favour of taxing food and raw materials. If I am asked that question in this crude way, my answer would be in the negative, and in any case, we only propose to tax foreign food and raw materials. [<i>Interruption<\/i>.] There cannot be any rise in price, because the British Empire can supply us with all the food we need, quite apart from the production in this Island itself, which would probably tend to increase. As to raw materials, we have the example of the duty on raw silk, where manufacturers, when exporting their manufactured articles, receive a rebate, an arrangement which to my own knowledge has worked with complete satisfaction; and a similar system of rebates could be arranged in the case of other raw materials which might be subject to taxation. We must, however, look at this matter as a big business scheme. Let me emphasise that I regard this matter, not as a political question, but as a business question. Under this scheme, great volumes of trade would flow to our cotton mills, our woollen mills, our steelworks and our coal mines, and also to our agricultural workers. In circumstances like these, I have no hesi-\ntation whatever in facing the situation with a stout heart. I am not in the least afraid of the parrot cry of \"Your food will cost you more.\" Even if that statement were true, which I do not believe for one moment, there would be the other side of the ledger to look at. We know and can prove that we should, under this scheme, be giving good and permanent employment to our people, instead of doles and unemployment. We know and can prove that our people would be offered happiness and prosperity, instead of misery and destitution.<\/p><p>I must turn for one moment to the Amendment which has been put down by the Liberal party. In the eleven years during which I have been in this House, I have seen a great advance in opinion. I have seen Members modify their Free Trade, or, rather, their Free Imports views considerably. To-day it is obvious that there are many Members who are thinking deeply on this subject with an open mind. It is true that there are some eminent Members of this House whom I have long given up as hopeless. The right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer I have given up as hopeless long ago. Until yesterday morning, I had given up the right hon. Gentleman the Member for St. Ives (Mr. Runciman), but I see that his name is attached to the Liberal Amendment. We have heard speeches from the benches on the Socialist side tending towards this scheme of Empire Free Trade. I remember that the hon. Member for St. Helens (Mr. Sexton) and others voted for Imperial Preference in the year 1924, and that the hon. Member for Camlachie (Mr. Stephen) and the hon. Member for Bridgeton (Mr. Maxton) made speeches which tended in the same direction, although they and their friends abstained from voting.<\/p><p>Nothing has been more marked, however, than the great advance shown by the Amendment which has been put down by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Carnarvon Boroughs (Mr. Lloyd George) and his friends, and, comparing this Amendment with his speeches of 1906 and 1910 in the country, I congratulate him on his courage. Although he has not been able to see the full light of day by supporting the taxation of foreign food and raw materials, this will doubtless come in time. Therefore, so\nfar from regretting the right hon. Gentleman's Amendment, I welcome it, recognising, as I do, that he has abandoned the fetish of Cobdenite Free Trade; but I would point out that any vote given for this Amendment ties this country's hands when discussing the development of inter-Imperial trade at any forthcoming Imperial Conference. Speaking for myself, I shall vote against it, and I beg all my friends, whether they agree or disagree with me, not to tie the hands of any British Government in the future by voting for the Liberal Amendment.<\/p><p>Many times in this House I have heard Members of the Socialist party plead for the downtrodden populations of the British Empire. I have not agreed with all that they have said, but I have this much sympathy with their views, that I think it should be our object and our ideal to raise the standard of living wherever the British flag flies. Have we done all that we could in the past? I do not think we have. Are we doing all that we can at the present? I do not think so. May I ask the House to forget the past; may I ask them to forget even the present; may I ask them to look at the future? If we are to remain a great Empire, we must raise the standard of living of every deserving British citizen, in whatever part of the Empire he may live. The scheme which I have outlined puts forward a practical policy for putting the British Empire upon an economic basis. It alone holds the field; it is our only hope; and for that reason I ask the House to accept the Motion which I have moved.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>In raising the question of the Singapore Base to-day I do not intend to discuss it from the purely naval point of view, as hon. Members will be speaking in this Debate who are more qualified to speak upon it from that aspect. I would like to say in passing, however, that every naval officer to whom I have mentioned the slowing down or the abandonment of this Base has stated that it would be deliberate strategical suicide if we were to do so. The decision of the Government to slow down the work at the Base resulted in many questions being asked of the Government, and I regret to say that many of those replies were considered vague and unsatisfactory. Hon. Members asked the Government whether the Dominions had been consulted, and the First Lord of the Admiralty replying stated that they had been notified. When further pressed in this direction he said he had no reason to suppose that the answer which he had given was out of harmony with their immediate views, but he would like a little more time before giving a definite answer. We have waited for that definite answer and it has not yet been forthcoming. The Under-Secretary of State for the Dominions has told us that they are in daily telegraphic communication, so that I cannot see why that reply has not been given. The Dominion Press comments in regard to those views being in harmony with the Government statement are not borne out, at any rate, by the Press comments which I have in my hand at the present time. The \"Melbourne Herald\" says:\n<q>Australia cordially supported the League of Nations and all the movements towards disarmament as a result of the Washington Conference. Yet, if the international peace movement means the jealous retention of naval power in northern waters and the use of the Dominions' interests as insignificant counters for bargaining, it will be strange if public opinion in Australia and New Zealand does not undergo notable changes.<\/q>\nThe \"Argus\" says:\n<q>In any case the decision comes from practically the same Ministry which decided in 1924 to abandon the Base altogether.\nThere was no thought of deferring to the decision of an international conference on that occasion. The disturbing conclusion is that the Labour Cabinet in Great Britain is making the Base a pawn in the political game. Such behaviour when serious consequences are at stake cannot be indulged in with impunity. The Singapore Base is essential to the adequate defence of the Empire and vital to those portions situated within the Pacific zone.<\/q>\nThat is what Australia says. New Zealand also makes some very severe criticisms, for it is stated that concern is expressed in Wellington, and the \"Auckland Star\" says:\n<q>Informing the Dominions of the decision is very different from consulting them. The Imperial authorities should take the Dominions completely into their confidence before finally resolving on a step that so vitally concerns their safety and the interests of the whole Empire.<\/q>\nThe \"Wellington Evening Post\" points out that information which falls short of full consultation is not calculated to produce a unified Empire policy. I think the House will agree that those comments do not confirm what the First Lord of the Admiralty told us. I would like to ask him if any protests have been made by the Dominions against the action of the Government and if so by whom? As regards the contributions which have been made to the Imperial Government, we know that New Zealand has contributed &#163;250,000. We know that Hong Kong has contributed a like amount and the Federated Malay States &#163;1,200,000. All of these contributions were made on the specific understanding that the Base would be proceeded with. Of those contributions &#163;1,294,000 has been expended, and I would like to ask the Government if they decide not to continue with the Singapore Base, whether they are prepared to refund the money which has been contributed, seeing that it would have been taken from the Dominions and the Colonies under false pretences. We were told the other day that most of the money had been spent by a Conservative Government. I agree as regards this, but we have been keeping faith with the Colonies and the Dominions. When the Labour Government say they are going to do away with the Base as they did in 1924 and that we have a good naval protection at home, it is very poor consolation to the people in those parts. The Government might just as well say: \"We are going to do away with the police\nforce throughout this country but we are going to maintain the Metropolitan police.\" Supposing there was a wave of crime throughout the country, would it be of much help to the people in the north to know that we had a good police force in London. The same thing applies in this connection. I hope, in view of the importance of this Base, that it will not be used as a pawn in the game of party politics.<\/p><p>As regards the slowing down programme, I would like to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty: Will there be any loss entailed by this slowing down and have they estimated the cost which will have to be faced by the country if they eventually decide to do away with it altogether? Turning from those points there is the very important aspect of the forthcoming Five Power Naval Conference. I have lived in Singapore and those parts for about 20 years and I have taken the keenest interest in the Singapore Base since its very inception. I realise that Singapore is the key to the Pacific, and the late Lord Roberts told us that it is there that the mastery of the world would some day be fought out. The cost, although heavy, is a mere bagatelle to the vast value of the Imperial assets it will defend. Many of the opponents to the Singapore Base object to it because it is what they regard as a war-like object at a time when there is an anti-war feeling growing throughout the world. I hope that that feeling for peace and disarmament will grow and get stronger and stronger as time progresses, but I think that their attitude in considering the anti-war feeling is universal is based upon a fundamental error.<\/p><p>There may be, and there is, a strong antiwar feeling in Europe, and at times I am doubtful whether the insistence of the beastliness of war is really all to the good because there is another side to war, and we should not be sitting in this House under these conditions to-day had the youth of the nation in 1914 only considered the beastliness of war. They are mistaken in thinking that the antiwar mentality is shared by all. European and Asiatic views are as different as the poles apart. East is East; as it always was and as it always will be. I defy anyone to produce a tittle of evidence to show that the anti-war feel-\ning has altered the views of the Eastern peoples. Orientals look to war as being the final argument. Islam is growing from strength to strength and is still the same old conquering creed. The warlike tribes of India with their Afghan neighbours have shown no desire to give up their fighting instincts. Japan, that great country, would rise as one man at the Emperor's call. The Chinese, with their teeming millions, the majority of whom are so poor that they cannot even afford to eat the rice that they grow, and have to live on millet instead&#8212;hon. Members opposite may laugh&#8212;<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I propose to raise, not at great length, a matter which I am sure will he of interest to the whole House, namely, the welfare and conditions of service of the officers and men of the Mercantile Marine, or, as I believe I am now correct in calling it, the Royal Mercantile Marine. In the last 10 years, Mr. Speaker, during which you and I have been in this House together, this matter has not often been raised, and yet there is no body of men and no industry of greater importance than this. Our Mercantile Marine is still the greatest in the world, and I believe it will be generally agreed that the nation owes a great debt of gratitude to those men of the Mercantile Marine who go down to the sea in our ships. &#163;2,000,000,000 worth of food, oils, coal, raw materials and manufactured goods are carried in British ships every year to and from these shores, and hon. Gentlemen opposite, who are always roaring out about national defence, will, I am sure, be interested in anything affecting the welfare of the men who man these ships from the national defence point of view.<\/p><p>It is our duty wherever we can to see that the conditions of service in this great Mercantile Marine are such that the best type of efficient man and lad is attracted to the Service, whether for service on the bridge as an officer, in the engine-room, or before the mast; but I am sorry to say that for many reasons there is a danger of the best type not being attracted in the future to the Mercantile Marine, or of those who are in it leaving at the first opportunity and taking up some other employment. One difficulty, of course, is that there is a great lack of training establishments and training ships, especially for lads of poor parents. It is extremely difficult in most\nparts of the country for a poor lad, whose parents cannot afford to pay fees to apprentice him, to enter the Mercantile Marine and, while there are excellent training facilities for future officers&#8212;the \"Worcester,\" the \"Conway\" and the \"Pangbourne\" turn out splendid seamen&#8212;there are not nearly enough facilities for those who cannot afford the fees which those excellent training establishments are bound to charge.<\/p><p>For many years the National Union of Seamen have been pressing the Board of Trade to provide greater facilities for the training of suitable youths for service at sea. I should like to know what the right hon. Gentleman has to say on that subject. We have, of course, certain training facilities. In Hull, we have Trinity House, which has turned out some of the finest seamen of this or or any other age, and there is an excellent technical college at Cardiff which also does splendid work in this direction. But far too few vacancies exist for the required number of young men and boys to be trained as seamen. I believe the \"Port Jackson\" training ship has been paid off, and, if that is so, there is not one seagoing training ship at present engaged in training officers or boys for the Mercantile Marine under sail or under steam. In view of our immense Mercantile Marine, our immense responsibilities, and our absolute dependence on the sea for our whole prosperity and life, that is an extraordinary state of affairs. So far this matter has been left almost entirely to private persons, to the benevolent public-spirited men who provide the money, for example, for commissioning the \"Port Jackson\" and the great benefactors who founded our establishment at Hull. I think the time has come when the Board of Trade should take a more active interest in the mutter.<\/p><p>One excuse put forward for the employment of foreign seamen in such large numbers is that there are not sufficient trained British seamen. A question was put to-day with regard to the employment of Chinese. I believe there are at present 11,000 European foreigners in our ships and over 52,000 Asiatics, of whom I admit many are British subjects. Lascars are good seamen. They did splendid service in the War, and I make no kind of attack on them. They are, nevertheless, employed in very large numbers,\nand, I think, in certain trades which should be reserved for British seamen. The reason really is that the Lascar gets 30s. a month, and the white able seaman &#163;9 a month. Furthermore, only very modest sums are extracted from the shipowners by the Government of India in workmen's compensation in case of an accident to Lascars. I believe the payments are not on Dearly so large a scale as for a white seaman, and therefore Lascars are employed in enormous numbers. With regard to the Chinese, there has been a great improvement from the British point of view. I believe the numbers have gone down from 14,000 to 2,000, but even that is a very great number. Of course they all claim to be British subjects. They all say they come from Hong Kong or Singapore. Although they cannot speak the local dialect of Hong Kong, they are always British subjects.<\/p><p>I have nothing to say against the Chinese seaman. He is an excellent seaman, reliable, and that kind of thing, but we have enormous unemployment amongst British seamen, and the Board of Trade should discourage in every possible way the employment of foreigners on all British ships, especially on the home trade. I know it is a difficult question, and it cannot be done all at once, and it is necessary to employ a certain number of non-British seamen, but I see very few signs of activity by the right hon. Gentleman in a matter of such importance. While the Chinese have decreased, there has been an increase in employment of Arabs, and they all claim to come from either Aden or India. There are more Arab seamen employed in British ships claiming to come from Aden than the whole population of Aden, men, women and children. The answer that is made, that the Englishman cannot stand the climate, is absolute nonsense. As a matter of fact, an Englishman in good health can stand extremes of hot and cold better than the Asiatic. It is an extraordinary thing, but actual statistics show in favour of the British seaman in two cases of sickness to three for the Asiatic under similar conditions. I believe the number of Arabs, who are nearly all firemen, is about 9,000, of whom about 25 per cent. can show War service. I would not suggest that they should be debarred from employment, but I think\nsome reservation should be made to prevent an increasing number of Arabs being employed in ships trading to British ports regularly. There are certain social results of an undesirable character from these Arabs being in large quantities in British ports. Cases have occurred at Cardiff which have been published in the papers, and it is a well-known trouble.<\/p><p>I want now to touch on another matter altogether. I know the pay of the seamen and officers is outside the direct jurisdiction of the Board of Trade, and I am not pretending that the right hon. Gentleman should intervene in this matter directly, but in view of the low pay&#8212;I say it advisedly&#8212;the uncertainty of employment and the many disadvantages suffered by both seamen and officers, the Board of Trade, where it can, should see that their lot is made as humane and as healthy as possible. The Board of Trade cannot directly interfere at present with wages, but it can insist on proper accommodation, and it could do a great deal in regard to the hours of labour. The standard pay of an able seaman is &#163;9 a month, a boatswain, a man who must have had years of service and must be experienced, &#163;10 to &#163;10 10s. a month, and a fireman, &#163;9 10s. Some owners pay more, a few pay less. Now we come to officers. There are hundreds of officers serving as chief, second and third officers who have been holding their master's certificate for years. They have had an extensive professional training and years of service at very low pay as apprentices and junior officers. They pass a stiff examination for their certificates, and they have great responsibility and very hard work. When I mention the rates of pay, it must be remembered that the average employment on pay of the average officer in a British line is only round about seven months in the year. Any accident to a ship, the ship paid off or laid up, and he is off pay at once. The pay of a third mate is &#163;11 10s. to about &#163;12 10s. a month&#8212;a little more on certain lines. The pay of second mates, the majority of whom are qualified for their master's certificates, and most have them, is &#163;14 10s. to &#163;16 10s., and chief officers, &#163;17 to &#163;20 a month, with some rare cases up to &#163;24. I know a case of a chief officer of a 7,500-ton cargo steamer who gets &#163;19 a month.<\/p><p>Imagine the lot of this man. He has to keep up an appearance, he has to meet passengers, and to be well-dressed. His wife has to keep up a certain appearance, and he has to pay for his own laundry and all sorts of other expenses. Such a man has tremendous responsibilities. So much is expected of him in case of disaster. He must stay at his post and he does. He has high professional attainments and has a commission in the Royal Naval Reserve. He performed valuable services in the War, and he received only &#163;19 a month when at sea. He is a man of the highest character and attainment. He is not entitled to any pension or superannuation and the moment that his ship is paid off he is on the labour market. He has no security of tenure. Is it to be wondered at that many of our finest seamen amongst the officers of the Royal Mercantile Marine are seeking any kind of employment on shore in order to get out of it?<\/p><p>What can the Board of Trade do here? The Board of Trade can do and should do&#8212;it should have done it long ago&#8212;what the officers, through their own organisation, have been asking for for years and what the majority of the best shipping lines are prepared to do, namely, introduce a general pension or superannuation scheme for the officers, and for the men too for that matter. The mortality and sickness among seamen is high. The seaman is very often past work at an earlier age than his brother on shore. As I have said, the majority of the good lines would welcome such a scheme. It would be contributory on the part of the officers, the shipping lines and His Majesty's Government. But so far the Board of Trade has been adamant. A regulation has been brought out by the Admiralty enabling lieutenant commanders to retire at 40 on a fair pension, but their brothers in the mercantile service still await some such scheme. The Board of Trade has funds which should have been applied to this purpose. I am informed that there is in the right hon. Gentleman's coffers, or has been&#8212;I do not know whether they have been raided&#8212;a very large sum, something like &#163;1,000,000 from the old shipping fees which every officer had to pay on signing on and on being paid off. That was the custom years ago and very\nlarge sums were accumulated. I should like to ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he can give any information about these sums. Who have had them? [An HON. MEMBER: \"What are these sums?\"] They are large sums of money accumulated from the old shipping fees. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will look into the matter and if he can give me information about them, not necessarily in this Debate, but later on, I shall be very much obliged to him. These funds would be a nucleus for such a scheme as I have mentioned.<\/p>",

With regard to the first question, the strength of the Army during the period in question was lower than had been estimated. That is part of the explanation. Then, the provisional payment made by India was &#163;200,000 less than the estimate. That matter is under discussion with the Indian Government. The Egyptian Government's contribution had also not yet been settled, and &#163;150,000 has not been received. The amount provisionally brought to account as regards the military contribution\nof the Straits Settlements was &#163;140,000 less than the estimate, pending discussion. The portion of the Dawes Annuity received in respect of the Rhine Army was &#163;116,000 less than estimated. The Hong Kong contribution was &#163;43,700 below the Estimate. That is the explanation of that item. Items Nos. 9, 10 and 14 deal with warlike stores; works, buildings and lands, pensions and other non-effective charges. In reference to warlike stores, the explanation is the claim made by the Government of India for employing Indians in China. The policy of the Government was to make savings in order to meet the extra expenditure incurred in China. The deficiencies in regard to the expenditure on works, buildings, and land are due to the same reason. The expenditure was cut down to a minimum in order that we might have extra money to meet the extra expenditure in connection with China. As far as the increase in pensions is concerned, that is due to the efficiency of the Ministry of Pensions which has enabled them to settle more of their business than was expected within that period. With regard to the question put to me by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Kelly) relating to irrecoverable balances, I will look into the point and communicate with him.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I beg to move, \"That Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair.\"<\/p><p>I will endeavour not to tax the patience of the House too much by dwelling upon details, many of which can be readily picked up from a study of the White Paper and the Estimates themselves, but I will try to draw the attention of hon. Members to one or two of the more salient points. The Estimates which I present to-day show a reduction of &#163;1,435,000 over last year's Estimates, and, though apparently they are &#163;65,000 higher than the Estimates for 1924, when the hon. Gentlemen opposite were in office, they are in reality &#163;1,250,000 lower than their Estimates, because I have had to include in the sum for which I am asking &#163;1,300,000 for the Fleet Air Arm, which in their time came under the Air Ministry Vote. So that, in fact, we are not only asking for &#163;1,435,000 less than last year, but for &#163;1,250,000 less than the Socialist Government's Estimates of 1924. This has been effected, in spite of the fact that I have to ask for new construction this year amounting to &#163;1,643,000 more than in 1924, and that the non-effective Vote, over which I have no control at all, is &#163;577,000 in excess of what it was at that time. The saving has been brought about by reduced maintenance charges under almost every head, amounting to &#163;3,445,000, or a reduction of about 7 per cent.<\/p><p>I ought to say a word about the non-effective Vote, which is often left out of the calculations of those hon. Gentlemen of this House and of others outside who keep on saying that we are spending more in forging lethal weapons of destruction than we were before the War. It is rather interesting to see how they justify their high rhetorical flights in that direction. We have been told that, in spite of peace and of all the needs for economy, we are now spending actually more in manufacturing weapons\nof destruction for the doom of humanity than we were before the War broke out. I am not a great expert in rhetoric, and I am sure that I should do injustice to the eloquence of many hon. Gentlemen here and outside who like their audiences to enjoy these flights of rhetoric, but perhaps next time they go to address meetings on this particular subject, they will take the trouble to remember that the non-effective Vote has increased by &#163;5,500,000 since 1914, which, as the figure stands, is more than the difference between my Estimates this year and the Estimates in 1914. Therefore, the terrible lethal weapons of destruction which are so largely being increased by the present Government are such alarming weapons as cheques for retired pay of officers who have left the Service, warrants for compassionate grants to women and children, and other equally offensive things.<\/p><p>It is a rather remarkable fact that, if you compare the Estimates of this year and those of 1914, you find that there is apparently a difference of &#163;4,300,000 between this year and that, but that is more than wiped out by the &#163;5,500,000 difference in the non-effective charges, and by the &#163;1,300,000 for the Fleet Air Arm. Actually, comparing like with like, our Estimates this year are &#163;2,500,000 less than those of 1914. [<i>Interruption.<\/i>] I have not finished yet. Perhaps hon. Members will allow me to remind them that the value of money is not the same now as it was then. Relying upon the credulity of their audiences, many of our critics are very fond of pretending that it is fair to compare the actual figures without taking into consideration the value of money. If you take into consideration the value of money to-day and then, and put the present figures of cost against those of 1914, you will find that the Estimates for 1914, instead of being about &#163;51,500,000, as I think they were, would have been &#163;83,500,000 at the present value of money. Therefore, we are spending actually, when you consider the difference in the value of money, apart from the question of the non-effective Vote, less than in 1914 by &#163;27,500,000. Those who say that we are spending more than we were then will, I hope, take notice of what I say, and modify their speeches accordingly. Before the War the Navy cost 24.5 per cent. of the total Budget; now it costs 6.9 per cent.<\/p><p>In accordance with our naval policy, about which I hope to say a little more later on, we have carried out a steady programme of replacement. In round figures, this has cost us &#163;45,000,000 in the five years for which I have been responsible. Of this, two-fifths represents the legacy which I inherited from my predecessors, partly from the hon. Gentlemen opposite, and partly from those who went before them; and three-fifths represents the additions for which I have asked. Of the inherited charges, the party opposite are responsible for &#163;9,500,000, which they passed on to me and which I was very glad to spend, because the policy which they introduced then, which was the policy of replacement, was a policy of beginning when other countries had laid down an enormous number of post-War ships, while we had laid down none. The policy begun in that year has been continued ever since.<\/p><p>4.0 p.m.<\/p><p>I said just now that I have reduced the maintenance charges under almost every head, and, to be quite plain, I will mention the three heads under which they have not been reduced. One is the Fleet Air Arm. There is an addition there of &#163;220,000, and practically all of that goes to providing an instalment of two more flights to the aircraft carrier \"Glorious,\" which will be commissioned this year, but will not have a full equipment of aircraft until 1930. The Fleet Air Arm is manned up to the authorised proportion of 70 per cent., that is to say, 92 naval officers are now employed in it, and 19 have been trained and reverted to periods of general naval service. The actual service has risen from 105 aircraft in 1924 to 135 in 1928, and the number at the end of the year 1929 should be 153. This is a very modest force, but great progress has been made in these years in zeal and efficiency, and I think we may congratulate all the personnel concerned. There has been a delay in fitting catapults to ships other than aircraft carriers owing to the necessity of experiments being fully tried out. Only two so far have been installed, but we are hoping to make provision for more in the near future.<\/p><p>The next head under which an increase is shown is Vote 6, where there is an\naddition of &#163;37,900 due to the fact that the Admiralty have taken over the entire charge of the production of charts from the Stationery Office. This increase is not an increase to the taxpayer, but is only a transfer to our Vote, and would otherwise have been carried on Civil Votes. The third increase comes under Vote 10, and this is accounted for by the additional provision for work on the Naval Base at Singapore. The Admiralty work there has been largely paid for by instalments of (he generous contributions of the Malay Straits, New Zealand and Hong Kong., This year the sum to be expended by this country will be &#163;200,000 in excess of these contributions, but the preliminary clearing of the site has been completed, and the contract for the main works has now been placed. The extra cost this year will be counterbalanced by saving on Vote 8, which was charged last year with over &#163;250,000 for the completion of the floating dock which has been successfully towed all the way to Singapore, and will shortly be in position for use. In my opinion, this has been a very great achievement, and it closes the first chapter of the history of the work at Singapore. It will be of the greatest assistance to the mobility of our Fleet in Eastern waters. The contract for the larger engineering works and graving dock is to be completed in seven years. Including the work to be carried out by the Admiralty, the total estimate at present is &#163;7,750,000, which shows a reduction of &#163;3,850,000 on the original estimate which was put before the House five years ago. Those are the three points in which there is an increase shown in the White Paper.<\/p><p>There are one or two other points, to which I would like to draw the attention of the House, which denote satisfactory progress. By a careful scrutiny it has been possible to reduce Vote A by 2,000 men, and we are concentrating upon the training of boys of the seamen class at Shotley and Forton, instead of in the \"Impregnable.\" Although, as I say, we are reducing the numbers, and although we are spending less under a good many other heads, we are not unmindful of the comfort and health of those who are being trained for the service, and we have been able to start in one or two directions what, I believe, are very useful\nreforms. I mentioned the \"Impregnable,\" the boys trained there are going to be trained at Shotley and Forton. That, in itself, will be a considerable saving, because the upkeep of the \"Impregnable\" is a very heavy item, and the upkeep of shore establishments will be considerably less. Shotley is being improved by the substitution of permanent buildings for the temporary ones which were there before. We are also making a little further progress with an improvement to which I attach considerable importance, and that is we are changing from the \"Fisgard,\" the hulk in which the boys were trained for engineer artificers, to a shore establishment at Chatham. There, again, there will be a very considerable saving in the upkeep, and I am quite sure a very great improvement in health, convenience and accommodation of the boys who have done admirable work in \"Fisgard\" under rather adverse conditions. There are two other things in which, I am glad to say, we are making progress in improved accommodation. One is at Fort Blockhouse, Portsmouth, and the other is in the accommodation of the anti-submarine experimental personnel at Portland who, up to now, have been housed in very uncomfortable temporary buildings.<\/p><p>There is another matter in which I am glad to note that progress has been made in the right direction. For some time I have been concerned with the question of pulmonary tuberculosis and the awards of pensions to those who have been suffering from it. I made very careful investigations, and, with the sanction of the Treasury, we have been able to adopt methods which now make it easier for men to claim pension for this disease attributable to the service than it was before. Of course, there are now, and always will be, hard cases upon the border lines, but in the method we have adopted the number of cases that are recorded as attributable to service will increase, and the pensions will correspondingly increase, as will also the allowances to widows, children and dependants of those who die from the disease. There is one other observation with regard to pensions which, perhaps, I might make. Before April, 1928, awards for service in the Royal Naval Reserve were restricted to men who had completed 20 years' service in the\nReserve, which entitled them to a gratuity of &#163;50. Since that date we have made a new regulation, and men discharged after ten years' service will be eligible for a proportionate gratuity, and according to the time beyond ten years they have served between that and 20 years.<\/p><p>The Headquarters Staff has been the subject of some criticism occasionally in this House, but I have often explained that it is quite impossible to expect the Headquarters Staff to show a reduction in proportion to the reduction in the Fleet. People say: \"Why do you have such an enormous staff when your Fleet service is so much smaller?\" The answer I have often given is that there are many more services which the staff have to perform now than they had to do before. The complications of machinery, electricity and new inventions have so entirely altered the duties of the Headquarters Staff, that it is quite impossible for the old staff to do the work which is necessary now, even although the numbers in the Fleet are less. You have only to look at a modern battleship or aircraft carrier, and all the different mechanism on it, to see what a different thing it is now to inspect and take care of a ship like that from what it was when you had cannon balls and black powder. I am going back rather far, but I think it is a very good illustration for anybody to go to Portsmouth and see the \"Nelson\" and then the \"Victory,\" and then remember that in between the dates of those two ships, and especially during the last few years, there has been enormous progress in things which were not thought of then. Without going as far back there is an enormous difference in all the electrical work, anti-submarine, anti-aircraft, mines and other things, many of which are quite modern inventions, which make it necessary to have a much larger central staff.<\/p><p>In spite of all that, we have reduced the staff at Headquarters by 275, and at out-port establishments we can show a reduction of 209. As a matter of fact, that ought to be 809. We are now counting the 600 second-class draughtsmen who were not returned before. I contend that a reduction of 275 in the Headquarters Staff and of 809 in the out-port staff is going some way to meet the\nwishes of this House and everybody else for economy in the office of the Admiralty. Of course, I do not know whether we can go any further. We are always looking out for economies and examining this thing. Only the other day the hon. Member for Devonport (Mr. Hore-Belisha), who is very assiduous in his attention to the Admiralty, put down on one day three unstarred questions which took 27 man-hours' work to answer. If he goes on at that rate, I cannot maintain these reductions. There is one other point to which I would like to draw the attention of the House. I am making the experiment, after the next vacancy, of having one less Sea Lord on the Board of Admiralty.<\/p><p>Another subject in which everybody is interested, and in which, I am sorry to say, so far one cannot record a great deal of progress is the subject of fuel research. I should like to say that we are keeping in close touch with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in doing what we can to facilitate whatever experiments can be made to find out whether coal can be more freely used in some form or another, or whether oil can be extracted from coal in such a way as to be capable of utilisation in His Majesty's Navy. I cannot tell how far we are from success in this experiment, but nobody would be more glad than the Admiralty if at some future time we are able once more to rely for our fuel on the coalfields of the Mother country.<\/p><p>I have mentioned those two matters because they seemed to me to be of perhaps greater interest than the others; but I think that in response to the hon. Member for North Camberwell (Mr. Ammon), who is always accusing me of not referring to Admiralty policy in my speeches, I ought to try to meet him on this last occasion by a summary of Admiralty policy. This is the fifth time I have had the honour of presenting the Naval Estimates. As I am not seeking re-election, I regret that this will be the last. I should like, if I may, to take this opportunity of thanking most sincerely the whole House, including hon. Gentlemen opposite, for the good nature with which they have always dealt with my efforts to sustain the Service which I have the honour to represent.<\/p><p>First of all, I will say something about our dockyard policy. The most disagreeable and painful part of my duty in carrying out the national demand for economy has been making the great reductions which have been necessary in our dockyards. It was essential that it should be done. It has been done by reductions in each yard, and also by reducing the number of yards from six to four. I always hoped that we should reach the point where we could more or less stabilise the numbers employed in the Royal dockyards, and avoid fluctuations, which are objectionable in many ways, and I hope We have now reached the stage where that stabilisation can be said to be possible. To assist this, every opportunity has been taken of allowing the Royal dockyards to tender for outside work, and they have actually made articles in the nature of outside work to the value of &#163;40,000; and, in addition to that, we are doing work for some other Departments on repayment. I am glad also to be able to announce, as I told the hon. Member for Devonport I hoped to, that the Chilean battleship \"Almirante La torre\" is coming to Devonport for extensive repairs in the course of the next financial year.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>The interesting part of these Debates is that practically every Member comes into this Chamber with the intention of speaking and catching the Speaker's eye. For that reason, I will not indulge in any attempt to\nemulate the oratory of those to whom we have been listening with great interest, but will just endorse one or two points made by previous speakers. I have every sort of admiration for the Secretary of State for Air and for economy, and I believe most firmly that the Secretary of State, if he could get more money for civil aviation, would do so. But I look on this as an opportunity&#8212;we are an extremely happy band from all parts of the House&#8212;to give him some backing to get more money from the Treasury. In the long run, it would not be a waste but real economy to see British civil aviation at the head of all the other countries in the world. Most of the rest of the world agree that in personnel and material British aviation is second to none, but it has dropped most painfully from its record at the head of other countries, and we have had a series of very interesting figures given to us by different speakers in that respect. The last speaker, the hon. and gallant Member for South Hackney (Captain Garro-Jones), has asked for a reply to them.<\/p><p>I would like to add to the figures already given, those of a country which I know well from one side to the other, and which was but a few years ago as behind as we were in civil aviation; that is, the United States of America, The figures of civil aviation to-day in America are amazing and cannot be repeated too often. The hon. Member for North Aberdeen (Mr. Benn) referred to the amount of capital investment in the American aircraft industry to-day, which he put at &#163;20,000,000. That is not one farthing too much. It has gone up from 5,000,000 dollars to 100,000,000 dollars in six years, but, in addition to this sum, another 50,000,000 dollars is invested under private enterprise. With regard to the output of aircraft: In 1927, 1,600 machines were turned out; in 1928, 5,000 machines: and it is expected that in 1929, 12,000 will be the output. We have had it stated that some 12,000 miles of air routes are in operation there, but it has not been stated that over 8,000 are open for night flying. We have had the number of aerodromes, but we were not told that over 2,000 cities have air ports or land marked for the purpose, and throughout the country over 400 chambers of commerce from San Francisco to New York have aviation centres, and that they are putting in tremendous work in developing\naviation. I was only too pleased to learn that the London Chamber of Commerce had made a move in the same direction, and I hope it will be taken up by the chambers of commerce in this country.<\/p><p>I would like to ask the Air Secretary a question with regard to the West Indies, a subject which I have raised frequently during the last four years. Is it still too late to get a British flying boat service there? I was told on the last occasion that this was a job for the West Indian Government and not the Imperial Government, but may I point out that in these centres of population, 50 miles apart it is very difficult to take the lead. They are not a Dominion. On the few occasions they get together they have to do so by boat, and it is a very long and tedious operation. I do not know any part of the world where a seaplane service would be more useful than in the West Indies, which are the nearest link between North and South America. A little incident occurred in the Leeward Islands which will illustrate the position. The Governor was going to start a tour of these islands, taking three or four weeks. A United States warship was in harbour and it happened to have a seaplane on board. The captain loaned the Governor the use of the seaplane for the tour, which he made in one day.<\/p><p>We must let the people of these islands realise what flying boats can do. The perfectly splendid flight of the Royal Air Force to Australia, round Australia, up to Hong Kong and back to Singapore, certainly the finest flight ever made by any squadron, shows what magnificent machines British flying boats are, and if we could only get a squadron to go out there and show the West Indies what flying boats can do they would, I think, make a start in this direction. But cannot we also give them help from the Mother Country? With all the admiration I have for the United States of America it is pathetic that we should hand over to the Americans the possibility of contracting for flying from one end to the other in one of the most patriotic series of islands in the British Empire. I should like to be quite clear with regard to Imperial Airways. I have the greatest possible regard for Imperial Airways, in whose planes I have often travelled; and I quite agree with the\nhon. and gallant Member for Ripon (Major Hills) that the first thing to consider is safety. We shall all agree that there are no safer machines anywhere than those run under the aegis of Imperial Airways; and with that we get courtesy and punctuality. But it is impossible for one monopoly to develop the possibilities of flying over every section of the British Empire. I quite agree that you save overhead charges, but in my humble opinion there is room for more than one concern, under the backing of the Air Ministry and Government, to develop civil aviation within the Empire.<\/p><p>Last, but not least, may I again ask the Minister for Air to do all he can to encourage flying boat services from this country&#8212;it was urged by the hon. and gallant Member for Central Hull (Lieut.-Commander Kenworthy) and myself last year&#8212;from the mouth of the river upon which stands the great Yorkshire city of Hull. I know of no finer port from which to connect the great industrial north with the Continent, from the River Humber to Holland and Hamburg. It is a service which is badly wanted and which, I think would pay handsomely for itself in a very short time. Then from the Port of London to Antwerp a service would be just as successful. We are a scattered Empire and should not allow other nations to go ahead of us, as Germany is doing to-day, because we have proved to the whole world that there is no flying boat on the sea or in the air better than the British seaplane when manned by British men.<\/p>",

As it was not allowed, however, we must have a special Clause making provision for the accounts and the balance sheet to be presented annually to Parliament. I am not going to cover ground which has already been covered in previous discussions, but we have a right to press certain points. There are certain aspects of this question which we have raised throughout these Debates, to which we have received no replies, and I make no apology for presenting one point in which I am particularly interested. I want to stop the humbug of the fictitious cable rates, which are due to the illusion that cables and wireless cost more to Hong Kong and to distant stations than to Canada and near-by stations. I have received no\nreply to that point. The Financial Secretary told us in an earlier part of the Debate that the Advisory Committee would have power to deal with these matters, but they can deal only with proposed increases of rates on rates prevailing at the date of the formation of the Communications Company. They have no power to suggest that diminution of rates should be made. That is a great difference, and I want to get an answer on that point, because cable rates are too high, and based on fictitious assertions. I believe that it is still possible for the Government to take control of overseas rates, and to fix a flat rate to all parts of the Empire. The Colonial Secretary ought to be interested in seeing that this is done, and there is no reason why it should not be done, because those acquainted with the technical side of the matter know that it costs exactly the same to wireless to Hong Kong and Australia as to Canada, and other parts nearer home.<\/p><p>The second reason for this new Clause which I wish to put forward is an entirely new reason. It is to obviate the danger that these two companies, the Merger Company with &#163;53,000,000 capital, and the Communications Company with &#163;30,000,000 capital, may juggle the profits between themselves. There is nothing to prevent the Communications Company buying more apparatus from the Merger Company, in order to show a small profit on the Communications Company and to keep them within&#8212;I was going to say the statutory terms, but there are no statutory terms&#8212;to keep them within the ambiguous, undefined terms of the White Paper. They can very well spend their surplus money in buying new equipment from the Merger Company, and putting the profits into that concern. The Advisory Committee have no power to look into this question, and I would like to ask whether the Committee are to have any statutory rights at all. Does the Postmaster-General propose to bring in a small Bill to give the Advisory Committee statutory powers to deal with the accounts and other matters of administration, or are they simply to be advisory?<\/p>",

The point which occurs to me is: who is going to appoint the Advisory Committee? Will they be appointed on the recommendation of the cable companies in the same way as the Government representatives are appointed, and will the Government have a final say in the matter? The words are:\n<q>approved by the Government at the suggestion of the cable companies.<\/q>\nIn my view, that will be quite ineffective. The main purpose of this Amendment is to try and establish some safeguard of our Imperial interests. We have urged in the course of these Debates that one of the reasons for the formation of the merger and the Communications Company was the need of maintaining the cables for the sake of Imperial strategy. Now it has emerged in the Debate that this will be no safeguard at all in fact, one of these cables is going to be scrapped as soon as it has been transferred. Consequently, there will be absolutely no safeguard in the way of preserving Imperial strategy for the future, because one of these cables is to be scrapped in a few years' time.<\/p><p>With regard to the Imperial Advisory Committee which is provided for in this new Clause, the most important question to be considered by them is the rates to be charged by these companies. I think that is a matter which affects everybody in this House and every commercial and private person in this country. If the Advisory Committee go into the whole question of rates, they will find that the British public is very seriously handicapped by the high charges made by the cable companies. Take the case of Hong Kong or Shanghai, where you have to pay 3s. per word for a cablegram. It costs exactly the same to the companies to send those messages to Canada, where the charge is only 9d. per word. I suggest that the Advisory Committee ought to go into the whole question of Imperial communications, because it costs the companies exactly the same to send a message to any part of the world. With the new short wave length it is possible to work a chief station on 25 kilowatts at all times of the day, and to get a regular service of communication at 300 words a minute. It costs exactly the same to transmit a message to Canada, South Africa or Australia, although in the latter case you have now to pay 3s. a word. The statement has been made by those who look after the cable companies that it costs more to send a message a long distance, but that is an absolute fallacy. It is possible to-day to have an all-round fixed rate of 5d. per word to every part of the Empire, and I suggest that the Advisory Committee might look into that question, and see whether it is not desirable to fix a lower rate and possibly scrap some of these cables.<\/p><p>I am aware that if this scheme was not brought in, many cables would have to be scrapped. We have been told that they are all required for Imperial service. I have been looking at the map of the Eastern service supplied by the Eastern Telegraph Company, and I cannot see why some of those services should not be scrapped. Why should we continue to spend money on these out-of-date services when a better service can be maintained by wireless beam stations of 25 kilowatts? I think all these matters ought to be examined by an efficient body which would not work behind closed doors. I hope that when we get a reply from the Government we shall he given some assurance that the whole question\nof rates charged by these companies will be gone into. The Financial Secretary is rightly interested in the Chambers of Commerce. I know that they are sending messages every day to all parts of the Empire, and it is in their interests that they should be able to send those messages at a cheap rate. If they could send messages to Hong Kong, Shanghai and Australia at 5d. per word, look at the business which the companies would be able to do. A reform of that kind would establish an all-round reduction of rates at a fixed flat rate, and subsidies in all these cases might be found necessary for Imperial purposes. That is one example of the very important points which ought to be gone into by this Advisory Committee.<\/p><p>I appreciate the difficulty we are in owing to the very complex nature of this contract and the many things which are outside the scope of this Measure. I would like to ask: will this Advisory Committee be able to review the whole situation of beam wireless? Will they be able to review not only the cable system which is contained in this Bill, but also the question of communications with Europe? I do not think that the Postmaster-General has given us any indication that, when we are forming this great world-wide international Communications Company, we are leaving out the question of vital communications with the Continent of Europe. The Postmaster-General has now sole control of 64 cables to Europe and the ordinary land lines. It is true that there are two competing services. The Marconi Company was given a licence to communicate with certain European countries, and the Postmaster-General has maintained corn munications with other countries. You have also got a competing system in the wireless. I cannot see when you have this great international combine which will deal with the communication side of European countries how the Post Office can carry on effectively the remainder of those communications with other countries in Europe. For instance, the Marconi Company is already competing with the Post Office even in those countries where they have not a licence to communicate by radio. They communicate between London and Berne by wireless, but they have not the right&#8212;<\/p>",

The captain was wounded and two British officers and one Chinese quartermaster were killed. The ship was taken by the pirates to Honghoi Bay, east of Bias Bay. On the 3rd November the British steamship \"Shasi\" was similarly seized by pirates on the Yangtse, about 11 miles below Hankow. One Chinese member of the crew was killed and one wounded, and an American passenger was seriously wounded. The pirates confined themselves to looting the personal effects of passengers, officers and crew. There seems to be no evidence that piracy is on the increase; in fact, as compared with previous years, the situation shows some improvement. As a result of the \"Anking\" piracy the General Officers Commanding, Shanghai and Hong Kong, were authorised to provide military guards on steamers on the Hong Kong, Amoy, Swatow and Singapore routes. Similar authority had previously been given to the General Officers Commanding, Malaya.<\/p><p>In addition to the normal patrolling by His Majesty's ships of the main steamer routes and the known centres of piracy in China, on the 10th November arrangements were initiated for putting armed naval guards on British steamers on the Lower and Middle Yangtse. It is not clear that an increased number of gunboats would be a certain cure for this evil, and the naval Commander-in-Chief has not, up to date, recommended any such increase.<\/p><p>Representations as to the need of taking effective action against the pirates' lairs are constantly made to the various Chinese authorities concerned. His Majesty's Consul-General at Canton reports that the authorities there have shown some activity in dealing with the base at Bias Bay and killed a number of pirates and released some of their prisoners. From the subsequent case of the s.s. \"Anking\" it appears that their action has been only partially effective, and may have simply resulted in the\npirates moving their base to Honghoi Bay. His Majesty's Consul-General at Hankow reports that the Chinese authorities there have made a great many arrests of persons suspected of having taken part in the piracy of s. s. \"Shasi,\" and that they appear to be dealing with the matter energetically.<\/p><p>Compensation has in the past been paid by the Government of Hong Kong in the case of the death or injury of officers of British ships as the result of resistance to piratical attacks, but now that the Piracy Regulations, which imposed on shipowners certain duties in connection with the prevention of piracy, have been abolished in accordance with their wish so as to leave them a free hand to take their own measures, it seems likely that the Hong Kong Government will consider that the responsibility for compensating the families of the officers should also devolve on the shipowners.<\/p>",

There is no difference between Communism and Socialism&#8212;take any ordinary dictionary and see. There is certainly an ever-growing difference and divergence between the Communist party in Great Britain and the Socialist party. I admit it quite candidly, and I do not suggest for a moment that in that ever-growing difference we are always the faultless party&#8212;we may be committing our errors and our individual faults. But the general picture is this, that since the revolution in Russia the Communist party are standing firm by one and the same programme. We are not adding anything to that, and the divergence does not occur because we want something more year after year but because the Socialist party want less and less Socialism year after year. At one time the Labour party of this country were agreeable to forming the Council of British Workers and Soldiers. At that time the Communists were agreeable to that proposition, and there was no difference of opinion between the two. To-day the fault is that the Communist party still demand that this country should be placed under the control of a council of workers and soldiers, and the Labour party does not want what it once wanted. The Council of Action was established by the Labour party in this country. There was no divergence between the Communist party and the Labour party on that.subject in those days. There is divergence today. To-day, the Communist party says that during the Chinese Expedition, during the Simon Commission, during the hundred and one struggles of the workers, there ought to have been councils of action all over the country amongst the working-class organisations. [<i>Laughter.<\/i>] My Labour Friends laugh at it. They did not laugh at it in 1921, and to-day they want to go away from the only method&#8212;the only method&#8212;which will introduce Socialism, and then allow the people to imagine that Socialism is to come in some unknown and mysterious way.<\/p><p>There is the question of the War Debts. There was a time when I, as a member of the Independent Labour party, had learned my lesson, within the Independent Labour party, that the whole of the War Debt of this country is blood money, is the result of undue profiteering during\nthe War, which every Communist and Socialist should repudiate. When that was the cry of the Labour party, the Communists and the Labour party stood together&#8212;nearer than to-day. Then the Labour party receded from that position, through the exigencies of Parliamentary vote catching, and brought it down to disallowing half the Debt instead of the whole of it. Then they came to the Capital Levy. They found the Communist party would be satisfied with it, but the divergence occurred not because the Communist party said, \"Your Capital Levy of a half is not sufficient, make it three-quarters,\" but because the Labour party withdrew from the Capital Levy. To-day our objection is that when the country is appealed to, democratic support is sought not for Socialism, but for subterfuges and substitutes for Socialism.<\/p><p>The Surtax! I know it is rather a sore point. I have been bred and brought up in a capitalist business life myself, and I know the Surtax is never going to be a reality. If you impose the Surtax to-day, I can vouch for it that at least one firm have got their plans ready in the City of London to have dummy shareholders in Buenos Aires, Calcutta and Hong Kong in whose names large numbers of shares will stand, and there will not be many capitalist mugs who will allow all the shares to stand in their own name. [<i>Interruption.<\/i>] It is so. We do not quarrel with the right hon. Member for Aberavon (Mr. Ramsay MacDonald) when he is seriously appealing to democratic methods, but we quarrel with him because he is depriving the working class of the opportunity of learning Socialism and voting for Socialism. He is making it criminal now to have in the programme anything that is genuine Socialism. That is why, in the Amendment which I had hoped to move, but which I am not permitted to move, I point out that apart from the impracticability of the Surtax there is no Socialism in the Surtax. The principle of the Surtax is. \"I will take 2s. in the pound out of your unearned profit, and I will then permit you to make 20s. of unearned profit.\" It is worse than the gambling business in which the Government have become shareholders. The Government will become shareholders in the unearned income of people who do not work and\nwho exploit the working class, living as parasites upon them. The Labour party says, \"I will square my conscience if you give me 2s. out of 20s., and I will call it Socialism.\"<\/p>",

The expenditure up to date on the Singapore Dockyard is about &#163;500,000 out of a total of &#163;6,917,000. This year it is proposed to spend &#163;200,000 on the dockyard, and want to reduce the expenditure by half. The total cost of the Singapore base is to be &#163;9,750,000. One reason why I am moving this reduction is the development referred to by the right hon. Member for Central Newcastle (Mr. Trevelyan)&#8212;the proposals of Mr. Kellogg to the French Government, which are, of\ncourse, still going on. He proposes that there should be a five-Power Treaty, jointly and severally outlawing war between the countries. If we accept the invitation, which has been addressed to us as well as the French Republic, and outlaw war by a solemn treaty between this country and Japan, it is absurd to go on with Singapore. Until we see the outcome of the very important negotiations now in progress, we ought to slow down expenditure and, I think, a reduction of half is not unreasonable.<\/p><p>Other reasons are too well known for me to spend much time on them. There is an existing dockyard at Singapore which can take the largest sized cruisers now being built. At Hong Kong the local company is enlarging the present dockyard to take the largest battleships. At Esquimalt is a dry dock, which can take the largest battleships and at Sydney, is the dock at Cockatoo Island, which will take the largest cruisers&#8212;all in the Pacific. Therefore, I consider this new dock unnecessary. There is a dockyard already to deal with the work, and the Straits can be closed, in time of war, by means of submarines, mines, long range artillery and aeroplanes. The site is unhealthy and it is easy to attack it from the land, and it would be much better to have the main Pacific base at Sydney, where the Australian army would defend it, and it would be a useful recruiting field for the young manhood of Australia. Singapore on all these grounds is a mistake but it is a double mistake at the present time in view of the discussions which I have mentioned. Hon. Gentlemen opposite are fond of saying that we should always employ British firms and buy British goods with Government money. The new floating dock is being towed out to Singapore by a Dutch company. I asked to-day how much the contract was worth but apparently it is not in the public interest to disclose the details. We may assume that it is a very considerable sum. I cannot believe that there is no British company capable of doing the work and we ought to have an explanation of why the contract was given to a Dutch company. Was it done to save money, and if so, what have hon. Members opposite to say about it? If there was no British company capable of doing\nthe work, it is high time we had a towage company and I suggest that it might be a branch of the Navy. It would be good training for officers and men and might be a good commercial proposition. We might begin a nationalised mercantile marine by embarking on a subsidised and Government controlled towage company. It is scandalous that, with the largest mercantile marine and the largest liners in the world, we have not tugs capable of dealing with work of this kind.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>In presenting this Supplementary Estimate to the Committee, I want to emphasise the fact that it is to meet the excess cost of the extra troops which were sent to China. That means that this Estimate does not cover the cost of the ordinary garrison of three battalions stationed in China, nor does it take into consideration the normal cost of those extra troops which were sent out there. I would also add that where, owing to their move to China, any saving has been made in the ordinary or normal expenses of the troops, that saving has been credited to this Vote. In March of this year we asked for a Supplementary Estimate for &#163;950,000 to meet the expenses of the Shanghai Defence Force up to the end of the last financial year, up to 31st March last. In presenting that Estimate I explained that only those expenses which could be paid in the last financial year were included in that Supplementary Estimate. In presenting the main Army Estimates of this year my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for War made it quite clear that no sum whatever was being included in those main estimates for the extra cost of the Shanghai Defence Force, but that Supplementary Estimates would be laid to cover those expenses. That is the reason for the Supplementary Estimate which I now have to present to the Committee.<\/p><p>I think it may be of interest if I draw attention to some of the movements of troops which have taken place since March and those which took place before March. In the first place, before the\nend of March, that is, during the last financial year, two infantry brigades and one extra battalion, together with artillery, an armoured car company, and various ancillaries, had been sent from this country and from Gibraltar and from Malta. Part of the cost of that movement, but only part of it, was included in the Supplementary Estimate taken for last year. In addition to those troops there was also, of course, one infantry brigade, with artillery and various ancillaries, sent from India. After March, in April and May, one additional infantry brigade, with details of artillery, and various ancillaries, was sent from this country. The troops I have mentioned which were sent out to China formed the Shanghai Defence Force, and they were distributed between Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tientsin and Wei-hai-wei, under the command of Major-General Duncan. The very presence of those troops had undoubtedly, a steadying effect in China.<\/p><p>In July it was decided that the strength of the force could be decreased, and the Indian brigade, which had been sent there in the first place, was returned to India between the months of July and November. It was later decided that five battalions of infantry and miscellaneous details might be withdrawn from China and sent to home and other stations. That means that it was decided that two brigades of infantry and one additional battalion should be withdrawn. I would like to refer to an answer which I gave to a question by the hon. Member for Stourbridge (Mr. Wellock) on Monday. He asked me the present strength of the additional troops in China, and I replied that the present strength was nine battalions, six of which were in Shanghai. I was then asked a supplementary question by, I think, my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Essex (Mr. Looker) as to whether any further reduction was contemplated. The figures I gave in reply to the original question were the actual troops in China at the present time, hut I had in mind that the five battalions which I have referred to, and which it had been decided to withdraw, had either been withdrawn or were in process of being withdrawn. Of the nine battalions which I gave as the present strength one is shortly being withdrawn, being one of the five battalions being taken away. That means that\nwhen that battalion has been taken away, and when these decreases have taken their full effect, the strength remaining additional to the garrison in China will be eight infantry battalions, of which five will be at Shanghai, in addition to supporting artillery and various ancillary troops. That is the force which will remain there for the present. It is impossible to forecast the future. The conditions are always being carefully watched, but I think that the Committee will agree that the whole force cannot be removed until a Government in China can assure us that it is able and willing to give adequate protection to our own nationals. The force which I have outlined as remaining there will, of course, be far less expensive than the larger force which has been there during the past year, and, assuming that no large expenditure for transport has to be provided for in the next year, the cost for the following year will be very much less than the figures now before the Committee.<\/p><p>I would like to refer to the position of the troops which have been out there. I think the Committee will realise that the position has been one of extreme difficulty, because, wherever the troops have been called in to assist at all, it has been in the case of riot or civil com-motion, and there are no more difficult situations with which troops have to deal. I think without doubt that the troops in China have acted with very great restraint; in fact, they have lived up to the very highest traditions of the British Army. The actual living conditions of the troops have been by no means perfect, and I think we shall sympathise with them in that respect. Their quarters have been in a confined space where they have had to live in improvised encampments. There have been very few facilities for training, and the opportunities for recreation have been very much restricted. Yet, in spite of all these disadvantages, the discipline of the troops has been excellent, and their conduct most exemplary. It may interest the Committee to know that, in view of all these circumstances, the health of the troops has been very satisfactory. In the earlier months of the occupation during the hot weather, there was a somewhat serious outbreak of pneumonia, but that was largely due to the climatic\nconditions, and also to the common but very unpleasant habit of the Chinese in spitting on the ground everywhere, in public carriages, and in all public places. To that habit was partly attributed the somewhat prevalent disease of pneumonia at the beginning of the occupation. On the whole, the health of the troops has been satisfactory.<\/p><p>Before turning to one or two of the items of the Supplementary Estimates, I should like to say a word with regard to the A Reservists. Questions have been put in the House with regard to the employment or re-employment of A Reservists when they return home. Some 3,000 of these men were recalled to the Colours to make up the numbers of the Shanghai Defence Force. Those men were within 12 months or two years of having left the Colours, and in the A Reserves they receive the sum of 1s. 6d. per day, which is 6d. more than the ordinary Reservists, on the sole condition that they place themselves at the disposal of the Government, and can be called up for service when necessary. They were called up, and some of them have already returned to civil life, and others are on their way back again. I would like to take this opportunity of appealing to the employers who employed these men before they were called up. Naturally, it is to those employers that these men will turn on their return home in the hope of being reinstated in their former employment. I know that a considerable number of them were unemployed before they went out to China.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>But everyone will see how very serious the allegations are. I want to ask the right hon. Gentleman if he will state, quite explicitly, if Lord Crewe, as alleged, sent for this person or these people. If so, did he have conversation with them? If so, did he discuss the subjects alleged? If he did not discuss the subjects alleged, did he discuss anything else? I hope that the right hon. Gentleman's reply will clear the air. I think I am justified, in view of the very serious conditions abroad, to ask that the matter should be cleared up. I do not wish to say anything more on that subject.<\/p><p>A further subject which the House will agree ought not to be neglected when we are going to adjourn for three months is that of Shanghai. We have a large Army in Shanghai, although we do not hear very much about it. I almost believe that the Government want the country to forget its existence. The other day, the War Office was most extraordinarily secretive on the question as to how many troops we have in Shanghai. They cannot pretend that they do not know. Why then, should they not tell us? They flatly refuse. It is true that they said there are so many infantry units; but we are not all military experts, and even if we were the mere statement of how many infantry units there may happen to be there does not tell us the size of the whole force. For the purpose of argument I am going to assume that the force in Shanghai consists of 15,000 men. I do not know whether it does consist of that number or not. It is not my fault if I have underestimated or exaggerated the number. The reasons become less and\nless apparent for keeping this considerable force, at enormous expense, kicking its heels in Shanghai. When it was sent out originally we made various objections, and all our objections, I maintain, have been fully justified.<\/p><p>We said, in the first place, that when armed force came to the front diplomacy would be at a discount. No one has tried to deny or wished to deny that the Foreign Secretary in the later months of last year seemed to have a very clear perception that things were changing in China. He had issued the December manifesto and shown a very clear recognition of the insurgence of Chinese nationalism, of their patriotic self-assertion, and of the general recognition that Western domination in China had, gradually, to come to an end. His negotiations were all tending in that direction. Of course, you cannot play two games at once, and when the British Army and the British Navy, in large force, went to Shanghai, negotiations fell in the background and we have not heard very much about them since. So far as we can see we are no nearer coming to an arrangement which will satisfy the one thing which, it is perfectly clear, dominates the whole of Chinese politics, and that is the determination of the Chinese, to whatever section they belong or under what ever General they are. They are all agreed on one thing, and that is that they want to be rid of all unequal treaties. The right hon. Centleman was moving in that direction, but since our troops have gone out other things, apparently, have taken place, and I have not seen any indication of any further progress in an understanding with the Chinese governing class.<\/p><p>The next thing we said was that illfeeling against the British would be accentuated by our sending out troops. We said that everyone outside the wire entanglements in Shanghai would be in a more uncomfortable position than they were before, and we were fully justified in that statement. The Government actually advised a general <i>sauve qui peat<\/i> to the rest of the British population to come to the coast, and that has been largely acted upon. The fact is that, owing to the exasperation of the Chinese at our action, more Britishers were in danger in other parts of China than were saved from danger\nin Shanghai. The other thing we said was that British trade would be disastrously affected by what we were doing. We pointed out what had been happening in the previous year and that because we had got across the whole of the Chinese Nationalist movement, owing to the shooting at Shameen and Shanghai, the trade of Hong Kong had been hit very badly, that there had been scores of bankruptcies and that the condition of antagonism had been a disaster for Hong Kong. We said that the same kind of result might very likely be more prolonged and more disastrous by our sending out these great military preparations to Shanghai.<\/p><p>It is extremely difficult to get trade figures. Here, again, the Government are not very ready to help us; but my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Central Hull (Lieut.-Commander Ken worthy) and I have been putting questions, and have elicited some information. The most important part of the information is that if you compare the trade with China in the three or four months at the beginning of this year with the trade at the beginning of last year, you find that whereas the United States trade with China has gone up by 8 per cent., our trade has gone down by 20 per cent. A further fact which we have elicited is that in the April, May and June averages of trade with China last year, our exports were &#163;1,182,000; this year they have fallen to &#163;576,000, or to one-half. That is some indication of what is happening. I do not think there is any denial of the very serious effects on our trade. The real question is, how are the Government going to get out of this present impasse, and what is their policy? Sooner or later, the Government must give way to the united Chinese demand for the abolition of unequal treaties. When are they going to get a move on in that direction? Are they going to leave the British Army in Shanghai indefinitely or when are they going to bring them home? They have no business to keep the Army there, whatever the original justification may have been, except under imperious necessity&#8212;15,000 men or whatever number they are.<\/p><p>While the War Office is not able to give us the figures as to the size of the Army\nin Shanghai, it is able to give us the figures regarding the number of men in hospital, and it is not a very satisfactory total. In March, there were 580 in hospital, in April 745, in May 871 and in June 959, or with officers practically 1,000. I do not know what proportion that is to the whole, but if my estimate of 15,000 is, right it means that one man in 15 is in hospital, and they are now only reaching the worst months. That is a formidable and serious thing. There is also the expense. That is a formidable cost. The newspapers to-day say that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, by economies, is going to be able to pay for the expedition in China. I wonder! It will have to be a formidable economy. The original Supplementary Estimate was for &#163;950,000. There is another item for capital and transport of &#163;1,000,000. Then there is the extra maintenance, presumably not put at any higher figure than it is by the War Office, of &#163;250,000 a month. That means that at the end of six months we shall, on the Government's admission, have paid &#163;4,450,000 for the expedition. By the end of the year at the same rate we shall have paid &#163;6,000,000, to say nothing of the expense of bringing the troops back, if ever we do get them back. That means that already we have spent &#163;740 per Britisher in Shanghai whom we have been protecting. I do not know whether it would not have been better to have waited for the risk&#8212;[HON. MEMBERS: \"Suppose your own family were there?\"]&#8212;and if the risk had appeared to have brought away our British population. I do not know whether it would not have been the wiser thing if and when any danger did appear to have brought away our population.<\/p>",

I am consulting a memomorandum which refreshes my memory as to the nature of the information that we have had in our possession. The connection of the Soviet Government with these intrigues was well known to everyone in China. It was definitely proved at the time of the arrest at Hong Kong, in June, 1925, of a Soviet citizen officially described in his passport as being at the disposal of the Soviet Embassy. He was carrying a certificate issued on 16th June by the Soviet Agitation Department in Shanghai, ordering him to proceed to Canton for the purpose of organising strikes. When he came up for trial the physician of the Soviet Consul-General at Shanghai attempted\nto bribe the Russian constable of the municipal police to declare that he had forged the certificate. The physician was arrested in the act of trying to hand over 10,000 dollars to the constable. He was remanded on bail, but preferred to forfeit his bail, and absconded.<\/p><p>I do not propose to carry the story further. This is the class of information, well established, which has been in the possession of His Majesty's Government, much of it for a long time and some of it for only a short time. What does it all show? It shows that the conditions on which alone the Trade Agreement was signed, upon which every succeeding Government without exception has insisted, have been systematically and continuously broken by the other party to the Agreement. The information we have laid shows that privileges accorded to the Trade Delegation were abused, that Soviet House was the seat, not only&#8212;I think I might almost say not chiefly&#8212;of trading activities, but of political propaganda and anti-British agitation. It shows that the Soviet Mission at Chesham House was engaged in similar activities, a breach of the comity of nations and an abuse of the diplomatic privileges accorded to them; and it shows that both these organs were acting under the instructions and in the spirit of a Government which was pursuing the same hostile policy to the Government with which it professed to be in friendly relations, in every part of the world.<\/p><p>I must, in order to bring home to the House the gravity of this action, recall what has passed between the two Governments. I begin with the Trade Agreement itself. It set forth that the Agreement was subject to the fulfilment of the following conditions:\n<q>That each party refrains from hostile action or undertakings against the other and from conducting outside of its own borders any official propaganda direct or indirect against the institutions of the British Empire or the Russian Soviet Republic, respectively;<\/q>\nand it went on to declare that it was understood that the term \"conducting any official propaganda,\" included the giving by either party of assistance or encouragement to any propaganda conducted outside its own borders. That document was signed on 16th March, 1921. Within six months the Government, of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Carnarvon Boroughs (Mr. Lloyd George),\nwho had signed the Agreement, found it necessary to address a Note to the Soviet Government, of which this is an extract. The Note is dated 7th September:\n<q>On the above review of the history of the last five months, it is abundantly clear that the conditions on which His Majesty's Government undertook to renew relations with Soviet Russia by the conclusion of the Trade Agreement remain unfulfilled. In spite of all the professions of good faith on the part of the Soviet Government, there have been unabated indications of bitter hostility towards this country and its Dominions and Dependencies. Even apart from the specific considerations to which it is pledged, it seems utterly to have failed to grasp the elementary principles which ordinarily underlie the relations between Governments professedly at amity with one another and naturally jealous of any attack on their own particular institutions. It still appears quite incapable of realising that a constant flow of inflammatory invective delivered by its leading representatives against the existing institutions of this country is an absolute barrier to the renewal of correct relations, and that actual hostile activities by its agents must necessarily prompt the belief that its desire for such relations is insincere.<\/q><q>His Majesty's Government have long been loth to believe that the Soviet Government was not as anxious as they themselves to create a more favourable atmosphere than previously existed, in which Anglo-Russian relations could be gradually cultivated till they finally became entirely normal. It has been their sincere desire that the Trade Agreement should not only be carried out, but should be the prelude to better relations between the Governments and peoples of the two countries. Such a future is, however, incapable of realisation if the conditions which have been described in this Note are to continue; and His Majesty's Government must ask for a definite assurance that the Soviet Government will cause these activities, which constitute breaches of the Trade Agreement, to cease.<\/q>\nWhat was the reply? The reply was that a cursory glance over the document was sufficient to enable the People's Commissary for Foreign Affairs to state to Mr. Hodgson that the charges contained in the Note were either unfounded or based on false information and forgeries. So early did the Soviet Government decide on the line of its defence! The Government of the right hon. Member for Carnarvon replied:\n<q>His Majesty's Government have not made these charges without a prolonged and careful investigation in each case into the sources of their information&#8212;sources which it is necessarily impossible in many cases to disclose. They see no reason to recede from\nor even to qualify a single one of these charges now.<\/q>\nThat was dated 2nd November, 1921, being the first formal complaint made, and made within six months of the signature of the Agreement.<\/p><p>I pass to 1923, when the Government of that day were obliged to take up the matter again. They said on 29th May, 1923:\n<q>There remains the all-important question of hostile propaganda carried on by the Soviet Government against the British Empire and British institutions in general. His Majesty's Government cannot conceal their surprise and disappointment that on this point the Russian Note gives no satisfaction whatever. Yet it is on the continuation or the cessation of these activities that the fate of the Trade Agreement depends. It cannot be too emphatically impressed on the Soviet Government that it was the pledge given by it that propaganda would cease&#8212;a pledge which is embodied in the text of the Trade Agreement&#8212;that rendered the conclusion of that agreement possible, and that the observance of this pledge was and remains an essential condition of it.<\/q>\nThey accordingly proposed a new formula to cover the case. It was in these terms:\n5.0 p.m.<\/p><p><q>The Soviet Government, acting on behalf of itself and of all associated and federated Governments, reiterates the pledges contained in the Russian Trade Agreement of 16th March, 1921, which were as follows: To refrain from hostile action or undertakings against Great Britain, and from conducting outside of its borders any official propaganda direct or indirect against the institutions of the British Empire, and more particularly to refrain from any attempt by military or diplomatic or any other form of action or propaganda to encourage any of the peoples of Asia in any form of hostile action against British interests or the British Empire, especially in India and in the Independent State of Afghanistan.<\/q>\nIt then, proceeds:\n<q>In view of complaints which have been made, the Soviet Government undertakes not to support with funds or in any other form persons or bodies or agencies or institutions whose aim is to spread discontent or to foment rebellion in any part of the British Empire, including therein all British protectorates, British protected states and territories subject to a British mandate, and to impress upon its officers and officials the full and continuous observance of these conditions.<\/q>\nThe Soviet Government said that that was an extension of their previous pledge; but they undertook it solemnly and promised its observance. I come now to the Note which was addressed to\nM. Rakovski by the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition when he was Secretary of State and Prime Minister. I quote it not for the purpose of entering into any argument about the Zinoviev letter. The information in the possession of His Majesty's Government as to the authenticity of that letter was, as the House knows examined carefully by a Cabinet Committee, including, besides the late Lord Curzon and myself, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Birkenhead and Lord Cecil, who is also a trained lawyer, and it was the opinion of every member of that Committee that the information in possession of His Majesty's Government proved up to the hilt the authenticity of the document, from its inception in Russia to its delivery in London.<\/p>",

If so, how will it come and why should it be?\" The right hon. Gentleman expressed his view that if the situation had been as it is now in China the Motion made from these benches would not have been moved protesting against the great expedition to Shanghai. What we said when we made that Motion was that it would create the kind of situation which now exists in China, and we were right. Everything that we expected has occurred. The Chinese were angry enough, and they are now more furiously exasperated. There is greater danger to all who are not behind the wire entanglements at Shanghai. It is exactly as we said it would be. Our Government finds that it has not got the other Powers acting with it. There is danger of war with the Cantonese, and, as a sequel of that, the House must remember that our trade with China stands in jeopardy not only of decreasing but of absolutely disappearing altogether. These are the things we were afraid of and these things are the things that have come to pass as we said they would if we exasperated the Chinese.<\/p><p>Take the events of Nanking. Our nationals are far away from the\nprotection of Shanghai. Very deplorable events occurred. But we do not know the truth of those events. The right hon. Gentleman the Foreign Secretary carefully abstained from replying to my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition, who had stated, as a reasonable policy for our country to pursue in a situation like this, which is liable to lead to war and where there are very materially different statements of fact from various quarters, that there should be an inquiry. What more reasonable suggestion could be made? Here you have three versions; you have the British official version, the version of Chiang Kai-shek and the version of Mr. Chen. They differ materially as to what soldiers were primarily guilty and as to how many Chinese were killed during the operations at Nanking. I do not suppose that anyone in the House definitely disbelieved the British account, but it does not tally with Mr. Chen's account, and, as my right hon. Friend said, in so far as we have had any experience or have been told of any experience of Mr. Chen, we can rely on his word. We can rely on this, that at any rate it is the opinion of the Cantonese Government, expressed through Mr. Chen, that the responsibility to a great extent for the disaster is due to the Northern troops and that many Chinamen were killed during the operations.<\/p><p>There is no reason for us to say that Mr. Chen is right and that the information given to the right hon. Gentleman is wrong. What we do say is that it would be an ugly business for us if we found that we had not got hold of the whole truth after we had gone to war, or as my right hon. Friend says, even if less happens, after we are enforcing our claims by whatever methods we choose to adopt. In this matter the House might adopt a little sense of proportion. What has happened at Nanking is deplorable. So are many things that happen in war. Really, although my hon. Friend on this side just now may have interrupted somewhat injudiciously, yet who denies that it is true that one of the things that does happen in war is that some victorious armies get out of hand and loot and destroy right and left? After all, this is not the first looting that there has been in China. A few years\nago a composite army of practically all the civilised nations in Europe looted Peking. Therefore I say, do let us have a little sense of proportion. Here is civil war going on in China. Here is admitted revolution going on. I read of a good way of putting it the other day in an article by Mr. Ransome:\n<q>You cannot have a revolution without breaking windows. Our duty is to keep out of the way of the falling glass.<\/q>\nWhat is the situation? It is quite true that these deplorable things have happened but, I say, again, let us have a sense of proportion. Since 1st January one Englishman has been killed at Shanghai, and three Englishmen have been killed at Nanking. It is deplorable, but it is hardly sufficient reason for the illimitable disaster of war as a response. While the Secretary for Foreign Affairs was speaking I felt a certain amount of sympathy with him. He was talking about the Labour party having two policies. The right hon. Gentleman himself has two policies, and that is his difficulty. We have expressed our approval of the Christmas manifesto of the Foreign Secretary. It was the first step in the right and necessary direction. What we complain of is that he spoils his policy. He makes it practically impossible to carry out that policy by the other part of his policy which he is now trying to justify, namely, the regime of force. We realise that as a nation we have to deal with a new situation, and, in spite of all that is happening now in China, with a hopeful situation in China. The hopefulness of it consists of this, that there is now at last a Government which has control of more than half China, a Government which is to a great extent a representative Government, a Government with whom we can deal, with whom we have dealt, and with whom we ought to go on dealing, and not a Government merely of brigands.<\/p><p>How does the South make its advances? I do not know how much fighting ft does, but what happens is that the whole population swings over to its side. It is a Government which is getting into its hands the whole of the good will and support of the Chinese people. We ought to put ourselves on terms with that Government. The future lies with them. If not, what is the prospect? Nobody\nsupposes that the present British Government wants war. It knows what would happen to it if there were war. Of course it does not want war. But governments drift and drift and drift into war, and if you send out armies of 30,000 or 40,000 into a country and tell them to sit there, for how long are they to remain? For weeks, for months, and for years? Why should you bring them back 10 years hence? What is the policy? You have not got one. The Government do not know how they are going to get out of the difficulty in which they are. But the guns may begin to go off. Put aside the national disaster of the fighting of the two peoples. What is going to happen to our trade? Where is it going if there is war? Let the House keep in mind certain facts of the situation as we see them at this moment. The other nations are not helping us very vigorously in our policy of force. It is pretty well known that the Americans and the Japanese do not like this policy. The French openly and expressly and officially dislike it. They are none of them prepared to help us in our course of violence. What is to happen? They are waiting for our trade. I do not say that that is their motive&#8212;far from it&#8212;but they know that that is what will result from it. This was amply exemplified last year when, as a result of the Shanghai and the Shameen shootings, Hong Kong trade was boycotted. What was the result? Disaster to Hong Kong. \"The Times\" told us that the value of property had gone down by &#163;100,000,000. With the assistance of the Government they had to borrow &#163;3,000,000. Our carrying trade fell from its supremacy to almost exactly the position of the improved Japanese carrying trade. Our export trade to China fell while the Japanese trade rose, and rose to an extent corresponding almost exactly with our loss.<\/p><p>I do not know how far, since the boycott has disappeared, the Hong Kong trade has recovered. It may have recovered. My point is that now you have the Southerners in occupation of the Yangtse. We are beginning to be told that there is no trade on the Yangtse even now. Of course there is not. If you have incidents like Wanhsien and like the coming of this great force of ours to Shanghai, if you exasperate the\nChinese to that extent, what is to become of our general trade, which is even more important to us on the Yangtse than in the rest of China? What folly it is! The Cantonese are quite open about it. Even the Communists in the Kuomintang agree absolutely that they do not want to drive out the foreigners by violence?. They have said so in the most explicit way in the last few weeks. What they say it is worth the while of a great industrial nation that lives on its foreign trade to listen to. The Nationalist Finance Minister said:\n<q>It looks as though foreigners had a sufficient force here for defence against the whole of the Chinese Army, but a foreign force, regardless of its size, is futile, because foreigners cannot force Chinese to trade with them.<\/q>\nHe also said that\n<q>The foreign forces were erecting a brick wall and shutting out foreigners from Chinese customers.<\/q>\nThere is our prospect as an industrial nation. That is one of the reasons why we do not want to fight. The main reason is that it is totally unnecessary. It is unnecessary, because we have started as a nation on the right course, which could free us from all our difficulties. If only the Secretary for Foreign Affairs would go on in that course, if only he would leave the advice of the fire-eaters who have induced him to send out these troops, if be would leave that advice and listen to the voice of reason, our troubles might soon be at an end.<\/p>",

That is much more important to me than my own views, and I suggest humbly should be more important to the House than any personal views of my own. The right hon. Gentleman emphasised the point which has just been made, that the ultimate decision of France and Italy must be a vital one for us, and that, whatever may be done at Geneva, unless we have the assent of France and Italy and know what they are to do, our first duty is that which is indicated in the old Book which will be for a long time our guide:\n<q>The strong man armed keepeth his palace.<\/q>\n5.0 p.m.<\/p><p>We cannot, without common consent and common disarming action by other Powers, disarm ourselves. I have said so much with regard to the subject which has mainly occupied us to-day. I want to say a few words on other subjects. The Singapore Base has again been referred to to-day, and I want to repeat what was said previously in this House. that the Imperial Conference strongly reaffirmed the value, in their opinion, of proceeding with the Singapore base, and to express the hope that, as the Malay State has made a most generous contribution and also Hong Kong, that other parts of the Empire may see the right and the necessity and the justice of doing something to relieve the mother country under this head. I thank the First Lord of the Admiralty for one announcement which he made which affects my own constituency, the City of Portsmouth. Its creation as a City since our consideration of Navy Estimates last year is a just meed to the historical position of Portsmouth and the great services it has rendered to the country. I want to thank the First Lord also for the improvement which has been made in the submarine base, but I join with others in expressing regret that he has found it necessary to reduce the number of men in the dock-\nyard. I recognise that, if you diminish your shipbuilding and repairs, it must involve a reduction in the number of men employed, but I think the remark made by the hon. Member for North Camber-well (Mr. Ammon) was somewhat cynical under that head. He said, and said quite truly with regard to the dismissal of these men, that it would mean\n<q>simply a transfer of expenditure from one side of the national account to the other, and, perhaps, will give us a very much worse return in unemployment and all those things which follow.\"&#8212;OFFICIAL REPORT, 14th March, 1927; col. 1685, Vol. 203.]<\/q>\nI would commend that comment to those in office at the Admiralty. It is a fact that, if you dismiss a number of your hands, men who have been trained for special work, living in a place which is almost entirely occupied in connection with the dockyard industry, the inevitable effect will be to transfer them from the Government Vote to the dole which means unproductive expenditure and the deterioration and demoralisation of the men. That is one of the problems in connection with the reduction of armaments which hon. Gentlemen opposite, I am glad to see, are realising. I hope that, as far as possible, the wind will be tempered to the shorn lamb, and that other work may be provided for those men when they are no longer required in the dockyards. I will not enter into the vexed question of the duty of the Admiralty not to send work to the private dockyards so long as they have men and space available in the Royal dockyards; I know what there is to be said on both sides of that question, but I do commend to the House, as perhaps carrying more weight than the words of a dockyard Member, some words spoken on this question by the hon. Member for Dunfermline (Mr. W. M. Watson). I think he made an extraordinarily good and able reference to the condition of these dockyard men. He said:\n<q>These dockyard towns have been built up exclusively for Admiralty purposes. Apart from naval activities, there is nothing in these areas. The whole community is dependent upon the work in the dockyards, and I rather sympathise with their representatives in asking that the men should be given as full employment as can possibly be given them. There is no justification for handing out Admiralty work to private yards while the Government has in their own hands the means whereby they\ncan meet their own requirements. In the Royal dockyards a great deal more work could be done than has been done up to now. There is no justification for the plea put forward &#8230;. that more Admiralty work should be given to private dockyards. So long as the Royal Dockyards are there and capable of doing Admiralty work, the first claim on that work should be for Admiralty workers in the Royal Dockyards.\"&#8212;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 14th March, 1927; cols. 1760&#8211;61, Vol. 203.]<\/q>\nThat statement comes with more force from the fact that anything which we, as dockyard Members, may say is largely discounted, and that the hon. Member for Dunfermline is not a dockyard Member.<\/p>",

Gentleman knows perfectly well that, when he was in power, Australia wished to support with money the Singapore Base, and it was simply be cause he and his friends would not go on with it that they diverted their money to building cruisers instead. That is a matter of simple history which the hon. Gentleman, I should have thought, would rather have kept to himself. I was going to observe that the total figure for the cost of the Singapore Base has been reduced from &#163;11,000,000 to &#163;7,7.50,000. That is exclusive of the cost of the new floating dock which is being constructed to go there. This reduction has been made possible by a more careful survey of the ground and of what is necessary, and also by leaving out certain facilities for storage and repair which are not absolutely necessary, and which, if unfortunately the political outlook were to become clouded, could be erected in a very short time. Towards the cost of\nthe whole of the scheme, the Straits Settlements have contributed the land; Hong Kong have already given &#163;250,000; the Malay States, as I have said, have given &#163;2,000,000; and we should be very glad to receive further contributions. They quite spontaneously offered the money, and there is no reason why other people should not do the same. The sum required this year for Singapore will be &#163;335,500 for the construction of the floating dock, and &#163;284,000 for other works, of which &#163;576,000 will come from the Malay States, and only &#163;43,500, it is fortunate for us, from the British taxpayer.<\/p><p>Then I must say a word about the necessity we are under for sending ships to China owing to the disturbed state of that country. I think the Leader of the Opposition and other speakers on that side of the House have attempted to draw some distinction between what they call the policy of the Foreign Office and the policy of the Service Departments, as if they were not united in this matter. It is a complete myth. As far as the Admiralty are concerned, what we have done has been to respond as rapidly as we could&#8212;and I think nobody could say we have wasted much time&#8212;in carrying out our part. What we have done has hen to respond to what the Foreign Office asked us to do in order to protect British people in China, and we are very glad to be able to send out ships from glad which landing parties can be disembarked, and whose presence will do a good deal to allay the terrible anxiety under which many British people are living in China at the present time. We have sent out 1,000 Marines at very short notice. They were ready in three days from the time they were asked for, and several days before their troop ships were available. I think it is a very fine testimony to the great efficiency of that magnificent force, the Marines, that in less than three days they were ready to go to those very distant parts of the world. As I have said before, we have estimated for &#163;125,000 towards the cost of bringing back those extra ships which have gone out there.<\/p><p>There is another small item on which, I think, we can congratulate ourselves, that is the success that so far has attended the tour of the Duke and Duchess\nof York in the \"Renown,\" and the great satisfaction and interest which their visit has caused in all the places at which they have stayed. I am sure the House is very sorry to hear that the Duchess is suffering from even a slight indisposition, and being interested in the \"Renown\" I cannot help feeling some satisfaction that it was on shore and not in the ship. At the same time, I hope that when she does return to the \"Renown,\" that will he the best recuperative convalescent treatment that she can have. I am sure the House will not grudge the very limited amount of money that has been spent on this most successful voyage.<\/p><p>There is one point which is rather an important one, although it is not a question of a great deal of money, and that is the Royal Naval Medical Service. Recruitment for that Service has been unsatisfactory for some considerable time. I need not go into the causes of it. A Committee was set up to look into the conditions of that Service, and to inquire into the causes of the difficulty of recruiting.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>In presenting this Supplementary Estimate there will be no need for me to enter into any question of policy. The reasons which decided the Government to despatch a force for the protection of the lives and property of British nationals at Shanghai are already well known, but I think it may be of interest if I give hon. Members some account of the arrangements which necessarily had to be made by the War Office in despatching this force. The sequence of events was as follows:&#8212;On 18th January the Board of Trade were authorised to make the necessary arrangements for the taking up of ships and the accommodation of troops. The Government, not wishing to take any decisive military action until the last possible moment, did not authorise the War Office to take the necessary military action until 21st January. On that day warning orders to the units selected to go to China were dispatched. On the same day notices calling up men of Section A of the Army Reserve were posted to them. The calling up of these men was necessary in order to bring the selected units up to the necessary establishments.<\/p><p>I might explain to the Committee that Section A of the Reserve is composed of men who undertake the liability to come up for service at any time within two years of their leaving the Colours. For that liability they receive an addition to their Reserve pay of 6d. a day; that is, they receive 6d. a day more than the\nmen in the other classes of the Reserve. Notices were sent to 1,581 men, and it is very satisfactory to know that of that number only four failed to reply and were absent without sending sufficient reason. With regard to the force itself, the situation in China was not such as to demand the despatch of a division of the Expeditionary Force. It was therefore necessary to consider and decide what force should be sent. It was finally decided that a force from this country of two infantry brigades, with ancillary units and with munitions, stores and medical personnel, should be despatched. When one realises the work that was entailed, first of all in organising the force without in any way disorganising the organisation of the Expeditionary Force, and the work of calling up the A Reservists, I think it is very creditable that it was possible in such a short time to despatch the force.<\/p><p>The first transport left this country on 25th January, only four days after the calling-up notices had been issued. Between 25th and 29th January, inclusive, that is five days, six transports left this country, conveying practically the whole of the Shanghai Defence Force. It included the whole of the rifle strength and most of the ancillary troops. Two ships left at later dates with small units of artillery and with the necessary stores and munitions. The first of those transports arrived at Shanghai on 26th February, and the last ship, containing details and stores, is due to arrive at Hong Kong by 18th March. I think the Committee will appreciate the satisfactory nature of an organisation which made it possible to despatch a force of that size from this country a distance of over 10,500 miles, and to land them there in a space of less than two months from the time the first orders were given. I think hon. Members would agree that it reflects the greatest credit on the military and civilian staff, not only at the War Moe, hut also in the commands and districts affected; also it reflects great credit on the officials of the Board of Trade, who have to make the whole of the arrangements for calling up the ships, for seeing them fitted and properly equipped for the reception of troops. The whole of that movement was carried out with very little fuss and with no ostentation. We\nmay well be proud of the way in which the War Department carried out that duty.<\/p><p>With those few introductory remarks I turn to the items of the Supplementary Estimates. In the first place, there are some items under Vote 1. Sub-head A is the pay, etc., of officers on regimental establishment. That item and several others are due to the transfer of certain British troops with the Indian Brigade which has now come on to British establishment. It is unnecessary for me to explain that this Supplementary Estimate is merely for money which will be expended before the end of this month, that is before the end of the present financial year; so that that particular figure is for the transfer, during that period, of those British units which have previously been on the Indian establishment. The whole of Vote 1 is either for those units that have been transferred from the Indian to British establishment or for the pay of the Army reservists, Class A, to whom I have already alluded.<\/p>",

I shall not try to make an Imperial speech, but our Empire has its lines of communications, which, in the first place, are in charge of the Navy. Their terminal points, our large bases and our fuelling stations are left to the Army for protection, and the Army provides the actual land protection of the bases which we hold. One has only to turn one's mind to some of our great trade routes in order to see where our military garrisons abroad are placed. One finds them along the trade routes: Gibraltar, Malta, Egypt, the Sudan, Aden&#8212;and going on down&#8212;Singapore and Hong Kong, while, on the other side of the Atlantic one finds the West Indies. It is in those places that our military garrisons arc placed, and I can assure hon. Members opposite that those garrisons have been reduced so much in recent years that they are barely sufficient to be able to carry out such duties as are thrust upon them. In many cases in regard to artillery in our forts in those places which I have mentioned, one will find that the actual regular personnel has been reduced to such an extent that the full defence of the battery has to be made up by locally organised defence forces. With those limitations and with our Army cut down to that extent, it is not possible for us to give a much better example than we have done to the League of Nations.<\/p><p>The hon. Member who seconded the Amendment made rather sarcastic play about our talk of reduction in the Army and spoke about our having reduced nothing but horses. He seems to forget that, although there has been a slight increase in the numbers this year, for reasons which were explained by my right hon. Friend, there has been an actual reduction in the Regular Forces of 5,000 men this year. Since 1922 there has been a reduction of over 50,000 men. Surely those reductions should be a very good example and should assure the other countries of Europe that we are not facing them in any aggressive spirit and that the forces which we have are needed solely and only in the defence of our Empire. Various other items have been raised, but I do not think I need go into details as to the organisation of the Army. One hon. Member asked me to give details about the number of tanks,\narmoured cars, and so on, which we should consider as the minimum, the lowest limit to which we could go in dealing with the League of Nations Conference. All these questions of men and material must depend upon the attitude taken up by the other foreign countries. It is not a matter for us alone; it can only be settled if we know what other countries are willing to do. The hon. Member for Pennistone (Mr. Rennie Smith)&#8212;I do not know if he was in Order, for Mr. Deputy-Speaker pulled him up before he had gone very far&#8212;dealt with another point of the Estimates, namely the education programme of the War Office.

There are, no doubt, some who will approach the subject from the standpoint of interest in and sympathy with a political experiment unprecedented in the history of our civilisation. For my own part, I confess I cannot share that sympathy, for I have a loathing for tyranny, whether in the form of Monarchism, Militarism, Fascism or Bolshevism. On the other hand, there are those, no doubt, who will approach it filled with hatred for the Bolshevist system, and also with some hopes of being able to turn the anti-Bolshevist prejudice in the country to their electoral advantage at the next election; and there are some, like the hon. and gallant Member for Wycombe (Sir A. Knox), whom I see on the opposite side of the House, and the hon. and gallant Member for Handsworth (Commander 0. Locker-Lampson), who gave distin-\nguished and loyal service to the country on the Russian front during the War, who fought with brave and loyal Russian officers and men, and who saw many of those who fought most loyally and bravely in the War foully murdered, often with every accompaniment of ferocious cruelty; and one can understand their feelings of abhorrence at entering into relations with men who might be held responsible&#8212;in so far as individuals can he held responsible for revolutionary excesses&#8212;for those atrocities.<\/p><p>I venture to think, however, that, natural and, if I may he allowed to use the word, creditable as such feelings may be, they have to be mastered if we are to form a cool, detached and impartial judgment as to how the relations with a great country have to be handled. After all, if we had been mastered by feelings such as those, we could hardly even yet have restored peace in Europe, we should have come to no settlement of our age-long differences with Ireland, and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs would hardly be pursuing his present policy in China. I shall, therefore, approach this question solely from the standpoint of British interests, peace and a revival of industry. There is no use in being friends of every country but our own, or, on the other hand, in being blinded, by hatred for a foreign political system, to the interests of our own country. I hold that it is our duty to take as long and as enlightened a view as we are able of the interests of those who sent us here.<\/p><p>What are our interests in Russia? They are, I take it, peace and trade. They are very similar to the interests which the Secretary of State described the other day as being our interests in China, namely, peace and trade. We have made, in China, great efforts and sacrifices to preserve our trade. We have not only sent there a costly naval and military expedition, but we are running serious risks in that country to defend&#8212;and I think rightly&#8212;British lives and British property. Hon. Members opposite often dilate upon the importance of British trade interests in China. They say what a vast trade we have there, and how necessary it is to keep that trade in the interests of our own country and of our unemployed. I\nagree that it is a vast trade and a great interest. Where I part company from hon. Members opposite is in this: The same hon. Members pour scorn on our \"insignificant and paltry\" trade with Russia, which is, they say, hardly worth taking into serious consideration. I have been at some trouble to collect the figures. I am not going to bore the House by reading them in detail, but am only going to give the aggregate figures of our trade with Russia and China in recent years. I find that, in 1924, our imports from China aggregated &#163;14,500,000, and our exports to China, including Hong Kong, aggregated &#163;29,000,000. In the same year the figures for Russia were &#163;19,000,000 for imports, and &#163;11,000,000 for exports, including re-exports.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I beg to move, at the end of the Question, to add the words,\n<q>But regret the delay of the Government in dealing with the Chinese situation, and deplore the despatch of armed forces to the Fan East as calculated not only to increase the risks to which British subjects in various parts of China may be exposed but also to put obstacles in the way of arriving at an equitable and permanent friendly understanding with the Chinese people on the basis of a frank recognition of their national independence; and this House accordingly calls for the immediate diversion and recall of the forces now on their way to China.<\/q>\nIt is unfortunate, in connection with the subject which we are discussing to-day, that the nation was so much occupied last year with the coal stoppage, and that we had not then free minds to be watching and discussing and weighing what was happening in China. Disastrous events were there occurring&#8212;events to which I must begin by alluding, because, without being able to weigh their importance, we cannot really judge the situation which exists there to-day. Not only during the last two years has the popular democratic Government of Canton become the dominant force in China. Certain other events have occurred. To us here the shootings at Shanghai and Shameen and Wanhsien are unfortunate incidents occurring 10,000 miles away. Towards those incidents our Government have adopted the policy of saving very little, of giving very late and rather reluctant informa-\ntion to this country, and I think that the greatest disservice done by the Government in that kind of action has been that they have given a wrong impression here of the real significance of those unfortunate incidents in China. The significance of those incidents in China is very vital to the understanding of public opinion in that country. Take the results of the Shanghai shooting. I ask the House to follow what happened and to realise what it meant. Within a fortnight of the shooting at Shanghai some 200,000 Chinamen, in protest against the killing of their fellow nationals, began to leave Hong Kong. It is seldom that there has been such a great movement in such a short time. They went off to Canton.<\/p><p>4.0 p.m.<\/p><p>What happened then? The authorities at Hong Kong sent word to the authorities at Canton that they were to send back these people. There was about as little chance of their being able to send back these emigrants of patriotic indignation as there was that the Israelites should be returned across the Red Sea. Then Hong Kong stopped food ships going up to Canton. On that there was begun by the Cantonese and the Chinese a boycott of British trade. If we had not had our minds so full of what was happening here and the even greater disaster to our trade of the coal stoppage, our minds would have been full of the results of what was going on in China. I need not give many figures to the House, but I must remind them of the kind of disaster to our trade which these events implied. The export of cotton goods fell from &#163;12,600,000 in 1924 to &#163;7,500,000 in 1925, and to &#163;6,800,000 in 1926. The decrease of worsted tissues was from &#163;1,000,000 to &#163;6,000,000. Then, as evidence of the kind of disaster to our trade in Hong Kong, this is a statement of the vice-chairman of the China Association, who said:\n<q>The depreciation in the value of property and shares in local industries in Hong Kong amounts to no less than &#163;100,000,000.<\/q>\nTo quote the Chancellor of the Exchequer in what he repeated last night,\n<q>Almost the last thing you wished to do with a potential customer was to shoot him.\"&#8212;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 9th February, 1927; Col. 201; Vol 202.]<\/q>\nlast year came the events of Wanhsien. Again, we vaguely discussed what happened at Wanhsien as an incident, but we have had no Papers yet laid. We really do not know what claim there is for a justification for what happened in Wanhsien. All we know is something of what happened. Scores of people were killed, and a city of the size of Bristol was bombarded by our ships and a large part of it laid in ruins. The Chinese do not forget this. I want the House to realise that, if you want an explanation of the anti-British feeling of the Chinese, if you want an explanation of Hankow, if you want an explanation why to-day our trade on the Yangtse is going, well then it is in these events which are constantly before the Chinese people. There is no need for wild propagandists to make people object to being shot. There is an effort to make out that the real reason why the Chinese are so passionately indignant to-day is because of Borodin&#8212;because of Russian adventurers. I want to say this very plainly and I believe I speak for&#8212;[<i>Interruption<\/i>]&#8212;I am certain that I speak for my friends behind me&#8212;that the policy of Canton is absolute independence for the Chinese, that the policy of Canton is the extinction of the unequal treaties, that the policy of Canton is the disappearance of the Concessions, that the policy of Canton is the withdrawal of the military and naval forces of the Western nations from the territory and waters of China. That is also the policy of the Labour party. It is the policy which the Labour party announced the other day:\n<q>We will do everything we can to procure such a settlement as will place China on a footing of national independence in the fullest meaning of the term.<\/q>\nI only want to say this with regard to Russia. Soviet Russia is backing this policy, and we are not going to allow our country to quarrel with Russia, because this time at least they are supporting a cause which we also declare to be just. There ought in this House to be the beginning of complete agreement as to what our nation wants. I am not quite certain, but I think the policy of His Majesty's Government is attempting to be the same. It is naturally moving in that direction with more caution as it\nis a Conservative Government. A great many of the declarations which the right hon. Gentleman has made indicate that he will go very far at any rate in that direction, and I should like to quote something which has recently been said by Mr. Vandervelde, the Foreign Minister of Belgium. It indicates, in the first place, how far that very astute states man thinks, or indeed knows, that the nations will have to go in regard to China, and it indicates also how clearly he has been given to understand how far our Government and the other Governments are ready to go. Mr. Vandervelde the other day said:\n<q>Belgium is siding with those who are not over-anxious to maintain in China institutions which have been imposed by Europe and which are in any case hound to disappear before the current of national sentiment which will become more and more apparent. This is not only our own attitude. On the contrary, it seems to me as if the heads of Governments, which have interests in China more considerable than our own, are convinced that any frosh resort to force would not only be illegal but ineffective, and, even farther, impossible.<\/q>\nMr. Vandervelde went on to say that.\n<q>For any expedition we would not even provide four men and a corporal.<\/q>\nI think that Mr. Vandervelde is right in two things. I think he is right, first, in indicating that the nations of Europe have got to give up the whole of their unequal privileges in China, and I take it he is right in indicating that that is the general attitude of our Government and of the other great Governments. We here have watched the efforts which the right hon. Gentleman has been making in the last few weeks to begin to make a settlement in the hope that he would succeed, and we are sorry that at present he has not succeeded. The challenge of this Amendment is against the action which is in fact stultifying all his wiser policy. A nation cannot play two games at once. It cannot try to be friends and expect to be believed by another nation and at the same time threaten that other nation. The sending out of this force has thrown back everything into chaos when it appeared only a few days ago that we were going to get something like a settlement. Self-respecting Governments do not sign treaties while the mailed first is being shaken in their faces. We are sorry that\nthe Government have taken the action that they have done<\/p><p>I should like at this juncture to say that I think the sending out of this expedition is a very unfortunate example to be given by a tuition winch ought to take the lead of the world in the League of Nations. I regret very much that at an earlier stage the main matters of issue in China were not in some way or other brought before the League of Nations. Of course, there is no need to remind the House that no doubt technically it would be extremely difficult to bring the Chinese question up in the League of Nations, because the weak Peking Government is the only Chinese Government that has an official position in the League of Nations, and because, also, the United States of America are not in the League. I think it possible and probable that the normal and regular machinery of the League could not under any circumstances have been used. But the normal and regular machinery of the League did not settle the trouble between Italy and Greece, and yet it was the influence of the League indirectly used by the right hon. Gentleman and others that prevented the struggle between Italy and Greece reaching more formidable dimensions than it did. I think it would have been a good thing if, even at an earlier stage, there could have been an impartial intervention by disinterested Powers and if that could have been made available. I do not know whether there is any truth in it&#8212;perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will tell us&#8212;but I see in the newspapers to-day that the Government are said to be thinking of approaching the League. I only wish the time may come and come soon when a Government will think first rather than last of approaching the League of Nations.<\/p><p>The argument which has been brought forward hitherto in favour of this great expedition to China is the plea that it is necessary in order to protect our fellow countrymen in Shanghai. Of course, on both sides of the House there will be agreement that there are risks. What we are called upon to do to-day is to weigh the nature of the risks one way and the other. There is the risk, which seems to be the only one in the minds of a great many right hon. and hon. Members opposite, of mob violence and uncontrolled soldiery in Shanghai. We first of all say that we have no right to put that risk\nvery high. There is no proof yet that we could not have got some very considerable guarantee of security from the Chinese. I should like again to press the right hon. Gentleman to reply to a question which was put by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition the other day as to whether any attempt was made to get in agreement with the Canton Government regarding the security of our people in Shanghai. After all, so far as the Canton Government are concerned, we have knowledge that we are dealing with reasonable people. Hon. Gentlemen may not altogether agree with them. That is a different thing. Nobody reading the utterances of Mr. Chen could think otherwise than that we have reasonable men to deal with. I should like to read another statement by another of the Chinese leaders. This is by the Generalissimo of the Southern Army, who says:\n<q>Foreigners who wish to remain in China are cordially welcome to stay here and to be governed by our laws. Nations who wish trade with us may do so in accordance with our laws. We will not solicit foreign capital for China, but it will always be welcome if foreign concerns wish to continue their factories in this country or open any other form of industrial enterprise they will be given our hearty support, in exactly the same manner as any Chinese enterprise, but it will only be permitted provided it is in the interest of the Chinese people. The welfare of the workers comes first in our scheme. Missionaries also will always he welcome as heretofore.<\/q>\nSurely that is the statement of a moderate and reasonable man, and think it most unfortunate if that is the case that we did not try to come to an understanding with these reasonable leaders of the Chinese people before we entered upon this course of military demonstration which is frustrating the better ends which we have in view. I will go further than that. Why should we put the risk in Shanghai so high? In the last two years scorns and scores of Chinamen have been killed in conflicts with us and our nationals. We heard to-day that only three Englishmen have been killed. HON. MEMBERS: \"Oh!\"] Well, very few. There has been no great outburst of fury against individuals in China, but there has been a very serious thing indeed to us, as I have pointed out already&#8212;there has been an attack on our trade. There has been a very serious boycott, but there\nhas not been any great outburst endangering the lives of people. Therefore, the danger to which the right bon. Gentleman the Member for Carnarvon Boroughs (Mr. Lloyd George) alluded yesterday, the danger that the police in Shanghai would be unable to deal with the situation, and that we should have to have recourse to embarking our population in order to take them into safety, is a very remote possibility. But, on the other side, the risks of the course which the Government have taken are infinitely more disastrous and more immediate. In the first place, the chance of a negotiated settlement is destroyed, at any rate for the time. That disaster has already occurred. The negotiations have been broken off. The end which we were all wishing for&#8212;coming to terms with the Chinese people&#8212;has been defeated. That is the first disappointment. Then there is another very serious matter.<\/p><p>Hon. Members opposite wish to secure the safety of the 8,000 or 10,000 Britishers in Shanghai&#8212;as we all do. [HON. MEMBERS: \"Oh!\"] There is no need for me to dwell on that point. Everybody knows we all want that. According to figures given to us this afternoon, there are 9,300 British people in Shanghai. This expedition is going to make their lives secure without the necessity of removing them if danger occurs. What about the other Britishers? By the figures given us to-day there are another 6,000 scattered all over China Up to now, on the whole, these compatriots of ours have been safe. [HON. MEMBERS \"Oh!\"] They have been, on the whole, unmolested. There have not been any cases in which any of them have been killed. What is going to happen to them if there is slaughter in Shanghai? If there is fighting in Shanghai because of the presence of our troops, what is going to happen to these people in the other parts of China? Our troops do not help them at all. Our troops endanger their lives. Our troops by increasing the indignation of the Chinese people, by in creasing ill-feeling in China, put these compatriots of ours into a far worse position than they were in a few weeks ago. But there is another thing. If we do begin to fight, what then is going to happen? We now know that we have united all China against us. A few days ago, after the announcement of the\nBritish expedition, the son of the Mukden War Lord, Marshal Chang, made this announcement:\n<q>If the British attempt force, I am sure the Chinese, both Northern and Southern, will rise together to defend their country.<\/q>\nSo, at last, we are managing to unite the Chinese people. If the Government will not accept the suggestion which we make; if they refuse our Amendment, it they will not call back their army, what is going to happen? These troops will go to Shanghai. They will land, watched by a sullen, hostile population, and until they go, they will be faced by the same hostile, sullen, angry people. The best that can happen for us is that the angry Chinese people will not attack, and that they will be content with a trade war upon us, and with boycotting our trade. The worst that may happen is the ghastly bloodshed of war. A spark may light it as we have sent the powder there. I think it is a tragedy, because the right hon. Gentleman had come so near to success. He had nearly brought the thing off with the goodwill of everybody, and then, in comes this expedition, making it impossible for him to succeed until he himself, or until his colleagues, will retract the decision which they have made.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I am glad to find an expert authority confirming that view. I will venture to read a very brief quotation from my speech at Manchester, as reported in the \"Manchester Guardian.\" It expresses views which I think will command the assent of hon. Members opposite:\n<q>There was nothing further from our intention and idea than to be drawn into an adventurous or grasping or ambitious or Byzantine policy in China. All we wanted to do with China was to trade with China, As was well said by Sir Austen Chamberlain, in his speech at Birmingham last week, where the Par East was concerned we were a nation of shopkeepers. We sought nothing in China but to be able to sell to the Chinese goods which they desired to have, and to receive hack in exchange goods which would be useful to ourselves. We regarded the 400,000,000 of Chinese as potential friends and customers. Almost the last thing you wished to do with a potential customer was to shoot him. The last thing you wished was that your potential customer should shoot you. We had shown by the efforts we had made&#8212;efforts that could not have been made without very grave heart-searchings and concern&#8212;that we were prepared to go to the utmost limit to gratify and dignify the national feeling of the Chinese people. But when it came to mob violence and to the life and property of British subjects, dwelling under the security of Treaties recognised for generations, being violently assailed and menaced, then we were hound, if we wished to maintain the reputation of this country, to take reasonable measures for their protection and defence.<\/q>\nI am sure the right hon. Gentleman is not going to argue, when a Minister makes a statement of that kind which commands general assent, that the reference which I made in an earlier part of my remarks can possibly be misinter-\npreted. At any rate, it pays a very poor compliment to Mr. Chen, to whose position and influence hon. Gentlemen opposite attach great importance&#8212;possibly exaggerated importance&#8212;it is paying him a very poor compliment to imagine that he would allow the discharge of his responsibility towards millions of Chinese to be influenced by a passing allusion of that kind. No one has more reason to be grateful to me for my remarks than the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition. They helped him out of one of the most difficult situations in which he has ever been. Last Monday he devoted the greater part of his speech on China to denunciation of the humble individual who now has the honour of addressing the House, and the moment he left off abusing me he was called a scoundrel by his own friends. But after my right hon. Friend had denounced my evil conduct, at the very moment when this speech was made in Manchester the Labour Party was sending a telegram to Mr. Chen strongly advising him to continue negotiations.<\/p><p>I have no doubt that telegram was extremely well intentioned, but I ask the House whether there is not a certain amount of danger in this dual diplomacy. I am sure that when, for instance, we see Mr. Chen officially saying to our representative, \"I have not done this in order to oblige the British Government, but I have done it to please the British Labour party,\" or when we see him addressing special manifestos to the British people saying how much better it will be for China and Britain and the whole world when the present reactionary British Government is swept away, and when the Labour party rules, I am sure he is being led into making a mistake. I do not think that it helps his affairs or our affairs if that sort of thing takes place. It is very much better that, for good or ill, the responsible Government of the day should be the sole channel by which diplomacy is conducted. To try to build up beneath the ordinary official diplomacy of the country all this worldwide structure of other diplomacy, is undoubtedly to tend to increase those elements of fundamental disagreement which have already made their appearance in our modern life and which it is the duty of every citizen to endeavour to reduce to reasonable limits.<\/p><p>My right hon. Friend the Member for Carnarvon Boroughs asked a lot of questions. Were the troops now on their way to China to stop at Hong Kong or to go to Shanghai? What were the views of the Consul-General at Shanghai upon the question of the necessity of troops being sent there? What were the instructions to the British Commander? What were the relations and what would be the relations of our forces with the force of General Sun? What are our relations with General Sun and with Marshal Chang? What is the military situation? The military situation is uncertain and obscure. Not only are there all the hazards of war, which are unknowable and immeasurable, but in addition to the ordinary hazards of battle there are all these possibilities of a large part of one army marching over and joining another army, and of generals who are ordered to attack the enemy, attacking their friends, but apparently in a manner to afford as little loss of life as possible to either party. As I say, the situation is obscure. We cannot pretend, and we do not pretend, to be able to give any decided judgment as to what will happen in the fighting which is proceeding, and which seems likely to develop between the Canton troops and the forces of General Sun in the neighbourhood of Hanchow. It is obvious, however, that much depends on the results of that fighting. We might easily have a situation in which all danger to Shanghai passes away. We might, on the contrary, have a situation at any moment when either the mass of retreating troops of a beaten army came pouring into Shanghai or possibly came pouring in with the victors at their heels.<\/p><p>No one can tell what will happen. No one here would take any responsibility for what will happen in that fighting or predict about it. It would be folly to do so. We must leave the judgment of the actual danger to British life in Shanghai to our representatives on the spot. We have very good representatives on the spot and we trust them. We have in Sir Miles Lampson, who is not in Shanghai but is in touch with all the developments of the China situation, an administrator and diplomatist whose character and actions have justly won the highest tribute from the right hon. Gentleman opposite who is able to speak\nfrom personal knowledge. We have in Sir Reginald Tyrwhitt the Naval Commander in Chief one of the most determined and at the same time one of the most cool and sober-minded officers to be found in the Navy. We must be guided as to the actual movements of troops by the advice which these authorities on the spot give us. We cannot attempt to judge here of the actual situation in Shanghai. As the Prime Minister told the House, if there was no immediate danger to Shanghai we should be quite ready to leave the brigade at Hong Kong, but the matter must be decided entirely on the advice which we receive from our representatives there. But they have been told explicity that their responsibility is limited to the protection of British life. That is their sole responsibility. In that name they are entitled to be and they will be supplied with what troops they need but for no other purpose of any sort or kind. As for any question of our taking sides with either of the Chinese forces, with either North or South, as to our taking sides with General Sun, we absolutely disclaim any such intention. We are only going to look after our own affairs and our own vital affairs in Shanghai. With regard to the different forces that are contending in China, our policy is to offer conciliation to all, to try to get justice and reasonable consideration from them for our own nationals and not to load the scales or to allow any preconceived notions or European prejudices to enter into the matter one way or the other. We cannot possibly judge these matters. They must be settled by the Chinese alone and our policy is to keep clear of all these matters. This subject will of course be unfolded by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary to-morrow.<\/p><p>There is only one other point which has been raised and to which I would refer before I sit down. My right hon. Friend the Member for Carnarvon Boroughs opened up the question of the attitude of this country towards Russia and towards Bolshevism. The whole of that position was stated last Session by the Foreign Secretary at great length. He then showed that we were under no illusions as to what was taking place and that there was no lack of provocation, but he explained in the most clear manner the reasons why the Government considered\nthat at the present time they should maintain the diplomatic relations which had been established. No new decision has been come to by His Majesty's Government, although obviously these matters call for examination at frequent intervals. When the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Carnarvon Boroughs proceeds to condemn those politicians in this country who dwell upon Red intrigues and the Red menace and so on, there I must part company with him. I served for many years with him in a Government before the Great War, and I think it is right to say that, as far as human ingenuity could go and as far as our resources went, we were not taken unawares. But we were always reproached afterwards, as everyone knows, for not having taken the country into our confidence more and for not having apprised the public of the danger and of the fears which the Government were nursing in their bosoms in secrecy and silence. Take the case of Lord Haldane, who rendered unequalled service at the War Office in devising the effective machinery by which the Expeditionary Force was sent out and by which 14 Divisions of the Territorial Army were organised. No greater war administrator has been at the War Office in our lifetime, but he never recovered his position in the public esteem because it was believed that he formed a very serious view of the intentions not of the German people but of the militarist party in Germany and that he did not fully disclose that view to the public. We are not going to repeat that in another field&#8212;I hope a much less tragical field. We believe ourselves to be the object of insidious hostile propaganda in every part of the world, and we are determined that, if this is to continue or at any time come to a head, it shall be encountered by a British public opinion in which the constitutional and patriotic elements are fully apprised of what is taking place; are vigilant, warned, ready for action, and ready to meet danger when it comes.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>The first speches of the Session always begin in harmony, however much they may end in discord, and it is my pleasant duty to follow the right hon. Gentleman in paying a tribute to my hon. and gallant Friends the Members for Westmoreland (Major Stanley) and Kilmarnock (Major MacAndrew) for the way in which they have discharged that difficult and delicate duty of moving and seconding the Address. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that we have indeed been fortunate in recent years, although it is always a source of wonder to me how the House manages to produce year after year Members who can discharge those functions with such ability and such competence. But I think I may say, without straining language, that we have seldom listened to two speeches so different one from the other and yet each so admirably adapted to the part it has to play. Kilmarnock, as my hon. and gallant Friend stated with some pride, holds a great record in this House, having had three or four Members representing that Division selected to move or second the Address within recent years. I am confident that she will be still further proud of what has been achieved to-day and the House will look forward in future years to the position which my two hon. Friends will undoubtedly make for themselves.<\/p><p>Now I have to examine briefly, as is customary to-day, the King's Speech and the observations which have been made upon it by the Leader of the Opposition. Of course, from my point of view it is an admirable thing that he should complain that he has never had lees material to work upon than he had in that speech. It is not my business to provide him with material to work upon. What he wanted was to find a mass of legislation which would help him to unite the scattered fragments of his own party, a kind of counterpane of unity to hide the straggling limbs of that ill-concealed couch. I think when the speech is examined the House will see that there is a great deal\nof useful work that it may accomplish this summer. It has for a long time past been borne in upon me that by far the best way of dividing the Parliamentary year is to begin the new Session in the late Autumn. The Government tried this experiment once, but owing to various causes was only able to try it that once. We feel that it would be well worth the House trying it once more and seeing whether it cannot he made a success, and for that reason we have put into the speech such legislation as we think there is a reasonable prospect of carrying by 1st August, giving the House a substantial rest through the late summer and early autumn and beginning the new Session with important legislation, say, in the early part or the middle part of November as the case may be. I do not know how other Members who are regular attenders of the House feel. My duty brings me to this Chamber every day at some time or another, and I have felt very strongly during the last year, quite apart from recent strenuous events, that the House has been suffering from too long and too continuous work in this Chamber and there have been apparent&#8212;I will say this for all sections of the House because I am speaking now as Leader of the House&#8212;signs of fatigue in the machine, and I believe from the point of view of the efficacy of our work a less strenuous year is a matter of the very first importance.<\/p><p>I say this without in any way discussing legislation, for which this is hardly the occasion, that one Measure of which the House has heard a good deal, the question of Poor Law reform, is so large and comprehensive that it would have been impossible to take it this Session unless we had contemplated a long Autumn Session. It is a Measure which must be mixed up with very important and intricate questions of local finance. It is very important, in my view, that such questions should not come into the House until they have been examined from every point of view and some opportunity has been taken of discussing them with local authorities in the country and I hope it may be possible when the new Session starts in November to get ahead at that early period with this important piece of work so that it may have the time devoted to it and the attention of all parties which is desirable in framing a Measure of such great\nimportance. The same is true of the Factories Bill. I should like for many reasons to have dealt with it this summer, but I would ask the House to consider this point, which bears on the question of business to which I have alluded. For some years past there has been a tendency among all parties to attempt more legislation than the House can deal with. If you take the greater number of years, Easter falls at such a time that it is impossible to look with certainty to getting the Second Reading of any important Bill before Easter. After Easter there comes the Budget. The Budget may be a small Bill or a big Bill, but it is always important, and you may be in the month of June or, as has happened, even in July, before you can get to the Committee stage of a long and important Bill. That inevitably means summoning the House back after an inadequate holiday, which for most Members includes a period when they are in their constituencies working&#8212;I think the general public are very often apt to forget that&#8212;and the House has to meet early in October and work right up to Christmas. That is a bad thing for good work, and I am sure if it is possible, as I believe it is, to get the Second Reading of the big Bills in the Government programme this side of Christmas so that they can be got into Committee when the House reassembles in February, it should be possible for any Government and any House to see that all the effective legislation is passed by about the end of July or early August. Of course, we all know the temptation on every Department to bring Bills out of its pigeon holes which have been rejected year after year by Government after Government on the ground that there bas been no time, and it will require a good deal of firmness on the part of any Government that may be in power working under this new time table, to resist that pressure so as not to lose the benefit they hope to get for Parliament as a whole by the changes they have made.<\/p><p>The House will judge from what I have said, and will know from its own experience, that it is no easy matter to get any considerable volume of legislation through by the end of July for the reasons I have given, but I should like\nto say a word or two about the Measures which have been alluded to in the King's Speech. By far the longest Bill with which the House will have to deal is the Bill on Unemployment Insurance. I would like to supplement what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Major Stanley) with regard to it. Let me remind the House, and many Members are familiar with this, that the system at present in operation is based on a series of Acts dating from 1920 to 1926. The system is, admittedly, of a temporary character, because it is provided in the Act of 1926 that the provisions in regard to payment of benefit cease to operate after December of this year. So, if there 15 no legislation, it would be necessary to include that Act in the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Bill, and in any case the matter would have to be dealt with within the next year or two, unless the House were satisfied, which I am convined it would not be, to allow this Act to be carried year after year under the Expiring Laws.<\/p><p>I think it is a matter of general agreement, not as to what should be done, that the scheme, which to a certain extent is of a patchwork nature, does require examination, and it was for the purpose of examining it that the Minister of Labour set up a Committee, presided over by a distinguished Judge, Lord Blanesburgh, to go into the matter. That Committee has now reported, and I hope the report will be published within the next few days. My hon. Friend quoted from some observations which had appeared in the Press to the effect that it was believed the Report was a unanimous one. I am glad to be able to tell the House that that information is correct; the Report is unanimous: it most satisfactory conclusion, and one reflecting immense credit on the Chairman and on all the members of that Committee, having regard to the complexity of the subject and the many difficult points which its investigation raised. From that, I would hope very much that the Bill may not be considered, as it would have been in other circumstances, a Bill primarily of a controversial nature, and that the House may join in trying to make it a really good Measure, and to get this question on a sound and satisfactory basis, on the lines of that Report, for a good many years to come.\nIn any case, that will be a Bill of many Clauses, and the matters which will arise in those Clauses will be of great interest to large numbers of Members of this House. The subject is one that is very familiar to them, and as such it is bound to be discussed at some length. I hope very much that, with the provision for business that we have made, it may be possible to give that Bill the examination that it deserves, and that the Act will be one that will reflect credit upon all parties in the House.<\/p><p>I do not think it is necessary at this point to say more about the Bill in connection with trade unions, because I understand that the Opposition desire to make that the subject of a separate discussion on one of the days allotted for discussion of the King's Speech. With that object in view, I have asked my right hen. Friend the Home Secretary not to give notice to-day of the introduction of the Bill, so that- there may be no technical objection to the discussion of that subject during the Debate on the Address. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition made some very natural fun about the wording of the paragraph dealing with agriculture. It is quite obvious from that wording that the Bills in question would be small Bills. None the less, there are a great many small Bills, and we have passed a number of them, which are Bills of great value, and. I am not at all sure that small Bills of the nature that we have passed, and shall pass, are not a great deal more welcome in agricultural circles than Bills which deal with much larger subjects.<\/p><p>The right hon. Gentleman, when he had run through the King's Speech, spoke at some length on China. I do not propose to speak at any length at this moment on China, for the reason that that, again, will be the subject of a day's debate on the Address. I understand that Thursday has been provisionally fixed for that debate, and on that occasion my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary will take the opportunity of intervening and speaking at some length. But there are one or two things which the House would expect to hear to-day, and there are one or two points, I think, which should be made without delay. I could not help being a little amused at the way in which the right hon. Gentleman tried to discover fissures in the concrete foundations of the Cabinet. It is common form\nto talk about divisions in the Government. I pass that by. But on the question of our China policy, he was very interesting. He reminded me very much of some of those modern and acute critics of the Pentateuch who are always looking for the various strata which they describe as Jahvist and Elohist. In regard to our China policy, he discovered the strata of what he calls the Foreign Office or the War Office. I can assure him, if he will take it from me, but I am afraid he will not, that these are myths he is pursuing. We have only one policy that we are pursuing, and that is the policy of His Majesty's Government. The speech that was made at Birmingham by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary&#8212;a speech, incidentally, which I think commended itself to the country as a whole and to foreign nations as a whole&#8212;contained an admirable account of events as they had happened up to the date on which he spoke. Some things have happened since, but, again, I will not go into detail. I think it is far better that the details should be discussed on a day which is given up entirely to that particular subject.<\/p><p>I wondered when I was listening to the right lion. Gentleman who preceded me in this debate whether he would have made exactly that speech had the responsibility of action as the head of the Government rested upon him. It is so easy to criticise when you have not the responsibility. I can assure him that none of the points which he put have been absent from our minds. I think that responsibility males you give a rather different weight to the factors in the opposing scale than you would give in the absence of responsibility. Where you have lives in the scale it is very difficult perhaps to weigh calmly all the factors on the other side. The right hon. Gentleman spoke about the danger when soldiers become policemen. Well, I wish it were possible to send the Metropolitan Police out to China. When policing has to be done in a foreign country on a large scale you have no instrument you can use, except soldiers or sailors, and T am quite sure that the right hon. Gentleman would acknowledge that no police in the world could have shown the tact, the courage and the forebearance which was shown by our men at Hankow. One of the difficulties of the situation, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, is that\nthere are elements at work that desire to push us into fighting and desire bloodshed.<\/p><p>China is not like this country; the mentality is very different. China is in a state of civil war. There have been events in the history of that country, unhappy events, which compel&#8212;[HON. MEMBERS: \"Hear, hear!\"]&#8212;authorities on the history of China will have their opportunity&#8212;anyone in the position of responsibility to envisage the grave possibilities that may occur. There are appearances in China, to-day which remind those of the greatest experience of what they saw shortly before the Boxer trouble. The danger is not only from the mob in Shanghai. If it were only the danger of the mob, it might he that such forces as have been accumulated there internationally, together with the local forces, would be sufficient; but there was the fearful possibility shown at Hankow that if bloodshed had begun you might have had Chinese troops fighting with the mob, and you might easily have had a massacre of white inhabitants. As was truly said by the Seconder of the Address, you can evacuate the small populations of foreigners in a place like Hankow, but in Shanghai you cannot, they are too many. Every foreign country is aware that evacuation is out of the question at Shanghai, and thus protection comes in.<\/p><p>5.0 p.m.<\/p><p>I said a few minutes ago that China is in a state of civil war. That is what we have to remember when we suggest that complete security could be obtained by an assurance&#8212;assurances can be given perfectly <i>bona fide,<\/i> and intended to be <i>bona fide<\/i>&#8212;but until we are clear that the opportunity has passed by for the neighbourhood of Shanghai to be the fighting ground between the various national forces in China in their civil war, you cannot say that the danger to the European and Japanese nationals in Shanghai has passed. At Hankow, one of the difficulties has been, as everybody knows, that the Nationalist army have either lacked the will or the power, or both, to control their mobs. Much more might an organised force fail to control such forces as might be let loose in a city of the size and wealth of Shanghai if a combination of unhappy and evil\ncircumstances once let them loose. We have sent to the East, as the right hon. Gentleman frankly admitted, not an expeditionary force. If we had contemplated war with China it would have been a different and a larger force. We have sent a, force which we have been advised by our advisers would be necessary to defend our people in the international concession, if that combination should arise of a real struggle to capture the concession and to murder the inhabitants on the part of a mob, together with troops, whether they happened to be troops which had come into Shanghai from beaten armies or troops of a victorious army. Such force as we are sending to China has gone there for the purpose of the protection of life, and for nothing else. I think it right to read to the House the resolution to which we came yesterday in the Cabinet embodying in few words the policy of the Government:\n<q>That the general policy of the Government should be based on the following considerations:<\/q><q>Our troops were sent to the Far East to safeguard British life in China, and particularly at Shanghai. That was, and is, the only policy of His Majesty's Government. The question of the time at which, and the manner and numbers in which, the troops should he landed at Shanghai must obviously depend on the local situation and the advice we receive from our representatives on the spot. If they consider that the emergency requires immediate disembarkation at Shanghai we shall act accordingly. If not, the leading brigade will be held in readiness at Hong Kong while the rest of the force is approaching. There can, of course be no question of entering into any arrangement with Mr. Chen or anyone else in connection with the movement of troops which are despatched solely with the object of protecting British lives.<\/q>\nWith regard to the situation at Hankow, all I wish to say is this. Nothing has occurred from our point of view, although the Foreign Secretary will be able to speak an this at much greater length, to make us alter our determination to achieve our ends by negotiation. That is so. Mr. O'Malley at this moment is waiting a further communication from Mr. Chen which has been promised to he sent to him within a very short time. It may be that by Thursday the Government may be in a position to tell the House something more on that. That is the position at this moment.<\/p><p>With regard to the North, I wish to say just one word. It is a difficult task, as the two Leaders of the Opposition will recognise from their experience in government, in a situation like this to hold the scales so evenly between the conflicting parties, in a struggle with which we have nothing to do and which is exclusively Chinese, in such a way that neither party can accuse you at any time of helping the other. The South would like us to declare that they are the Government of China when they hold authority over but a fraction of China. It would be impossible for us to do that, as it would be impassible for us to help the North in the various directions which they would like.<\/p><p>No man can tell when we shall have a united China again, or what form that united China may take. Such events as are happening to-day are nothing new in the history of China. They are common to every period when a dynasty breaks down. Such periods are succeeded by years of anarchy. Most unfortunately for ourselves, having regard to the great trade interests we have in the East, we are living to-day in one of these periods of anarchy. It is our earnest desire, from motives of self interest if from no other, that that period shall be shortened as much as possible. We cannot help to shorten it by taking part in the struggle ourselves. We can, and we shall, do what we can to be ready for the day when there is a united Government in China by keeping on, as we have been, with making the most generous offers simultaneously to both parts of China, the North and the South, by being ready to discuss, as we have discussed and as we are discussing, with them what we can do to come together in the hope that when these unhappy internal struggles are ended we may again be able to enter on new friendly and propitious relations with that great country united, a country with which in the past we have had on the whole friendly relations, relations of service to both of us, and relations which must play, having regard to our position in Asia and the East, a great and growing part in the peace and prosperity of the whole of the Eastern hemisphere.<\/p>",

The pirates were in control of\nthe ship until 1 a.m. on 16th November, when the officers, by a sudden attack, overpowered the pirate guard on the bridge and released the other officers and passengers. They then held the bridge deck against the attack of the pirates. The pirates then set fire to the ship. The captain let go an anchor and swung the ship so as to send the smoke and fire aft, whereupon some of the pirates abandoned the ship in two dinghies. His Majesty's Ship \"Bluebell\" arrived at 5.30 a.m. on 16th November and put an armed guard on board. 22 of the pirates were captured and four are known to have been killed. The chief engineer (British) of the \"Sunning\" was wounded and one male passenger is missing. There is no truth in the report that one or more European women were taken by the pirates as hostages.

I apologise for the length of the answer.<\/p><p>I have already dealt with the Wanhsien incident, in my previous reply. As regards Canton, the House is aware that for over a year past an agitation has been on foot, directed exclusively to the destruction of British trade. The attacks by the boycott organisation on British traders became so intensified as to compel His Majesty's Government to adopt measures to resist such acts of piracy, and orders were accordingly sent to the Commander-in-Chief. China Station, to take steps to seize and disable all boycott patrol beats, and to remove all pickets from British wharves. Operations to this end were taken on 4th September, but at the first sign of naval activity all boycott patrol boats fled. So there was no necessity to effect seizures, nor did His Majesty's ships fire a shot.<\/p><p>These steps evoked a prompt response from the Cantonese Government, who arranged with His Majesty's Consul-General that Chinese police should patrol the river, and guard the wharves. Accordingly, the naval activity was suspended. This arrangement has been\nscrupulously observed by the Cantonese Government, and no further incidents have occurred.<\/p><p>On 18th September the Cantonese Government informed His Majesty's Consul-General that they had made arrangements to end the boycott of Hong-Kong at the latest by 10th October, and that they proposed to levy certain taxes on imports and exports, for the purpose, it is understood, of liquidating the strike organisation. A notification to this effect was published in the \"Canton Gazette\" on 24th September, and at the same time the strike pickets guarding the approaches to Shameen were removed. In the meantime British steamers have been plying to Canton without obstruction, and have secured passengers and full deck cargoes.<\/p><p>As regards Central China, the Cantonese forces have captured Hankow and Hanyang, although Wuchang, the capital of Hupeh, continues to hold out against them. Some fear was felt lest their advent on the Yangtse might lead to a spread of the boycott to that area, but I am glad to say that, although there has been a certain amount of agitation, there has been practically no interference with British trade and industry at Hankow. The extension of the war zone to the Yangtse valley led to a certain amount of firing on British and other steamers. Representations were made to the Cantonese Government., and attacks of this nature now appear practically to have ceased.<\/p><p>Anti-British agitation broke out in the latter half of this month at Chungking, and considerable depredations on British property were committed. It became necessary to evacuate all British women and children. The latest reports, however, indicate a slight improvement in conditions there, and it is hoped that, with the return of the second captured ship, a further improvement will shortly take place.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>The Postmaster-General in opening his speech said that he felt very much like the chairman of a public company making his annual statement. I think the Committee must congratulate itself on the fact that they have a Postmaster-General who has presented the accounts of a big commercial concern in concise, businesslike terms, which have been very interesting and appreciated by all of us. The fact that he said he would not be prepared like the chairman of a company to put his signature to the balance sheet in no way detracts from the fact that he is at the head of one of the most successful business concerns in the world. I imagine that there will he no difficulty on this side of the House in co-operating with him in endeavouring to get his annual statement at the end of the year arranged by a different kind of accounting, instead of what is now a strictly cash account. The businesslike and interesting statement which the Postmaster-General has presented embodies within it a story of wireless romance more fascinating than any that has ever been talked about within the knowledge of man. The statement which he has just given to us in matter-of-fact terms of the possibility of our being able by wireless telephony to communicate with the utmost ends of the earth, coincident with the development of wireless telegraphy, opens up visions which the imagination fails to comprehend.<\/p><p>I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his tribute to the staff, and particularly that section of the staff which he mentioned in connection with the general strike, especially as it does something to counter the mischievous and false\ninnuendoes and suggestion made by certain hon. Members in this House with regard to the work of the staff and the cooperation of the large union mostly concerned with them, which did co-operate very closely with the right hon. Gentleman's Department and the officials during that particular period. Whilst paying that tribute, the right hon. Gentleman went on to express a doubt as to what the staff might think of him. Up to now the report is quite a good one. There is no objection, and there can be no objection, to the fact that when the wage claim was lodged with the Arbitration Court, the right hon. Gentleman, on behalf of the Government, took the unusual step of lodging a counter-claim. If the case presented has to fear any counter-claim, then, of course, we cannot feel on very sure ground with regard to the case. Although there may have been some demur, it was only on account of the unusual course that was taken by the right hon. Gentleman, and not from any feeling of animus against him for taking that step.<\/p><p>My task will be a great deal easier this year, because many of the grievances that are usually raised on this annual occasion are <i>sub judice.<\/i> I shall not therefore trouble the Committee with them. I would hasten to say that through the spread of the co-operative spirit which has taken place between the Union of Post Office Workers and the Post Office administration during past years the need for venting grievances in this House has been progressively less. We have not had to trouble the House with purely domestic affairs, because we have been able to settle them through the machinery which has been devised between the Union itself and the Post Office. I demur from one remark which the Postmaster-General made, that he did not think it was his business to do anything to stimulate a demand with regard to the cash-on-delivery system. Surely, he has to look at the matter on business lines, just in the same way as the development of the telephone. It is as much his duty to endeavour to increase the usefulness and work of his Department on that side as it is to look after the rapidly developing telephone side. The right hon. Gentleman is entitled to much credit for the businesslike way in which he has developed the telephone side and\nbrought it increasingly before the notice of the public. He has taken a long, businesslike view in spending money well ahead, and if for the time being it may seem unremunerative it is bound to be remunerative later, because he will be in a better position to meet increase of traffic along that particular line.<\/p><p>I was interested to notice that the Postmaster-General has joined the ranks of those statisticians who delight in telling us how many pennies it would take, placed side by side, to reach to the end of the earth. The right hon. Gentleman did not illustrate his point by pennies, but he spoke of the number of packets which would be required to reach from the earth to the sun, and how many would be likely to be left over after the long line of packets had made the journey. Although he has taken this fresh method of illustrating his point, the wonderful figures which he has given us have left us to some extent unable to grasp all that was meant in that respect. I shall not trouble the Committee with matters of detail so far as staff grievances are concerned. As far as the Post Office is concerned, I would appeal to the right hon. Gentleman for a wider development of the Post Office service. It always gives me great delight when someone of the political persuasion of the Postmaster-General stands up, and has to give us such a very fine report of a purely Socialistic experiment in business which is being carried on so efficiently under a confirmed individualist such as the Postmaster-General.<\/p><p>I suggest that a line of development, which might he adopted without involving any fresh legislation, would be to explore the possibilities of the Post Office Savings Bank. I called the attention of the right hon. Gentleman to that matter in a question a few days ago. The Government and the country need as much money as they can get at a cheap rate, and it would be well to encourage among the bulk of the population the habit of thrift. The Post Office Savings Bank is one of the best avenues for promoting thrift. Quite recently there were proposals before the London County Council for the establishment of a municipal savings bank. The County Council considered the very excellent example of Birmingham in regard to the\nestablishment of a municipal savings bank. They considered other experiments which have been made in this and other countries, but the County Council and the Finance Committee came to the conclusion, after examining the question in all its details, that the need would be met in the Post Office Savings Bank if the Post Office Savings Bank would relax one or two of the regulations now operating.<\/p><p>They suggested that the National Savings Committee could do a good deal in the way of publicity in regard to the opportunities offered by the Post Office Savings Bank for the development of thrift among people of small means. They went on to suggest that the Post Office should give further facilities by abolishing the limitations, to which I called attention some years ago, which are imposed by insisting that people can only pay in a complete shilling. To people of small means that is a difficulty, although it may not seem so to hon. Members who are not accustomed to dealing with 'these small matters. It is a considerable difficulty from the point of view of poor people who may not have a shilling, but who would be prepared to put a few coppers into the Post Office. In the aggregate, that would turn out to be a considerable amount of money, as has been shown by the experience of the Penny Savings Bank, which collapsed with disastrous results to many poor people, and similar organisations. These institutions meet a need which the Post Office has not yet met. I suggest that the Postmaster-General might very well explore the suggestion made by the London County Council in their resolution:\n<q> That the Council is of opinion that with a view to providing additional facilities for encouraging thrift it is desirable that the scheme of the Post Office Savings Bank should be improved so as to provide as regards deposits and withdrawals facilities similar to those provided by the Birmingham Municipal Bank, and that greater publicity should be given to the facilities offered.<\/q>\nThere are two points to be made in that connection. One is, that people should be allowed to put in deposits of less than 1s., and that they should be able to withdraw without notice a larger sum than they are able to do at the present time. I know some of the difficulties from the inside. One of the difficulties will be\nthe amount of book-keeping which will be involved and greater expense, and there will be, possibly, the danger of mistakes in paying out. Those are difficulties which every bank has to face, but they could be got over by administration. I hope the Postmaster-General will take the lead which has been given to him by our largest municipality, and explore the matter not only with a view to offering better facilities for depositors in the Post Office Savings Bank, but of getting the use of money at a comparatively low rate of interest. After all, the poor people are not so much concerned with the actual amount of interest as they are with the security which is afforded and have some little return for the money placed on deposit.<\/p><p>I want to refer again to the question of what is known as the postal cheque system. I have already brought it to the attention of the Postmaster-General in discussions in this House and in correspondence have put it before the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The postal cheque system, in a word, provides that people of small means shall be able to use a cheque book, appropriately devised, in the same way as people who have large deposits in joint stock banks. It is not a new proposal because it has been adopted by almost every Continental country. Having regard to some of the criticisms and objections by the Postmaster-General, and also by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I sent a questionnaire to all the European countries asking for information with regard to the business carried on in this direction. If the Committee will pardon me I will give hon. Members the reply which the Chancellor of the Exchequer sent to me in September of last year. It is to this effect:\n<q> As I promised, I have now looked into the question of postal cheques. I find that the Post Office have investigated this system on several occasions from 1908 onwards, but have never felt able to recommend its adoption. It is true that certain Continental countries have made a success of it. This is partly due to the fact that they run their post offices on cheaper lines than we do and can afford to fix fees for such business on a scale which in our case would result in a heavy loss. But the main reason is that their banking systems are relatively undeveloped and the postal cheque system has the field more or less to itself. In this country where banking facilities are so widely spread and highly developed it is only the smaller and less remunerative\naccounts which would come to the Post Office. I am advised, therefore, that it would be impossible for us to adopt the system without serious financial loss.<\/q>\nI feel sure that the real objection comes from the joint stock banks, who are opposed to any development of State banking as represented by the Post Office. The fact remains, however, that the Postmaster-General is the largest banker in this country and does a business which is much larger than that of any joint stock bank. In spite of it having been turned down in former years&#8212;that is always the fate of a new proposal&#8212;I suggest that the right hon. Gentleman, with his independence and business capacity, should jump at this sort of proposal and adopt it. It affords great opportunities for much business. It has been adopted by most of the other countries in Europe. When asking them for a return in connection with this postal cheque system, I put this question to them: \" Is the banking system as highly developed in your country as in England?\" That is the real objection of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In their reply several countries say that it is not, but one or two, which are commercially more nearly akin to Great Britain, particularly France, claim that their banking system is superior to ours. I am not in a position to contradict them; I do not profess to be an expert on this matter. Belgium and Germany consider that their banking system is on an equality with the banking system in this country, and from the replies I have received it is clear that the amount of business done is simply stupendous. The figures beat even the figures which the Postmaster-General has put before the Committee this afternoon. They, of course, refer to marks and francs, not to pounds sterling. In the case of Germany, the whole of the business they dealt with in connection with the postal cheque system amounted in the aggregate to the extraordinary figure of 78,501,341,000 marks in the year 1925, and in Belgium it amounted in the aggregate to 36,320,244,000 francs. Those are figures which we can quote but cannot fully grasp. They indicate a tremendous amount of business which, if it is found to be profitable in other countries, the Postmaster-General might explore in order to see whether it is not worth while adopting in this country.<\/p><p>Let me turn to another subject, namely, the sale of the Abu Zabal Wireless Station in Egypt. This station has been run by the British Post Office, but it has not paid. It has been run at a loss. Latterly it has been re-equipped and a certain amount of money, about &#163;10,000, has been spent on technical equipment and additional accommodation for the staff. Altogether a considerable amount of money has been added to the capital expenditure originally involved. I am informed that a sum of &#163;120,000 has been paid by the Marconi Wireless Company for this station, at a moment when it seems that there might be a revival of business and the station made a business proposition. Having regard to the fact that the Post Office is able to conduct its work with so much success it is curious that it is unable to make a success of this wireless station, which it is proposed to hand over to the Marconi Wireless Company who are prepared to run it. There must be a little more behind this. The reputation of the Marconi Company in regard to Imperial wireless is not altogether above suspicion. They have more than once queered the pitch with regard to the development of Imperial wireless, and when the Imperial Economic Conference have approved the development of Imperial wrieless, the Marconi Company have put sand in the machine and delayed it. Now they appear in this transaction, and it would be interesting if the Postmaster-General can inform the Committee of the real reasons why the Government arc selling this wireless station to a private British concern. It has been technically improved and new buildings for the staff and plant erected, and I should like to know whether this was done preparatory to disposing of it to another company.<\/p><p>The Marconi Wireless Company are, I understand, our competitors in other fields. We work Italy from London. Is there any proposal to make concessions to the Marconi Company to work route traffic for this country through Abu Kabal? This is an important matter. This particular station transmits to Rhodesia, Iraq, Hong Kong and Singapore, and it shows possibilities of great commercial development. If a concern like the Marconi Company buy this station, it shows that they must have some knowledge of the potentialities of\nthe station and that there is a possibility of producing a revenue. The Donald Committee, I know, recommended that the station should be disposed of when the Admiralty requirements had been satisfied. Have those requirements been satisfied? I hope the noble Lord, the Assistant Postmaster-General will be able to give us full information with regard to this case when he replies, because it is a matter of public importance. It is the disposal of public property and services to a private concern without Parliament knowing all the facts in reference to the case.<\/p><p>I want now to deal with a purely personal matter concerning an officer who was lately chief engineer on His Majesty's cable ship \" Monarch.\" In 1915 the \" Monarch \" was torpedoed and sank- off Dover, and as a result this officer suffered considerably in health and from a nervous breakdown. He was placed off duty, and received a pension under the Injuries in War Act. He received certificates. from the Post Office medical officers, four in number, and in addition certificates from private practitioners, including one of the most eminent nerve specialists of Harley Street, Dr. Schofield, to the effect that he was suffering from shock due to the torpedoeing of the \" Monarch.\" This officer has been retired earlier than his full service life on a reduced pension and without any allowance whatever for the injuries received by the torpedoeing of the \" Monarch.\" The reply of the Post Office has been that the Department does not recognise the complaint which has brought about his retirement as in any way due to the injury received while he was on the \" Monarch.\" That, curiously enough, is in direct conflict with the highest medical opinion. and Dr. Schofield, the physician of Harley Street, wrote and objected to the Post Office sending this man back to work on the \" Monarch \" on the ground that it was quite contrary to his own orders. He said:\n<q> I saw and carefully examined Mr. R. Allen at 10, Harley Street, on 22nd March, 1919, and gave him a certificate <i>(Copy sent),<\/i> and now learn with intense surprise. that it was utterly ignored. I have been constantly consulted by all grades in both Services, and this is the only instance of such action. The consequences have been disastrous, and I have certificates from Drs. Hunter and Davis proving this, and find\nthat my patient at 47 is now an invalid from service causes only.<\/q><\/p>",

I have heard rumours to this effect: Is he or is he not being advised to put such stringent conditions upon the contract for the dispoa1 of Pembroke Dockyard as to make it very difficult for those who are considering the acquisition of this dockyard to make out a satisfactory contract with the Admiralty? I would suggest to him that they might be able to make this contract very flexible, because the Admiralty has full power to take over anything during a time of war, and it is of very little use, if the right hon. Gentleman is wishing to dispose of a dockyard, to tie it up with conditions which the commercial interests are not able to carry out.<\/p><p>The main reason why I rose was to put a more serious matter, not only to the First Lord, but also to the hon. Member who is at present leading the Opposition, to see whether or not it is possible for both the Labour party and the present Government to co-operate in a policy which would secure a certain amount of economy in the near future. The present position in regard to Singapore is that the proposal originally made, and for which the various Dominions and Dominion Governments made offers, has altered, and at the present moment the whole policy is only settled and arranged for a matter of two years. I would like to remind the House of the present position and to give the financial figures. Hong Kong gave &#163;250,000, and the Malay States &#163;180,000 and land. That amount was given for the big scheme. Australia offered &#163;1,000,000, but has since withdrawn its offer. New Zealand, I think, offered &#163;250,000, but has since spent that\nmoney upon a new cruiser. Therefore, as far as the general policy is concerned, nothing has been done to reintroduce the ten-year or big programme by the present Government, because apart from that, as hon. Members will remember, the scheme as originally proposed was altered when the Labour Government were in power. Therefore, if we are going to get continuity of policy, it is very desirable for the two parties to come to some agreement before the Imperial Conference meets in October of this year. The Dominion Prime Ministers will be coming over in October, and they will require to go into many questions of national defence, and, obviously, they must, go into the naval question which concerns them perhaps more than either the aerial question or the military question. On this point another consideration arises, and one also brought about by what happened when the Labour Government were in power.<\/p>",

The Australian Naval Estimates for 1925&#8211;26 are &#163;2,421,000, and, in addition, they are providing in that year &#163;1,500,000 towards the construction of two new cruisers and two new submarines. The New Zealand Navy Estimates and charges for naval purposes amounted to over &#163;500,000; Canada's &#163;280,000, and South Africa's &#163;140,000. While saying we are very grateful to those who have been generously making contributions, we might also say that we would be very glad if in some directions these contributions could be increased. There is only one other figure I want to give to the House with regard to present-day expenditure. The figure of &#163;58,100,000, which I have given as the Estimate for this year, would, if stated in pre-War value of money, only amount to &#163;34,712,000, and that will compare with an expenditure of &#163;51,000,000 in the year 1914, so that, judged by pre-War values, the expenditure of the present day on the Navy cannot be regarded as extravagant.<\/p>",

I think that to-day we are reaping in China exactly what we sowed. I have read a book which I daresay other hon. Gentlemen have read, written by an American who stayed in China for some time. It is entitled, \"Why China sees red,\" and the reasons he gives are very largely the reasons which I have given, though he mentioned many more which I have not time to specify.<\/p><p>No forcible means can save a nation or maintain what is wrong. It is because I hold that belief that I am against this Vote. China is a case in point. Right hon. and hon. Gentlemen have shouted because I quoted China. Let us take something much more modern. There are those present who will remember the time of which we have been reminded by the memoirs of the late Queen Victoria. I refer to the Russians and Constantinople. I remember sitting up in the\nPublic Gallery of this House and hearing the most famous of the speeches made by Mr. Gladstone and others during that controversy. At that time we were being urged to fight in order to keep the Russians out of Constantinople. We fought the Crimean War for exactly the same reasons.<\/p><p>My hon. Friend the Member for Peck-ham (Mr. Dalton) called attention a few minutes ago to the Anzacs and others who lost their lives in Gallipoli. I suppose the House knows that we fought that fight in the hope that we should capture Constantinople and be able to hand it over to Russia, in fulfilment of a pledge to the late Czar that he should have Constantinople. I have had the advantage of having read the memoirs written by Sir George Buchanan, by the late French Ambassador at Leningrad, and by Signor Nitti, the Italian statesman. No one will deny that in 1856 and 1876 this country fought in order to keep Russia out of Constantinople. The men whose graves are all along the Crimea died for that purpose, but those who died in the last War fought to put Russia into Constantinople.<\/p><p>When I am told that the British Navy is necessary for British interests, I want to know what British interests really mean and of what they really consist. I desire, in conclusion&#8212;[HON. MEMBERS: \"Hear, hear!\"] I am not concluding because of anything hon. Members opposite have said. I am against enlistment in the Army and the Navy and the Naval Air Force because, as I see it, men are conscripted by hunger. They are not free volunteers. The great bulk of the men who join, according to the figures given from the Front Bench opposite, are unemployed. They are conscripted by unemployment; but, even so, those men when they enlist, and go out in the ships, do so, not for their own interests, but for the interests of and in support of capitalistic exploitation in every quarter of the world.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>When you speak of replacing, I trust that before very long the Admiralty will be able to find some ship to replace the \"Effingham.\" To send a ship like that to the East Indies is a waste of money, a waste of good material, and a waste of men, who cannot be replaced, and it sends a very unpleasant and unhappy feeling right through the service. Instead of building as fast as we built the \"Dreadnought\"\nor as slowly as we built the \"Effingham,\" I would very much rather accelerate the building of those ships that are now laid down, and I will tell the Committee the reason why. I would do it to try out their speed, their worth, and their style. I was reading a book in the Library yesterday by a very well-known admiral, and he tells us how he went to sea with a fleet of eight battleships, all of one particular class, and that when they got in a sea-way and in rough water the report to the Admiralty was that they were absolutely unfit to fight except the water was as smooth as a mill pond. Those eight ships were absolutely wasted. Fortunately for us, the War did not come while we were relying on them, and therefore, I say: Let us take those ships that are now building, and let us send them to sea to find out what work they can do, and how they do it, before we build more to take their place, because if they are failures, those we build afterwards like them will also be failures.<\/p><p>That applies also, and very much so, to the \"B\" cruisers, the 8,000-ton cruisers, instead of the 10,000-ton cruisers. If you build an 8,000-tonner, you may be sure you have to sacrifice something. You must sacrifice speed, or guns, or armour, and probably all three. In 1812, since which, happily, we have not had any trouble with the United States of America, we sent frigates to sea, and so did the United States, but what they called frigates were entirely different from what we called frigates. They were the 10,000-ton frigates against our 8,000-ton frigates, and it astonished the people of this country very much to find that our smaller frigates were being sunk by the American larger frigates, which happened whenever their big frigates attacked our email frigates. When we met on even terms, like the \"Shannon\" and the \"Chesapeake,\" we kept the balance even. The same thing happened at Zanzibar during the last War, where we had an old ship called the \"Pegasus.\" There she was; she could not run away, and she could not fight, and a German cruiser came, and at long distance killed 25 of her men, and holed her, and she had to be run ashore to prevent herself sinking. It was our own fault, first, because we left an old ship where she ought never to have\nbeen left, and, secondly, because we did not try out our ships sufficiently before we built them in numbers. Again, there was a scandal during the late War, when the \"Goeben\" escaped from Admiral Troubridge. Admiral Troubridge had three cruisers with him. We know now that if he had attacked the \"Goeben,\" he would very likely have had his three cruisers sunk, because the \"Goeben\" was faster, and she carried 11-inch guns, while he carried nothing but the old 9.2-inch guns.<\/p><p>We have been asked over and over again who is the enemy. I should say this: Do not build against anyone, but build for our security and for our freedom, but if you want enemies, you can have France if you like, you can have China if you like, you can have Japan if you like, and you can have the United States. I said just now we were not likely to quarrel with France, but at present we are the third only in strength in the Pacific, and I see that Hong Kong is asking for another regiment to assist them there. Is it realised that we could not land a single soldier in Hong Kong if Japan said \"No\"? That is a fact. Japan is our political friend, at the moment at any rate, and the United States is also our political friend, but that is only so long as our interests do not clash. When those clash, political friends very quickly become political enemies. There are many Members in this House who will remember that from 1910 to 1914 we were told that Germany wa6 not possibly visualising England, that she could not bring herself to fight England, and that she was building her fleets, it was said by some, to amuse the Kaiser. We know better know. We know the luck we had in not being caught entirely unprepared. We know now that we were inferior, as has been said again and again in this House, in every single department except that of officers and of men. In these, fortunately for us, we were supreme, or, as I have said, and as my right hon. Friend the Member for Carnarvon Boroughs did me the honour of saying what I said some time back, that we were supreme, but he thought that if we could have put the English sailors into the German Fleet and the German sailors into the English Fleet, the result might have been very different.<\/p><p>Against whom are we building? Let us take the words of the right hon. Member the ex-Secretary of State for the Colonies.\nWhat did he say the other day? He said \"I use my common sense when I am talking of building against another country.\" Let us use our common sense. Have we a single friend in the world? If we have, I say frankly that I do not know him. Have we any land, have we any island, have we any coaling station, that other nations do not covet? Are we sure of the United States friendship? We know that during 1915 Admiral Benson, writing to Admiral Sims of us, said: \"Do not let them pull the wool over your eyes,\" and \"I would as lief fight the one as the other.\" That was the American Admiral Benson's view of the difference between England and Germany. Are we even first in the Atlantic? I doubt it. Have we nothing the great nation on the other side might covet&#8212;may covet&#8212;from Jamaica to Bermuda, to the Bahamas, to Newfoundland, to Canada herself? Is there nobody coveting even the little Falkland Islands? You know they do. Do you think nobody covets Australia, that great land with less people than there are in this city of ours? Would no nation like to annex New Zealand? Of course they would. What prevents them? What prevents them from sending their overflow population to these countries? The British Fleet, and the British Fleet only!<\/p><p>The time is short, and this is but a breathing space; therefore, let us put our house in order. Let us put our dockyards in order. They need it. Portsmouth is the headquarters of the Fleet. The premier dockyard requires a good deal of money spending upon it. Portsmouth needs making what it ought to be. We ought to provide a slip there oft which we can build a big ship if we want to do so. We have at present only one slip, and it will only take a small ship. There is no dock on the south coast which can take one of our big battleships&#8212;not one! Let us make the senior service the great service, the one in which I believe the whole future of this country depends. Let us make it a happy and a contented service. Let us have no more \"Effinghams.\" Let the men be at home in their ships, contented and comfortable&#8212;the man as well as the officer. Let us get a return for the money that the nation spends on the Navy. Let us not forget even now&#8212;and this is the opinion of almost every man who takes the trouble to visualise the Navy&#8212;that the\nRoyal Navy is not merely our sure shield&#8212;it is the bed-rock&#8212;for the safety, security, and freedom of this country.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>That all goes to emphasise what I am saying. I am very glad to have those interruptions while we are discussing the one-Power standard. The two-Power standard is evidently being aimed at by certain Members. There were other points, some of which were touched on by the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Ramsay MacDonald) with special reference to Singapore. That does have a very distinct bearing on the matter under discussion, and, as was pointed out in a Debate in another place a few days ago, the Government have not yet made up their minds what it is going to do with regard to that. That is surely another point on which we should receive information. May I ask: Is there going to be a floating dock as well as a graving dock at Singapore, and what amount is the nation to be committed to with regard to expendi-\nture? We have had a suggestion that it is going to cost &#163;10,000,000, but we know that is quite an under-statement as to the ultimate cost. You have to consider barracks, hospitals, coast defence arrangements, and defence against aerial attacks, which mean that three times &#163;10,000,000 will not cover the expenditure if we are going to develop along those lines. The Committee is entitled at this stage to know how far we are going, and if the nation is to be asked to enter into it blind-folded.<\/p><p>I venture with great diffidence to approach this from another point of view, a point which has only been tentatively touched upon in other Debates. We are told it is necessary that we must have this dock there to protect our trade routes in case of hostilities with other Powers. I will not touch on the threat this holds out to our former ally Japan.<\/p><p>There is not much in the argument from the strategical point of view of the protection of our trade routes. Surely it docs follow with the outbreak of war all trade North of Hong Kong will automatically cease. Dominion trade, that is between Australia and New Zealand, does not for the most part pass through the Straits of Singapore, and could be diverted to a more Southerly route. We have to remember that eight weeks will elapse before the Fleet will get out to Singapore, and another three or four weeks before it will be able to go into the open sea, and by that time three months serious happenings will have ensued. Undoubtedly the first step of any hostile power would be an attempt to seize this base. Is there anything in the suggestion that it is a means of protecting Australia and New Zealand? We are told it is 3,000 miles from Japan, and we have a right to retort that, equally, it is 3.000 miles from Japan to Singapore. But it is also 5.000 miles from Sydney and 3,000 miles from Thursday Island, the nearest point on the Australian coast. There cannot be any substance in the proposal that this is being done as a means of protecting our Dominions in that direction. It has to be borne in mind that there is a strong division of opinion in our Dominions on this base, and one who may be the next Prime Minister of the Commonwealth has expressed very distinctly the view that\nthey are not prepared to support this project in any particular.<\/p><p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Spen Volley (Sir J. Simon) a little while ago said that what mattered was the habit of thought which one got into, and some sections of the Committee apparently have not learned anything from the War, and are still thinking in terms of War mentality instead of seeing that we are in an entirely different world. At this moment we cannot afford great expenditure on armaments, and if ever there was a time when we should go slow, this is the moment, and we should certainly take steps to foster the peace spirit throughout the world. What has been the greatest assurance of peace between this country and the United States? There has been no greater assurance of that than the 3,000 miles of frontier between Canada and the United States on which there is not a single sentry or a single gun, and if one were placed there you would have the potentialities of war at any time. With regard to the value of Singapore from a strategic point of view, in the short time I was at the Admiralty, I formed the opinion, which has been reinforced since, that there is a considerable difference of opinion among experts as to the future and value of the capital ship. Each rival school disputes the prestige and the authority of the other. A joint paper was read in June of last year before the Institute of Naval Architects by Captain Munro, of the Royal Navy, and a civilian member, in which they had under review proposals with regard to Singapore. They foretold that the days of the capital ship were numbered, and that what we would need in the future was a mobile base, rather than a fixed shore base. In their paper they stated\n<q>In the light of the facts set forth in this Paper, should we not ask ourselves if we as a nation, would be doing the right thing if we were to instal at Singapore or elsewhere a permanent base on shore with an excavated dry dock that would take years to complete and cost a large sum of money, a great proportion of which would be spent abroad. Should we not rather provide at vastly less cost, the whole of which would be spent in British labour, a floating base, fully equipped, which in time of war or threat of war, could be readily transferred to whatever port or base the General Staff might deem best for carrying out its duties.<\/q>\nI do not profess to be able to judge between experts, but it is fair to point out that there is this difference of opinion as to the value of the base, and at a time when every &#163;l matters, we have no right to pour out money for something which may in a few years prove obsolete. I hope we shall have a full statement as to how far the Government intend to go, what is the scheme, and whether they have decided that there is to be both a graving dock and a floating dock at Singapore.<\/p><p>There are one or two direct and specific suggestions I desire to make, which the First Lord may or may not think of value, with reference to the possibility of effecting economies without impairing the efficiency or strength of the Navy. The right hon. Gentleman is probably aware that the late Government had a small Committee consisting of the First Lord, the Parliamentary Secretary, and the Permanent Secretary, who were to overhaul the whole civil establishment, with a view to making reductions. They were impressed with the fact that it would be possible to make a large reduction in number of staff which had become considerably inflated. That work was interrupted, and I should like to know whether it is now being continued, and what possibility there is of reductions being made along these lines. The Estimates for the Navy are between &#163;60,000,000 and &#163;70,000,000, or more than half the total of &#163;120,000,000 which this country votes for armaments, and one weakness in this connection since the War has been the practice of overbudgetting at the Admiralty. In the review of accounts for 1923&#8211;24, we find the total surplus to be surrendered amounted to nearly &#163;4,000,000, which means that people were overtaxed to that extent for the Navy. Attempts were made by the last Government to cut down that surplus. Of recent years the surplus has varied from 5 per cent. to 11 per cent. of the Estimates. That is very high, especially when we have regard to the fact that the surrender in pre-War years amounted to only 1.5 per cent. There should be closer budgetting in this respect, and one would like to know what steps, if any, have been taken in regard to this matter. We are now getting back to proper estimating, but in 1924&#8211;25 the overhead cut then made was &#163;3,000,000\non the assumption that there would be a surplus. With that overhead cut made on the Estimates, it was unnecessary to come to the House for a Supplementary Estimate, except for the Sutton judgment, which could not have been foreseen, and which was extraneous to ordinary Admiralty expenditure. I have been informed by those in touch with these accounts that we could make a further cut of &#163;1,000,000 or &#163;2,000,000 on the overhead charges, which is a suggestion worth going into, and one which should commend itself to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.<\/p><p>Referring further to the subject of economy, I suggest that it is now time that all the War remanets were cleared up. During the War, the Admiralty advanced considerable sums to naval contractors for supplies, the erection of buildings, and so forth. Settlements have been effected on a large scale, but there are still some important items outstanding. What is the position in regard to this matter? Is every effort being made to get the best settlements in the interests of the taxpayer? One would also be glad to know definitely if it is the case that we have advanced a considerable step with regard to control over naval expenditure. I understand that the Permanent Secretary to the Admiralty is now to be the Accounting Officer, and is to appear before the Public Accounts Committee, and other authorities. This of course, means that the House of Commons will be able to get as near as possible to a policy in matters of importance, and exercise a more direct control than has been exercised in days gone by. There are some other questions which I desire to ask the right hon. Gentleman. What is the position between the Government and the United States naval authorities regarding the exchange of petrol effected during the War? What is the aggregate amount of money involved, and what is the amount obtained by Great Britain. One would also like a statement on coal and oil fuel, and the financial effects of the use of oil, and perhaps the Minister will make a statement regarding the policy of working down surplus stocks, the object being to reduce immediate expenditure. Will he also explain the position in reference to the deterioration or diminution of stores left over from the War. All these\nmatters have remained with us since the War, although that period is now so far removed, and it is not necessary to emphasise the effect which they have on the expenditure of the nation and the importance of having them cleared up satisfactorily.<\/p><p>May I emphasise the point raised by the hon. Member for West Islington (Mr. Montague). I know nothing about the matter to which he made special reference, but it is a subject of first-class importance, and it is likely to give rise to much misunderstanding and great disturbance of mind among the industrial population, particularly at a time when people are touchy and anything is likely to happen. I hope, therefore, we shall have a definite statement as to the allegation that the Navy is to be called upon to act in the interests of one side in a dispute. I hesitate to think that such is the case. But a statement from the right hon. Gentleman made with authority contradicting it would very much ease the situation. I hope if the First Lord will heed not so much the criticism from the Opposition he will have regard to the criticism from his own benches, and the suggestion that this is the particular moment when we can stay our expenditure with regard to armaments. Our cruiser outlay is largely experimental, and I see that already criticirms are being made with regard to a ship recently launched. [HON. MEMBERS: \"No!\"] Surely all the indications point to the fact that there is no need to go in for large scale expenditure on armaments at the present time, and that we can make the necessary experiments on a smaller scale. The money which we would save in this respect is much more needed for social legislation, and meantime, by the use of the machinery of the League of Nations we might do much to render unnecessary in the days to come any increase in our armaments.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I suggest that the unemployment in Dundee increases and that reductions of wages are going on day by day, while British capital and the British jute trade have left these shores, and will leave it in a larger degree. A hundred bills of co-partner-ship between the employers and employ&#233;s in Dundee will not improve that position. The only thing that will improve that position is international Communism. The only thing that will improve that position is that the Bengali worker in the jute industry in Bengal shall have the identical conditions given to him as the Scottish worker in Scotland. Then the owners and controllers of capital will not run away from their own country and squat in other peoples' land.<\/p><p>I would go further, and I would insist upon carrying out in practice what is piously put forward in the first sentence of this Bill, that there should be no opposition between Capital and Labour. I would achieve that by removing those individuals who are not labour, who are\nnot workers, but who presume to own and control capital. [HON. MEMBERS: \"How would you do it?\"] Hon. Members ask me how I would do it. I would advise them to go from this House a short distance and consult the trade union leaders from Russia, and they will tell them. [<i>Laughter.<\/i>] I expected that that suggestion would cause laughter among those who are accustomed to prosper on the work of other people, but the trade union worker in this country is beginning to see the limits of liberty, freedom and happiness that have been won by the trade union workers in Russia.<\/p><p>British trade is suffering at present for the simple reason that individual controllers of capital and individual owners of places of industry are so anxious about their profits that they prefer to close down places of work and send men and women into the streets to starve or to do what they like. The Co-partnership Bill is not going to help a crowd of unemployed men or women. From whom are they to obtain the co-partnership profits? The only remedy is to get hold of those individual controllers of factories and places of work, who are a failure by their own admission, and to let the State do the job which they can no longer carry on without starving men and women. We are told that in this Bill methods are put forward of dividing the profits. We are told that the masters are going to be magnanimous in dividing the profits&#8212;at present they have started doing so&#8212;at the rate of 6d. per working day, and because they are going to be magnanimous in dividing the profits they want a remission of 25 per cent. Income Tax. They want to take 8d. a day from the State and magnanimously give up 6d. to the workers. The other 2d. will, of course, be a matter of safeguard.<\/p><p>There is to be co-partnership, but it is to be a very limited co-partnership. Labour is not going to decide the remuneration of the directors, the brokerage of the brokers, the commissions of the nephews, cousins and sisters of the directors. The workers are only going to sit down in silence as co-partners in an industry and accept what margin is shown to them as the margin to be divided, and then they are to divide it according to law and order. There is to be no control by the workers in preventing the mineowners of this country from\nopening mines in South Africa, India and Southern China and producing coal there by slave labour at 5s. per ton, and then the miner is to be told that because it is possible to produce coal at the pit's mouth at 5s. per ton, somewhere else in the world, we cannot afford to produce coal here at more than so many shillings per ton. There is to be this limitation upon the worker, and with it on his back he is to have all the freedom and partnership with his master, and to have a share of the profits that can be collected with these limitations resting upon them.<\/p><p>It appears to me, without labouring the point further, that the real cause of the suffering of the working classes of this country, or any other country, is the control of capital by irresponsible individuals. I want to be perfectly clear. There is a lot of talk about good will between brain and hand. I think that the hon. Member's observation was very imperfect. It is a, cruel argument and a misleading argument to say that there are some people who work by brain and some people who work by hand. There is no worker who works by hand alone without work-mg with his brain at the same time. No engine driver, driving his mail train at the rate of 50 or 60 miles an hour in a blizzard, is working merely with his hands. No spinner, no weaver, no smelter, to miner, no carpenter, no bricklayer, no stonemason can do his work correctly if he does not use his brain just as much as the Lord Chancellor and the judges and lawyers and architects and chemists. Each individual worker works by his brain as well as by his hand, while a few lucky ones sit in easy-chairs and pretend to work by brain and refuse to work by hand. [HON. MEMBERS \"Like yourself !\"] Like myself. I do not claim to be an angel on earth. I claim to be full of all those vices, all those defects, all those drawbacks which the present hideous individual capitalist system imposes upon me. The only difference between me and hon. Members opposite is that I am willing to get out of it at the first possible moment, and that right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite are refusing to get out of the iniquitous position. In every industry there are workers by brain and there are other workers who work by brain and hand at the same time. We are not talking of\nthe actual workers by brain inside each industry. Their right place is in trade unionism and not in co-partnership; their right place is in the workers' organisation and not in the Federation of British Industries. We are not talking of those actual directors of industry, expert chemists or engineers.<\/p><p>A reference was made to-day to the speech of the Prime Minister four weeks ago, when we were debating the trade union levy. I was personally sorry that our prosaic and matter of fact Prime Minister has also now found it necessary to resort to the poetical idealism of Carnarvon and Aberavon. The one thing that the Prime Minister did make clear to us was the established change that has taken place in this country in the relations between masters and men, even since the days of his youth. The patriarchal relationships have gone and a stiff relation of class interests has come to stay. It is not a quarrel between brain workers and hand workers. Workers are all workers. We admit them all as equal, and we say that the brain workers and the hand workers combined should be the sole controllers of capital, as well as of the products of capital and of the profits. That is our point. There are happy families living in Wales or Scotland or England who are to-day, merely as shareholders, sitting at home and enjoying large incomes from the hard work that some Chinaman is carrying on in the Hong Kong Docks, or some Zulu or Bantu is doing in the mines of South Africa, or some Hindoo or Mahomedan is doing in the jute mills or the cotton mills of India. We say that the shareholders who sit here and pocket all the profits out of these industries are neither brain workers, nor hand workers, and we are out to remove that class once and for ever. The Bill points to the evil of the opposition which exists between capital and labour, but at the same time it wishes, not only to perpetuate the existence of that evil, but even to strengthen that opposition between capital and labour by the arbitrary control of capital. The real controller of capital, the real owner of capital, is labour, and the right place for every man and woman within the circle of labour, is in his or her trade organisation, and not in the Federation of British Industries or in the chambers of commerce.<\/p><p>It was quite obvious that the Mover, and particularly the Seconder, felt that the Bill was not needed. Do these hon. Members really wish to tell this House that they are yearning to give the workers a little more, but that in order to do so they must have the assent of the House to a Co-partnership Bill. Let them get on with the job and do it. This Bill is not wanted, as far as the poor workers' interests are concerned, but it is wanted by others, because surreptiously it is another means of deceiving the worker and the consumer. The worker can obtain a higher share in the product of his toil without any such Bill. If he is wise enough he will obtain the full 100 per cent. by his trade union organisation fighting for him like the very devil. I suggest this Bill is wanted because it is another surreptitious move to get 25 per cent. remission of Income Tax and a preferential right to Government contracts. That is what the Bill is wanted for. We are not told what <i>quid pro quo<\/i> is expected from the worker, but he will be told to take his reduced wages, and if he can increase output and rival the concerns which are running on slave labour in other parts of the Empire, then he will have his share. We were told when the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a previous Conservative Government reduced the Income Tax that industries were going to be revived, unemployment was to be diminished and British trade was to be set upon its feet. Nothing of the sort happened. The workers were given notices of reduction more frequently after the Income Tax concession than before it, the number of unemployed increased, and there is always the doubtful song as to British trade not reviving again. Here we find another plea for the reduction of Income Tax put forward, this time in the name of the workers, along with a plea for the right to Government contracts, which contradicts the whole spirit of the Bill.<\/p><p>The Bill claims that the present system increases the cost of production and the price of commodities and it suggests that when co-partnership is adopted we are to expect a reduction in the cost of production and in prices. If that is going to happen, if the Mover and Seconder and supporters of the Bill believe that they are speaking the truth, they must know\nthat those firms which join the co-partnership scheme will produce their goods at a cheaper cost, and they will naturally stand to gain Government contracts by the ordinary law of competition through their cheaper cost. They say in the Bill that when it is passed the cost will be cheaper, but in their hearts they believe the cost will be higher, and they will demand Government contracts by legislative right when they cannot obtain them by the law of competition and cheaper cost. If they believe that by this scheme the cost will be cheaper, they must be confident that every contract will belong to those firms which are in the co-partnership scheme, and that no contract will go to a firm which is not in it.<\/p><p>I find it impossible to move what is called a reasoned Amendment against the Second Reading of this Bill. The Bill is a conglomeration of unreason. The Mover said there are trade union leaders who like this system of co-partnership. It is not for me to explain the inner mind of the trade union leaders. Perhaps they are misunderstood, and when they mean co-operation between the superior staff inside a place of industry and the inferior staff, as we now know them, they do not really mean to support co-partnership, but even if they do, that is not my business. My duty in this House is quite clear, and it is not to think in terms of trade union leaders, or Labour leaders, or Conservative leaders. Those who want to work for the happiness and rights of the working class must work for Communism and Socialism of an international character. Those who want to work for catching the vote of the ordinary ignorant voter must continue to work for Co-partnership Bills. That is the common factor between some men on this side and the other side, if there are any, and I do not for a moment suggest that there are.<\/p><p>The co-partnership scheme, as it is put forward in this Bill or as it may be put forward in any other Bill, is not going to diminish unemployment, it is not going to make British industry rival the industries of other countries, and it will not be able to reduce prices to the consumers. If you say that this is all going to happen, then it is only an admission that all that stands in the way to-day is the profit of the master class, and if that is so, you are all the time declining to accept responsibility for the fact that\nunemployment, reduced wages, and loss of trade are all due to your incompetence or to your greed as a master class. If there are profits to share, why were you so cruel, and callous, and heartless a few days ago as to refuse to the miner even an ordinary living wage? Why are you prepared to give him a. share in the profits when you are not prepared to give him his right to a living wage? I submit that this Bill should be read six months hence. I am sorry that I cannot, according to the practice of this House, name a longer limit, but my heart really wishes that this Bill should be put off till such time as the class struggle and the class war takes place, and the working class comes out of it victorious.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<\/p><p>It is with considerable diffidence that I rise to second the Amendment which my hon. Friend has proposed, and I would crave the indulgence of the House for a maiden speech, as although I have had twenty years practical experience in our Overseas Empire in every kind of capacity as man and master, I have had little experience in public speaking. Still, I am emboldened to face the ordeal of a maiden speech on the subject of Empire Development, as my experience, first as a wage-earner and later as a wage-payer on railway construction in our Overseas Empire, has convinced me that the solution of our troubles in this country is bound up with the development of our Overseas Empire. During the present Session I have heard many suggestions with regard to finding a solution of the various problems of this country, but I do not think I have heard a single suggestion that took in the idea of mobilising the whole Empire in order to find a solution of our problems at home. Most of the suggestions that I have heard sounded to me more like a palliative than a cure. I fully believe that if we in this country have only one-half the courage and vision in developing our Empire overseas that our forefathers showed in providing that Empire as a heritage for us, we shall cure, at any rate, some of the troubles from which this country is suffering at the present moment. I do not wish to mention any controversial subject, because any programme for the development of the Empire must have the unqualified support of all political parties in all parts of the Empire. Unless a programme free from party prejudice is adopted, it is bound to be without continuity, and upon continuity alone the success of any programme must entirely depend.<\/p><p>In order to appreciate properly the difficulties that confront us, it is necessary to realise that the Empire geographically and climatically&#8212;I leave out India, because it is really neither a Colony nor a Dominion&#8212;is divided into\nthree sections, namely, this country, the self-governing Dominions, and the Crown Colonies and Protectorates. The problems facing these three sections of the Empire are all entirely different, but if each section has a reasonable and tolerant appreciation of the difficulties facing the other two, if they will only work together in a reasonable spirit of reciprocal co-operation, I am sure they can do a great deal to solve the problems of all three. The main difficulty, of course, that faces this country is, as my hon. Friend has said, that of the surplus population, largely represented by unemployed craftsmen in our skilled trades, coal miners, and others. There is also the necessity of finding fresh markets for our produce. The great difficulty of the Dominions is shortage of population, and particularly of people with agricultural knowledge capable of developing raw land. I would point out to the Committee that the self-governing Dominions comprise the whole of that portion of our Empire which is really fit for settlement, in the true sense of the term, by people from this country. The two chief problems facing the Crown Colonies are the necessity for providing increased and cheapened transportation, and the improvement of sanitation in the broadest sense of the word, as affecting man, beast and plant. I would point out, also, that our Crown Colonies and Protectorates are mostly tropical or sub-tropical, and, therefore, they are not fit, in the true sense of the word, for settlement by people from this country. Moreover, they have in most cases large native populations, and in any case they do not suffer from any particular shortage or surplus of labour.<\/p><p>Any movement to bring these three sections of the Empire closer together must of necessity be initiated by this country, as the senior partner in the firm. But there is a difficulty in the way, and it is, to my mind, chiefly this, that the organisation which we set up in the Colonial Office, some 25 years ago, for dealing with the affairs of the Empire, has become obsolete because the Empire has outgrown it. Consequently, I think that the Colonial Office is failing, through no fault of its personnel, in one of its very important functions, namely, the co-ordination of the Empire. I wish to emphasise at once that none of my remarks are made in any spirit of criti-\ncism of any of the personnel of any Government Department, because I am convinced that, with the machinery at hand, they have done a great deal more than could possibly have been expected. But if we are going to develop our Empire to the full, the first thing is to develop our organisation for dealing with it, and to bring that organisation up to date. The organisation at the Colonial Office to-day is practically the same as it was 25 years ago, with the exception of a considerable increase in personnel. That increase in personnel, however, is largely among the subordinate staff. It is true that three new Departments have been created, for dealing respectively with the Middle East, the Irish Free State, and Overseas Settlement. Nevertheless, the actual organisation is practically the same as it was 25 years ago.<\/p><p>If one turns to Class II of the Estimates&#8212;Salaries and Expenses of the Colonial Office&#8212;I think it will be found that this Service is probably one of the cheapest, if not the cheapest, of any of the great Departments of State in this country, while the responsibilities of the Department are as great as, if not greater than, those of many of the others. Class V of these Estimates really represents our national contribution towards the expenses of our overseas Empire, and it will be found, in the Estimates for the current year, that the expenditure under this heading&#8212;excluding Overseas Settlement and the Middle Fast, which cannot be compared with previous years&#8212;is only &#163;1,216,000. If we compare this with the same Estimate under the same heading twenty years ago&#8212;namely, for the year 1905&#8211;6, we have to deduct &#163;586,000, which represents loans to Tanganyika, Nyasaland, and Northern Rhodesia, and certain expenses in connection with the Irish Free State, leaving our net contribution towards the expenses of our Overseas Empire at only &#163;630,000. If one turns to page 52 of the Estimates, one finds that there are estimated credits amounting to some &#163;261,000, and, if we take that from the &#163;630,000, we find that our total net contribution to the expenditure of our overseas Empire for this year amounts in all only to &#163;370,000.<\/p><p>Under the same heading in the Estimates for 1905&#8211;06, the net expenditure was estimated at some &#163;1,260,000. The\npoint I wish to make is that, when our Export trade to our Colonial Overseas Empire twenty years ago was worth only some &#163;71,000,000, we were prepared to contribute towards the expenses of our Overseas Empire, under Class (5), some &#163;1,250,000; but that at present, when our Exports to our Colonial Overseas Empire total about &#163;200,000,000 our contribution under Class (5) in the Estimates is only &#163;630,000; or, if the credits be deducted, some &#163;370,000.<\/p><p>I submit that in our overseas Empire we have, not only the greatest heritage in the world, but the greatest trust. With the permission of the House, I should like just to outline the organisation that we have for dealing with it, and to make three suggestions to the Government&#8212;firstly, with regard to getting a greater spirit of reciprocal cooperation between the three sections of the Empire; secondly, with regard to stimulating emigration to our overseas Dominions; and, thirdly, with regard to developing our Crown Colonies and Protectorates. In the first place, I would point out that the Colonial Office, as at present organised, is divided into two groups of Departments, the one dealing exclusively with the affairs of the self-governing Dominions, and the other being directly responsible for the administration of government in our Crown Colonies. There is, however, absolutely no connection between these two groups of Departments except in the person of the Secretary of State, the Permanent Under-Secretary, and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, and it is not surprising to find that, just as there is little or no connection between these two groups in the Colonial Office, so there is practically no connection between the Dominions and the Crown Colonies. Of course there are exceptions, like the Agreement between Canada and the West Indies, or the Pacific Islands, which have been handed over to the Commonwealth of Australia for administration but, broadly speaking and in the main, there is little or no connection between the two.<\/p><p>I cannot emphasize too strongly that in the main, as far as the Dominions are concerned, the Crown Colonies might belong to a foreign Power, and that in the Crown Colonies the peoples of the Dominions are regarded, both officially and unofficially as \"Colonials.\" That, I\nsubmit, is a state of affairs which should not be allowed to exist. It is the organisation&#8212;certainly not the personnel&#8212;of the Colonial Office that is really responsible for it. I submit, further, that, unless we can bring these two great sections of our overseas Empire closer together, we shall never be able to get Britishers who have been born overseas to realise the value, and also the responsibility, of their Imperial heritage. I believe the problem of holding the Empire together in future years is not going to be an easy one. The only way in which it can be done is by making every Britisher, in whatever part of the British Empire he may have been born, realise both the responsibility and the value of that heritage which has been handed down to us by our forefathers.<\/p><p>I suggest, therefore, for the consideration of the Government, that the first step towards promoting a better understanding between all three sections of the Empire would be for the Colonial Office. to follow the example of the Foreign Office in relation to the terms of engagement of personnel for the Service, so that in future all new appointments to the Colonial Service should be made for service either at home or abroad, and that, when the present officials of the Colonial Office have completed their service&#8212;and I fully realise that their terms of engagement must, above all things, be respected&#8212;no new appointments should be made to senior positions in the Colonial Office, unless the officials to be appointed have had actual experience in Crown Colonies, whether such appointments be in the Crown Colonies Department or in the self-governing Dominions Department of the Colonial Office. All such officials should have had five years' service in the Crown Colonies, and have had experience in the self-governing Dominions. I prefer, if it could be arranged, that they should be seconded to the Civil Service of one of the self-governing Dominions for a period of two years. I quite agree that it is most important that the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary should be given every opportunity of visiting the Colonies whenever that be possible, so that they can get first-hand knowledge of the problems with which they have to deal. But, after all, these gentlemen are only transitory, migratory beings. The Secretary of State\nfor the Colonies of yesterday is either the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the head of a great trade union to-day and, if it he important&#8212;and I agree that it is most important&#8212;that these gentlemen should have an opportunity of visiting our overseas countries, and getting first-hand information, surely it is far more important that equal opportunities should be given to the permanent officials of the Colonial Office, whom nothing but death or time can remove. If such a procedure were adopted, it would also go a very long way to do away with the feeling which exists in the minds of those in the Colonial Service overseas in the Crown Colonies that the general staff officers, as the senior officials in the Colonial Office may be called, have no actual knowledge of the conditions under which the front-line troops in the Colonies themselves have to carry out their duties, often on the very outskirts of civilisation. From my own short experience in the tropics. I can fully realise the meaning of the clause in the old Scottish litany\n<q>From ghosties and ghoulies and long-leggety beasties, and all things that go 'bang' in the night, Good Lord, deliver us.<\/q>\nThat clause has a very real meaning to the solitary white man on the outskirts of civilisation in Africa, although it may not have the slightest meaning to the man who has spent the whole of his life in Whitehall.<\/p><p>The next suggestion that I would make for the consideration of the Government, for the purpose of promoting better feeling throughout the Empire, is that real effect should be given to Section (2) of the third Resolution agreed to at the Imperial Economic Conference in 1923, relating to Imperial Preference and public contracts. That Resolution reads as follows\n<q>(1) That this Imperial Economic' Conference re-affirms the principle that in all Government contracts effective preference be given to goods made and materials produced within the Empire, except where undertakings entered into prior to this Conference preclude such a course or special circumstances render it undesirable or unnecessary.<\/q><q>(2) That so far as practicable efforts be made to ensure that the materials used in carrying out contracts be of Empire production.<\/q><q>(3) That State, provincial and local government authorities should be en-\ncouraged to take note of the foregoing Resolutions.<\/q>\nThis Resolution could be put into effect without legislation, and would go a very long way to overcome the feeling which exists&#8212;I am not prepared to say whether it is justified or not, but it does exist&#8212;in at least one of the self-governing Dominions, that the Crown Colonies and Protectorates are 113t as the preserve of this country, and that the producers of goods in our own Dominions overseas are not only not getting equal opportunities for competing with the manufacturers in this country in regard to goods purchased on Government account, but that there is actual discrimination against them. I believe that this impression would be entirely wiped out if the practice of calling for tenders by private invitation were discontinued, and if, when goods were purchased on Government account, invitations for tenders were advertised publicly throughout the whole Empire. I submit that this procedure should be followed, in any case, in relation to goods purchased by the Crown Agents for the Crown Colonies with money derived from taxation in the Crown Colonies themselves. This would give our self-governing Dominions a very real preference as full partners in the commonwealth of British nations, and would go a long way to offset the fact that in our markets we can give them only a very small preference in return for the very considerable preference which they give us in their markets. I am told that the cash value of the preference which they gave us in the Dominion markets in 1924 amounted to &#163;12,000,000. Unless we adopt some such procedure as this, we have little right to complain when the Dominions place orders in foreign countries for the goods that they want, though when this is done it is always the subject of adverse comment in the newspapers of this country.<\/p><p>To turn to my second point, with regard to assisting emigration to our self-governing Dominions, I do not want to repeat what my hon. Friend has said, but only to endorse whole-heartedly every word of it. I speak as an emigrant. I believe it would be very much cheaper for this country to hear the whole financial responsibility of paying a man's passage to the Colonies, giving him subsistence, and helping him to purchase a farm on a\n20 years' purchase basis, or something of that sort, than it is to give him unemployment benefit, which at the best only gives him the bare necessities of life, and does not give his children a chance in the world. I believe any money spent in assisting people from this country to our Dominions can be looked upon as an Imperial and a national investment, whereas any money spent in giving merely unemployment benefit must be looked upon in the nature of absolutely dead expenditure. I think the figures of trade and population in our overseas Dominions prove that. In 1904 the population of Canada, New Zealand and Australia, I believe, was 10,600,000, at which time we exported to those countries goods of British manufacture amounting only to &#189;35,000,000. With a population in the same countries of between 17,000,000 and 18,000,000, we exported in 1924 goods to the value of &#163;111,000,000. The value of the Dominions is again borne out by the amount per head purchased in the Dominions of goods of British manufacture. Speaking from memory, I think it is &#163;16 per head in New Zealand, &#163;12 in Australia, &#163;3 in Canada, and when you come to another of our best customers, a foreign country, the United estates, it is about 5s. per head, so the man who goes to our own countries overseas is worth far more to us than a man who goes to a foreign country. He is an investment.<\/p><p>Turning to our Crown Colonies and Protectorates, it is here more than anywhere else that I think the need for reorganisation of the Colonial Office is becoming most apparent, and it is in this connection I submit that our national contribution towards the expenses of our overseas Empire is neither commensurate with our responsibility nor sufficient to safeguard our commercial interests in those countries. I do not believe it is generally realised in this country that the Secretary of State is responsible not only for the proper administration of government in the ordinary political sense, but also for the running of all the public utilities and public services in most of our Crown Colonies which services ordinarily speaking, in a white man's country do not come under Government control. With the exception of British Honduras, Bermuda, the Bahamas and British Guiana, in most of the local legislatures there is an official majority, the unofficial members\nof which are appointed as a rule not elected. In any case the Crown has reserved the right to legislate in those Colonies by Orders in Council. So the responsibility of the Secretary of State is absolutely direct for all forms of administration.<\/p><p>Another thing, I do not believe the average man realises is that these Crown Colonies, which do not include India, Burma, Egypt or the Sudan, have an area of 2,600,000 square miles, a population of 48,000,000, and purchased goods of British manufacture last year amounting to &#163;50,000,000. It is especially with regard to research work, improving the health of man, beast and plant&#8212;because they all count in those countries&#8212;that I claim that we are not living up to our national responsibilities, It is true that, as guardians of those Colonies and of the native races, we authorise them, at their own expense, to do research work of all kinds. But our national contributions for the purpose of collating the results of their efforts, so that all the Colonies can profit by the mistakes and successes of their sister Colonies, is absolutely ridiculous. In the present Estimate the whole sum amounts to 119,500, only &#163;1,500 more than was voted 20 years ago for the same purpose, when the importance of this work was not so generally realised, especially with regard to tropical diseases. This &#163;19,500 is subdivided as follows: &#163;300 for the University of Hong Kong, &#163;12,500 for the Imperial Institute and Mineral -Resources Bureau, which is I believe in England. &#163;1,000 for the Tropical Diseases Bureau, &#163;1,000 for the Bureau of Entomology, &#163;2,000 for scientific research in connection with the development of the economic resources of our Colonies and Protectorates, &#163;2,000 for the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture in the West Indies, and &#163;1,000 for the National Council for Combating Venereal Diseases, in all, only &#163;7,000 as our national contribution in connection with medical, veterinary and agricultural research. This is actually &#163;12,500 less than was voted 20 years ago to aid agricultural research work in the West Indies alone.<\/p><p>During the last 20 years, where real progress has been made in tropical countries, the chief factor has been that the pioneer has been able to take advantage of what the scientists have\nfound out by research work for him. I believe not only the future development of our trade in the Crown Colonies, but the maintenance of existing trade depends upon us giving adequate, support to research of this kind. My complaint is that, though successive Governments have apparently realised the necessity of allowing the Crown Colony Governments at their own expense to run public utilities and public services, and to do a, certain amount of research work, they have entirely failed to provide any organisation to act as technical advisers in these matters to the Secretary of State or the officials responsible for the administration of the Colonies to the Secretary of State. Just as there is no co-ordination between the two groups of Departments in the Colonial Office&#8212;dealing with the affairs of the Dominions on the one side and the administration of the Crown Colonies on the other&#8212;so there is no co-ordination between the various Departments directly responsible for the administration of groups of Crown Colonies or the individual Colonies.<\/p><p>The Colonial Office, as at present organised, is endeavouring to do the biggest wholesale technical business the world has ever seen through a number of non-technical, watertight retail compartments. The senior official responsible to the Secretary of State for one or a group of Crown Colonies has to make recommendations with regard to proposals emanating from the Colonies dealing with political administration, sanitation, education, research work and all the public services and utilities. It is simply beyond the power of any one man to do the work properly. Furthermore, I do not think it is fair to put that burden on any one man's shoulders. To ask a man to do all this is to put him in the position of the giraffe in the circus, which the farmer looked at for 10 minutes and then said, \"There is no such animal.\" In a circular issued in February, 1904, by Mr. Alfred Lyttleton, defining the duties of Crown Agents, it is laid down that when important harbour works, railway works, or water or drainage schemes are projected, the Crown Agents are authorised, as the agents of the Colonies, and at the Colonies' expense, to engage consulting engineers and to place contracts for the purpose of carrying out those works. In other words, they are authorised to\nengage specialists for the construction of certain works of a civil engineering character. Still there is no provision in the Colonial Office itself for any organisation from which the Colonial Office officials, responsible for the whole administration of a Crown Colony or a group of Colonies, can turn to get advice, as from a general practitioner as opposed to the highly expensive consulting specialist, upon matters of routine dealing with the administration of these many Government run public utilities and services.<\/p><p>The functions of the Crown Agents are quite definite. They are the financial and purchasing agents of the Colonies in this country, paid by the Crown Colonies, and as such cannot give advice to the Colonial Office on questions of policy referred to the Secretary of State by their masters who are paying them. If the Colonial Office is going to take advice from the Crown Agent on technical policies, it is the equivalent to the Secretary of State giving authority to the tail to wag the dog. Therefore I submit it is necessary to provide in the Colonial Office departments to correspond with the various technical departments in the Crown Colonies to deal with everyday questions regarding the administration of medical and sanitary work, transportation, and public utilities and services generally. The officials in charge of these departments should be responsible for the inspection of the services they represent in the Colonies, for the selection and interchange of personnel, and act as advisers to the senior officials and Secretary of State. Half their time should be spent in visiting the Colonies and making themselves conversant with the problems to be met on the spot. They should also be given opportunities of visiting the Dominions and foreign countries, because many problems which have to be met in the Colonies have been solved elsewhere.<\/p><p>The growth of our export trade to the Crown Colonies would more than justify the expense. It has grown in 20 years from &#163;17,000,000 to &#163;56,000,000. There is plenty of work for such departments in the Colonial Office manned by whole-time experts, and I am firmly convinced that the future development of these Colonies depends on the cheapening of transportation and the\nfighting of tropical diseases, inimical to life of all kinds, and I believe the desired result can best be reached by installing such technical departments as I suggest in the Colonial Office for the purpose of co-ordination and advising in connection with administration. With regard to medical research, I do not believe the average man realises that the native inhabitants of our tropical Crown Colonies suffer to a very great extent from the very same diseases that make those Colonies really unsuitable for settlement by the people of this country. If we can improve the health of the people in those countries it is going to increase the amount of exportable goods they produce, which is in direct relation to the amount of imports they buy from this country. Therefore, I submit to the Government that they should appoint two Select Committees, one to see if further powers cannot be given to the Overseas Settlement Board with regard to the spending of further funds or advancing the whole of the cost of emigration, especially in relation to the cost of unemployment, and the other to go into the question of the reorganisation of the Colonial Office with regard to establishing technical departments or subsidising existing institutions for research with a view to rendering more efficient the technical services and improving the conditions of health obtaining in our tropical possessions upon which the prosperity and the development of those possessions absolutely depends.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>The speech of the hon. Baronet the Member for Caithness (Sir A. Sinclair) when boiled down appeared to me to amount to another \"wait-and-see\" policy. I think, however, the House is to be congratulated that the new Members, who have some knowledge of Singapore and that part of the East, have all spoken in favour of the Government going on with their policy. The right hen. Gentleman the Member for Carmarthen (Sir A. Mond) made the unique and astounding claim on Thursday that his party was the only party who had been consistent in this matter. He stated that he was no believer in the necessity of Singapore or as to its efficiency, and he contended the base was quite unnecessary. I think if the right hon. Gentleman would recall June, 1921, he would be aware that the Cabinet of which he was a member then\ngave its official sanction and approval to the Singapore base. The right hon. Gentleman also stated it would be a provocative factor. I would ask him whether we are going to spend &#163;60,000,000 on the Navy, and then paralyse that arm, which is so necessary in those Eastern waters. One might just as well say that a police force for home is a provocative force, because it is out to prevent the activities of evil-doers. You might as well say to the members of your police force at home, \"You are to stand in one place, and never cover your beat,\" as to restrict the mobility of the Navy in regard to Singapore.<\/p><p>I maintain that if we are to have a Navy, we must have an efficient and a mobile Navy, so that it could do everything required of it in these waters. As regards provocation to Japan, Baron Hayashi has definitely stated that Japan does not look upon Singapore as being anything in the nature of provocation, and also we have Earl Balfour telling us that Singapore was deliberately left out of the agreement at Washington, because it might be wanted as a base for Empire defence. The hon. and gallant Member for Central Hull (Lieut.-Commander Kenworthy) is just as inconsistent as his colleagues. He warmly greeted this plan when it was first brought forward by the First Lord of the Admiralty. He acclaimed it as being the thing for which he had worked all along. Yet, since that time, he has practically boxed the compass, and now states that it is absolutely useless. He seems also not to be quite aware of what the position is out there. He said that the whole island suffers from overcrowding, and that housing conditions are appalling. Statements like that give a very false impression of the true position. You might make the same statement in respect to the Isle of Wight if you took the town of Ventnor, and drew the conclusion that the whole of the island was overcrowded. There is undoubtedly a certain amount of overcrowding in the city of Singapore, but on the site generously given by the Straits Settlement Government there is plenty of room for all the housing accommodation required. Another gentleman, who was once a Member of the party opposite, is also inconsistent. I refer to the ex-Member for Westbury (Mr. C. W. Darbi-\nshire). He told us that the place was very enervating and demoralising, but when he was not re-elected to this House, he with his wife immediately went out to Singapore, and at the present time is residing there. The whole policy of the party opposite is not one of consistency, but of procrastination, and that is the reason why they are in the impotent position in which they find themselves to-day.<\/p><p>It is, I think, our bounden duty to maintain and to strengthen every link in the chain of Imperial defence. There is no Member on this side of the House who would spend one penny on any aggressive policy at the present time to add to the great burden of debt that is pressing on this country owing to the War. There is nobody who wants war. We see the maimed men who are walking the streets to-day as the result of the Great War. Everything we see to-day must make us avoid, so far as possible, war in the future. I say that, by having a strong, mobile fleet, and a base whereby that fleet can operate from Singapore, we are providing something which will be the greatest factor for peace in the future. Our Navy has always stood as an emblem of our policy of peace, and has always acted in that direction. We have also to remember that we are dependent absolutely for our food on outside sources. We must protect our great shipping and trade routes for our food supplies. Then, as regards the Dominions and the Dependencies, are we to take the opinion of men like Mr. Bruce, or are we to take the opinion of irresponsible men like the hon. and gallant Member for Central Hull? Mr. Bruce knows what he is talking about, and he has great responsibility, but the hon. and gallant Member for Central Hull has none. The Dominions look to us, and they are prepared to support the scheme financially. The time will come when we shall have to consider whether we, the mother country, are going to do our duty and defend them if we can. We know that they had a nasty slap in the face from the Socialist Government over Imperial Preference, when we had practically made them a promise in regard to that matter, but the Socialist Government came into power and turned it all down. While they were shutting the door in their face,\nthey were opening the door to Soviet Russia. Is that the way to establish friendship between the mother country and the Dominions? They, certainly, should be supported, for they are ready to give us financial aid towards the cost of the base. New Zealand has already voted &#163;100,000, Australia is going to do more, and Hong Kong has, contributed &#163;250,000, while, as I have stated, the Straits Settlement Government has given a site.<\/p><p>Therefore, I think it is up to us to show that we have really realised our great responsibility. I should like to see international disarmament brought about on the land, the sea and in the air. Everybody in this House would like to see it, but I should like to know why we are always waiting on America. Cannot we take a lead in this matter? We know very well that during the War America did not allow idealism to stand in the way of material progress. It is well known what reply was given to the question why the Americans were called \"doughboys.\" The answer was, \"Because they were (k)needed in 1914, and did not rise till 1917.\" Therefore, I say it is up to us to take the lead in the question of international disarmament.<\/p><p>The question of a garrison at Singapore was referred to by the hon. and gallant Baronet the Member for Caithness. We want a certain number of men, and have always had a garrison at Singapore, for which the Colony makes a military contribution. But it would be interesting to know how many people in this House or outside know where Singapore is. It reminds me of something that happened when I was talking lately to a friend about Burmah. \"Why,\" he asked, \"do you call it Burmah: my brother always called it Bermuda?\"<\/p>",

Those figures, which were given in the House of Lords, I think were not understood by some people to refer merely to the expense at Singapore. The floating dock has to have extensions made to it which will cost altogether &#163; 310,000, and there is a certain sum provided in our Estimates for supervising staff to supervise the work as it proceeds. The figure given for the cost of Singapore during the year of which we are speaking was &#163; 204,000, but. we have provided in the Estimates for &#163; 250,000, for two reasons.

[HON. MEMBERS: \"Why should we have it? \"] I do not think that Hon. Gentlemen will get indigestion at all, and I think they will, possibly hear something about the Singapore base from someone who, although he cannot speak so well as many others in the House, has had nearly 21 years of service within a few days of\nSingapore, and who, therefore, presumes in any case to know something of the subject about which he is speaking. I have, since 1900, been a merchant and trading Vice-Consul in the Dutch East Indies, and, as a merchant, I stand here to-night to speak about the Singapore base from a trading point of view, because I have realised, during the time I have been out in the Far East, the necessity of protecting British trade, both in the Dutch East Indies and travelling to and from the Dutch East Indies.<\/p><p>I need not, I think, go into the history of Singapore very deeply, but possibly a few facts about that place, which was founded by that great man, Sir Stamford Baffles, some 100 years or more ago, may interest the Committee. At the time when he founded Singapore, the population was 300 souls all told. It is to-day 500,000. In 1824 the total imports and exports of Singapore amounted to about &#163; 2,000,000. To-day they amount to about &#163; 127,000,000, and nearly one fourth of\nthat, about &#163; 30,000,000, is to or from the Dutch East Indies. There is about &#163; 3,400,000 to and from China, &#163; 5,000,000 to any from Japan, and &#163; 1,500,000 to and from Australia, In 1919 I attended the centenary celebration of Singapore. The Governor, like myself and many other Gentlemen on these benches, was a Scotsman and in his speech he said that, when he was home in 1910, he told some people in Scotland that the tonnage of the shipping that entered Singapore was double that which entered Glasgow, Leith, Aberdeen and Dundee all taken together. I looked up that reference yesterday and I find that the tonnage is now nearly double the tonnage of the shipping entering the whole of Scotland. Those of us who are Scots will realise, therefore, the amount of tonnage entering Singapore.<\/p><p>When speaking of the imports and exports to the Dutch East ladies, I want it to be clearly understood that, while I was there for over 20 years&#8212;and I was there during the Boer War and the recent Great War&#8212;I never had anything but courtesy and civility, and no Britisher, so far as I know, has ever suffered any incivility at the hands of the Dutch. Perhaps you will not be interested in the Dutch East Indies, if you think that I am pleading that I should defend these Colonies for the Dutch. That is not my view. I mention these facts because I want you to see how tremendous are the British interests in those islands. In the reference to the trade to and from the Dutch East Indies I will speak from figures which I received recently from the Overseas Trade Department which used to receive the figures from me until recently. When I was Vice-Consul in Java I used to send my figures home, and they were taken by the Board of Trade to the Overseas Trade Department. So I thought that I would let them return the compliment, and give me figures; and I hope that they are as correct to-day as they were in my day.<\/p><p>The report, dated 19th July, 1924, of the commercial agent at Batavia, which is the capital of the Dutch East Indies, states that the total imports for private account in 1922 were between &#163; 60,000,000 and &#163; 80,000,000. The figures may be, interesting. Of that amount, 23 per cent. came from Holland and 44 per cent. from the British Empire, and no less than\n16 per cent. came from the Straits Settlements. So nearly half of the imports are of British origin. The export?, which amounted to nearly &#163; 100,000,000, were not exactly in the same proportion. The exports to Singapore, to a great extent for trans-shipment, were 19 per cent., to Holland 16 per cent. and the United Kingdom 5 per cent. Of the shipping traffic in 1923 44 per cent. was under the Dutch flag and 35 per cent. under the British flag. There are in the Dutch East Indies no fewer than 500 harbours. Certainly only a few are what may be called first-class harbours. The rest are second-class or quite small harbours, but nevertheless they give an opportunity for ships of all sorts and sizes to enter these harbours and, as was shown during the War, more or less to do a certain amount of local damage.<\/p><p>You have trading to the Dutch East Indies from all parts of the world by various British shipping companies. I am not here to advertise the shipping companies or the insurance companies or the banks, but they are such companies as Holt's Blue Funnel Company, the British India Steam Navigation Company and the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand, and such-like companies, that carry on a regular trade to and from the Dutch East Indies, and as often as not through Singapore, or they take it, as the New Zealand Shipping Company does, from New Zealand to Java and then to Calcutta or <i>vice versa.<\/i> The population of those islands is no less than 49,000,000. Of that number there are 184,000 Dutch, 3,400 Germans, 1,600 Britishers, 809,000 Chinese, and a great number of Indians and others who are, to a great extent, our own subjects. I was surprised during the War to find that one of my principal occupations was signing the passports of Indians and others who were anxious to go to Singapore and on to India, and these are all subjects of ours. The 1,600 is the actual white British population, but added to that we have another very big population of Chinese who were born and bred at Singapore. There was, indeed, a Chinese-English school, and we had a large number of Singapore-born Chinese who lived in the Dutch East Indies.<\/p><p>Some figures as to foreign capital may be interesting. The Dutch capital is estimated at &#163; 158,000,000 and the British\ncapital at &#163; 50,000,000, and, according to the figures supplied to me, there are &#163; 16,000,000 British and &#163; 14,000,000 Dutch money invested in those islands in rubber and &#163; 3,000,000 British money is invested in tea. The Committee will admit, therefore, that the British capital invested in that country, and the British interests, are very considerable, and when one realises how near they are to the Straits Settlement, and the amount of traffic to and fro by small steamers, one must see that the Dutch East Indies depend a great deal on what is going on in the British Possession adjacent. I do not pretend to be a naval expert in any shape or form. I am not, like one of the hon. Members who spoke some time ago, a person who has never been to sea. I have been round the world from various places have travelled to the East via Suez and come home by South Africa. I have gone out by America, Japan, Hong Kong, Canton, Manila and all these places, so I know the geography of these places very well, and I may tell you that this is by no means a new proposition. I have discussed this self-same thing for years with Dutch authorities.<\/p><p>When as a youngster I was in the Dutch Indies, I was one of those who had to do compulsory service under the Dutch Government. I was a scutter&#8212;not a scooter&#8212;what you call in this country a compulsory volunteer. It was not until they found out, although I was in the ranks, that I knew my drill&#8212;I had been in the London Scottish&#8212;far better than my Dutch captain, that they thought they had better change me over, and they put me into the fire brigade. [HON. MEMBERS: \"In kilts?] I was not in my kilts in the fire brigade, though it was certainly warm enough for them. To come back to Singapore. The Port of Singapore is getting more important daily. It is the gateway of the Far East, and it is surprising that the base has not been made long ago. When you consider the geographical importance of the position of Singapore and the amount of traffic that passes to and from and through the place, it is to me extraordinary that the base has not been constructed before to-day.<\/p><p>Some years ago when I was officially in the Straits Settlements. I had a talk with the highest officials of the Government, civil, military and naval. It was\nunofficial talk and we did not know what were the politics of each other. As a fact we had nothing to do with politics. When I came home to England I was asked what were my politics. I had been proposed for a Conservative Club and I had to say that my politics were so-and-so. I had not thought of the subject for 21 years. An hon. Member says it shows how hard up they were last year. Let me tell him that practically before I had retired from the East I was a Member of the London County Council. Very soon after arriving in England I found out which was the right side on which to be. The whole question of Singapore is discussed in England from a political point of view. Out in the far Blast it is discussed from the standpoint of what is necessary, and, having been a business man all my life, I consider that it is merely a question of insurance.<\/p><p>One hon. Member on the Liberal Benches has said that we can have such a thing as over-insurance. I suggest that you can have under-insurance just as much. I am convinced, having been out in the East and in Singapore from time to time, when T have gone into the question on the spot, that all those who are true lovers of peace, all those who stand by the League of Nations&#8212;some hon. Members may laugh, but I mean it, and I am talking on facts rather than on fancy&#8212;all those who really want to support the League of Nations should vote for the Singapore base, because the mere fact that we have a strong base at Singapore will not be regarded as intimidation or aggravation by any people, but will be considered as quite the contrary. When in the Lord Mayor's Show you place police at certain points on the route, is that a provocation? It is exactly the same if you place this base at Singapore along the route from this country to the Far East. You are then doing your best to prevent war anywhere. The mere fact that we have a strong base there, with a strong Navy to back it up, is for the good of this country and for the maintenance of peace throughout the world.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>With regard to the speech of the hon. and gallant Member for Uxbridge (Lieut.-Commander Burney), it is needless to say how much I agree, for I have been hammering at the principles he mentioned for many years. I used to point out in the old days the false doctrine of coast invasion. Any point with regard to the 50,000 miles of Empire coast line produced the same argument about invasion which the military used in regard to this Island. The whole question of economy is to be found in the suggestion of one supreme Minister who will be able to say to experts, \"Is it vital or usefull If it is useful, we cannot have it; but if it is vital we must have it.\" That means the Minister of Defence at the head of all the Services. The idea of a Minister of Defence is not quite so young as the hon. and gallant Member for Aylesbury (Sir A. Burgoyne) thought. We owe the idea to Lord Randolph Churchill and the Minority Report of Lord Haiti rigton's Commission in 1886 which he signed. I am quite certain that if that is done and we have some sort of stocktaking with the setting up of a roving Geddes Committee you will find\nit will save an immense amount of money. As an example, I drew the attention of the Conservative Government in 1923 by letters, and I think once or twice on the Floor of the House, to the parade ground of the military at Hong Kong. The last Government had the wisdom to sell that piece of property, which was right in the centre of the business community of Hong Kong. They got &#163;2,000,000 for the parade ground, and a suitable ground very much cheaper elsewhere. That is only one instance of many where we could raise a lot of money. The hon. and gallant Member for Hertford (Rear-Admiral Sueter) raised the old tale of his unhappy differences with the Admiralty in the past. I wish he could forget these old unhappy things of long ago. [An HON. MEMBER: \"Why?\"] I do not see why Lord Beatty and Sir Roger Keyes should be punished for the sins of Admirals years ago. We never had a War Staff in those days, and we all had differences with the Admiralty. You have a War Staff now, and you can hope&#8212;<\/p>",

As regards the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand, the position is as follows:<\/p><p>Prior to the decision of the late Government to discontinue the development of the, Singapore base, the Commonwealth\nGovernment had expressed their intention of submitting to Parliament proposals for a substantial Australian contribution towards the cost of the base, and the New Zealand Parliament had already voted &#163;100,000 as a first contribution. After the late Government's decision, had been announced, the Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments decided to take increased measures for their naval defence, entailing a considerable increase in defence expenditure over a period of years.<\/p><p>It will be necessary for the Australian and New Zealand Governments to take these new commitments into account in considering the extent to which in present circumstances they can co-operate in the development of the Singapore base; but understand that the Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments will consult their Parliaments on the subject as soon as opportunity offers.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>It is money that is collected under an international agreement, it is true; but in consideration of the fact, as the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has reminded us. that the Chinese took a certain part during the War as our Allies, it has been agreed that henceforth that money shall not be collected from the Chinese for our sole\nuse&#8212;it is Chinese money. In any case, the question I am putting to hon. Members is: Why continue to allow China to spend &#163;400,000 on her own purposes, or on purposes that partly meet her needs, when, as the hon. and gallant Member for Clitheroe reminds us, there is so much that might be done in this country&#8212;so many unemployed, and so many constructive pieces of work to be carried through 7 That is not a question for the hon. and gallant Member opposite to put to this side: it is a matter for him to take up with his own Front Bench.<\/p><p>I suggest to the hon. and gallant Member for Clitheroe, and those who agree with him, that the real reason why this year the Conservative Front Bench and last year the Labour Front Bench decided to use this money for purposes that would be beneficial to China, even though they might be beneficial to us as well, was because it is now realised on all sides of the House&#8212;at any rate, in the responsible quarters of the House&#8212;that China has become an adult nation, that China must be treated as an equal, that if there are to be adequate opportunities for Britain (thinking of its own interest in the future) to enter into effective arrangements that are going to help China and help ourselves, they can only come on the basis of treating China as an equal with ourselves. If we were not prepared to admit that, the findings of the Washington Conference with regard to China encourage people in that country to-day to look upon themselves in a vastly different light from that in which, I am afraid, some hon. Members opposite look upon China. The fact, too, that, with regard to this indemnity, America has treated them in a comparatively generous way, compels us to alter our attitude. For some years past the Americans have foregone the money that otherwise would have been paid to them under the terms of the indemnity. I agree that the Americans, having spent so wisely on educational effort, some of the results have gone for the benefits of American trade. It has been said that students trained in China with the help of money that the Americans have foregone have ultimately gone across to America, continued their training there still with the help of the same money, and have finally gone back\nto China as commercial emissaries of American industry. But America has gone a great deal further than that. She has set up a Committee consisting of 15 persons, 10 of whom are Chinese, five of whom are American. Those five Americans are exceedingly distinguished men in the world of education. One of them is Professor Dewey, and another is Dr. P. Monroe, both of whom can be depended upon to look upon the problem of education not merely from the mercantile point of view, but in its widest humanitarian aspect.<\/p><p>That is what America has done. She is willing that such money as she formerly had control of should be spent under the advice of a Committee largely Chinese and for the rest consisting of distinguished intellectual leaders in American opinion. Curiously enough Russia, which was referred to by the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, seems to have been able to set us an example in this matter. It has been decided by Russia that a Committee shall be set up to supervise the expenditure of the money over which formerly that country had control, the Committee to consist of three persons, two of whom are to be Chinese and the third a Russian. I know it may be said that a regulation is laid down that tilt: decisions of that Committee shall be unanimous before action can be taken, but I do not know that that very much differentiates the Russian procedure from the procedure suggested in this Measure. After all, our Committee, with its ten representatives, is only an Advisory Committee, and the Secretary for Foreign Affairs acting as a single individual has the final right of veto, as the single Russian representative might have on a similar Committee. That is the position regarding the development that has been made in the ideas both of this country and of other countries.<\/p><p>I come now to trace the opposite tendencies, the proposal backed up this afternoon by the hon. and gallant Member for Clitheroe, that the money should be spent for commercial ends. We are told that the 6,000 miles of railway in China now are not sufficient. How many more miles of railway can you construct if you spend the whole of this money? Two thousand miles at the most. The &#163;400,000 a year capitalised would make, not &#163;8,000,000 as is suggested, but possi-\nbly &#163;10,000,000 or &#163;11,000,000, and that would provide 2,000 miles of railway. That being the position, you cannot pretend that by a proposal of that kind you are going to do something which will bring benefit to all the homes of the 400,000,000 people in China. What hon. Members are thinking about, I suggest, is the benefit that can be obtained by a comparatively small class, and I am afraid that that class is not in China but is to be found wholly in this country.<\/p><p>There was an interesting statement made recently by a distinguished Chinese military leader, Marshal Tuan Chi-jui, who said that it might be possible to use the money for the purposes of education and it might be possible indeed to develop village schools, but that in order to get the village schools it would be necessary to get railways completed and to provide the means of people getting into the schools. There is the practical point of view expressed by Marshal Wu-pei-fu last year, who also suggested that the money should be used for railway purposes. But I see from other Chinese opinions that what has happened in this regard has been this: the Chinese military leaders have in the past obtained grants for the making of railways. They have run the railways in as economical a way as possible, disregarding all margins of safety, having accidents on the railways, with rolling stock and tracks inefficient, and making out of the grants they have received sufficient in profits to pay their soldiers, and. through their paid soldiers to continue that anarchy which hon. Members opposite so often profess to despise. The granting of money for railways, in fact, instead of helping China on to its feet., if the grant be made in connection with some of the military leaders of China, may actually make the present confusion worse confounded.<\/p><p>There is not only that difficulty which we have to face regarding expenditure of this kind. Unfortunately for us, the Chinese have a different idea of our commercial expenditure than, perhaps, we have. Hon. Members think with great pride of what we have done in China, but the Chinese have known all along what the Commission of the Shanghai Municipal Council reported not very long ago regarding some of our commercial undertakings in China. I see that upon that Commission one of the representa-\ntives was Dame Adelaide Anderson, who is suggested as one of the representatives of the Committee which is to be engaged in supervising the expenditure provided for under this Bill. The Commission brought to light such facts that it was necessary for them to recommend that child labour under 10 years of age in factories be abolished. More than that, it stated that if that provision were carried out, 50,000 children in Shanghai would be affected. They discovered that children of five years were engaged in brushing silk and that children of the same age were employed in match factories, working for the equivalent of a penny per day or less. Our commercial relations with China, then, have not been of the happiest. It is because we to-day suspect that this Committee is likely to use the money, not for educational purposes, but for railways in backing up other commercial enterprises, that we feel we cannot accept the Measure in its present. form; at any rate, we cannot accept it unless some undertaking be given that the Committee which supervise the process is a very much more satisfactory Committee than that at present outlined.<\/p><p>Let me indicate what will be the nature of the Committee, as far as one can see from the reports in the Press and in other quarters. The Committee is to consist of 10 persons. It has already been announced in the House of Commons that the place of Mr. Bertrand Russell or of Mr. Lowes Dickinson will be taken by Professor Soothill, of Oxford. We have no criticism to make of Professor Soothill, who is a very distinguished scholar. He has given very earnest service on the mission field of China, ultimately becoming, I believe, the Chancellor of a University. But Professor Soothill's work has been mainly in connection with what might be called missionary education. Unfortunately the Chinese do not look upon missionary education in quite the same way as we look upon it. Indeed, I saw in a statement made by Mr. 'Leung Koo, who is the Oriental Travelling Secretary of the Students' Christian Movement, in a speech in Manchester shortly before Christmas the following:\n<q>There has been some talk of missionary educational institutions in China applying for the Fund when it is returned to China. Chinese opinion is wholly against that. We\nhope the mission will not apply for the money.<\/q>\nI do not believe that if Professor Soot-hill were left to his own devices he would desire the money to be used entirely for missionary purposes. But clearly there is a suspicion in China that by displacing Mr. Bertrand Russell and electing Professor Soothill you are going to have the money spent in a way that will not altogether meet with the approval of the Chinese people. If that be the case, you are failing in the main purpose that you have set before yourselves in foregoing this &#163;400,000 a year that would otherwise have been available if this Measure had not been passed. I see that Professor Giles, another distinguished Chinese scholar, of Cambridge University&#8212;I suppose we can regard him as the natural opponent, as far as the Universities are concerned, of Professor Soothill&#163;made the statement recently, in a discussion with Chinese students at Cambridge, that he was entirely opposed to the spending of the money for what might be described as Christian purposes. Professor Giles probably felt the necessity of saying that because of the action that the Government has taken. I believe that unless you can get back on to the Committee men of intellectual eminence who are free from particular interests in the way that Mr. Bertrand Russell and Mr. Lowes Dickinson were, you cannot expect to succeed with the Chinese in the main purposes that you are pursuing.<\/p><p>5.0 P.M.<\/p><p>May I draw the attention of the House to the general complexion of the Committee as it now stands? I understand that there are three official representatives from the public Departments. But one of them, Sir John Jordan, strictly speaking, is no longer a public representative; he is as much concerned with private interests as other directors of private companies whose names I discover on that Committee. I see that Sir John Jordan is a director of a Chinese-Indian company, and naturally he will look at the problem from the point of view of the company of which he is a director. Sir John Jordan, not very long after the Conservative Government came into power, found it to be within his duty to make a speech violently praising the Conservative Government and drawing attention to the fact that the\nRussians had humiliated themselves, had brought themselves down to the level of the Chinese, and were nothing more than equal with the Chinese in the Russo-Chinese-Treaty that was recently signed. How, then, can the Chinese 5.00 P.M. themselves, when they hear of Sir John Jordan making speeches of that kind, expect him to look at the problem from their point of view, and try to guarantee effective education from the Chinese point of view '? I see there is also included in the Committee Sir Charles Stewart Addis, and, looking at his record, I discover that he is a director of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, a director of the British Indian Steam Navigation Company, a director of the Eastern Telegraph Company, a director of the British and Chinese Corporation, a director of the Chinese Central Railways, and chairman of the London committee of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. Do you imagine the Chinese, reading the qualifications of these gentlemen, are going to put the same estimate upon their capacity to deal with China as some hon. Gentlemen opposite have done? Our criticism is that, though you propose to spend &#163;400,000 mainly upon education in China, the Committee you have set up is entirely incapable of giving an unprejudiced view regarding Chinese education, and until there can be included upon it men of eminence, impartial men, in the sense that Mr. Bertrand Russell and Mr. Lowes Dickinson are. I do not believe you can expect any effective results from the giving up of this very large sum of money.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>That was my personal opinion, near the last sentence. At the end of their despatch with regard to the Treaty of Mutual Assistance the Government, feeling it necessary to indicate once\nagain their desire to do something, could only say this much:\n<q>It is the policy of His Majesty's Government that whenever a favourable opportunity presents itself, the Governments of the world should meet in conference with the object of devising a scheme or schemes for the reduction of armaments.<\/q>\n\"Whenever a favourable opportunity presents itself.\" That is a very different note from the note struck by the Prime Minister a few months ago. But I would point out that the change goes even further than that. Only a day or two ago, in answer to a question by the hon. and gallant Member for Central Hull (Lieut.-Commander Kenworthy), with regard to the attitude of the President of the United States, the Prime Minister replied that no move in favour of disarmament had been made by the President of the United States. The Prime Minister added:\n<q>He has declared his general interest and sympathy, and I agree with and respond to that.<\/q>\n\"General interest and sympathy.\" We all agree and respond. But that is surely a very different note from the demand for \"energy and decision\" in pressing forward disarmament, which were the words of the Prime Minister only as recently as March last. In answer to the same series of questions by the hon. and gallant Member for Central Hull, and in reply to a suggestion that the Prime Minister should make a definite move now, the Prime Minister replied, and, I think, replied wisely:\n<q>Any ill-timed move would do incalculable harm.<\/q>\nThat is quite true: the situation is so delicate&#8212;more delicate to-day, in many respects, than it was a few months ago&#8212;that the right moment and the right way to approach the problem have to be chosen very carefully, and it may not be a matter of weeks only but of months and even of years before that problem can be satisfactorily tackled. If that is so, I suggest that the move which was made in March with regard to Singapore was not a particularly well-timed move. If a gesture is to have real effect it ought to precede immediately the opening of negotiations; it ought to lead to a definite conference from which some definite result can be reached. But we realise now, as I suggested in criticising the Prime Minister's action at the time, that the gesture was made in a vague and fumbling man-\nner, with no definite idea as to how it was to be followed up. The idea, whatever it may have been in March, has grown progressively less definite and more remote every week during which the Government has been face to face with the complexity of the international situation. That is the position, the official policy of the Government as regards the Navy.<\/p><p>But there seem to be two different policies in the Government in this matter, at any rate if one is to judge by the very amazing utterances to which the Lord Chancellor, who is also the Lord High Strategist of the Government as head of the Committee of Imperial Defence, gave vent in that same Debate to which I have referred. While the First Lord made it quite clear that definite Powers were to be approached in the near future with regard to this matter, and that we were going back to the construction of Singapore if that approach were unsuccessful, all that the Lord Chancellor could say was:\n<q>How can we give any indication as to when our policy is to succeed or fail; or how soon it will succeed or fail? The question is one which does not admit of an answer.<\/q>\nHe apparently acquiesces in the position that, whatever may be the strategical dangers involved, we have as a matter of fact no policy with regard to disarmament, no idea whatever when the time will come when we can say that we have done well or made a mistake in withholding our hand with regard to Singapore. Again, the Lord High Strategist gave a description of the Singapore Base which, I am sure, will not commend itself to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty. He described it as \"a base of offence, just as much as it was to be a base, and even more, of defence.\" He said that it would be\n<q>a great instrument of offensive possibility. It would be something which would dominate the whole Pacific, and which would make an alteration in the strategical balance of the world, a new weapon which we had never had before, by which this nation has to impose its will upon the Pacific.<\/q><\/p><p>And he added:\n<q>There is no getting out of that. I have worked it out on paper.<\/q>\nWith all submission, I have attempted to work it out on paper myself, and I have been informed&#8212;I think it is information equally in the possession of my hon. Friends opposite&#8212;that the very maximum\nradius which a fleet can dominate from a particular base is something like 1,500 miles. As a matter of fact, long before that radius is reached the effective power of a fleet is greatly diminished. We felt it ourselves in the narrow waters of the North Sea. When we were operating off the German Coast, we were already operating at a disadvantage. One thousand five hundred miles radius into the Pacific from Singapore covers less than 2 per cent. of the area of the Pacific. It does not get to within 1,500 miles of Japan. At the very most it might be said to dominate Hong Kong. If you want to dominate even the Western Pacific, you would require to bring up to date the base at Hong Kong, and you would require to create a new powerful base at Wei-hai-wei, or some-where in that neighbourhood. It is only under those circumstances that you could, in any sense of the word, be said to dominate even the Western half of the Pacific.<\/p>",

The Committee inquired at some length into the question of the using of the whole of the Boxer Indemnity, or some part of it, for the stimulation of Chinese education on British lines. I do net know why the report of that Committee has never been published. I should have thought that. it would have been a very good thing to have had the report published now, particularly in view of the fact that the Under-Secretary has stated that he contemplates the setting up of a further Committee, apparently to go over much the same ground and to make further recommendations. Whilst I agree generally with the principle of using at any rate some part of the Indemnity for the encouragement of Chinese education on British lines, the views of the people best qualified to judge two years ago were by no means unani\nMous. More than one of them expressed a doubt whether the contemplated ex-penditure would be as satisfactory in results as many of us hoped it would be. We have behaved very generously to China in recent years, and that fact should not be forgotten. In 1917 we allowed China a moratorium of five years, during which time no indemnity instalments were required from her. At the end of that period we went further than many of the other great Powers in accepting an arrangement under which the. back payments due during the moratorium would not be payable until 1940. The House should remember that fact in considering this further request for an extension of generous treatment to Republic. Speaking fer myself, I do not object in principle to the proposal of this Bill: but there is one objection in detail which I hold very strongly. The Government are asking the House to give. them a, free hand to distribute the money exactly as the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs may desire. I think that is an objectionable way of dealing with the money. The Under-Secretary has said that he contemplates a Committee for advising the Government as to how this money should he spent. Either that Committee should be a statutory Committee under the terms of the Bill or the details of the expenditure should be set out in the Schedule. As a Member of the former Committee. I heard a. great deal of evidence from Sir John Jordan, the Vice-Chancellor of Hong Kong University and other experts as to how money could best be spent in stimulating Chinese education. Before this Bill roaches the Statute Book some details of methods of expenditure should be incorporated in it. My own view is that while we should allow the Bill to get a Second Reading to-night, we should. during the Committee stage insist either on the details being included or on the Committee to which the Under-Secretary referred being made a statutory Committee with powers definitely assigned to it in reference to the spending of the money. I am in favour of the general principle of the Bill and hope the House will give it a Second Reading.<\/p>",

I consider that any defence of religious equality in Scotland is unnecessary. I have had some remarkable examples in my own time, and more or less in my own political history,\nof the assertion of the principle that religious conviction is a matter which should be left to the individual conscience and should not be brought into politics either in favour of or against any citizen of the country. When you look at the representation of Glasgow and the composition of the Ministry and find two or three men, Irishmen by race and Catholic by upbringing, among the most powerful members of the Ministry, I think that it will be admitted that Scotland has given one of the best examples in the world with regard to this fundamental principle&#8212;except perhaps my own country, which I may be pardoned for mentioning. Ninety per cent. of the Irish party were Catholics, and yet that party elected three Protestant leaders in succession, one of them Mr. Parnell who was the most powerful political leader in Irish history. You, Sir, were in the House and so was your predecessor when a remarkable event took place. The Foreign Office Vote was put down. Sir Edward Gray, as he then was, was the Foreign Secretary and there was a tumultous audience of about 10 Members. That was a few months before the War, and there was this attendance of 10, mainly cranks, who, instead of discussing the very grave and menacing questions which existed, raised questions concerning Hong Kong and Shanghai which were important in their way but small compared with the policy of the British Empire in view of what was to happen within a few months' time. At a quarter past 8, after the cranks had had their say, we got the great question of whether the East Surrey Water Company should be allowed to take some more gallons of water every year from a little river called the Wandle. The House was rapidly filled up and the question was debated in ardent and passionate speeches. Some said that if this Bill were carried typhoid fever would stalk through the streets of Croydon, and others said that if it were not passed consequences more horrible still would ensue. The debate went on that night and for the next two nights. It occupied 12 hours. You had 12 hours given in the House of Commons to the East Surrey Water Company and four hours devoted to the policy and the interests of the Empire. That made a profound impression upon me. Your predecessor in the Chair, Sir, was one of the\ngreatest Speakers which this House has ever had, and was well known to be a man of conservative and cautions opinion I remember that Lord Ullswater, with whom I had had no conversation whatsoever on the subject, declared that he was profoundly impressed by this exhibition. I do not know what was his opinion on devolution, but evidently he thought there must be something wrong in an assembly which will devote 12 hours to the East Surrey Water Company and fours hours to the foreign policy of the Empire.<\/p><p>I cannot understand why my right hon. Friends opposite should speak as if the proposals of this Bill were contrary to their principles. The Bill is in fullest accord with their principles. They call themselves Imperialists. I am willing to call myself an Imperialist, if I am allowed to define the phrase. The real truth is this: The House of Commons is a diligence of the eighteenth century trying to do the work of a modern express train. The parish pump can intervene to embarrass and postpone discussion of the greatest and most important questions of our world-wide Empire. The position is a little, better now, but I remember the time when, on a sultry afternoon in July, when nine-tenths, or a considerable proportion, of the Members had gone to their spas or other resorts, the Indian Budget was brought into a House of Commons that had not more than twenty Members in attendance. It is inviting disaster thus to neglect the duties of our Imperial Parliament. Apart from my strong sympathy with the desire of the Scottish people to deal with their own affairs, I sympathise with this Bill as the first step towards that noble enlargement of the duties and character of this House which I think is equally essential to domestic peace and the maintenance of order abroad.<\/p>",

My first question is in regard to Supplementary Reserve, which is to cost them &#163;500,000 and is to consist of 350,000 men. In this Estimate I see that there are 2,158 officers to be attached to the Territorial battalions, and if that is so will they not be rather left in the air, and there will be no <i>esprit de corps.<\/i> I see that 7,900 men are to be trained. Could not these men be formed into some kind of battalions after the form of the old Special Reserve in order that they might be given some kind of <i>esprit de corps.<\/i> Under present arrangements they are very much left to themselves, and this is not an arrangement which is likely to prove attractive to the officers. My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Melton (Sir C. Yate) drew attention to the strength of the Army in India. That has been reduced in the present year from 71,109 to 61,964. Has that reduction been made with the full consent of the Commander-in-Chief in India? The Secretary of State for War, in answer to a question I put to him the other day, said the British cavalry in India had been reduced from nine regiments to six. What has happened to those six? So far as I can make out from the Army Estimates, two regiments have come home and one has gone to Palestine. Is that one in Palestine going to remain there permanently as a garrison, are barracks to be built there for them, and on whom does the charge of those three regiments which have been brought from India fall at the present time? They used to belong to, and were on the strength and in the pay of, the Indian Government. I fully realise the Army accounted for nearly one half of that Budget, and that they were very anxious to get rid of a certain number of troops, but have they thrown, at the present time, the whole of the expense on to the War Office Estimates? Besides that, the artillery in India has been reduced by over 1,000.\nDoes that mean each battery has been reduced by a few men, or that a whole brigade of artillery has been brought over? The infantry in India has been reduced by 5,500 British troops. Are they battalions which have been brought home, or a few men from each battalion? Then the signal corps has been reduced by 1,000. Can the hon. and gallant Gentleman give us an explanation as to whether the whole of the charge has been thrown on the War Office Estimates, and whether it has been done with the full consent of the Commander-in-Chief in India?<\/p><p>10.0 P.M.<\/p><p>There is another point in the Army Estimates which rather puzzles me. Why do Mauritius, Ceylon, Hong Kong, and the Straits Settlements pay contributions for the upkeep of the garrisons, whereas Bermuda, Malta, Jamaica and Sierra Leone pay nothing? Why should one pay a contribution and not the other? Why should Hong Kong pay a contribution and not Malta? Why should Ceylon, and yet Jamaica, a rich island, pay nothing? That is a little point I would like to put to the War Office for information. I see in the Estimates that the Germans are to pay &#163;1,250,000 for the upkeep of the British Army at Cologne. How are they raising that money? Is it by requisitions, or is it purely an estimate they hope they may get, and see very small promise of fulfilment? As the Secretary of State said, and we on this side all fully agree, our Army is not aggressive or Imperialistic in any form or sense. It is purely for our protection. It is our police force, and when we realise that we have no less than one-fifth of the world to protect, and a population of over 400,000,000, I think an Army of 209,000 is a very small force indeed to look after those populations. We are responsible for those people, and for the defence of those countries, and should we reduce our Army by any large amount, we should be responsible for the fate of those countries. I feel quite sure that the General Staff is taking a careful interest in the happenings in the Near East. Great changes are taking place every day. We have seen the Caliph expelled from Constantinople, and there are more surprising things than a great revival of Mohammedan religion in the East. We may again see the Arab assert his forces. The House really has no idea of how the breath of religion can sweep\nover the whole of the East. Now that the Caliph has left Constantinople, we may see a vast revival of Arab religion throughout the East, and I would ask those responsible for the strategic defence of our Empire to watch this matter most carefully, and as conditions and times change, so to change and keep up with those conditions. All that we desire on this side of the House is to see our British Army second to none in the world in its efficiency and in its training. It is not Imperialistic; it is not aggressive. It is purely for the protection of our Empire, and for that of our peoples to whom we are responsible. I feel quite confident that, in the hands of the right hon. Gentleman, after the speech to which we have listened to-day, he is the first to take advantage of all those changes and new-conditions, and of all the inventions as they turn up, and, by doing so, he will uphold that reputation which we, and all of us who have fought in the Army, and I believe most of those in this House, desire to uphold, and that he will continue to carry on those traditions that we have always had in the British Army, and which we desire to see remain.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I am sure hon. Members listened with very great interest to the explanation which was made by the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for the Colonies, but there are one or two things he said which struck me as rather peculiar. The first was when he sought to throw the onus on the Australian people for the management of the Island of Nauru. I understood that it was the League of Nations which had issued a mandate, and that this country had accepted the mandate. As we have a Commissioner appointed to represent this country, it appears to me that we are not able to shelve any responsibility, but must take the full responsibility for what happens on the Island of Nauru. We share the profits, and if there were losses we should share them. Therefore, it is up to us to see that the conditions which obtain with regard to the working of the phosphates, and all the details with regard to the organisation, are satisfactory to a nation such as we are.<\/p><p>The next thing I noticed was that the Secretary of State for the Colonies produced accounts which have not been circulated to this House. I consider that we should have been in a better position to have discussed with accuracy the granting of this money for these accounts, which we were not able properly to appreciate as they were read from the Table, if those accounts had been circulated to the House. We should then have been able to investigate them and we should have known better where we are. It appears to me that in a matter of this kind it is up to the Government to give the House all the information it possesses. Therefore, I would ask that on another occasion we might be supplied\nI with the figures which are available to the Government. I want to ask a question on the accounts with regard to this &#163;253,000 profit which has been made. Is that all profit, or does it include the interest and the sinking fund as well? According to the accounts which are given here, our share of &#163;106,504 is our share of surplus profit. I suppose business men do not include interest on capital in profit. If the interest has been earned in addition to the profits, I should like to ask where the interest is shown and how it has been accounted for.<\/p><p>I desire to ask a few questions with regard to the conditions under which the Chinese are labouring. I asked the right hon. Gentleman to lay on the Table details of the agreement that these Chinese labourers sign, and I have had the opportunity of going through these particulars. While I desire to congratulate the Commission upon the profit which has been made out of this enterprise, I do feel that in a country which is largely responsible for setting an example to the world in regard to the manner in which it treats its employ&#233;s, we ought to be assured&#8212;I do not make any allegations, but only ask questions&#8212;that the conditions under which these Chinese are labouring are such as would commend themselves to the sentiments of the British nation. I think we have a special interest in this matter. Therefore, I desire to ask a few questions. First of all, in the agreement it is stated that the wages that are paid to these Chinese are as specified later on in the agreement, but when I come carefully to search the agreement I find no record of what they are. I desire to ask what wages are paid to these Chinese workers in the Island of Nauru. Why have these wages been omitted from the copy of the agreement with which I have been supplied? Are they stated in the original agreement? If they are stated in the original agreement, have they been suppressed in the copy that has been sent to me? I notice that overtime is paid at the rate of 5d. an hour, and, therefore, if overtime is paid for at double ordinary time it would lead one to suppose that the wage paid is 2&#189;d. an hour. I do not think Members on the Labour benches will be satisfied with the payment of 2&#189;d per hour, even to Chinese labourers. I\nwant to appeal to Labour Members with regard to the several matters I am bringing forward.<\/p><p>The second question I have to ask is this. In the agreement it is stated that any piece-work arrangement that is to be made is to be made by mutual agreement. I want to ask the Committee how the Chinese labourers are in a position to stand up for their rights with, regard to piece-work arrangements when they have been brought 3,000 miles from Hong Kong or China to work in Nauru. There should be some arrangement whereby some arbitration board is appointed or some outside body to whom these Chinese labourers could appeal with regard to wages. The third question is this: Is not the contract a very one-sided contract, when three months' notice to terminate the agreement can be given to any Chinese labourer, whereas he has no right to terminate the work before the three years expire. What right have we to say to the Chinese labourer: \"We discharge you with three months' notice,\" while he has no right to terminate the agreement? I hope representatives of the Labour party are taking notice of these things, because in my opinion these clauses in this agreement are a scandal and a disgrace. It is most peculiar that there are two agreements; one the Chinese labourer is asked to sign before he leaves China, and another he is asked to sign when he arrives at Nauru. Under the first agreement five days of 9&#189; hours are to be worked, and one day, Saturday, 4&#189;, making 52 in all. When he has to sign the second agreement for three years he has to work six days of 9&#189; hours, or 57 hours. Before he leaves China the arrangement is 52 hours, and when he gets to Nauru he is faced with an agreement by which he has to work 57 hours. Is that straightforward British integrity? By this agreement a man has only six days' holiday in the year. He has his Sundays and six days' holiday. Is that agreeable to hon. Members on this side? [HON. MEMBERS: \"No!\"] If there is any emergency, any breakdown in machinery, this man is to be asked to break into his six days' holiday without any compensating day being given to him for the time he works in the emergency. [An HON. MEMBER: \"Has he any dole?\"] He deserves something. I do not know that he gets it. The last question I have to ask is the most serious of all. It is\nthis. Are any proper reasonable provisions made whereby these Chinese labourers may take with them their wives to Nauru?<\/p>",

The First Lord is responsible for the Navy to the country. During the War there were four First Lords in four years and four months, and there have been three since the War, so that there has been seven First Lords of the Admiralty in less than nine years. Consequently, the Admiralty has degenerated into a very extravagant and demoralised Department. Take first the Admiralty itself. In 1914 there were 2,000 officials in the Admiralty and 146,000 officers and fighting men. On the 1st June the figures for which are the latest that I have been able to get, the number of officials at the Admiralty was 3,555, whereas the personnel has been reduced to about 99,000 men. The proportions are rather striking. In 1914, there was one official to 70 fighters, and to-day there is one official to 28 fighting sailors. That shows to me a good deal of demoralization in the Admiralty. I need not go into the dockyards. We have one more dockyard than we had before the War, and the same number of employ&#233;s for about 46,000 less fighting men. I have often said from this box during the last three or four years that the Admiralty have been laying broad and deep the foundations for future expendi-\nture. They have established stations all over the world, every one of which must require defence in time of war. The strategy of the Admiralty has been scattered, whereas the strategy which I was taught under that very distinguished Admiral, Lord Fisher, was concentration. We have got a similar instance of scattered strategy in the establishment of a new naval base at Singapore, to which I shall ask the attention of the Committee more particularly this afternoon. Last year we had great hopes of the Washington Conference. The victorious Powers in the late War joined together at Washington to complete the Pact of Peace, and we were all proud that The British Empire took a leading part in those discussions, because peace is the policy of the British Empire. Before all things, in such a Conference frankness and goodwill were absolutely essential. We were discussing matters of grave moment with our friends and with our Allies, friends and Allies with whom we had fought a common foe and won a common victory for civilisation. This new Treaty especially dealt with the question of the Pacific, and it was stated very clearly in the Treaty that\n<q>no new fortifications or naval bases shall be established east of the meridian of 110 East longitude.<\/q>\nThat expressly excluded Hong Kong. On the 6th February, 1922, there was affixed to this document the signatures of the United States, not only of Great Britain, but of the British Empire, of France, of Italy, and of Japan. The British Government, in June, 1921, had come to a decision to establish a naval base at Singapore. My right hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, whom I congratulate, told us that it was intended to establish that base before the War. All that I can say is that I was there, and that I never heard of it, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. Asquith), who was Prime Minister, never heard of it. It is curious that we should not have heard of it. It was decided by the Coalition Government in 1921 to establish this new great fortified naval base. We went into the Conference at Washington, which resulted, as I have said, in the Treaty signed on 6th February, 1922, and we never said a word to that Conference that we proposed to establish a naval base\nwithin 355 miles of that longitude which was mentioned in the Treaty. I cannot understand why, if you were dealing with this matter with that frankness and goodwill which were so essential, you should not have communicated your intention to that Conference and have let them know exactly what you were doing. Not only was that information not communicated, but the Government, despite that Treaty signed by all these nations, have never modified their policy. It seems to me that the very basis of such Treaties must be confidence, trust and goodwill, and concealment in such matters is inconsistent with the best traditions of British statesmanship. True it was that there was no obligation to communicate the information, but, when you are negotiating on such a delicate matter with friends, it is well to treat them openly and to put all your cards on the table and not keep the ace of Singapore up your sleeve. Let us take Article 21 of this Treaty:\n<q>The United States shall arrange for a Conference eight years after the Treaty to consider what changes may be necessary to meet possible technical, naval, and scientific developments.<\/q>\nThat was provided for. Article 23 says:\n<q>The Treaty between these Powers shall remain in force until the 31st December, 1936, and shall continue in force until two years' notice of termination has been given by one of the contracting Powers.<\/q>\nApparently, neither the Admiralty nor the Government set any store at all by that Treaty. The right hon. Gentleman the First Lord of the Admiralty says:\n<q>We are helpless in the Pacific and reliant on the good will of a friendly and lately allied Power.<\/q>\nI can only say that I heard those words with pained amazement. Are we really to understand that in this year of Grace, 1923, a Treaty, solemnly entered into to last until 1936 between great Powers who are friends, is to be treated as a scrap of paper? I imagined, after the recent experience of Germany, that there would have been sanctity with regard to treaties and pledges between the nations of the world. If we are to have no sanctity for treaties and no regard for treaties, what sort of a world are we going to live in? A world bristling with armed men and stocked with weapons of war, with Great Britain, I am sorry to say, if she establishes a naval base at Singapore, leading the race in armaments? I do not know whether that is the conception of\nthe Admiralty of the future. I have said that we shall have a race in armaments. Does anybody believe for a moment that Japan has not taken cognisance of this new naval base? Does anybody believe that there will not be new naval armaments in the Pacific. And so this ruinous race will go on.<\/p><p>I propose to deal with this matter quite frankly, because this is not the moment for anything but plain speaking. The idea of a base at Singapore contemplates the possibility&#8212;I will not say the probability&#8212;of a war with Japan. There can be no other reason for it. If you do contemplate the possibility of a war with Japan, why did you sign the Washington Treaty&#8212;that is my first point&#8212;because, in contemplating such a possibility, you hamper yourselves in defence in the Pacific. The First Lord says that we are helpless and reliant on the good will of Japan. Why fetter yourselves, why fetter your freedom? You can neither enlarge nor improve the base at Hong Kong. I am going to ask about this posesssion and the establishment of a new naval base for battleships at Singapore. How do you propose to defend Hong Kong, in the case of a war with Japan, from Singapore? It is 1,444 miles away from Hong Kong. Does anybody believe, if battleships were taken to Singapore, which I very much doubt, that they would be sent 1,444 miles up to Hong Kong, with all the risks from submarines and mines and with no base whatsoever there for them to take shelter?<\/p><p>I cannot help thinking that in this matter the Admiralty have been over-clever, and over cleverness does not really answer in these great international matters. I assume that Singapore, when it is established at a cost of anything from &#163;10,000,000 to any number of million pounds, will be a base possibly like Rosyth or Portsmouth in this highly industrial land, with coal and iron and willing, skilled artisans at the disposal of the admiral in command. I remember very well the expedition to Mesopotamia. I remember some friends coming home. I have not the slightest doubt that the wiseacres who ordered the expedition to Basra imagined Basra to be a second kind of Southampton, but, instead of that, the Arabs had to take them on their shoulders from the ship to the shore. We had the other day an address from a very\ndistinguished naval officer. It was a new development. I welcomed it, but one did not like to get into a wrangle with, or ask questions of, a distinguished naval officer. I remember Lord Carson once saying that it was a great disadvantage to naval officers when they were called into the War Council, because they were cross-examined by men who were accustomed to talking, whereas they belonged to the silent Service. Besides, it is not the business of a naval officer to give answers. It is the business of the First Lord, and I propose to ask him one or two questions now about this new naval base at Singapore. Have they considered the climate of Singapore? [<i>Laughter.<\/i>] I do not know why that should excite the hilarity of the hon. and gallant Member for Portsmouth (Sir B. Falle), but all sorts of things excite his hilarity. Lord Northcliffe, in that very remarkable book published since his death, says that he was at Singapore in December, 1921, and this is what he says about it:\n<q>I do admire how the people tackle their jobs in this infernal climate, for such it is. Everything is damp. As I dictate, I am eating Huntley and Palmer's biscuits which are like putty. The men and women are wonderfully vigorous with their golf, lawn tennis, and riding.<\/q>\nWill you be able to provide all these amenities for your garrison, your artisans, and your flying men at Singapore? Will submarines be able to lie at Singapore? I should like an answer to that question, because Singapore is a very hot place, and submarines cannot well lie in these very hot climates.<\/p><p>I ask the First Lord of the Admiralty, on what scale do you propose to establish the base at Singapore and its fortifications? There must be a permanent garrison, there must be guns, there must be British soldiers there to guard the base. How many British soldiers do you propose to keep there? There is to be, we were told by the Civil Lord of the Admiralty in another place, a flying ground there. How many members of the Air Force do you propose to keep there? What is the annual cost to be? Is it be &#163;1,000,000, &#163;2,000,000 or &#163;3,000,000 a year? How many millions a year will you have to spend in maintaining this new naval base? This base must, if it is to be of service, as has been adumbrated\nby the First Lord of the Admiralty, be an immense base, always ready&#8212;because war breaks out in unexpected moments&#8212;with a vast establishment. Let us assume that this base is there, complete with all its paraphernalia&#8212;with its docks, booms, workshops, magazines, fortifications, artisans' dwellings, garrisons, and flying corps. I have had some experience of this, because I was at the Admiralty when Rosyth was constructed; therefore I know something of what happened.<\/p><p>Assume you have a war with Japan, by the new Washington Treaty we are to have 15 battleships, of 35,000 tons each, while Japan is to have nine. Does anybody for a moment believe that those 15 battleships could be sent to Singapore, which is 40 days' steam from this country, if war with Japan broke out? Does anyone believe we should send those valuable battleships, costing &#163;7,000,000 a piece, to Singapore? I take the liberty of doubting the wisdom of such a policy. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave us his idea of the future of Singapore, and quoting from the Selborne Memorandum of 20 years ago he said:\n<q>Our policy must be to seek out the ships of the enemy, wherever they are to be found, and destroy them.\"&#8212;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st May, 1923; col. 1267, Vol. 163.]<\/q>\nThat is the policy, and we have the Civil Lord of the Admiralty in another place contemplating a general action in the Pacific. Let us keep our minds clear. There is the risk of the submarine, the mine, and the aerial torpedo. In the late War, whatever may have been the freedom of movement of the Grand Fleet, the Grand Fleet did not seek out the ships of the enemy, wherever they were, and destroy them. The Grand Fleet did not go near the German ports, though its strength was two to one that of the German Navy.<\/p><p>Therefore let us clear our minds as to what we can do by seeking out the enemy ships, wherever they are to be found, and destroying them. If the Grand Fleet could not go across 300 miles of sea to the German ports, how is our Fleet to go some 10,000 miles away to seek out and destroy the Japanese Fleet? The whole thing is a piece of woolly strategy. The right hon. Gentleman says:\n<q>The decisive sea battles of our history have been fought at great distances from our shores.<\/q>\nI am afraid that such a battle as I suggest, fought by the British Fleet at such a distance, might be a decisive battle, but not in the British favour. I remember what happened to the Russian Fleet when they attacked the Japanese Fleet.<\/p>",

On the total sum foreshadowed in these Estimates, we have already cut down the amount by something like &#163;1,500,000, bringing it down to about &#163;9,500,000. This sum will be spread over a very considerable period, probably about 10 years.

            "body": "<p>Provision is made for completing one only of the four light cruisers in hand. In view of the loss of the \"Raleigh\" surely it is not too much to expect that two cruisers, at least, would be passed into commission, especially as the hon. and gallant Member for Central Hull said they were laid down seven years ago. The hon. and gallant Member tried to draw the conclusion from this fact that the men in the Royal dockyards were an idle, lazy lot of fellows, and did not do their work. That is the kind of ignorance one would expect from the hon. and gallant Member for Central Hull. He ought to polish up his knowledge and get some information with\nregard to the dockyards. Let me give him some. These men in the dockyards are some of the best workmen the country possesses. They are able to turn out a ship in as quick time as any workmen in the country. No one can deny that. If, however, the Government does not provide money for these ships, of course the ships cannot be built. If you do not provide money for anything, the thing is not done, nor do men work on ships for which no money is provided. Their Lordships of the Admiralty, during the last seven years, have not provided the money for these cruisers. It is only reasonable to suppose that they have not had the money in hand, and so have been unable even to finish one of the cruisers. That is the explanation, which I wish the hon. and gallant Member for Central Hull were here so that he might understand.<\/p><p>The question of fuel was referred to by the Noble Lord the Member for South Battersea (Viscount Curzon) as all important. It is, of course, no use building ships if they cannot steam under their own fuel. I should like the First Lord to explain the reference in the Naval Estimates to merchant shipbuilding. I see a note,\n<q>that nothing at present is being done in this direction. <\/q>\nAre we to understand that the Admiralty have given up all ideas of building merchant ships in the Royal yards, or is that only under present conditions? There are one or two points in regard to the dockyards to which I should like to refer, chief of which is the matter of the recent discharges of the apprentices and ex-apprentices. A very great mistake has been made in this direction. Here are boys who have been trained with a great deal of care; whose parents have spent a large amount of money on bringing them up, and giving them the school education necessary in order that they might pass the examination, success in which they naturally had some reason to believe would give them a position for life. Instead of that, they have been practically turned on the streets. I am amazed that this should be done after the First Lord's statement, the other day, that apart from the new shipbuilding programme there would be plenty of work to keep the present staff fully occupied for some years to come. No sooner had the right hon. Gentleman\nsaid that than 100 apprentices in Devon-port Dockyard, with five and a half years' training, were sent adrift. [HON. MEMBERS: \"Shame!\"] What are these men to do? They are men who have worked their way up as apprentices; they are worth something to the country; and it is the duty of the country to see that they are provided with some kind of work. I understand that a deputation was at the Admiralty yesterday upon this very subject. The same deputation came to me. I should like to ask the First Lord whether he received that deputation, and what answer he gave to the points they raised.<\/p><p>There was a Question which was down on the Paper in my name to-day, but which was not reached. I wanted to know, from the First Lord of the Admiralty,\n<q>if he will consider the desirability of allowing men in His Majesty's dockyards who are so desirous to retire and receive the pension or gratuity to which they are entitled, thus avoiding the discharge of younger men now under notice? <\/q>\nWill the right hon. Gentleman tell me if that is possible, and if not, why is it not possible? I want to say a word about the unestablished writers employed in the Royal dockyards and the naval establishments, who entered after 4th August, 1914, and who are required to pass a qualifying examination before being placed on the Established List. Those failing have to be discharged. That seems all right so far as it goes, but lot us look a little further. These men passed a Civil Service examination in order to obtain entry into the dockyards. They were not allowed to compete at the examinations held for absorbing the temporary staffs, although the temporary staffs had no Civil Service examination to pass. The majority of these writers have boon in the yards for six or eight years. Some were not of age when they went into the yards, but since they were admitted to the yards in the naval establishments, they ought to have the opportunity of getting on with their work. They were allowed in many cases to go to the War on their coming of age. Boy writers admitted to the yards and naval establishments in February, 1914, are being established without further qualification. It is unfair to make this distinction between them. We have been told that hired writers de-\nsiring appointments to old Class Dockyard clerks, grade 3, were required to take part in a limited competitive examination. That may have been so, but unfortunately no examination has not been held since 1914, and those who failed have been assimilated and established without further effort.<\/p><p>There is one other point in regard to Dockyard employees. The established workmen in the yards claim that they should have some kind of leave, with pay given to them, during the time they are absent on leave. Civil servants in other walks of life, except dockyard men, get leave with pay, for some days during the period of their work. Unfortunately, the men in the dockyards are not given this privilege. They have also to submit to a deduction from their pay in order that they may attain a pension. This deduction for superannuation allowance is a somewhat severe one, and if a man dies he gets no compensation for it. In addition to that, I would point out that when a man gets what is called \"an appointment\" in the Civil Service&#8212;it is a pity that the hon. Member for North Camberwell is out of the House at this moment&#8212;he obtains what is called a rise, a little extra pay, equal to or above the amount he has to pay for his superannuation. Why not apply that to the men in the dockyards? Why should they not have a little extra pay, instead of having their pay cut down as they do now?<\/p><p>My hon. Friend below me has spoken about the naval reductions, and told us what he has done. No doubt he did a great deal, and no doubt other hon. Members did a great deal also. I will not say what I have done. The great thing is that it has been done, and whether it was done by the hon. Member or by myself does not make much difference. We want the House to realise that this is not fair to discharge these men with a paltry &#163;20. They have to pay &#163;70 if they want to buy themselves out of the Navy, and yet, on compulsory retirement, their engagements are practically broken, and they have to be content with a paltry &#163;20. A great number of these men have their homes in the West country. It costs them a fair amount of money to get up to London, and a man coming up to town from the West country is not likely to have much of the &#163;20 left after a few weeks are out. I would, there-\nfore, suggest to the First Lord of the Admiralty to see if he cannot give them a little more.<\/p><p>Then there is the question of commissioned marriage allowance for officers, including air warrant officers risen from the ranks. Five units out of six, taking the Services altogether, are receiving this, but not naval officers. Then men in the Army, Navy and Air Force receive a marriage allowance, and so do the men in the Navy, but not the officers. I trust the First Lord will look into the matter. Again, there is a question of officers' widows' pensions. Ordinarily pensions of widows of officers of and from warrant rank up to 13th August, 1920, were &#163;25 for warrant officer, &#163;30 for commissioned officer from warrant rank, and &#163;50 for a lieutenant. Since that date the pensions of the widows of officers have come up for consideration, and those from commander to Admiral of the Fleet have been amended, but the rates for the widows of warrant officers were left over for consideration. The higher officers have increased pensions, but that is not the case with lieutenants' widows. They are still on the same basis as before the War. It is quite impossible, for things to go on in that way. In the current quarterly Navy List, what do we see? That this matter is still under consideration. But it has been under consideration for two years, and I think hon. Members in all parts of the House will consider that the time has arrived when something should be clone to settle the question.<\/p><p>I come to the question of the coastguards. I do not say much about the men being transferred from one Department to another, for I have no doubt they will have a certain amount of compensation, and I have no doubt the Department in which they are now engaged will look after them just as much as the Department from which they have come. But bear this in mind, the men in the Navy always looked forward to fill these positions. As a reward for long service at sea they became coastguards. You go into the Navy now with no chance of ever becoming a coastguard, or of getting a \"cushy\" job after long years of hard work at sea. That is all swept away and nothing has been said about it. I think it only right that the First Lord should have something to say on\nthis point. Then with regard to the ventilation of the ships. Complaint is constantly made that ships are not properly ventilated, and there is a good deal of truth in this contention. We know what happened to the \"Vindictus,\" that went out to Hong Kong the other day. She was overcrowded, and although she had to go through the tropics, was without refrigerators, both the accommodation and the ventilation on the ship was very bad.<\/p><p>In conclusion, let me put this one more point to the First Lord. We have heard a good deal of what the Overseas Dominions are going to do for the Navy. But no definite statement of any kind has yet been made. They did something during the War both in ships and contributions; but what is to be their position in the altered circumstances? The First Lord says that owing to the Washington Conference the Dominions cannot build any more ships. Hence the Navy to-day stands responsible for the defence of the whole Empire. That being so, I think that the time has come that the Dominions should consider what proportion they are going to pay. I should like to ask the First Lord of the Admiralty to lose no time whatever in calling together a Naval Conference from all parts of the Empire so that we may know on what footing we are in regard to what I should like to see&#8212;an Imperial Navy!<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>The last time I had the privilege of addressing the House on this subject was on the 15th of December, 1920, just after my return from the East. I have had several opportunities since of visiting the East, and I am of the same opinion to-day as I was two years ago. At the General Election I stated\nperfectly plainly on all my platforms that it was my profound and convinced belief that we should remain in Mesopotamia until such time as we had established sound and stable government there. I am, as I always have been, pro-French and pro-Turk. I will put forward three reasons why I think we should at the present time retain Mesopotamia. There are very many people in this country who are determined that all our sacrifices there shall not be in vain and that we ought not to be robbed of the fruits of victory, and we are all fully aware that there are many other countries who are as fully aware as we are of the importance of Mesopotamia financially, commercially, and strategically. I know full well that we cannot expect to reap any benefit immediately, but to my mind these are minor points. What I do wish to impress on the House from my own experience of that country is the geographical and strategical position of Mesopotamia as far as the British Empire is concerned. It is in my humble judgment of paramount importance to the British Empire and to the safety of Europe and also of the East. We are often asked for a definition of a great statesman. I venture to suggest that a great statesman is a man who can anticipate events and have foresight to look forward to the future, and to legislate 25 or 50 years ahead. One of the greatest acts of diplomacy in this country was in November, 1875, when in this House, against enormous opposition both in this House, outside this House, and in the Press, Mr. Disraeli insisted on buying the Suez Canal shares. By that means he established a high water way to the East and a link between England and the Indian Empire. Now history may be repeating itself to-day. There is no doubt, as far as our Empire is concerned, that by possessing strategic points throughout the whole world we have been able to maintain the British Empire in the position in which it is to-day. Imagine the jaundiced eye of a German skipper going from Hamburg to Shanghai when he beholds the Union Jack floating at Dover, at Gibraltar, at Suez, at Aden, at Colombo, at Singapore, and Hong Kong. He would feel inclined to say, like the man who saw a giraffe for the first time at the Zoo, \"it simply ain't\ntrue.\" It is an eye-opener to the man who goes out there for the first time.<\/p><p>The first time I visited Turkey was 27 years ago, and I watched there with the very keenest interest, and also with the deepest concern the rising ascendancy of German influence and power and the corresponding set-back of British prestige in that country. For 15 years prior to 1914 the Germans were working and negotiating every day for the concession of the Bagdad railway. Berlin to Bagdad was part, and I think the greatest part, of their dream of world-wide dominion. I believe their ultimate goal was India at that time. Look at the importance of that concession; they knew what they were about. If they were working for that concession, surely it is worth our while to take note and to see that we should take a hand. Whereas they could get from Hamburg to Berlin, from Berlin to Vienna and on to Constantinople and Aleppo&#8212;which in future will be the great Clapham Junction of the East&#8212;where porters could soon be shouting \"Change here for India, Abyssinia, and Cape Town.\" If they laid such great stress on that, we would be foolish if we did not take a hint from them. Not only does it affect us because Aleppo is the junction there, but it is next to the most important seaport of the eastern Mediterranean, Alexandretta. I agree that no one who is even occasionally threatened with intelligence would accuse the Germans of losing any opportunity for want of foresight. They are essentially a race whose bump of acquisitiveness has always been enormously developed. A great French statesman, Mirabeau, said a hundred years ago \"the national industry of Prussia is war.\" The Germans were taking no chances. They wanted an alternative route, a route by water. Directly they got the concession for the Bagdad railway, bills were passed in the Reichstag for linking up by canals the Elbe, the Oder, the Rhine and the Danube, so that they could be able to send their destroyers straight from the Baltic and the North Sea to the Black Sea. At present there is a connecting canal from Aschaffenberg through Bavaria to Passau above Vienna. That was, in 1914, widened and deepened to allow vessels of 2,000 tons to pass through at that time, so we cannot complain of the Germans not having foresight and not paying a great deal\nof attention to Mesopotamia and the East. After the peace with Russia, the Reichstag passed another Bill for a canal from the Gulf of Riga to the Dnieper, thereby giving them another alternative route. If they had had the Bagdad railway and these canals linked up they would have been on the high road to the East; they would have had a waterway to the East, and their fleet behind the Dardanelles forts could have commanded our Mediterranean trade.<\/p><p>I have heard some people say that as Russia let us down it would serve Russia right to be ruled by Germany and that we should not interfere. That\" is a most dangerous doctrine, especially when we consider that 80 per cent, of the Russian peasants are absolutely illiterate and helpless. I put two points before the House. Giving us the Bagdad Railway, we have a land route to the East, and by the Suez Canal we have an alternative waterway to the East. If there were danger in Egypt and that canal were blown up, we could rely on the high road through Mesopotamia to the East. Apart from the importance to us of Mesopotamia as the high road to India and the East, it is all-important in my humble judgment as a buffer State for the peace of Europe. To the south you have Egypt; on the east the persian Gulf and India; on the north-east Armenia, Persia and Georgia; and on the north-west the volcanic Balkan States and Bessarabia, which is likely to give us trouble at any time. I lay great stress on our situation at Mesopotamia as a buffer State for the peace of Europe, and I believe that if we remain there until we have that stable government established, we will be the messengers of peace in that part of the world.<\/p><p>We have heard a good deal about economy so far as Mesopotamia is concerned. We are all economical, or we try to be, but I am sure there is no patriot who is ever out for economy at the expense of British prestige. It is all very easy for us to give popular votes to please constituents, but this is not a passing phase of that sort at all. When we vote now we are voting to maintain the strength and dignity of the Empire, not for ourselves, but for many generations yet unborn. Many may not have had the opportunity of studying this subject; many may not have cared to do so, and many have not\nhad the opportunity to go there. That is not their fault or our fault; it is the fault of our insular position. There are some people whose only knowledge of Mesopotamia is gleaned from the Book of Genesis. May I say most respectfully that some of us are far too apt to be too parochial? We think far too little of these great and powerful nations which surround us, and far too much of our own particular parish at home. Now, there are two ways of holding Mesopotamia. We can hold it by battalions or without them. We all wish to hold Mesopotamia without them, but there is one condition precedent to that, and that is a strong, lasting peace with our old friend the Turk. I believe sincerely, and I hope, that that alliance will come about at the earliest possible moment. I believe that Mosul is essential to Mesopotamia, is part and parcel of that province. I feel sure that when we have this alliance with the Turk that he will see it in the same light; he will recognise that it can only be part and parcel of the province of Mesopotamia. I have always taken the very keenest interest in all Eastern questions. I am profoundly convinced that we should not at any cost let go our grip and hold upon Mesopotamia for reasons I have already given. I believe that commercially, financially, strategically and geographically this is one of the most important spots in the whole British Empire at the present time, and also for the peace of Europe, which ultimately will moan the peace of the world. I maintain on this ground that we should support our occupation of Mesopotamia, on patriotic grounds, and also on the ground of peace&#8212;on both these grounds. In that way we will still keep our Empire solid and intact and in the forefront of every nation of the world, a position it has held for centuries in the past, and, with God's help, will hold for centuries to come.<\/p>",

I think it is clear, from the comparison I have given, that, so far from\nimporting into our maintenance of the one-power standard a spirit of keen and jealous competition, we have, on the contrary, interpreted that standard with a latitude which can only be justified by our desire to avoid provoking competition in armaments and by our conception of the special relationship of good will and mutual understanding which exists between ourselves and the United States. It is with the same latitude that we have also dealt with the problem of the balance of naval power as compared with Japan in Far Eastern and Pacific waters, spreading out over a long number of years the preparations in respect of oil fuel bases and the improvement of docking facilities which, if we feared any serious divergence of policy, let alone the possibility of actual conflict, we should be bound to press forward and carry into effect immediately.<\/p><p>I may be asked by hon. Members opposite why, if we contemplate no conflict, or even friction, with the great naval Powers which I have named, should we attempt, in our present difficult financial position, to aim even at equality? The German fleet is at the bottom of Scapa Flow; we have no other immediate menace to fear; why should not we drop quietly, for a time at any rate, into the second or third place? I would ask hon. Members, do they really think that it is possible for us, of all nations&#8212;we who have everything at stake on the sea&#8212;even in times of profoundest peace, even when the horizon seems fairest, to run the risk of being obviously and demonstrably inferior to any other Power, however friendly that Power may be? There is no certainty in the domain of international affairs. The clearest sky may be suddenly overclouded, and nations may be swept from their peaceful course by a storm which has sprung up almost without warning. Rut one thing is certain. A great -Navy, once let clown, cannot be re-improvised in an emergency. It is not only that the ships take years to build; the training and instinct required to handle that amazing complex of mechanism, a modern battleship, need a generation to teach. Is there any Government, whatever its political complexion, which could afford to gamble with our whole existence on the probability of perpetual world peace? We,\nat any rate, are not prepared to run that risk or to incur that terrible responsibility.<\/p><p>As a matter of fact, if we did contemplate the contingency of serious difference with any other Power in the near future, we should certainly not be justified in resting content with a one-power standard, or one interpreted in so easy-going a spirit. We have never done so before. During the years of rivalry and contention between ourselves and the Russo-French Alliance at the end of the last century, we laid down as our general guiding standard that of two Powers to one&#8212;a two-power standard. More than that, we took good care to interpret that two-power standard so as to give ourselves a very substantial margin of strength over the combined forces of any possible adversaries. That margin preserved the peace when the sudden crisis arose over Fashoda in 1898. A year later it saved us from the possibility&#8212;by no means a remote possibility&#8212;of joint German, French and Russian intervention in the South African War. When the menace of German naval ambitions displaced the older rivalry with France and Russia, we fixed that margin at a 60 per cent. superiority in capital ships. Will anyone suggest to-day that we ought to have fixed it at a lower margin?<\/p><p>If, then, we do dispense with such a margin, if we are content with an easy equality, it is just because there are no underlying rivalries or conflicts of purpose which could bring a war within the zone of reasonable probability in the near future, and because there is a widespread desire for peace and for relief from the burden of armaments, which we, on our part, have done everything by our example to encourage. But there is a limit to the risk we can afford to run by weakening ourselves in order to promote peace&#8212;if, indeed, we do promote peace by going beyond that limit&#8212;and we have reached it. I should be failing in my duty to this House and to the country if I suggested the possibility of further reductions in our strength in succeeding years. On the contrary, I must ask the House to keep clearly in mind that these are exceptional Estimates, framed to meet an exceptional financial situation, and that the economies which we have achieved are, in part, at any rate, due to the postponement of necessary ex-\npenditure which will have to be made up with the return of more normal conditions.<\/p><p>No part of the task of carrying through this scheme of reduction has been so difficult and painful as that which has been concerned with the cutting down of personnel. The terms of compensation for loss of career and prospects which we fixed for officers and men have, I think, been generally regarded as meeting the case fairly, and even generously, in so far as money compensation can ever meet such a case. We offered these terms in the first instance for voluntary acceptance, hoping in this way to discover those to whom the compensation might, for one reason or another, be a real inducement to leave, and so reduce compulsory discharges to a minimum. As regards the men, we, to a very large extent, attained our object. Of 12,250 men to be discharged, all except 550 have applied voluntarily. That we have been compelled, in the last few weeks of the financial year, to select even 550 for compulsory discharge is in itself regrettable, but the relative figures for voluntary and compulsory discharges prove that our terms did in the main appeal to the men.<\/p><p>As regards officers, the terms have appealed to about two-thirds of the total of 2,000 who will have left by the end of the financial year, but this has been mainly in the warrant officer class and in the non-executive branches. Among executive officers the reduction has had to be made almost entirely by compulsory selection. The lists had already been most drastically weeded out by previous reductions, and there had been practically no inferior officers left to eliminate. The task with which the Board of Admiralty have been confronted has been the anxious and truly invidious task of scrutinising records in order to find some way of deciding who among officers of high ability and distinguished service could be said to be even a shade behind their fellows. It was impossible that selection carried out under such conditions should not give rise to heartburning and disappointment; but it does speak well for the patient care and fairness with which the Sea Lords have carried out their painful task that their verdict has been so generally accepted.<\/p><p>A period of cutting down such as we have just passed through is not only dis-\ncouraging to the service itself but to those outside who are thinking of joining or allowing their sons to join; but. I believe I can venture to give both to the service and to the parents the assurance that we have reached the limit of possible reduction, and that they need not fear a recurrence of any other such period as that through which the Navy has just passed. As every care has been taken in the present reductions, both as regards officers and men, to avoid creating the possibility of blocks in promotion in future, I think I can say with confidence that the prospects of those who arc now entering the Navy, in all ranks, are as good as they have been in the past.<\/p><p>There is one further item in the reduction of naval personnel to which I ought to make special reference. The coastguard which was transferred from the Board of Customs to the Board of Admiralty in 1856 has, under modern conditions, ceased to be of direct value to the fighting Navy. Except for certain wireless operations, its work has in fact been entirely devoted to purposes for which the Board of Trade and the Board of Customs are responsible. It is obvious that a system under which one Department does the work and pays for it and another Department prescribes what it wants done is not likely to be economical. The change which has now been decided upon, following the recommendations of the Geddes Committee and of the Special Committee which sat under the chairmanship of Sir William Mitchell Thomson, has certainly resulted in a very considerable economy of personnel. In place of 2,925 coastguards under the Admiralty, there will be 352 for the naval shore wireless service, 935 coastguards for life saving service under the Board of Trade, and 450 for the preventive service under the Customs&#8212;a total saving of nearly 1,200 men.<\/p><p>There seems to be some apprehension in certain quarters that the efficiency of the coast watching service will suffer by the transfer to the Board of Trade. As the decision of the site of stations has always rested with the Board of Trade, and as the personnel will, in the main, be the same, recruited in the first instance from the present coastguard, and in future from retired naval officers and pensioners, it is not easy to see in what respect the efficiency of the service could really be adversely affected. There are, I know, cer-\ntarn difficulties connected with the particular stations which are now being administered for Lloyds by the Admiralty under a contract, but pending a settlement of this difficulty the Admiralty have arranged with the Board of Trade to retain control and management of these stations for a further three months until the end of June.<\/p><p>No legislation will be required for the transfer of the life-saving service to the Board of Trade, though legislation will be necessary to enable the Admiralty formally to divest itself of responsibility in respect of its revenue duties, and to transfer to the Board of Trade power to take over those duties, in so far as at certain points they cannot be carried out by the Board of Customs direct. This need not, however, delay the transfer which is to take place on the 31st March. The existing Coastguard will on that date be discharged with the discharge gratuity to which their services entitle them, plus an additional gratuity as compensation for the curtailment of their naval careers, proportioned to the years of expected service lost. Of this latter gratuity, a portion, in no case exceeding one-half, will have to be refunded on entering the new service of the Board of Trade or the Board of Customs.<\/p><p>As regards the dockyard personnel, we have, I trust, also come, with the last heavy cut of some 10,000 men, to the end of the period of unsettlement and discouragement inevitably consequent upon a period of reduction. Apart from any question of new shipbuilding programmes, there is plenty of work to keep the present staff fully occupied for some years to come, a condition of things which ought to enable us not only to retain our men, but to get the best work out of them. There has already been a very satisfactory improvement in the output of work with the return of more normal and stable conditions. Here, too, the process of reduction has had its painful and anxious side. It has inevitably added to the volume of unemployment, already serious, in the great dockyard centres, which depend almost entirely on Admiralty work for their livelihood, and which consequently felt the full and direct loss resulting from measures of economy, whose countervailing gains will only come back to them slowly and indirectly in the course of a general improvement in our trade condi-\ntions. I am glad to say, however, that in connection with the general measures for the relief of unemployment this w inter, the Admiralty were authorised to devote sonic of the unexpended surplus in the current Estimates to taking on about 1.000 unemployed men for work during the last few months.<\/p><p>All these reductions in personnel and in the material strength of our establishments have made it more necessary than ever to devote our attention to those imponderable things that matter even more than numbers or armaments, and take even longer to make good. I mean to education and training, to scientific research, to the sound organisation of our staff work, and the fostering and strengthening of all the great traditions which have made the Navy what it always has been, not only a sure shield, but a quickening and inspiring element in the life of the nation. I have been privileged in the last few months to see something of this inner aspect of the Navy. Two impressions in particular stand out in my mind. One is that of treading the hallowed decks of the Victory&#8212;Nelson's flagship, and still the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth&#8212;and realising how the spirit of Nelson and the Nelson tradition still pervade and dominate the whole life of the Service. The \"Victory\" has now been saved from possible disaster by being brought into dock, where she is shored up, and receiving such repairs as are necessary for her salvation. The further task of clearing away the new bows and other superstructure added after 1820 and restoring her to the exact state in which she fought at Trafalgar is one which we feel we cannot, in these difficult times, treat as a strictly naval requirement, to be paid for out of Navy Estimates. We can only hope that the appeal which Admiral Sturdee is making to the patriotic generosity of the public throughout the Empire will meet with a sufficient response. The House is already aware that one anonymous well-wisher of the Navy has made a splendid gift of &#163;50,000 towards the &#163;150,000 required.<\/p><p>My other impression, at the very opposite end of the historical scale, is that of the Cadets at Dartmouth, the boys who are destined to carry on and develop, under new conditions, the great traditions of the past. I do not think it would be possible to find anywhere a finer training\nschool, a better all-round education of mind, spirit, and body, amid more beautiful and inspiring surroundings, or a keener, manlier lot of boys than are to be found there. The noble building which has taken the place of the old Britannia has, thanks to the intimate collaboration of naval officers and public schoolmasters to give it each of their best, truly become what Milton wished his ideal school to be &#8212;a place where young men are\n<q>stirred up with high hopes of living to be brave men and worthy patriots, dear to God; where they shall have an abundance of exercises, which shall keep them healthy, nimble, strong and well in breath; which, being tempered with precepts of true fortitude and patience, will turn into a national valour, and make them hate the cowardice of doing wrong.<\/q>\nI have specially mentioned Dartmouth, but my impression of all the naval educational establishments and specialist schools, whether for officers or men, is the same. There is everywhere the same adaptation of the traditions of the past to the imperative needs of modern science; the same simple, direct spirit fearlessly tackling the immense complexities and responsibilities of the problem of the future. The sailor's life is one continuous process of education in technical proficiency as well as in responsibility. The one danger is that the demands of the teacher and specialist may encroach too much upon the time given, especially in youth, to what, after all, remains the foundation of all things in a great Navy, the understanding and love of the sea. After all, in the last resort, it is not science alone that counts in the critical moment, but science at the disposal of the quick eye and the instant decision, in the teeth it may he of a bitter gale or in the appalling and bewildering conditions of a great battle.<\/p><p>5.0 P.M.<\/p><p>I do not think that anyone who has not been brought into direct contact with the problems of a modern navy can realise the technical transformation which has been wrought in recent years, a transformation which has been immensely accelerated by the experience of the late War. The Navy of to-day and to-morrow is almost as different from the Navy of 20 years ago as that Navy was from the Navy of the old sailing ship days. The development of wireless, of mining and\ncounter-mining, of submarine attack and defence, of aviation&#8212;all these things have transformed the work, and with it the organization of the Navy. It is the failure to realise this that has been responsible for some of the criticism of \"shore establishments,\" as if these were unnecessary accretions to the active work of the Fleet, places of refuge in which superfluous officers and men are tucked away and draw their pay while waiting for something to do. On the contrary, these establishments are training schools and research establishments of the most intensive character, and are indispensable to the efficiency of the Navy under modern conditions. No part of the money we are spending in these Estimates is better spent than that which is devoted to them, and the relative increase in the sums spent on Votes 5 and 6, the Educational and Scientific Services in the total Estimates, to-day, as compared with pre-War figures, is, I confidently claim, evidence of the truest economy, of the determination to achieve the greatest future results from the minimum of total expenditure in the present.<\/p><p>It is this same profound difference in the character of the post-War Navy that accounts in no small measure for the difference in central organisation which is reflected in Vote 12. The increase in that Vote over pre-War figures is, of course, due in large measure to the great increase in salaries and wages which applies to the Civil Service generally. It is in part due to the clearing up of the post-War financial situation to which has to be added the heavy extra work of carrying through the programme of reductions. It is also in part due to extra duties imposed upon the Admiralty by Parliament. Marriage allowances, welfare development, Whitley Councils, Naval voting&#8212;all these things are good in themselves, no doubt, but they involve a great amount of extra work, which is necessarily reflected in the numbers and cost of the Admiralty staff. It is due even more to the increasing complexity of modern warfare. Every new weapon, every new electrical or mechanical device has to be dealt with in the Admiralty on its technical merits. But it does not stand by itself. It affects design and construction. It affects tactics and training, it raises a score of new problems which\nsomeone has to work out. To starve the thinking Departments which have to deal with these problems and whose right conclusions on these problems may make the difference between the saving and the waste of tens of millions, would, surely, be the height of unwisdom.<\/p><p>In many ways we suffered in the late War as the result of inadequate headquarters' staff organization, and for us to set up our admitted inadequacy of those days as the ideal to which we should revert in post-War times would be to flout every lesson of experience. These Estimates are, in the main, not the work of politicians or of buraucrats, but of practical sailors; of men imbued with the conviction that the strength of the Service is the ship; who think in terms of the naval battle and not of the office stool. If they in their endeavour to secure the very maximum of fighting efficiency for a given sum of money have decided that they have carried out all the reductions in the staff of the Admiralty which present conditions allow of, we may presume, not unreasonably, that their judgment in this respect is not less sound or less unprejudiced than in regard to any other Votes comprised in these Estimates.<\/p><p>Some brief references are made in the memorandum, supplemental to my explanatory statement, to the activities of the Navy during the current year. I need not expand these now, except in regard to one or two points. I think the House will be glad to know that the visit of the \"Hood\" and \"Repulse\" to Rio de Janeiro, on the occasion of the Brazilian centenary celebrations last autumn, was an unqualified success. The impression created by the appearance of those two splendid ships was great in itself. But it was surpassed by the impression created by the bearing and conduct of our officers and men, who not only showed themselves to be good sportsmen&#8212;they gained nine firsts out of 15 athletic events&#8212;but gentlemen, who realised that they wore each and all responsible for the credit of their country. I sincerely hope that this good impression may not be allowed to he obliterated and fade away, but that in one way or another the Navy may regain more frequent touch with the prosperous and progressive nations of the South American Continent.<\/p><p>The most important and significant part of the Navy's work in the past year has been in connection with the events in the Near East. I would remind the House that it, was thanks to the presence of the Navy and the authority exercised by our Commanders that the evacuation of Smyrna was successfully carried out, and that in barely a fortnight, working in conjunction with the United States, nearly 200,000 Greek and Armenian refugees were safely got away. When the subsequent crisis in our relations with Turkey arose, the Mediterranean Fleet was rapidly reinforced and concentrated in Turkish waters. An improvised battalion of Marines was at once despatched to Constantinople to reinforce the Army, large numbers of guns were mounted and manned by the Navy at the Dardanelles, and large parties of seamen landed to help the Army in digging trenches at Chanak. The pressure of military and naval power in conjunction has never been exercised for the preservation of peace more efficaciously than it was during those critical weeks.<\/p><p>The temporary reinforcement of the Mediterranean fleet is, however, I believe, only the first step in our gradual return to a more normal distribution of the Navy after the abnormal concentration in home waters imposed on us by the development of that German menace. The main task of the Navy is, after all, not to act as coastguard to the United Kingdom, but to keep open everywhere the seas whose freedom is our very life-breath and the condition of our existence as an Empire. The distribution of the Navy must depend on the strategic circumstances of any given time. But the Navy must be free to go anywhere. It is not free to go anywhere to-day owing to the fact that we have neither supplies of oil nor the docking and repairing facilities required to give it the necessary mobility. We can at present neither send our battle fleet to the Far East nor maintain it there.<\/p><p>It is to remedy that situation that we are gradually building up our chain of oil reserves at the various strategic points on our ocean routes, and that we are now making a beginning on a very small scale with the necessary preparations for eventually creating at Singapore a Naval base capable of dealing with the requirements of a fleet of modern capital ships.<\/p><p>At present there is no dock in British territory in the East capable of taking a capital ship. The Washington Treaty precludes us from expanding and developing Hong Kong, and, as a matter of fact, the position of Singapore on the direct route to the Far East and on the flank of our commercial and strategic line of communications with Australia is naturally the one best suited for our purpose. It is for us almost what the Panama Canal is to the United States, our gateway to the Pacific. The ultimate development of this base, with the necessary graving docks and locks, workshops and stores, will cost some &#163;11,000,000, but this will be spread over a long period of years. Only &#163;200,000 in all will be required in the present Estimates for preparatory work, and only comparatively small sums in the near future.<\/p><p>There is in this, of course, no suggestion of any difficulties in our relations with Japan. On the contrary, if there were even an apprehension of such difficulties we should not be dealing in such leisurely fashion with what is an indispensable prerequisite of any strategic action in the Pacific. We are simply carrying out at our own time a measure essential to the performance by the Fleet of its proper function in Imperial defence. We have often in the past in appealing to the Dominions to co-operate more effectively in the naval defence of the Empire reminded them that their destiny might be settled by an action in the North Sea. It is equally necessary for us to remember that our destiny may in the future, as in our past history, depend on what happens in the most distant seas of the world. I want to insist more particularly on this point, that our existence depends on the freedom of the Navy to keep open the seas of the world, because it has been so largely obscured by the impressions of the late War. The Navy did keep them open for us and closed to our enemies, and this was the main cause of our winning the War. But because it happened to do so in and from the North Sea we are apt to fall into the mistake of thinking that the chief task of the Navy was to hold the narrow seas.<\/p><p>And this leads to the even more serious error of supposing that because the local problem of the defence of the narrow seas has been profoundly affected, as it\nhas, by the development of aviation, that the importance of the Navy has thereby been diminished in our scheme of defence, or even that aerial defence is in some way or other destined to supersede naval defence. The importance of the air is bound to develop enormously and will increasingly affect our social and economic life as well as the problems of our defence. But that will not alter the fundamental physical and mechanical fact that the surface between water and air will always remain the plane in which the greatest weight&#8212;and consequently the greatest potential offensive and defensive strength&#8212;can be propelled the greatest distance with the least expenditure of effort. The sea will always remain the chief base of world wide mobile power. But undoubtedly the effective exercise of sea-power itself will be profoundly influenced by the use of the new weapon of the air.<\/p><p>How this can best be done is a question on which, as the House is, of course, perfectly aware, the Admiralty and the Air Ministry have taken different views. The Air Ministry hold&#8212;I trust I am not misrepresenting their views&#8212;that as the air is one continuous element the concentration and unification of all forms of air warfare under a single control will lead to the greatest efficiency. The Admiralty is not concerned with laying down so broad a general principle. It does not claim control, for instance, over air operations conducted over the sea from shore bases, or wish to revive the old Naval Air Service. But it claims that the naval air work which is directly a part of the naval battle, which is based on the fighting fleet itself, is so vital and integral a part of work of the Navy, so identical in its essential characteristics with the work done by the other naval weapons which contribute to the same result, that it can be most effectively done only as part of the same Service. This difference of points of view affecting two great Services can only be settled by the kind of inquiry which the Prime Minister has announced. It is to be hoped, in the interests of the efficiency of both Services, that it will be settled with the least possible delay.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>In reference to stores, I am very sorry to see the First Lord continue his policy in the same direction. The First Lord tells us that\nit is justified only by the financial situation and the passive atmosphere in the sphere of naval armaments. But in the matter of stores, especially oil fuel and fuel abroad, it is necessary to have a constant supply. It is not much good spending a large amount of money on ships if we cannot steam them under their own fuel. For myself I do not see the placid atmosphere. I read the other day&#8212;the hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Newbold) will correct me if I am wrong&#8212; that Russia was spending some of her ill-gotten gains on building a navy. \"We ought to have fuel stations where the ships which we have built could he supplied with oil fuel.\" On page 4 of the statement the First .Lord says: \"We do not propose to lay down any new ships in 1923&#8211;1924.' If hon. Members turn to page 12, they will see that the First Lord says that during the year progress will be made with new construction and reconstruction. Surely the two statements conflict. No doubt the First Lord will give us some explanation? Will he tell us what new construction he refers to on page 12? Are we to have no new cruisers laid down? We had four cruisers laid down between 1916 and 1918; only one of them has been nearly finished, the \"Frobisher.\" In view of the loss of the \"Raleigh\" two at least of those cruisers should by now have passed into the Service. But that is not to be. And we are to have no new cruisers. That is a mistake. I would suggest that if possible the First Lord should reconsider his decision.<\/p><p>I was glad to see that there are to be no further discharges in the dockyards. I hope that the First Lord will emphasise that to the greatest possible extent, because it is essential that men now engaged in the dockyards should be certain that they will not be discharged. But what about the apprentices and ex-apprentices who have been discharged? Is there no hope of bringing them back and making some provision for them? The apprentices of the Navy, Army and Air Force are invariably retained. Is it not possible, even now, to make it a <i>sine qua non<\/i> that apprentices and ex-apprentices of the Royal Yards shall be established? Nothing is said in the memorandum about dockyard wages. May I take it that there will be no further reductions? I should be glad to have a statement on that point, and also to know\nwhether the Admiralty letter sent me the other day with regard to Devonport Ropery is correct, and whether it will be maintained, or whether there is any prospect of it being transferred to Chatham.<\/p><p>I must say a word about unestablished writers. The decision that those employed in the Royal Dockyards and Naval Establishments and who entered after August are required to pass a qualifying examination before they are placed on the Establishment, and that if they do not pass they will be discharged, is causing much dissatisfaction amongst the boy writers and ex-boy writers. These boys were not allowed to compete in the examinations held for absorbing the temporary staffs, although the temporary staffs had no Civil Service examination to pass. The majority of them have between six and eight years' service. I ask the First Lord whether he can give some explanation why this difference should be observed. Then there is the question of the Admiralty established Civil servants. They claim&#8212;there are 15,000 of them&#8212;to be paid for leave. They have four public holidays in the year, but no other holiday, and if they take leave for sickness, or because they want a change for a day or two, they have to lose their pay from the State. I do not think that is quite fair. This practice is not observed with other grades of permanent. Civil servants nor by private employers. Another point with regard to the Admiralty established Civil Service is the claim to have no real deduction made from the substantive rate of pay for superannuation purposes. Hon. Members may not be aware of the fact, but Civil servants in other branches, when they get what is called \"an appointment,\" have an addition made to their stipends or salaries and do not have to pay for superannuation.<\/p><p>We are told by the First Lord that the naval reductions have come to an end or nearly so. In this connection I wish to press forward the case of those men who have been compulsorily retired lately. Many of them are young and many of them have had a certain amount of money spent upon them by their parents and by the State. Now they are sent out with only one month's notice. I do not regard that as quite fair, because they were\nasked to come into the Navy, and they were told they would have continuous employment and would be able to put in time for a pension. By being sent out at one month's notice, all that is done away with, and some proper compensation should be made to them. The compensation at present is &#163;20 or &#163;25. Is that sufficient? I do not think it is, when you consider that &#163;1,000 in addition to retired pay is given to officers of similar age and length of service. I entreat the First Lord of the Admiralty to see if he cannot do something in the direction of awarding higher compensation, in view of the fact that it is absolutely impossible for these men to get employment in the towns where they are now located. The First Lord told us he was quite unable to spread these discharges over the entire Navy. He said the time was not sufficient, and therefore he had been obliged to confine the compulsory discharges to the home service. I think, with a little more consideration and a little more calculation, it would have been possible to take in the whole Navy instead of making all these discharges in the home service. An hon. Member has spoken at length about \"Showing the Flag.\" Showing the Flag is very important for the British Navy. It served us exceedingly well at Brazil, as we heard this afternoon, and it has done the same in the past. It has shown what the British Navy is&#8212;what the power of the British Navy is, what its personnel is, and what its ships are like. That is an important matter when one considers that ours is an island State, thousands of miles from our British Possessions overseas.<\/p><p>We have also been informed by the First Lord that particular ships were sent to the Dardanelles and that they were very useful in serving the purpose for which they were sent there. Let me tell the House, that. in order to send those ships to the Dandanelles properly manned, we had to take almost every man and boy from the Naval Schools, and in the Royal Marine Barracks hardly;I man was left. That was the result of cutting down the personnel of the Navy. [HON. MEMBERS: \"Hear, hear!\"] I am very much obliged to hon. Members opposite for applauding me&#8212;it is not often I get applause from them. May I now refer to the question of the pensions of officers' widows. The ordinary pen-\nsions of widows of officers from warrant rank up to 13th August, 1920, were &#163;25 for the widow of a warrant officer, &#163;30 for the widow of a commissioned officer from warrant rank, and &#163;50 for the widow of a lieutenant. Since that date, the pensions of widows of officers have been reconsidered, and a great deal of amendment has been made in those of widows of officers who come within the categories of Commander to Admiral of the Fleet, but, so far as that class to which I have referred is concerned, nothing has been done. In the Admiralty Regulations today there is a note to the effect that these pensions of widows are still under consideration. They have been under consideration for two years; surely it is time to come to some conclusion.<\/p><p>Then there is the important matter of ventilation. Only the other day when the question was raised in this House we were told that a Committee was inquiring into the matter. I have received a letter to-day from a man who sailed in the \"Vindictus,\" which went to Hong Kong, and what happened there? Not only was the ventilation very bad, but all the arrangements were very bad. The ship was overcrowded, the messes of the lower deck Pere particularly overcrowded, and the galley arrangements were indifferent. The galley was designed to provide food for only 750, and there were on hoard 1,300 men, and the ship was not even fitted with a refrigerator, notwithstanding the fact that she was going to the tropics. I hope the First Lord will see his way to place these facts before the Committee, in order that this sort of thing may not happen a second time.<\/p><p>In conclusion, let me say a word about a subject that is very near to my heart, and that is the question of an Imperial Navy. The Prime Minister told me, and at the same time the House, in answer to a question the other day, that the effect of the Resolution passed by the Imperial Conference in August, 1921, was to defer detailed recommendations till after the Washington Conference, and that discussions were proceeding, but had not arrived at a stage when a statement could be made. The First Lord of the Admiralty has not given us to-day any indication as to what it is intended to do to carry out that Resolution, and I should like to know what is the position. And I should like to ask, Does the Washington Agreement im-\npose conditions on shipbuilding in the Dominions?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>In making the customary statement on the introduction of Vote 10, I hope the Committee will find that my remarks will be as brief as my demands are going to be modest. Before I come to the figures, I wish to dissipate two erroneous ideas I find very commonly held with regard to this Vote. The first is that because this Vote deals chiefly with such mundane materials as bricks and mortar, it must be a very dull subject. I can only say, as one who temporarily has something to do with the administration of this Vote, that I find it intensely interesting. We deal with and we provide everything for the requirements of the Navy, from the largest engineering undertaking to the smallest building repair, in almost every part of the world. We deal in everything from docks to door handles, from barracks to washhand basins, and the area over which we work extends from Wei-hai-wei in the North to the Cape of Good Hope in the South; from Jamaica and the Falklands in the West to Singapore and Hong Kong in the East; and to me this world interest invests even bricks and mortar with a certain amount of glamour.<\/p><p>The second error to which I have alluded is a far more important one. There is a widespread belief that expenditure under\nthis Vote is not essential for the primary purpose of the Navy, and that it absorbs money which might be more profitably devoted to the fighting efficiency of the Fleet in other directions of the Naval Service. If I may say so, I think this is the right line that any criticism should take, that no expenditure on this Vote should detract from the fighting efficiency of the Fleet, and that is the test which I always apply to every single item of expenditure that comes before me on this Vote. This general belief is entirely wrong, because you cannot divide expenditure under this Vote from that incurred for the general needs of the Navy. What we provide forms an integral and vital part of the Navy both in personnel and material.<\/p><p>Take personnel. We have to build and provide the educational establishments and colleges at which the men are trained. We have to build and provide the barracks in which they are housed; and we have to build and provide the hospitals to which they are taken when they are sick. We have to build and maintain the slips on which to build the ships, and the docks and the locks in which they are repaired; we have to build and maintain the workshops in which the repairs are carried out; we have to lay down railways and provide roads to serve those ships and workshops; and we have to build and provide piers and jetties, and, by dredging, ensure the correct depth of water for the ever increasing draught of our ships.<\/p><p>4.0 P.M.<\/p><p>We have to build and maintain workshops, storehouses and magazines for the thousand and one articles without which the ships would be useless; guns, ammunition, torpedoes, mines, depth charges, and stores of every description. Further we have to provide fuel installations&#8212;and this is probably the most important item we have to provide at the present moment&#8212;to replenish our ships not only at home but all over the world; and we have to build wireless telegraphy stations to communicate with our ships. I hope I have indicated enough of our activities to show the Committee that we provide for the integral needs of the Navy and that the Fleet could not come into being or exist without us. The amount which I am going to ask the Committee to provide for the purposes I have roughly outlined for the financial year 1922&#8211;23 is &#163;4,273,000. Last\nyear this House voted &#163;5,836,600, but to that I must add a Supplementary Estimate of &#163;10,000 which we got through later in the year, so that, comparing the gross Vote this year with the gross Vote of last year, I can show a decrease of &#163;1,573,600, which, if you take the percentage, is a very considerable amount on the total involved. I want the Admiralty, and particularly my Department, to get the credit for the great majority of this reduction, because the great majority of the cut was made before the Committee on National Expenditure was ever heard of. As long ago as June last year we had cut this Vote down to &#163;4,756,000, and this was the Estimate which we presented to the Geddes Committee. The Admiralty have always been willing to co-operate with that Committee or any Committee to effect reductions in expenditure, and we met that Committee and made a further reduction of &#163;483,000.<\/p><p>This further reduction was not made without a great deal of effort, and it was made, in four ways. First, by not proceeding with various items that were approved by this House last year and which we thought we could really do without in these trying times. Secondly, by going slow with various continuation services where the adoption of that method did not involve too great expense. In some cases it might involve too great an expense for the saving made at the moment. Thirdly, by postponing many undertakings entered into for the improvement of the living conditions of naval ratings while serving on shore. I regret very much not being able to go on with some of these welfare items, and I hope that the House, when times are more propitious and money is more easily available, will support me or my successor in trying to get some of these welfare items that really are so desirable. The fourth means by which we made that cut was by drastically cutting down new works and concentrating only on those services absolutely necessary in the interests of safety and health.<\/p><p>The Geddes Committee, in their Report on that Vote, which is not a very long one, recommended that no new works of any description whatsoever should be undertaken this year. The Admiralty could not possibly recom-\nmend that course to the House, because it would be the most false economy imaginable. I do not know whether many hon. Members, like myself, since the War, have taken a great deal more interest in such subject as re-soling one's boots and shoes. If they have, they will have learned, like myself, that you can allow a hole in the outer sole to go to a certain length, but directly it goes too far the shoe becomes useless and you have to buy a new pair.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>My Noble Friend tried to lead the Committee to think that we were spending enormous sums of money upon new public buildings. On actual new works the contrary is really the case, more this year than in any other year in the history of these big public Departments. If you take the Inland Revenue buildings, the particular Vote which we are now discussing, the actual expenditure on proposed new works is about &#163;99,000, and on the total of the whole Vote it is something like &#163;328,000, and not &#163;4,000,000. It is true that in a great many cases the Departments after the War necessarily have to make demands for considerable sums for maintenance. That is inevitable after the years through which we have passed, but the Department has been met in every way, by both the Revenue Department and the Post Office, in our endeavour to cut down as much as possible expenditure upon public buildings. In many cases the Post Office have represented to us that we are curtailing unfairly the development of the postal service. We have set up as a particular standard in\ncoming to a decision largely the medical reports and the reports from the staffs employed. I venture to assert that those hon. Members interested in this question of economy would, if they read those medical reports, recognise that in giving way as we have done in some cases, we are only doing so in the public interest.<\/p><p>We recognise very fully that there must be economy. The hon. Member for Ilford (Mr. Wise) made an inquiry with regard to the wireless chain which appears on the Estimates for the first time. That is in pursuance of an arrangement come to by the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee, and it is in accordance with the agreement made in 1919 for the erection of stations in England, Egypt, East Africa, and Hong Kong and possibly one in Canada. We do not anticipate that anything like the full amount we are asking for will be actually expended this year because it will take a considerable time to select the stations.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I do not propose to attempt to follow my right hon. Friend in the very interesting detailed criticisms which he has made. The difficulty which he felt, I recognise I should feel even more acutely. My technical knowledge is far less than his, but with all respect to him, I rather doubt whether anything is to be gained by any attempt to deal in detail with the proposals of the Government. I am one of those who think that the vice of the Geddes Committee policy was that people outside the Government were instructed to make detailed proposals as to economies inside Departments. Although I should be the last to decry the great skill and ability with which the Committee carried out their work, I think it would have been preferable not to have begun at that end at all. The Government should have first made up their minds, if necessary with the aid of some expert Committee, as to how much the country could afford for these services&#8212;very much as my right hon. Friend suggested should be done in reference to a particular branch, I think the Headquarters Staff. Having made up their minds that if the country was to pay its way, it could not spend more than a certain amount on the Army, then they should have left it entirely to the expert military advisers to say how the Army was to be brought down to that figure.<\/p><p>I believe that would have been a sounder plan, and one which would have produced, on the whole, better results and less unpopularity in the Army itself. I recognise that considerable reductions have been made. The House must be grateful to the Government for having done even as much as they have done. My only regret is that it was not done earlier, and that the tremendous expenditure in such places as Iraq&#8212;it is not included here, but I take it as an illustration&#8212;was not cut down earlier. These expenses might quite as easily have been cut down in 1919, and that would have\ngiven us many millions which might have been available for reduction of taxation, or in order, if it was thought necessary, to improve the fighting strength of the Army. The reason I have ventured to intrude upon the Committee is not, however, because I wish to discuss that aspect of the matter. I was very much struck by the warning given at the end of the speech of the Secretary of State for War as to the military danger which his advisers thought we were running by making these reductions. It was a courageous statement to make from the Treasury Bench. I agree that it is for the Government to take responsibility for a policy of that kind and not to attempt to push it off on their military advisers.<\/p><p>The warning was greatly emphasised from a wholly different point of view by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for North Down (Field-Marshal Sir H. Wilson) in one' of the most interesting maiden speeches ever made in this House. His case is one which really merits very close attention from the Committee and raises questions of the very greatest importance, going right down to the safety of this country, and even further than that. He says that at this moment there are as many armed men in Europe as there wore in 1913, although the German army has been reduced from 800,000 to 100,000 and the Austrian army from 400,000 to 30,000. In other words, there has been an increase of more than a million men in the countries of Europe, other than Germany and Austria. That is a terrible comment on the results of the policy which we have pursued since the Armistice. I am bound to say that I do not feel sure that that policy, which has been in some respects a policy of adventure, has been altogether abandoned. My hon. and gallant Friend gave, with perfect accuracy, a very formidable list of the increased commitments which we now have, compared to our pre-War commitments. He pointed to the perennial commitments that we have with reference to this country and Ireland, India, and Egypt, and he added Hong Kong, the Rhine, Silesia, Constantinople, Palestine, Iraq, and the two pacts with France and Belgium. I think that is a very formidable fact for the whole of the country to consider. I do not deny that some of those commitments&#8212;I do not think all of them&#8212;were inevitable, but I do think\nit is a great pity that, having taken these commitments, having taken upon us burdens which really greatly add to our difficulties, and in a sense weaken the strength of the Empire, we should at the same time have contrived to convey the impression in all foreign countries that we have grabbed everything we desire and that we alone have come out of the Conferences at Paris with greatly increased power and prestige. It seems a deplorable result of our diplomacy that we should have, in fact, weakened ourselves and at the same time achieved a reputation for national greed unequalled in the annals of this country.<\/p><p>Now we are not apparently satisfied with that, and, though we are not allowed to know very much about it, we are apparently negotiating pacts with both France and Belgium, which my hon. and gallant Friend says will add to our commitments and liabilities. We are not told exactly what those pacts are. If we inquire, we are told that we are hampering the negotiations of the Government and that we must wait until the Government has completed the pacts before the House of Commons is to express any opinion on the policy which underlies those pacts. We all know that by that time it will be-perfectly useless for the House of Commons to express any opinion, for, if it does so, it will be said that the House of Commons is seeking to go behind the honourable engagements which have been made on behalf of this country, and therefore I must venture, very respectfully, to say that the policy of entering into any separate military engagement with any individual Power is, in the circumstances, of the highest degree of unwisdom. I hope that any engagement which we may undertake will be of a most restricted character. If we make any such engagement to an individual Power of that kind, apart from other objections which I shall have to touch upon in a moment, we are, as it seems to me, giving a right to that Power with whom we have made that engagement to press us to maintain armies sufficient to make the engagement that we have entered into a real one and not a mere pretence. I agree with the argument that my hon. and gallant Friend presented&#8212;though I am afraid the conclusions I draw from it are different&#8212;that military retrenchment depends on military policy.\nYou cannot have a policy of military adventure and a policy of military retrenchment at one and the same time<\/p><p>I am afraid that I have now reached the limit of my agreement with my hon. and gallant Friend. What, if I understood him rightly, does he propose I He does not criticise the policy; he accepts it, and he says&#8212;which, if you accept it, is perhaps true&#8212;you must have an increased Army in order to fulfil the engagements and commitments that you have undertaken. I listened very attentively to his speech, and when he came to the concluding passage, where he put forward what he actually proposed, what his suggested policy, was, he said that you ought to have an Army sufficiently large to prevent war. That is a version of our old friend that we used to hear so much about, namely, If you wish for peace you must be prepared for war, the maxim on which all Europe acted up to 1914, and the year 1914 seems to me the final condemnation of that policy. Just let us examine what my hon. and gallant Friend proposed. He recited to the Committee, quoting the Secretary of State, what the present proposals would give us&#8212;one division in 15 days and a cavalry division, a second division in from 15 days to six weeks, and a third or fourth division in four months. My hon. and gallant Friend said that is what we should have then, but not what we have now, and he compared with that what we had in 1914, which was six divisions, but the six divisions were not sufficient to prevent war. Therefore, if you are to prevent war, you must have more than six divisions.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p class=\"unknownspeaker\">Field-Marshal Sir HENRY WILSON:<\/p> <p>May I claim the indulgence of the House for my maiden speech? I feel sure I can trust to the kindness of hon. Members to let me off easily during the many slips I am quite sure I shall make. May I make my first one by trying to explain, if I may, who it is I am? I was born in what is now euphoniously called the Irish Free State, and I lived there for 20 years. We were then under the tyranny of the Union, but I lived in the greatest friendship with my neighbours. I was rooted in Ulster, and I have been a soldier for 41 years, serving one Queen and two Kings of the British Empire. The net result is this, that I am intensely loyal to the Crown and intensely proud of the British Empire, and any remarks that I may make to the House will be made in that spirit. The Estimates that have been laid before the House are to a great extent based on the Report of\nthe Geddes Committee. May I say that we are one of the only great Powers who have a voluntary army, and that to have a voluntary army has many advantages, but it has one great disadvantage, that in the nature of things it solves no military problem? If you have a great many volunteers you may have a great big army, but if you have very few volunteers you will probably have a very small army. The size of the Army being that which the number of volunteers willing to join makes it, the size of the Army has no relation to war. I think I can prove that by saying that in 1914 we entered a war with six divisions, and in order to win that war we had to raise a total of nearly 80. It is perfectly obvious, therefore, that the six divisions of the voluntary Army had no relation whatever to the war into which we were plunged. But at that time there was no reason why we should have an army fit to fight the Germans, because, so far as my recollection goes, the Government of the day did not think that it was probable that we might have to fight Germany. If, therefore, any money had been put into an army to be ready to fight the Germans, and we were not going to fight them, the money would have been wasted. I remember, I think it was the present Prime Minister, as late as 23rd July, 1914, seven days before the great German army got on the march, assured this House that there was very little danger of war. I have made these observations because the Geddes Committee, broadly, base their reductions of the Army on two hypotheses, both of which are false. The first was that the German peril having passed, there was no necessity to keep an army to face it. There never was an army facing it, and there should not have been, seeing that, in all probability, we were not going to war. So far as I know, we never raised one man, kept one horse, or moved one wheel-barrow because of the danger of a war with Germany. Therefore, to take as a hypothesis that the Army was kept to face Germany, and, the German danger having passed, the Army could be reduced, is a false deduction from a false basis. The second reason that the Committee gives for the reduction is that with modern inventions and modern arms a modern army is a much more formidable thing than a prehistoric army. That is so, and the Committee go on practically\nto say that one company of infantry now can do the work of four companies of infantry in old days, and, therefore, now we can abolish three companies of infantry, and be as strong as we were. That seems to me to be a false deduction from a false basis. In the case of European wars, I imagine our enemies will have the same arms and armaments as we should have.<\/p><p>Therefore, there would be no gain in that respect, and in savage wars it is a very curious thing that modern inventions have, on the whole, made the enemy much more powerful than ourselves. It is a curious thing. I was calculating only the other day&#8212;I may be quite wrong&#8212;that if to-day India were asked to carry out Lord Roberts' famous Kabul to Kandahar march, India would ask for at least three times as many troops as Lord Roberts had in 1878. It is true that in these frontier fightings we have had in the last 18 months, we have employed, and have had to employ, far more troops than we had before these modern inventions gave the enemy such an advantage. The reason is that the mountains and the deserts do not change and they preclude the civilised people from using to the full advantage the modern inventions. On the other hand, the long-range rifle, and the wonderful eyesight of the natives, make them able to pick off individuals at 2,000 yards, whereas in former days they had difficulty in doing it at 20 yards. The right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State has told us what it means to the Army if these Estimates are passed, and he mentioned figures, which I venture to repeat, but which I would not myself have made public. If these Estimates are passed, Great Britain and Ireland can produce in 15 days one division and a cavalry division, and then for the second division she has to wait for anything between another 15 days and six weeks, and for a third and a fourth division she has to wait months. I mention that now, but I would like to come back to it in a few minutes.<\/p><p>May I now state, as briefly as I can, what liabilities we are under? England, Ireland, Egypt, India, and now, I am afraid I must add, Hong Kong&#8212;those were all present in 1914; they are all present today. But, in addition to those, we have\nnow the Rhine, we have Silesia, we have Constantinople, we have Palestine, and we have Iraq, in addition to what we had in 1914. There are two more liabilities which are quite new, which we had not in 1914, so far as I know&#8212;a pact between this country and France, and a pact between this country and Belgium. In addition to that, may I mention two things which, to me, render the situation infinitely more dangerous than it was in 1914? As a result of the War, and as a result of the Peace Conference following the. War, Europe, which in 1914 chiefly consisted of great Empires, has now been broken up into a number of small States. That in itself is an experiment, perhaps not for me to criticise; but when I add that there are at the present moment in Europe and the quite Near East 11 States with no access to the open sea, and five more with only access to the Black Sea, making a total of 16 States without access to the free, warm water, how anybody can imagine that a vast country, for example, like Russia, with a population of 150,000,000, with all her free, open seaports all the year round taken from her, will not break out to the sea, whether Esthonia is guarded by the League of Nations or not, I cannot imagine.<\/p><p>There is another thing which, to me, shows a dangerous state of affairs in Europe. In 1914 we had these big Empires. People said at that time&#8212;and said truly&#8212;that it was because of these big Empires we had big armies; and we had big armies in 1914. As a result of the War, the German Army, which stood in 1913 at 800,000 strong, is now 100,000 strong, and the Austrian Army, which stood at 400,000 strong, is now 30,000 strong. Yet, in spite of that, there are as many armed men in Europe at the present moment as there were in 1913. I have the figures of the armies of all the States, and the increase in the number of armed men in these small States is simply terrifying. In addition to that, we have in Europe at the present moment, practically every sound man, and many that are not, between the ages of 20 and 50 trained to arms. Who, then, says, and who can say, that the state of Europe is more peaceful than it was in 1913? Take our liabilities. England&#8212;it is only six or eight months since we had to call up the whole of the Reserve, and make I an <i>ad hoc<\/i> army. Ireland&#8212;who will say\nwhat is going to happen in Ireland? Egypt&#8212;who will say what is going to happen in Egypt? In 1913&#8211;14 Egypt was profoundly quiet. India&#8212;who is brave enough to say what is going to happen in India? In 1913&#8211;14 India was profoundly quiet. Hong Kong&#8212;who will say what is going to happen in Hong Kong? In 1913&#8211;14 it was profoundly quiet.<\/p><p>In addition to those old liabilities, the dangers of which have enormously increased, we have the Rhine, Silesia, Constantinople, Palestine, Iraq, a pact with France, and a pact with Belgium. Who says our liabilities have not increased? Yet in 1914 we could put six divisions in the field in 9&#189; days. Now we can put one in 15 days, two in 30 or 50 days, and a third and fourth months hence. I wonder if this is the right moment to reduce the fighting troops of Great Britain? The right hon. Member for Peebles (Sir D. Maclean), in his speech, seemed to think that the soldiers in their advice paid no attention to finance. I wish it were true that we had not to pay attention to the 6s. in the &#163; which the policy of His Majesty's Government put on this country; but, unfortunately, we pay 6s. in the &#163; just as much as he does, and, therefore, finance is very much present to our minds.<\/p><p>So far as my judgment goes, nobody knows what is going to face us in the near future. We all know that our liabilities are enormously increased and we have just been told that our power to meet them has been immensely reduced. It has always seemed to me that the primary duty of an army is to prevent war. I know of no cheaper way of conducting the business of a State than by conducting it in a state of profound peace, and one of the ways of doing that is to have an army of sufficient strength to prevent war. But if you cannot, either from reasons of policy or other reasons, prevent war, then the next duty of the army is to win the war. To win a war is a terribly expensive thing both in men and in money. Therefore it is infinitely cheaper to have a force which will prevent war rather than to have a force which if it has to go to war even can win the war. There is, however, a third possibility, and that is to have an army not sufficiently strong to prevent war and not sufficiently strong to win war, but just sufficiently weak to lose the war.\nThat is a most terrible catastrophe that can happen to an Empire. In my judgment, if the Estimates now placed before the House are passed, if the reductions contemplated in the fighting forces are carried out, we will be in the position of that third army, just ready, in spite of everything it can do, to lose the war.<\/p>",

It is particularly fortunate, I think, that the proposal which has been made by my hon. and gallant Friend should have been preceded by an extraordinary speech by one whom we have known under many names, but who is now known to us as the hon. and gallant Member for North Down. Of all the maiden speeches I have ever heard I think his was one of the best delivered and the most interesting, and I am sure the House will await with anxiety the next time he addresses us, although I hope he will not make our flesh creep so badly on the next occasion.<\/p><p>The speech of the hon. and gallant Member for North Down is the greatest proof of the necessity for carrying out the proposal of my hon. and gallant Friend. My hon. and gallant Friend proposes that we should set up a Commission&#8212;that has been often proposed and even promised before&#8212;in order to find out how best to consider the administration of our sea, land, and air forces, and how they should be co-ordinated in war and in peace. My hon. and gallant Friend said it was a peculiar thing about modern inventions that, so far from making one stronger, they tended to weaken. His argument in the first part was irrefutable, but the hon. and gallant Gentleman might also have said if one man is now worth what 10 men were worth before, it is equally true that one casualty is ten times more disastrous than before. He went on to say, in dealing with savage warfare&#8212;a matter which may come more immediately before us in the next year or two&#8212;that the same argument applies. I hold the view, which is shared by many better able to judge, that the development of our air power makes us far more powerful and not less powerful. I gave only the other day four instances in Mesopotamia, and only yesterday the Secretary for the Colonies gave an instance in\nSomaliland which is almost too good to be true, showing that the presence of two aeroplanes saved a whole expedition. I do not say that the view advanced by the Field Marshal in his speech is wrong, but I do suggest there is a powerful body of opinion who are as strongly in support of the view taken by my hon. and gallant Friend. If there is anything to bring the two together, it may well be that the Secretary for War will be impelled by his advisers to take the anti-air view and greatly increase the other forces, while an impartial reviewer, after listening to what is to be said on both sides, may think that on the whole the air view is the correct view and that money spent on increasing the other forces could be saved.<\/p><p>The same remark applies to the whole argument addressed to us by the hon. and gallant Field-Marshal. He pointed out that before the War we had so many regiments. Now we shall have fewer. He also pointed out, with perfect truth, that while the state of Europe is in some respects more favourable, it is in other respects far less favourable, from this point of view, that with such a number of small States the possibility of war is one which should have great weight with us. That was urged in an extraordinarily powerful memorandum by General Smuts. Reference has been made to the danger at Constantinople and at Hong Kong. The defences of those places is more completely bound up with the sea than with the land, but aircraft are essential and we want to increase our Air Force rather than our land force. In theory, under the arrangement set up by the Lord President of the Council, the Prime Minister should sit on the Committee of Imperial Defence. Once upon a time he did do so, and he adjudicated on these very matters. My hon. and gallant Friend will very well remember having attended many meetings of the Imperial Defence Committee presided over by the then Prime Minister. I have in mind the very good advice he gave us and which we acted upon. Now the Prime Minister cannot possibly do that. He is too much engaged on other affairs of State. There is not the remotest chance of any Prime Minister in our time finding an opportunity to do this co-\nordinating work, to preside over the Committee of Imperial Defence, to listen to the arguments on both sides, and then to come to a decision.<\/p><p>There are two great causes of waste under the present system. One is the overlapping of services. If each service has its own parson and its own hospital, it leads very often to an absurd waste of money. The other great sources of waste is the employment of wrong weapons&#8212;the employment of land forces when we should employ air forces, or the employment of air forces when we should employ sea forces. I come to the next point. Can what my hon. Friend proposes be done successfully? Here I shall be on highly controversial ground in what I am going to say. Some people urge that it is no use setting up a Ministry of Defence, or adopting another plan which I will adumbrate presently, because, in point of fact, the deliberations of such bodies have done us no good in the past. We were, it is said, utterly unprepared for the late War, and we only muddled through it by luck and by the gallantry of our men. There has been a lot of loose talk about this. I am here to say that, in my judgment, and certainly in the judgment of the Germans, although everybody was more or less unprepared for the War, we were the least unprepared. We were better prepared for the War on the 4th August, 1914, than any other nation that entered into the War, and the reason why we were so much better prepared was because we had given it really more careful thought. It is true that there were times when we were desperately short of shells, of guns and of rifles, but that was not due to the fact that we lacked prevision. It was because we had planned for a war in defence of Belgium on a certain scale When the War broke out the British Empire was spending, approximately, &#163;100,000,000 a year, and when the Mobilisation Order came, approximately, 1,000,000 men stood to arms. I may say, in passing, that the amount the British Empire was spending was a great deal more than was being spent by any other Power, including Germany. Our plan was, and I had a great deal to do with it, so that if anyone is in fault, I am the man to blame; I welcome criticism and am prepared to meet it, for I have presided over more Committees of Imperial Defence than anyone else&#8212;our\nplan was to keep these 1,000,000 men in the field and to put them in the right places, while our Navy was to keep the sea. In other words, the first problem was to defend the whole Empire from hostile attack, the next was to maintain our communications with a view to securing our food supplies and bringing reinforcements from over the water, and the third problem was to defend Belgium by helping France to do so. One detail was to catch all the spies. When war did break out we did a good deal in these directions, while our Navy put a strangle-hold on Germany from which she was never able to escape. Remember, no single hostile foot was ever put on any part of the British Empire, and that shows that we disposed of our forces in the right way. At the same time, we did give assistance in Belgium in time to prevent the Germans taking Paris. That was not done without thought.<\/p><p>When I first became Secretary of State for War the Field Marshal who has just addressed the House came and pointed out to me that if Belgian neutrality were violated it was extremely probable our Armies would not get in time to the places where they ought to be. With the consent of the Cabinet I asked four men who, between them, owned the great majority of the A1 steam tonnage of the world to meet me here in this House. They did so. I put to them the problem, and within a few months, with the aid of the Admiralty and of the War Office, they produced an entirely new plan involving an expenditure of a large sum of money for the transport of the Expeditionary Force by very ingenious means which enabled that force to reach its objective in a much lesser amount of time than would in the opinion of the best judges have made the difference between the fall of Paris and its safety. That is just one instance of what can be done by careful thought and prevision, and I claim this, that up till the declaration of war by the operations of the Committee of Imperial Defence presided over by the then Prime Minister, now the right hon. Member for Paisley (Mr. Asquith) and attended constantly by the late Prime Minister, the Lord President of the Council (Sir A. Balfour) as well as by the Chief of the Army Staff, and the corresponding officers in the other Services we thought out our problem better than anyone else. We may have\nmade great mistakes afterwards, as we made mistakes before, but at any rate we were enabled to get through the first three months of the War.<\/p><p>7.0 P.M.<\/p><p>What I ask is that we should revert to that practice and that we should stabilise it and make it stronger. I do not think anyone ought to support a Resolution of this kind, and least of all one who has been in the responsible position of Secretary for War as I have, without saying what he really means so that people can criticise his proposal. I think my hon. and gallant Friend who proposed this Amendment will agree with me that the proposal which I have ventured to put before the Secretary of State is one worthy of consideration, and I hope the right hon. Gentleman will lay it before the Prime Minister. We want to get this co-ordination. Some people say: \"Set up your Commission as proposed here, and direct them to consider how best to constitute a Ministry of Defence including the various Chiefs of Staff as well as Under-Secretaries for Land, Sea and Air.\" That would mean a great dislocation and probably great added expense, but still if the expense saved us from war that consideration surely would be a mere bagatelle. I do not believe in making too sudden changes in these matters. I think the far better plan would be to recognise the fact that exceptionally good work was done by the Committee of Imperial Defence under the then Prime Minister in the times preceding the War. Let us see how we can reproduce that and make it better. This Prime Minister cannot do it, and it is a thousand to one that the next Prime Minister will not be able to do it either. Let us have a Vice-President of the Committee of Imperial Defence, who should be the Lord President of the Council or the Lord Privy Seal, with not only the power but the duty to be informed of all estimates and all plans of the three fighting services, Land, Sea and Air, before those plans or estimates are passed. Let him pass them under review; let him have power to send for all persons and documents to find out the truth; and then let him have the power to decide, subject to the approval of the Cabinet, what is the best way to employ such available defensive forces as we have. Some will say that it would be best that the Chief\nof the Imperial General Staff, the First Sea Lord, and the Chief of the Air Staff should be members of the staff of the Vice-President of the Committee of Imperial Defence. There are difficulties about that, but the existing staffs would provide all the material that was required. You certainly then would not have any more expense in the direction branch, but you would have one man, not a soldier or a sailor or an Air officer, one man who would be what we used to call in the Army \"a frock\"; one of your politicians whom you must have under any system of Government, whose sole duty would be to co-ordinate those services and decide, instead of what happens now, as we know, when all these urgent questions are brought up by very tired Ministers before a very tired Prime Minister, who has not time to consider them, who does the best he can to dispose of them in a little time, but who has not the time to make the best decision nor to send for the right people to tell him all sides of the question. I earnestly commend this proposal to the Government, because I am quite sure, whatever my hon. Friends feel when they are cross about the defence forces, that the defence forces of this country have been the best guarantee for the liberty of the world that the world has ever had, and that by retaining them with due economy and on a sufficient level we shall be doing more for the freedom and happiness of the world than anything else we can do.<\/p>",

Baronet. According to the terms of the Treaty, there is going to be an impartial\nchairman. At any rate, he is not going to be a North or a South of Ireland man. Hon. Gentlemen will not accept the Boundary Commission, for the very good reason that any impartial chairman, take him from Timbuctoo or Hong Kong, who has any nous, any intelligence, any sense of justice, could not but divide the country&#8212;if division is at all possible, which I myself very much doubt&#8212;differently from the way it has been arbitrarily carved out in the Act of Parliament which hon. Members have had forced down their throats, and to which they now so strongly adhere! The second course is to take in the whole of Ulster. We hear a great deal about Ulster from hon. Members who live in Ulster, but they would not have Ulster. Why would they not have the whole of Ulster? Do they think that Cavan, Monaghan, and Donegal are not parts of the Province of Ulster, and, if so, why would they not have them? Let them move an Amendment to this Treaty, or to the provisions of the Act of 1920, giving them the whole of Ulster. No! Why? Because they do not represent the whole of Ulster, and they would not get the support of the majority of the people of Ulster.<\/p><p>Let us come to the third alternative. With all respect to them, I think it is the only alternative that any rational, sensible-minded Ulsterman would adopt. It is to come into the Irish Free State. That sounds very ridiculous. Hon. Members may smile. But I have been in the North of Ireland quite recently, and I have met many business men there, differing from me in politics, who have expressed to me their own opinion that it would be far better for the North to come in with the rest of Ireland. What I want to ask to-night is this: Why should not the North of Ireland come in and work with their fellow-countrymen throughout the rest of the land? After all, what will be their position if they do come in? One would think that they were immediately going to be swallowed up and destroyed. What will be the position? In the first place there will be no Boundary Commission. They will enjoy the occupation of, and legislative and administrative functions over, the same territory which they now purport to enjoy under the Act of 1920. That is, they will have the full six counties within their control\nas they have not, but as they might have, at the present moment, the only difference being that the services, which are now reserved for the Imperial Parliament, would be transferred to the Irish Parliament in Dublin, in which the North of Ireland men would have at least a very fair and adequate representation.<\/p><p>I am perfectly sure if they were to take that step, that the Southern Irishmen would meet them more than half way, and give them adequate safeguards and guarantees both as to their religious and political convictions and their pursuits in the Ireland of to-morrow. There is also another way out for these hon. Members, which, however, I do not put forward seriously. It is that they should adhere to the policy that has been preached for so many years, and so ably and so strongly by their late leader, Lord Carson. It is this: \"Leave us alone, that is all we want; do not come near us: all we desire is to be part and parcel of England.\" I do not put that proposition very seriously, because I know full well they do not for one moment entertain it in their minds&#8212;to become once more part and parcel of this country, to be treated as an \"English\" \"shire,\" like Yorkshire and Lancashire. That is a proposition which not one of these Members would dare to put before the people of Ulster to-day! No reply? Very well! Having secured self-government for at least a portion of Ireland in which they have resided all their lives, like every other measure which they have resisted, they will hang on the more tenaciously to it than any other people in any portion of the country?<\/p><p>I am most anxious that Ireland should come together, that peace and order should be restored, that the chaos, both in the North and South, should cease. The only possible chance is for every sensible and patriotic Irishman, no matter to what party or creed he belongs, to come in now and support the Provisional Government and the Free State which has been set up in that country. I should like to say this: as a Nationalist Irishman, I give no credit whatsoever to this Government or this House or to any party in this House for this Measure of freedom. I hope I shall not give offence in making these remarks. I say that this should have been done, and could have been done, years and years ago. It was not done, and we have the consequences,\nunfortunately, in Ireland to-day. This I characterise as a pure Measure of expediency on behalf of the present Government. I believe the Government of to-day, those who are proposing this Measure, care no more for justice and fair-play than any Government in days gone by. We in Ireland have been betrayed by all British Governments and all British parties, and we therefore know the value of their words and the value of their pledges. I make this exception because the Labour party have never had the opportunity. The Labour party have never had the opportunity of, having the responsibility of office in this country, and therefore I do not place it within the category. It may be said that I am bitter. Yes, I am exceedingly bitter, and I have every reason to be bitter. If I am bitter, what can you conceive of the feelings of the vast majority of the Irish people? You say they are anti-British. Well, they are anti-British, and they have every reason to be anti-British, and all I say is this&#8212;you cannot go about kicking a dog and maltreating it for an extensive period and come along afterwards and offer it a bit of sugar-coated candy and expect it to lick your hand. That cannot be done. An hon. Member below me says it can. Well, he has a greater knowledge of the canine species than I have. You cannot maltreat an animal and expect it to have any regard for you. However, the hon. Member may have a wonderful power of dealing with dogs. I hope his power will be as useful in dealing with his constituents when he goes for the next election.<\/p><p>Much as I feel, and deeply as I feel resentment of the way that we in Ireland have been treated in the past&#8212;we especially on these benches by Government after Government of this country&#8212;I believe now that at any rate, from what motive I care not, this Government means business. So far, they have kept their word in regard to the Treaty, and I am glad to be able to say that the Secretary of State for the Colonies has shown during the Committee stage of this Bill that he will stand no nonsense, no matter from what quarter it comes. If this country keeps its word&#8212;and mind you, it will be a novelty in regard to Ireland&#8212;but if it does, then you may trust Ireland to keep hers. I want the future to be a future of amity and friendship\nbetween these two peoples. I want to let bygones be bygones, not only between Great Britain and Ireland, but also between Irishmen themselves. I want Irishmen themselves to come together and to prove as good citizens of this great commonwealth of nations as have Irishmen in every other part of the Empire.<\/p><p>After all, I have been throughout the Empire and know something of it. I know what I am talking about when I say that Irishmen have been your leading lights and pioneers in the legal world, the political world, and in the sciences and industries of the British Empire. The Empire you boast about is by no means a British Empire. It was built by Irish brain and brawn as much as by any other. I do not know whether hon. Members have been as much as I have throughout the Dominions, but I have spent quite a time there, and there is no part of the world, America not excluded, where this Bill will receive most hearty accord than throughout those great self-governing countries which go to make the British Commonwealth of nations. If Ireland is given a chance&#8212;if only Ulster people would show that sense and patriotism with which they have been so often credited&#8212;time and commonsense will be the healer of all these troubles, and though this is by no means the millennium, though I for one, and those with me, were never consulted about the smallest details of the proposals, I feel that if these proposals are carried into force, they will lead to future happiness and prosperity in that country.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p class=\"unknownspeaker\">Major-General Sir JOHN DAVIDSON:<\/p> <p>I rise with diffidence to address the House on a subject of great importance, namely, the Imperial Conference and the agenda for that Conference. Having been so closely associated with the Dominion forces during the War, I feel, and have felt for some time past, that their strength is so enormous and so increasing that the British Empire as a whole, if working as a whole, can act for the good of the world in a military sense. They put in the field over a million troops, and these were troops of the very highest quality, unsurpassed in the pages of military history. If the Dominions could put forward that effort at that time, with their rapidly increasing strength there is nothing which the British Empire cannot perform in the future, if it only works in close co-operation. I was one of those who moved to have this Debate, not with any idea of trying to force the hands of the Government or to extract any views from them. It would be very desirable that they should not give their views on a great many of the matters in question, but at the same time I do believe that since a Debate of this nature will be of very great value not only to this country but to the Empire generally, it is only right that the representatives of the people of this country should have an opportunity of discussing these matters. We know quite well that in the Dominion Parliaments there has been ample opportunity for Debate on this subject, and it is right and just that there should be a similar opportunity in this country. I do not agree at all with those who take the view that the subject matter of the Conference is no concern of the House of Commons. Such views have been expressed in different quarters, both verbally and in writing. I do not propose to pursue this matter further, but simply to refer these people to a remark made by Burke&#8212;\n<q>Great empires and little minds go ill together.<\/q>\nThere is one thing which we should establish, before we start debating the matter at all. There is no intention or wish on the part of the people of this\ncountry to disturb in any fundamental manner the constitutional relationship between one part of the Empire and another. That is an essential feature, and certainly there is no intention on the part of any section of the community in this country to do anything which would interfere with it. Indeed, I should go a step further and say it is preferable, from every point of view, that the initiative should be taken by the Government in all these matters. There are two great underlying principles which sound like platitudes, and perhaps are platitudes. The whole work of the Empire must be based in the future on the two principles of freedom and co-operation. There is very little to be said in regard to freedom. I think the dominions are all agreed&#8212;in fact, only a small section of the community throughout the whole Empire are not agreed&#8212;on the advantages of maintaining the ties with the Mother country, and particularly the tie of the Crown. As regards Co-operation, the other of these two principles, there is a great deal to be said and there, are a great many difficulties involved, both in regard to measure and agreement. As Mr. Hughes very rightly said a few days ago, empires and nations do not stand still. They are continually either going forward or going backward and that movement, as he also said very rightly, is accelerated in these days by modern means, modern methods and modern science. That movement is extraordinarily rapid to-day. Mr. Hughes also pointed out that we have got to decide whether we are going to move forward on a principle of whole-hearted and unselfish co-operation or whether we are going to decline to take advantage of the possibilities which are before us and take the other course of moving backward towards disintegration and decay.<\/p><p>Not only do nations and empires move as I have indicated, but there is another tendency of movement to be considered. Old countries which are over-populated and highly industrialised are apt to recede, just in exactly the same way as new and undeveloped dominions tend to go forward very rapidly. As the focus of power and wealth moves within any group of nations from one centre to another or from the centre to the extremities, so the incidence of responsibilities and burdens must equally and proportionately shift. I do not believe that in considering this incidence of\nresponsibilities and burdens there is any mechanical formula which we can follow. We have had an example in recent years of a formula being made out in this respect. It was the formula of comparing population combined with trade tonnage, as between the various portions of the Dominions. A formula of that sort is not worth the paper it is written upon. There is only one formula, and that is mutual and voluntary agreement between the parties concerned. It is very evident that quite recently there have been signs of this movement of responsibilities and burdens. There has been a very evident sign in the Peace Treaties that the Dominions are prepared to accept responsibilities and take a position and status in the world generally and interest themselves in the world's affairs. We have seen the part they have taken in connection with the Peace Treaties and they are signatories to the League of Nations. That is a great step forward in which Canada and South Africa are in the van, closely followed by Australia and New Zealand, with India behind, but following very rapidly also.<\/p><p>It is all very well to say that the Dominions should accept this responsibility, seeing that they have reached a state of autonomous power, and be satisfied with it. There are certain anomalies involved between that condition and the condition of co-operation which we want to achieve. For instance, there is the anomaly between complete autonomy and collective action. These two things do not normally go well together. There is also the difficulty of each of the Dominions, possibly, offering separate advice to the Crown. I do not believe, however, that these difficulties are very great or insuperable, but I think that possibly it may be desirable to effect some minor changes in our constitutional practice. I do not want to investigate these difficulties in the realm of foreign affairs. I will leave that to others. But I do want to investigate them in the realm of Imperial defence. There is very little distinction between the two. They go hand in hand, and what applies to the one in a very large measure applies to the other. My chief object is to investigate the question of Imperial defence, and, where there are autonomous powers working together, how that co-operation which is so necessary can best be achieved between them. Which is the best way of securing\nconcerted action without infringing the principles of freedom and autonomy? To my mind, if we can achieve some solution on those points, we shall have gone a long way towards setting up a model for the whole world, at any rate, for the League of Nations or any association of nations. Certain specific problems are in front of us to-day, and if one unfolds a map of the world and attempts to study those problems, one sees that if you put your finger on any country in any part of the globe, the British Empire is interested in one way or another up to the hilt.<\/p><p>Those problems do not affect the different parts of the Empire in the same degree, and that is where the difficulty of co-operation will come in. For example, Australia and New Zealand are interested in what is known as the Pacific question, in the idea of a white Australia, in the position of Japan, and in the encroachment of that country among the islands. On the other hand, South Africa has few external problems. She has troubles of her own of a different kind. Canada is not interested to anything like the same extent as Australia in the Pacific problem, although she is interested to some extent, in the same way that America is. Great Britain is very deeply involved and committed in Eastern Europe, in the Middle East and in Asia. If one considers these matters one sees that the British Empire in one way and another, is involved over the whole face of the globe. Is each portion of the Empire to deal with its own particular problem and to ignore the rest? Will South Africa stand aloof, saying that it is no concern of hers? Will the Dominions stand aloof, saying that Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia are no concern of theirs? Will Canada give its quota towards the defence of the Pacific? In what way are these burdens going to be distributed among the various parts of the British Empire. Will they recognise that the security of one part of the Empire is the security of the whole? Will they go in for the principle which was enunciated two days ago in the House of Commons, Each for all and all for each; or will they go on some other principle?<\/p><p>This is the true principle of co-operation, but it needs close study and definition. It is a matter of very great urgency, as I hope to point out in a moment. I do not wish to go into great detail, or, indeed, to probe at all into the\nPacific question and the question of a white Australia. I have not enough information, and I doubt, if any Member of this House has enough information, to go into it. There are other sides to the question, and it is extremely complicated. I know well the arguments of those who see in the Pacific problem extreme danger&#8212;the overcrowded East, the colour bar, Japan's position in China, the encroachment southward of Japan amongst the islands of the Caroline and Marshall groups, the possibility of Japan seizing the Philippine Islands, and the awakening of China. All these questions have been raised and pointed to as an extreme danger in the Far East. On the other hand, there are those who do not think so seriously of the situation. They point out that the distances are almost too great for war to take place, and the motives are really small. The colour question is an economic question, and if it is looked upon from the economic point of view it is easily solved. The national sentiments of those countries is generally opposed to war, and competition in armaments has only just begun. In considering these matters, however, there is one which stands out above all the rest as a matter of fundamental importance. Competition in armaments is beginning or has begun, and if it is allowed to reach a certain point, and to pass that point, there is no stopping it, and war is the inevitable result. It is essential that that competition should be stopped at the very earliest possible moment. I do not mean by that that it has to be done within a month or two, or in a great hurry. It must be done with deliberation, because it is a very difficult problem.<\/p><p>I do not mean that we should give up all idea of defending in an adequate manner the Pacific. That has to be undertaken, and possibly it will be necessary to provide naval bases and defences at places in the East. I do say, however, that it is essential that the whole situation in the Far East should be adequately reviewed by a Conference comprising not only America and ourselves but Japan as well. I believe, myself, that the sound principle is to extend the Japanese Treaty until the result of that Conference is known. I will go one step further, and point out to Australia the extreme desirability, both from the\npoint of view of defence and from the economic point of view, of encouraging emigration to her countries and the population of her Northern belt at the earliest possible moment, and of giving every facility that can be given to enable that to be done. That applies also to our own Government. In these days everyone will agree that economic development is of far greater importance in the world than anything else. To my mind, if the whole Empire collaborates and speaks together on these important questions, it will be able to achieve a very great deal, not only for itself but for the benefit of the world at large. To Great Britain, Eastern Europe and Asia are of very pressing importance. I do not know whether it is sufficiently realised that we have troops in Silesia, in Constantinople, in Palestine, in Mesopotamia, in India, and in China at Hong Kong. All along a perimeter of 8,000 miles there are disturbances of one sort or another and of varying degrees of importance. This country is not really fitted to undertake a function of those dimensions. If we are going to let this Pacific question wander on until it gets to a point where we have to compete in armaments, we cannot manage these responsibilities all over the world ourselves. I do not want to go into the colour question, but it is a subject which has to be covered. It must be borne in mind that this colour question is one that may split the Empire between the East and West. The Dominions are apt to take one point of view, and our Eastern populations are apt to take another point of view, and it is in the handling of this question by Indian statesmen that this matter will be very largely solved. But I would press the point that if the arguments are removed from the social basis and based more on the economic question&#8212;because it is more a question of the standard of life than a colour question&#8212;I am credibly informed by those who know, that it will be rightly understood in India at least, and, I believe, also in Japan.<\/p><p>I have run over some of these problems lightly, but it is quite evident from what I have said that we require some machinery for co-operation. We have none at the present moment. The resolution of the 1917 Conference laid down the principle of an association of autonomous nations for the Empire, of the equality of nationhood, and of continuous Cabinet\nconsultation. It is this question of continuous Cabinet consultation which is a little difficult to understand. This implies either periodical conferences, or periodical Cabinet meetings, or something of that sort. Personally, I think there is very little in a name, but I should sincerely like to go back to the old name of an Imperial Council. That does not imply the haphazardness of a conference, nor does it imply the rigidity of a Cabinet. But some standing machinery of that nature is- wanted, and I believe myself that the only satisfactory solution is to have resident Ministers from the Dominions in this country. Spasmodic consultations once a year for a few days are of no value, and I do not believe for one moment that the mere fact of having resident Ministers means that the Dominions should be committed to any line to which they do not want to be committed. The whole thing could be based on freedom and co-operation. Such a Council could deal with foreign affairs, trade and matters of defence.<\/p><p>Fortunately, we have some machinery for Imperial Defence in this country, though it is rusty, as it has not been working for some years past, and that is the Committee of Imperial Defence. I believe if that Committee is reconstructed on proper lines, it will give us what we want&#8212;a real Committee of Imperial Defence with the Dominions in it. The Prime Minister and one or two others are members of the Committee of Imperial Defence, but I think the Prime Ministers of the Dominions <i>ipso facto<\/i> should be all members of the Committee as well. But no Committee of that sort is of real value unless you have some technical advice, not the sort of technical advice that has happened in the past, individual officers occasionally coming up to register their opinions on problems, but that technical advice should be given by a sub-Committee, which is in continual session, and is studying these matters as they change from day to day, and is only there for an advisory purpose. In a period such as we are passing through of great financial stringency and transition, I think a great deal of money spent on armaments is a great waste, and that much more can be done by research and close study, and a Committee of this sort would give that study which is so requisite to the problems\nwhich I have tried to set before the House to-day.<\/p><p>So far as this country is concerned, the late Prime Minister, the War Minister, the late First Lord and the late Air Minister have all agreed that it is desirable to set up a Committee of this sort, that is to say, from the point of view of Great Britain, because they were not speaking for the Dominions. But if it is desirable from the point of view of Great Britain, how much more desirable is it from the point of view of the Empire as a whole. I have been harping on this subject now for two years, and I apologise to the House for venturing to speak on it again, but I have felt all along in the last two years the essential necessity of having a sub-Committee of this sort, that I have ventured to bring it before the House again. I believe that co-operation can be obtained in this way, and that it is the only way it can be obtained. We must grip these problems at once. If we do not, they will get beyond our control altogether. The future, to my mind, lies in the hand of the statesmen who are assembling here to-day. They have a very difficult and a very important task, and we are fortunate indeed in having them with us to solve these knotty problems.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>There has been a great deal of correspondence with the Board of Trade in reference to the suggestion which is contained in this Resolution. I am surprised, after the last communication from the Board of Trade to the bankers, that they have brought this in at all, because it is wholly unnecessary so far as the British Empire is concerned. Apparently the Board of Trade are entirely ignorant or the banking methods of conducting business within the British Empire. Any firm or company whose credit is worth anything can get their shipments financed to any part of the British Emipre&#8212;any firm which has goods to ship to Australia, India, Hong Kong, Ceylon, the Straits Settlements, or North Borneo even which is not so well provided with banking facilities, or South Africa. There are British banks by the dozen which are willing to buy commercial bills on any of those places provided that the credit of the firm on this side is good. They do not even look at the acceptors of the bill.<\/p><p>I will give you one example to prove this, because the Overseas Trade Department sent out to different countries their representatives to give information to the merchants and manufacturers of this country. The result is, the Board of Trade know perfectly well, that large numbers of manufacturers received orders from native traders in India and China.\nThe methods adopted were very simple. The native traders went to the representative of the Overseas Trade Department and asked to be put in communication with responsible people in this country to whom they could apply for commodities. They were put into communication and the traders sent orders and wrote to the manufacturers that they had opened credits with the National Bank of India or the Chartered Bank or one of the other large banks, and then the manufacturers shipped these goods and drew against them. These firms, with experience of trading in these countries, sent out samples and goods and drew against them.<\/p><p>After that, orders followed and credits were opened with these banks, which were acted on by manufacturers, but for a period after the War when everything was booming the manufacturers shipped out quantities of goods to these various markets, and other credits had been opened, and the firms drew bills on the native traders abroad. In the meantime while these goods were in transit the market went down, and when the goods arrived in India and other places the local merchants simply refused to take them up.<\/p><p>It is no secret that the markets in the East are simply flooded with British goods which it is impossible to sell, and on top of this we have the Government stepping in to say, \"We are going to assist somebody else to intensify the fearful glut which exists.\"The intention of the original Bill was to deal with the cases of countries like Roumania, Esthonia, and others, where there were no banking facilities. The exchange in those countries was such that it was impossible to send any remittances to this country during a given period, and the Government wanted to assist trade for responsible merchants, who could put up security, until such time as the exchanges became more normal and they could remit or could ship goods against the goods which they got from England. A certain amount of that trade has been done through the intermediary of the Government, but a great deal of trade has been done without the assistance of the Government. Now that the Government wish to extend that system, I would refer the President of the Board of Trade to the commercial history of this country and of India. He will find that even in the\ntimes of the old East India Company there was an enormous amount of trade between this country and India, and now it has developed to even more gigantic proportions, and it is ridiculous for the Board of Trade to come forward to-day to interfere in the normal conduct of the business of houses that have been established for a century or more. Some 57 houses have been there for 100 or 150 years, and now that the Government come in these houses will not know where they are at all, because they will not know when the Government are going to interfere, and how the Government are going to interfere, and what adventurers are to be assisted. What the Government do not appreciate is that one of the causes of the stagnation in the export trade arises from the fact that the markets of these countries have been flooded and that owing to the poverty of Europe there is no market for their produce. If there were a market in the countries of Europe&#8212;in Germany, France and Italy, which are all virtually bankrupt now&#8212;for the seeds, jute and other articles produced by our colonies that would right exchange, and the normal trade would come back again as it has been for generations past. The more the Government try by artificial means to remedy the state of affairs the more they will make it difficult for those who have carried on the trade for generations to keep it going until conditions become normal again. It is absolutely useless to try and oppose this Resolution. There would be no possible chance of success, but I do enter on behalf of the bankers who have carried on that trade willingly, and are willing to carry it on, and also on behalf of the merchants, the strongest protest I possibly can against the interference of the Government with the trade that has been carried on successfully against the whole world.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>It is an old custom that the Civil Lord of the Admiralty, when that office is held by a Member of this House, should present and defend Vote 10. For the first time in this Parliament, that office is held by a Member of this House, and, in presenting this Vote to-day, I am reverting to the old custom. I think it would be for the convenience of the Committee if I were to make a short statement on the general question of Vote 10 and were to review, quite briefly, some of the principal groups under which the chief or greatest number of items fall. One of the first questions that naturally arises on the presentation of any Estimates to-day is how much is being asked for compared with pre-War days, but before making that comparison, I should like to point out that nearly all the money in this Vote is concerned with building and engineering operations, the cost of which, as everybody knows, has increased by nearly 240 per cent. We are asking this year for a total of &#163;5,836,600. In 1914&#8211;15 the Vote for the same services was &#163;3,595,500. That shows an increase over the last pre-War Estimate of only 62&#189; per cent., and, if the Committee will take into consideration the enormous increase in the price of everything affected by this Estimate, they will agree that is very satisfactory indeed. If everybody could come forward with an Estimate increased by only 62 per cent. they would be very pleased.\nI would next ask the Committee to compare the Estimate for this year with the Estimate for last year. If hon. Members will look on page 97 of the Navy Estimates they will see various sub-heads ranging from A to O, and if they will look at the last two columns giving the increases and decreases they will see that on some Votes there have been increases and on others decreases. They will notice that for the first time there is given a very full description of the causes of the increases or decreases. That is done this year for the first time, and I hope that the Committee will find it convenient.<\/p><p>Compared with last year the net increase on every sub-head is &#163;682,600. There is an increase of &#163;932,970 under sub-head (<i>b<\/i>) New Works, Additions, and Alterations, and, as that more than accounts for the total net increase of the whole Vote, I propose to concentrate my defence on sub-head (<i>b.<\/i>) Before doing so, I should like to point out what large deductions have been made on items which were considered and which were put forward as vitally essential for the needs of the Service. Out of a total of &#163;3,044,660 under sub-head (<i>b<\/i>), &#163;2,496,660 is required for the completion of work which has been already voted by the House, and to-day I am asking for new works only to the amount of &#163;548,000, that being on account of items which will total &#163;2,446,040. This figure was arrived at by investigating proposals estimated to cost over &#163;8,000,000. The Committee therefore will see that, as a result of the recent deductions and adjustments in the schemes asked for and put forward as representing what was urgently required, 70 per cent. of the suggested outlay was disallowed, and we have satisfied ourselves with only 30 per cent. of the amount that was put forward as urgently needed. A large proportion of the items under sub-head (<i>b<\/i>) fall under three groups. The first is stowage for oil fuel, the second welfare items, and the third the provision and extension of naval armament dep&#244;ts. I want to take, first of all, the biggest expenditure, which is that on oil fuel stowage. The present policy of the Admiralty is to build ships to burn oil fuel only, and in a short time the Navy of this country will consist only of oil-burning ships. I do not think that in this year, 1921, there will be many people in this country who will contest the wisdom of this policy.<\/p><p>There are some hon. Members who make numerous speeches in this House, and, to my mind, a just retribution always comes to them, because sooner or later they are bound to be confounded by their former speeches. I have not been guilty of making many speeches in this House. The last time I opened my mouth here was in July, 1914, and it is rather hard that in the first speech I have to make since that time I find myself confounded by one of my very few former utterances. In pre-War days I did question the policy of oil fuel. In those days I had three arguments against it which I thought were good then, but which do not apply now. My first was that the oil resources of the world had not then been sufficiently explored to admit of a very wide policy of oil-burning ships. My second was that, as we were entirely dependent on overseas supplies of oil, it was very unwise to embark on any far-reaching policy of oil-burning ships before we had made adequate provision for the storage of oil in this country. Neither of those arguments holds good to-day. Even less does the third of my old arguments hold good. It was that we had in this country a priceless possession in a fuel that was cheap and abundant, and the supply of which would never fail&#8212;I refer to coal. I have had a calculation made comparing the prices of oil and coal. The Committee will understand that we have all sorts of different contracts in both oil and coal, and I have had worked out very carefully, the world flat-rate for oil and the world flat-rate for coal, and at the present moment, as far as we can see from our contracts, we are actually paying less money for the oil taking into consideration the respective calorific values. That is not the only advantage by a long way. Where you have to handle three tons of coal you only have to handle two tons of oil, and the handling of oil is much easier than that of coal when you consider that very often it can be carried out by means of a pipeline instead of by the most laborious process of filling coal bags, hoisting them on board and putting the coal down into an almost inaccessible stokehold. When you consider the amount of fuel handled every year by the British Navy, the Committee will realise the immense amount of labour, time and energy that can be\nsaved by the use of oil fuel. Further, the efficiency of oil fuel is very much higher than that of coal. I will only give the Committee one illustration. Destroyers, when they have to be refuelled, if they are coal-burning, must travel to some port and go through the laborious process I have briefly indicated. On the other hand, oil-burning destroyers have only got to go alongside a battleship, and in two hours they can be filled with oil and they are ready to go out again and pursue their duties. Another very important question in connection with the increased size of ships to-day is the amount of room that oil occupies. It is much easier to stow than coal, and although that may seem a small thing it is of vital importance to-day, when one of our greatest difficulties is that of fitting ships of ever-increasing size into existing docks by which an enormous amount of money is saved. Lastly there is the point of personnel, and that is one which speaks for itself. There is a large reduction of personnel in oil-burning ships as compared with coal-burning ships. If hon. Members could see the stokehold and engine room of an oil-burning turbine driven ship they would find it presenting a marvellous contrast with those in the ships of the old days.<\/p><p>I hope the Committee will concede the point that the oil-burning policy is a wise one, and is indeed the only policy which the Admiralty can pursue. If they concede that point I have then to ask for the money to meet the requirements of the stowage of oil fuel, and it is necessary to find the money under this Vote. What we are asking for may be divided into two parts. First we want to establish an Admiralty reserve at home. This was authorised by the Cabinet in 1919, and it is estimated the work will be completed in 1929 of building various places around the coast for the home reserves of fuel, and we are asking this year for a total amount of &#163;958,000. Besides that we have naturally got to provide supplies for oil-burning ships abroad. The total reserve required for that purpose has not yet been estimated and it is hoped that it is one of the questions that will be discussed and settled at the forthcoming Imperial Conference. For the moment the provision which is included in the Estimate under discussion is to meet the ordinary peace requirements of His Majesty's ships while cruising in foreign waters, and the Com-\nmittee will see on examining the Estimate that we are asking money for such places as Cape of Good Hope, Falkland Islands, Rangoon, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Sierra Leone, and Singapore. There is nothing strategic about these points at the present moment, they are simply to provide fuel for our ships on the ordinary ocean routes. The amount required this year for the foreign service is &#163;428,000, and the total for the whole of the oil service is &#163;1,386,000, an increase of &#163;724,000 over what was required last year.<\/p><p>I next come to the provision for the welfare of the men of the Navy. The Admiralty have known for a long time that many of the existing arrangements for naval ratings in dockyards and other naval establishments are totally inadequate for the comfort of the men. The War prevented a great deal of necessary rebuilding and remodelling, and to-day there is a very big accumulation of work of this kind, the need for which is urgent. A Committee was formed in 1919 to consider the welfare of the men, and the proposals now included in this Estimate are to enable the more urgent works to be started. We shall want more money for this in the future, and I should like to take the opportunity of warning the Committee that with the present stringency of money we are only doing what we can. The larger items consist of adaptation of rooms for mess purposes, alterations of buildings to provide better sleeping, messing and recreation accommodation, and to improve the cooking arrangements for the crews of ships in dry dock, which is a very important thing and has been a long-standing grievance in the Navy. I am sure the Committee will not grumble at the inclusion in the Estimates of these items which are long overdue and which will materially assist the comfort and well-being of the sailors. The total amount I have put under this leading of \"welfare\" is &#163;100,000.<\/p><p>The last point is that of Naval Armaments Depots, and the amount we are asking for is &#163;94,000. Provision for the stowage of high-explosive material falls under three heads. The first is the creation of new depots. During the War the centre of gravity shifted up North, and we have made new dockyards. We have to provide accommodation for explosive material in connection with those\ndockyards. The second head is the increased accommodation necessary in existing depots. The Committee will realise the enormous increase in the use of high explosives brought about by the experience of the War, and the consequent necessity for additional stowage. Take the case of mines. It was one of the things the British Navy was deficient in at the beginning of the War because of the stringency of money in old days. During the latter period of the War we were using enormous amounts, and we have got to have these mines ready and to have stowage for them. Then there are some forms of explosives, such as depth charges, which were not used before, and for which we have to find house room now. There are also bombs for air purposes which are practically new; war-heads and other things, all apart from the ordinary shells and cordite.<\/p><p>During the War, accommodation had to be found in a very hurried manner for a great many of these high explosives, and undoubtedly grave risks were taken, but we cannot permit these risks in peace time, and we are asking money to remove these risks or to reduce them as much as possible. The third head is protection for old depots, new and old alike. Not only has the quantity of high explosives in use altered, owing to War experience, but the quality has altered in a very marked degree, and nearly all the high explosives used now are far more powerful than those of the old days. These high explosives are liable to detonate if a fragment of shell or bomb is projected through their outer covering, and in connection with the possibility of air attacks that makes necessary a radical change in the arrangements for the protection of these explosives, I will only recall to the Committee two of the disastrous explosions which occurred during the War. One was at Silvertown in January, 1917, when 53 tons of T.N.T. detonated with the result that 73 men were killed, 900 were injured, and a large amount of destruction was done to property. At Halifax a much larger explosion took place when 2,600 tons of high explosive detonated, resulting in a death-roll of 2,000, and the devastation of two square miles of country. When we realise the proximity of some of our magazines at the present moment to large centres of population, I hope the Committee will concede the\nnecessity of paying a premium, even if it be fairly high, in the endeavour to secure the utmost possible immunity from such catastrophes in this country. That is all I propose to say in my opening statement. I have endeavoured to defend the one subhead under which there is a big increase. I should like to remind the Committee of the amount of increase on this Vote over the pre-War days, which is only 62 per cent. I hope to be able to answer any questions or criticisms that may be raised during the course of the Debate, and I trust that in these opening remarks I have not taken up too much time.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I daresay the right hon. Gentleman is perfectly right, and if he goes to a Division, I will support him on that point; in the meantime, I am pointing out that I do not think these people are badly paid at &#163;900 a year, and in these times, when one remembers the financial stringency, I do not think we are justified in voting a bonus to them. At the same time, I am sure hon. Members on this side were glad to hear the tribute paid to these people to the right hon. Gentleman for their efficient and whole-hearted services, and so on. We quite appreciate that. We are not making any attack on them or their efficiency. We wish them well in every way. We have a very excellent Civil Service in this country, and I, personally, have no hostility to them, but when things are so serious financially, and when we are harping on reductions of wages in every class of the community, I think it is wrong to give these bonuses to these people, especially as they may last for another 12 months, and the cost of living may come down very considerably in the present year.<\/p><p>I would like to draw attention to the fact that the Office of Works proposes to pay some of its humbler members what I consider an inadequate salary. Hon. Members will see in the Estimate an unspecified number of coal porters, hall porters, etc., to whom it is intended to pay wages ranging from 27s. to 32s. a week. Now a coal porter has to be an able-bodied man, obviously. A hall porter has to be a man of good character, and is usually a man of mature years, and very often is married and has a family, and wages of this sort are altogether inadequate. These humble people, I consider, are being offered wages that good employers ought not to pay for the same class of work, and I desire to enter, very briefly, my protest against these wages, Then there is an unspecified number of charwomen for whom the sum of &#163;2,500 is asked. I am sorry we are not told the number, and what each is being paid. The principle, I think, ought to be adopted by the Office of Works in regard to both charwomen and the junior clerical staff of adequately paying them, but not having more than are absolutely necessary. There is in the Secretariat what appears to be altogether a disproportion-\nate number of junior clerical people who are very lowly paid. You have there ten superintendents of female typists for this year, as compared with two last year; 52 shorthand-typists, as compared with 13 last year; and 74 typists, as compared with 13 last year. I daresay the increase is due to the building of the 10,000 houses, but even then it seems to me that, simply for the secretariat alone, and remembering the fact that there are many other clerks and junior clerical workers included in other Departments of the Office of Works, the number is excessive. The explanation can be found when we look at the salaries. For the typists, the salaries are from 22s. to 36s. a week, which, I think, is well below the wages offered for typists in the City. The shorthand-typists are paid from 28s. to 46s. a week. I think 28s. a week for shorthand-typists is altogether too low. You have a vast number of underpaid clerical workers. It would be preferable to have a smaller number of better paid clerical workers, who were thoroughly efficient, and see you got the best work out of them. I think the policy there revealed deserves attention. Might I ask a question with regard to the architects abroad? Why is it that we require architects in China and Japan, two in number, and an assistant architect, in addition, stationed in China? Is it in connection with the dockyard at Hong Kong?<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>Referring to the question I asked the Prime Minister at Question Time to-day as to the Naval policy in the coming year, I desire to draw the attention of the House to this most important matter, and my objects are twofold&#8212;first, to endeavour to persuade the Government to announce a decision which may save the country millions in ensuing years; and, secondly, if I may be permitted to do so, to create a greater\ninterest among the Members of the House in good time before any Naval Vote comes before them. This matter is of such great international importance, and of such importance to the taxpayer, that I make no apology to those members who have been good enough to stop at this late hour for drawing attention to the subject. I beg the House to believe me when I say that in anything I may argue presently, I have always before me the fundamental fact that on the strength and efficiency of the Navy there depend mainly the safety, honour and the welfare of this Empire. There has been a Sub-committee of the Imperial Defence Committee considering recently the question of, I understand, battleships or battle cruiser building. I understand they have been considering it from a political and from a technical point of view. I do not wish to touch on the technical side at all, except to say that I am a confirmed believer in the supremacy of the surface ship and of the gun in naval warfare, but, as regards the political aspect of the case, I think it is high time we had a decision and announced it to the world.<\/p><p>This is a very critical moment, having regard to the naval programmes of other countries, and if we could announce a decision now which showed we were not going to start rivalry and competition in battleship building, it might save the country hundreds of millions in future years, and possibly, as an hon. Gentleman says, from war. But whatever decision the Government come to, I trust they will take the country at once into their confidence, let it know what their decision is, and give their reasons for it. I trust there will be no secrecy, no stealthy building of ships, and things of that sort, but that they will declare their policy courageously and boldly so that the world will know what we are going to do. We have only two other countries to consider&#8212;the United States and Japan. I am fully alive to our alliance with Japan and our Treaty with the United States; but it is as well for the House to remember that those Treaties are liable to come to an end, and that there are no less than five different combinations, or rather, sets of circumstances, which may arise as between the three Navies. I do not wish to enter into that at the present time; it would take far too long;\nbut I will put one set of circumstances. Supposing that we resorted to war with the States, which God forbid, but it is always possible&#8212;we have been at war before&#8212;and supposing that Japan, seeing her opportunity whilst we two were at war, proposed to step in and expand, as she wishes to do. What would be the attitude of the two English-speaking nations towards that threat? That is only one set of circumstances which has to be considered. Whatever circumstances arise, the strategical aspect of the case bulks very largely as regards finance, and for this reason that if we build these huge battleships, costing &#163;8,000,000 or &#163;9,000,000 each, possibly, we shall have not only to keep and maintain attendant flotillas but we shall have to build bases overseas for them to work from. We shall have to develop at great cost at Halifax, Bermudas and Jamaica, and we shall have to go into the Pacific and find new bases on the West coast of Canada. We shall have to found a new Rosyth on the west coast of Canada, probably at Prince Rupert; Esquimalt and Vancouver are untenable against modern attack by gun or aircraft. We shall require another base somewhere in the neighbourhood of Port Moresby in New Guinea, and we shall have to develop Singapore into another Rosyth. Although we have secured these huge floating docks from Germany, it would land the country in an enormous bill for docks, coaling stations, oiling stations, ammunition depots and every imaginable thing necessary for battleship bases. And even if we had these bases it is questionable in my mind whether we could use battleships at all. For this reason, that the distances in the Pacific and Atlantic are so enormous. Japan is building as many battle cruisers as she is battleships, and I believe that for the reason that she appreciates what great distances these craft have got to move over. I desire to emphasise that point and bring it home to the House that in addition to the battleships themselves we have got to spend enormous sums of money on the bases which are essential for warlike operations if we are going to use these battleships.<\/p><p>We started in the old Dutch wars with bases in Deptford Creek, and after spreading all over the world ended up during the War with Germany with bases\nat Scapa Flow, Invergorden, and Rosyth. It shows how bases change their position, and there is no question that we shall have to build enormous bases in the Pacific, Caribbean and China Seas. I do not intend to-night to refer to the actual building programmes of these other countries. It is impossible to do it in the time. But I have obtained an answer from the Admiralty to a question I put the other day as to what were the actual facts as to the building of ships by the United States and by Japan. I am not going to enter into this, but I am satisfied of this: After examining this statement I say emphatically there is no occasion for us to lay down any battleships in this next financial year. Naturally this has been discussed by the naval advisers of the Imperial Defence Committee, and undoubtedly it must have been discussed by this Sub-Committee which has been sitting, and I think it is high time this Sub-Committee, if they have not already done so, should come to a conclusion on the subject, and that the Government should announce a decision which I hope is that which I have put before the House.<\/p><p>There is another aspect to which I am anxious to draw attention. In his speech from the Throne His Majesty referred to our friendly relations with foreign Powers. Thank God it is so Do not let us jeopardise that happy state of affairs by any foolish and provocative action on our part by initiating or even entering into rivalry and competition with these other countries. If there is to be any such iniquity and wickedness perpetrated, let the reproach of it lie with them and not with us. That is the moral side of the question. Let me refer to the practical side. What this country wants is not battleships. It wants five years of steady devotion to the propagation of industry, a reduction of taxation, of the setting of our house in order, and not of building battleships and bases. Any money which is spent in the next five years should be confined to an Army, a Navy, and an air force of the smallest possible limits and to research; experiment and research, so that when we do enter upon a programme of capital ships&#8212;I do not say battleships, for no one really knows what the capital ship of the future will be&#8212;we shall ensure that these ships will not become obsolete in the course of a few years as ships have been doing recently. It will give us an opportunity to further investigate the proper positions for our bases in the\nforeign seas and of getting them ready for these ships.<\/p><p>It may shock the House to know that in respect of design in many points we were behind the Germans in 1914. In the safety of our ships against torpedoes our design was behind that of the Germans. The Germans in point of accuracy of their guns were superior to us and in point of armour-piercing shells they were distinctly ahead of us. That affected our naval operations very seriously. I want money spent on research and experiment to clear up all these points before we start building new ships.<\/p><p>I desire to draw the attention of the House to the contribution of the Overseas Dominions and our other Possessions towards the upkeep of the Imperial Navies&#8212;not the British Navy only, for there is an Australian Navy, a New Zealand Navy and a Canadian Navy, or there should be. Hitherto, in my opinion, the Overseas Dominions have not done half enough in this respect, excepting perhaps Australia and little New Zealand. In round figures there are 16,000,000 white British people in these overseas Dominions as against 48,000,000 in this country, and on that basis the overseas Dominions ought to contribute a fourth of the cost of the Navy. But perhaps the fairer way to arrive at the proportion of the overseas Dominions is the volume of trade. I do not want to go into details, but in 1913 the volume of trade of our overseas Dominions and Possessions was no less than &#163;890,000,000. The overseas trade of our own United Kingdom was &#163;1,400,000,000. Included in these two figures there is &#163;500,000,000 of inter-trade between ourselves and the Dominions. On that basis, I think the overseas Dominions and our other Possessions should contribute nearly two-fifths of the cost of the Navies, including the Australian Navy and so on. But even in regard to Australia, let them consider their responsibility. They cry for a white Australia; what does that mean? It means a Navy in Australian waters comparable, at least, to that of Japan. The Australian Navy at present is insignificant compared with Japan's, but the responsibility for that lies with Australia. India, which did &#163;327,000,000 of trade in 1913, has a small India Marine, but contributes mighty little to the Navy Estimates. The Navy of Canada is a lamentable failure.<\/p><p>The contribution of South Africa is ridiculous, having regard to their trade. The West Indies, the East Indies, Mauritius; and Hong Kong, from which a tremendous trade flows overseas, contribute nothing at all, and the sooner this matter is considered the sooner it will relieve our finances.<\/p><p>Apart from the iniquity of any competition in this matter with the United States, we cannot afford to enter into that competition unless our Dominions pay their fair contribution towards the cost. It would be foolish for us to enter into such a competition, because they are far richer, and they would soon leave us behind if they wished, nor do I for one moment believe that they wish it.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I wish to say that, after carefully considering the shipbuilding programmes of foreign countries, the moral aspect of the case, and, having regard to the necessity for retrenchment, I deprecate most strongly any battleship being included in the coming programme. There is an old adage that a stitch in time saves nine. A stitch in the shape of a declaration that we are not going to build any ships this year may save the country hundreds of millions in the ensuing year.<\/p>",

I am somewhat surprised at the line taken by the Parliamentary Secretary, as the Government have already got over the difficulty in the case of men who are receiving pensions from the various Departments. I know hon. Members of this House who have been in receipt of pensions from the Government, and I have read of their being out of the country for a considerable period for reasons of health, but I have never\nheard that their pensions were stopped during the time they were away. If pensions can be paid in the case of Civil Service pensioners, or of Army or Navy pensioners, why cannot we get over the administrative difficulties in the case of these people who have been paying week by week for their pensions? I recall the case of men who are sent to Malta. The Admiralty requires a number of its men, middle-aged men, to go out to Malta for periods of two or three years, and they go also to Gibraltar and to Hong Kong. If it happens that only one of their parents is alive, they like to take that parent with them, because the family may never have been separated. Under this Bill, if those people in the Admiralty service care to take out their old parents the pension they are in receipt of will be stopped. Reference has been made by the hon. Member for Springburn (Mr. Hardie) to Cook's tourists. Hon. Members on the other side sometimes remind us of the trade unions. Trade unions have branches in various parts of the world. I deal with branches in Gibraltar, Malta, Simon's Town, Hong Kong and Bermuda. If the trade unions can get over the difficulty of distributing their benefits there, surely the Ministry of Health is not going to put itself in a secondary position to the trade unions? I trust, after the appeal that has been made to the Parliamentary Secretary by his own party, and after he has heard how the pensioners from other Departments can be paid, no matter what part of the world they are in, that he will grant this concession to people who are recipients of pensions under this Bill.<\/p>",

Member above the Gangway, and I think it is necessary to review the facts of paragraph. (<i>b<\/i>) in order to grasp the fulll meaning of the Amendment. Under paragraph (<i>b<\/i>) company may, as an alternative to the five per cent. Corporation Tax, pay a lesser sum, that being a sum calculated on 10 per cent. of the profits of the company after deducting from those profits, first, any debenture interest and interest on permanent loans, and secondly, any preference dividends paid at a fixed rate on preference shares. If the abatement from the 10 per cent. stops at that point, you are hurting the unsuccessful company and favouring the successful company. The benefit of the deduction rests entirely on the extent of the capital arrangement. Let me illustrate the point. If you take two companies, each with &#163;1,000,000 total capital, one company happening to have &#163;500,000 of 8 per cent. preference shares and &#163;500,000 in ordinary shares, and the other having a straight &#163;1,000,000 of ordinary shares, in the one case you get, as a deduction from the 10 per cent., 8 per cent. of the &#163;500,000 preference shares, whereas in the other case the whole of the charge falls on the ordinary shareholders and on the million of issued ordinary shares. The Chancellor of the Exchequer says that the whole of this tax falls upon the business or corporation, and does not in any way affect the shareholders. He pointed out that there would be no difficulty, because certain debentures and certain preference shares were to be exempted as to the amount of interest if issued before April last, and as to others, he said that it did not matter a bit as the whole charge came upon the business, and there could be no preference in connection with an\nold business. I suggest that there would, and that the difference is equal to a preference given to the old-established business. If he will look into the matter he will find that it is so, and that it is a distinct preference given to that corporation or trader. If you have a company with &#163;500,000 of issued capital to-day compared with a company of &#163;500,000 issued before 29th April, you have the further point that the capital issued before April last is given a preference to the extent of the interest on the preference shares of the company issued before April last.<\/p><p>Let me show another inequality. Three companies can be instanced. Two companies last year raised the rate of their preference dividend by 2 per cent., from 6 per cent. to 8 per cent., simply because it was not possible to raise preference money at a lower rate. In both these cases the increase in rate was entirely an accidental event and had no reference to this Bill, because this Bill was not then known. These two companies will obtain the benefit of an abatement of 8 per cent. on their preference shares instead of 6 per cent. Take the case of another company with &#163;350,000 of preference shares outstanding. They could not issue any more preference shares, and being short of cash they got the preference shareholders to agree to convert their preference shares into ordinary shares. That was only done a few months ago. It was due to the pure accident of that capital re-arrangement that in computing the amount of Corporation Tax they have to pay the preference dividend on &#163;350,000 worth of 6 per cent. preference shares. That is entirely inequitable. The accident of converting the share capital in the one case to ordinary shares denies them the right of deduction in computing the Corporation Tax.<\/p><p>There is a much more serious consideration than those to which I have referred, and that is the consideration which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Yarmouth (Sir A. Fell), namely, the driving of capital out of the country. The Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to that point and indicated that he did not look upon it as a very serious matter. There has been a steady tendency for some time past, owing to the burdens occasioned by increasing taxation of every kind, to drive the Colonial public utility companies and\na great many other companies out of England. I can mention companies who have actually left this country on account of the increasing taxation. They have been heavily hit by the various taxes prior to this tax. The Excess Profits Tax, in certain cases, drove them almost to despair, and this tax, I am sure, will drive a great many other companies to follow their example and leave the country. There is one company with a capital of &#163;200,000 which has left London. It has changed its location and is no longer recognised as an English company. There is a Bombay company with a capital of &#163;2,149,499 which has left the country, a Rangoon company with a capital of &#163;685,063, and a Hong Kong company with a capital of &#163;251,875. All these companies have left this country. It is generally agreed that a large number of other Colonial companies have under consideration the transfer of their head offices from London to places abroad.<\/p><p>How much will this tax yield altogether? A small amount of capital, relatively, transferred from London to abroad will more than swamp the total amount which you will get from the Corporation Tax. You will lose all the other taxes&#8212;Income Tax, Super-tax, and, so long as it lasts, the Excess Profits Duty. I do not think this tax can be supported as it stands, and I suggest that if the Chancellor of the Exchequer can see his way to give an abatement of a sum equal to 6 per cent. on the ordinary share's of the company, he would get over this difficulty&#8212;at any rate so far as the Corporation Tax is concerned. Is it not right that people putting their money into trade and industry should at least expect that that trade and industry should yield a reasonable return, coupled with their hard work? Is it not right, reasonable, and essential that they should at least be secured of revenue equal to the amount that a lazy individual can get by putting his money into British secured Government Bonds at 6 or 7 per cent.? Surely we are entitled to demand of the Chancellor of the Exchequer an absolute and definite exemption up to such an amount as a man who is living entirely on what is called unearned income can get, and that at least the man who is putting his money into industry and working hard is entitled to demand, before he comes under the Corporation Tax, exemption to an\namount equal to what the lazy individual can get; the man who sits beside the fire toasting his toes or taking scented baths and amusing himself. Speaking from a very wide experience in many industries in England, Scotland, and Wales I am certain that the amount that will be deductable, due to this exemption, will be trifling because, remember, the tax is computed on the basis of Schedule D and the actual amount taken would be very small; but this Amendment will release industry and give confidence that people who put money into trade and industry are entitled to 6 or 7 per cent. as a normal yield not subject to special taxation. I press the Chancellor of the Exchequer to think seriously over this Amendment, which will make very little difference in the yield and will go a long way to re-establish the confidence that is so much needed for those who are engaged in industry.<\/p>",

I wish it to be a reminder to the Secretary of State on a subject about which I have informed him already. During 1917, when stationed at Hong Kong as a military officer, I was invited one day to lunch at the Governor's house, the occasion being a reception to the Chinese mandarin who was the Governor of Canton. All British officers and officials of the colony were present. A discussion took place on one side of the table about a matter which had just been before the courts&#8212;a case of selling two girls, and as to whether it was legal in a British colony to buy or sell human beings. The Chief Justice, or whatever may be his proper title, laid down an <i>obiter dictum,<\/i> which was strange to the ears of an Englishman who had not been long in the colonies. It was to the effect that it was extremely doubtful as to whether slavery and the buying and selling of human bodies was not legal in Hong Kong. Since by the Proclamation taking over the territory of Hong Kong we\nagreed to observe Chinese customs; and slavery at the time was one of the Chinese customs to which we believed the Proclamation referred. No punishment was inflicted, but there were Englishmen in Hong Kong who still thought it was not possible to buy and sell people legally under the British flag, and so it was heatedly discussed. One of the legal gentlemen who had been at the trial was at the lunch, and the Consul-General from Canton carried on some slight discussion relating to what they considered to be the constitutional policy as to slavery within the British Dominions. After the conversation was over, so far as the British replies were concerned, the Mandarin silenced the whole discussion by making the following observations: \"It is true that under the old Manchu Dynasty slavery was a legal institution within the Dominions and Empire of China, but the moment that dynasty was swept away and a Republic established its first declaration, and its first most stringent law, was the abolition of slavery and the buying or selling of human beings, even for adoption or any other purpose, or in any other guise. Because it was a Chinese custom we found it very difficult to suppress it in China, and we have cut off the heads of hundreds of Chinamen to insist on this law being observed. Now one of the strangest things is that the only place where this can be done within the whole territory of China is Hong Kong, the possession of Britain.\"<\/p>",

Under the head of Special Miscellaneous Revenue the war contributions of India and the Colonies showed an increase of &#163;10,000,000, due to a further payment of &#163;9,000,000 by India on account of the liability voluntarily assumed by her for &#163;100,000,000 of the 5 per cent.

WARD:<\/p> <p>A subject has recently been brought to my attention which I desire to refer to for a little while only, because I do not think that the continued discussion to-day is really to stick to the rules of cricket. In addition to that, it is not necessary that any Minister should reply to me. But I want to place on the records of the House just a protest in reference to a matter of which I have personal knowledge. It comes, I suppose, under the Department of the Colonies. I have had sent to me a paper&#8212;\"The Child's Guardian,\" for April&#8212;apparently published in London. The front page deals almost entirely with a subject the heading of which is, \"Does child-slavery exist in a British Colony?\" Perhaps I had better read one quotation which will explain what I want the authorities to gather. I am now quoting from the \"Hong Kong Telegraph\":&#8212;\n<q>Whether slavery does or does not exist in Hong Kong is a matter upon which different people have different ideas according to their conception of the meaning of the term. One of our Registrars-General once referred in his Annual Report to a state of affairs which he admitted was, at any rate, closely allied. But on one point there can be no dispute, and that is that Chinese children are bought and sold in this British Colony, without their consent being in any way obtained, and no attempt whatever is made to hide the fact. This is a Chinese custom. Whilst we admit that very many of these children are far happier in their slavery than they would be in freedom, we say unhesitatingly it is a custom which ought to be suppressed. We can understand the horror of the English lady who wrote us yesterday on the discovery of the existence of this pernicious system in a British Colony, and while we agree with the sentiments she expressed, we are glad to think she realises the difficulties of the matter. We wish her success in her determination to get the matter brought to the notice of influential persons at home. It may interest her to learn that the very first enactment passed, when Hong Kong became British was an anti-slavery Bill, but it was disallowed by the Home Government, as it was considered that the Imperial Statutes for the abolition of slavery extended by their proper force and authority to Hong Kong. That means that the laws against trafficking in human beings are still operative.<\/q>\nThen this newspaper asks\n<q>Then why are they not rigidly enforced by His Majesty's officers in this Colony?<\/q>\nJust for a moment I will describe my own experience. When I was in Hong Kong, in 1917, by attention was called to this question, and I wrote letters to the Secretary of the General Federation of Trades Unions, and I gave report of a case which was tried in the High Court of Hong Kong, where for some reason or other the <i>ipse dixit<\/i> of the Judge was to the effect that as the buying and selling of human beings was a Chinese custom, and that when taking possession of the colonies we had agreed to observe the Chinese customs, and buying and selling of human beings, if included in that custom, could not be interferred with by us. I called the attention of the Federation of Trades Unions to this matter in the latter part of 1917. I asked them to keep it quiet, and I said that while we are fighting and battling with all the forces of our Empire I did not wish it to be known that we were tolerating the buying and selling of people in one of our own colonies. I asked them to go quietly to the Colonial Office and lay this very case before the Secretary of State for the Colonies and see if the matter could be quietly altered.<\/p><p>It strikes me that you cannot get anything quietly altered in this country and you have to make a noise before you can get anything done. I am informed by the Federation of Trade Unions that the Colonial Office definitely promised to attend to the matter if the Federation would not make it public property. They promised to see that this practice was curtailed and as far as possible abolished. Now we are having letters from Hong Kong, which are about to be published in a paper circulating in London, showing that this buying and selling of human beings takes place quite publicly. Anyone can go and see it done, and can offer so many dollars for one of these girls or boys as the case may be, which to my mind is a most outrageous proceeding. On this question the documents must be at the Colonial Office, and my letters must be there. A copy of the report of the trial to which I have referred at Hong Kong must be in the pigeon-holes of the Colonial Office, and yet not a stroke appears to have been done to deal with the matter. This seems to me to be so unusual and opposed to our character as a nation that I wonder how the thing has lived as long as it has done. I thought it was only necessary to draw the attention of the Colonial Office to it in order that it should disappear. Three years have gone by, and, according to an advance copy of a newspaper sent to me, the thing is still flourishing and would continue to flourish if I had not been allowed use of these few minutes, which I hope will be sufficient to put this inhuman practice down.<\/p>",

If you have not got so many officials you will not want so many houses for them! I am putting this point to the right hon. Gentleman: Is it wise for him to go in for this building programme at the dockyards? Now let me come to a subject where you are going to spend an enormous sum of money on new works; that is in connection with oil fuel establishments. Judging by the standard of the old days, it is an enormous sum of money that is projected. If we had gone to the Treasury when I was at the Admiralty and asked for permission to spend &#163;2,500,000, I do not know what the answer would have been, or what the Chancellor of the Exchequer would have said. You are going to spend, according to these Estimates, at Gibraltar&#8212;which is in addition to the accommodation there now&#8212;accommodation to contain the oil fuel&#8212;&#163;187,000; at Hong Kong, &#163;110,000; at Jamaica, &#163;47,000; Malta, &#163;195,000; Plymouth, &#163;555,000; Portland, &#163;956,000&#8212;nearly one million; at Port Said, &#163;555,000; and on the Clyde, &#163;400,000.\nThat is all new work. This is for oil fuel establishments to be begun this year. I ask again, is this wise? You are going to reduce&#8212;you have reduced&#8212;the Navy, and you will be more pressed in the future; is it wise expenditure at this moment, when everything is so dear, to launch out into this enormous expenditure for oil fuel establishments? This is nothing to do with the fuel. I put in a caveat against this when the Navy Estimates were last discussed, and I do so again most emphatically; because if you start these works you cannot stop them Now is the time to settle the question of unnecessary expenditure. I hope my right hon. Friend the First Lord will take note of it, because I am perfectly certain that a large amount of this money could be saved.<\/p><p>I have been talking economy, but there is one economy which I would not exercise for one moment, and that is to economise at the expense of the naval officers who have been demobilised. Naval officers have served their country splendidly during the War. Many of them are in a state of great anxiety. They do not quite know what the future will bring forth. They are splendid specimens of manhood. Therefore, I hope the Admiralty will be liberal with these officers. They deserve it.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I will take care not to stray any further. I do not think that I was a bit unfair to the Admiralty. If my right hon. Friend had been here&#8212;the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Admiralty was here&#8212;when one of the hon. Members for Devonport spoke (Sir C. Kinloch-Cooke), he would have heard the lion. Gentleman reading out very recent extracts from speeches of the present Sea Lord and the late, Sea Lord, who has gone to another place. and who received such a well-earned eulogy from my right hon. Friend,\nin which those two very gallant and respected admirals almost ridiculed the idea of trusting to anything but our own strong right arm at sea. Members of this House have said the same to-day, and we heard at once cheers of approval. Therefore, we are going back to the jungle law at sea, and, that being the case, let us see how the Admiralty policy is shaping. To begin with, the North Sea is now a British lake, and therefore no expenditure should be incurred on bases or air stations or anything of that sort in the North Sea above a bare minimum. I fear that there has been unnecessary expenditure on purely North Sea defences. If I might make a prophecy, the great strategical point of the future will be the Straits of Malacca, and Singapore is the place where development should take place with regard to dockyards.<\/p><p>The great flight to Australia, which has been so happily completed to-day, passed through Singapore. Singapore is not only a great strategical point from the naval point of view, but also from the aerial point of view. With regard to the dockyards, again referring to the jungle policy, I hope there will be no money spent on Jamaica. I regret to see that there is some allowance for oil tanks there. It will be impossible to hold Jamaica against the United States of America. [HON. MEMBERS: \"Nonsense.\"] I hear hon. Gentlemen who arc greater strategical experts than I am say \"nonsense.\" I at once bow to their superior wisdom. In any naval warfare in the Atlantic, with a hostile United States, Jamaica will be too far inside the enemy's territory, and could no more be held than Heligoland could be held against Germany in the late War. Hong Kong is also too far in the enemy's sphere of influence if we are going to fight against Japan, and any money spent there, I submit, could be much better spent with greater effect at Singapore.<\/p><p>With regard to home bases, Chatham, to which big ships cannot go except at high tide now, is a dockyard which will have to be turned over to mercantile work in the future. For the same reason Harwich had better be a purely commercial port. From a strategical point of view, money spent on Harwich could be much better spent elsewhere. I hope that the policy of keeping obsolete vessels abroad for the purpose of showing the White Ensign will not be continued. At present there are sloops and\ngunboats in the East Indies which in war time would be death traps and in peace time are not fitted to carry the British Ensign with dignity. The democracies in those countries are educated, they have a vernacular Press and the sending of obsolete sloops and gunboats will not very much affect them. The fastest and most modern ships should be available for that service. I would ask the right hon. Gentleman when replying to tell me whether it is intended in the future to keep up the expenditure of money on the present obsolescent vessels of the Royal Indian Marine? Many of those vessels have great historical names and have done great work in this War, but they are quite useless for modern warfare. The criticism I have to make of the &#163;157,000,000 Estimates is that the real reductions will not commence, so far as I can gather, until the summer. For some months the Navy was kept in a state of suspended animation.<\/p>",

The hon. and gallant Gentleman, for instance, made a statement which I resent, having lived for some time among the Russian people. I do not suppose there has been a greater proportion of massacres and murders on either side in this internecine struggle in Russia than there has been when civilisation and law and order have been uprooted in any period in the history of the world. These are the natural consequences of revolution. The unfortunate part of the business is that those who promote revolutions think they can do it on a sort of limited liability basis, but you cannot do anything of the kind. The history of the world has shown that moderate men may, by their very moderation and by repeated attacks upon an effete form of government-, destroy it. But these moderate men do not guide it immediately the old is destroyed. In every revolution in the history of the world, behind these moderate men, who are aiming at higher ideals and a higher form of a humane organisation of society, come the very worst elements, and they take advantage of the absence of law and authority to behave generally in such a way that those who originally initiated the revolution would almost prefer to go back to the conditions which they themselves had previously destroyed. I am very much afraid that is the situation in the country that we are considering.<\/p><p>I must, however, protest with all my power against an observation of the hon. and gallant Gentleman who said, \"Of course we know the Russians are not civilised at all.\" I have found them hospitable and decent men, and I am not so-sure that even a body of Russian workmen &#8212;if it were not for their language and, the crude gear that they are obliged to wear owing to the climate, considering the-chances our workmen have of education, whereas the ordinary labourer in Russia has no education at all&#8212;would not compare quite favourably with any body of workmen you could find in any of the Western countries of Europe. Therefore, I resent the statement, having been, friendly with these people and addressed meetings at which thousands of workmen were assembled. Given a chance, they are equal to our own men. Once human society is uprooted, you go back at once to the jungle, whether you like it or not. You would have the same thing here. If the hon. and gallant Gentleman wanted to set loose a similar set of men in this country I would kill him the first chance I got. Naturally every man's life is in his hands. You want to have lived there to see it then you understand immediately. It is general wherever human society is: destroyed, and there is no restraint where the worst elements can wreak their vengeance and satisfy their lustful appetites without any restraining influence of law and of authority. I say then that the Russians are no worse than probably we should be under similar conditions. On the basis of what they have done, or this, that or the other, you can, not make a general statement that the-Russian people are not civilised.<\/p><p>I think, however, it would be much more to my purpose if I were to illustrate exactly the situation as I understand from the time I landed at Vladivostok at the latter end of July, 1918. It may interest the historian to know that I was stationed with half my battalion at Hong', Kong and half at Singapore. Rioting and disorder had taken place at Singapore and half my battalion was left there while headquarters went to Hong Kong. In November, 1917, my battalion first received orders to collect itself together and proceed to an unknown destination. It was so unknown that a private citizen at, the hotel dinner table that night asked me when my battalion was going to move to Vladivostok. All preparations were made and orders given&#8212;instructions as to.\nthe behaviour of the troops and the officers and then about January, 1918, orders came cancelling the whole business. We understood that diplomatic difficulties had occurred. The Allies wished to interfere for purposes of their own, but the situation was not quite clear, and it was not certain whether we could supply the necessary force to enable the Allies to interfere effectively in the Russian difficulties. This went on until June, 1918, when imperative orders came which one could see quite clearly were definite and final. The battalion was to be collected together at Singapore and put upon the first ship which could be conunandeered and go straight away. We landed at Vladivostok about the end of July, 1918. Mine was a garrison battalion, and it was supposed naturally that its duty was garrison work for the maintenance of law and order. My instructions were definite, and I am now in a position, as a Member of this House, to state what my instructions were so far as I think the public interest will not be injured. I was a -senior officer, no Mission having arrived. It was distinctly Understood that the presence of British troops on Russian territory was not to be considered as an act hostile to the Russian people. We were there as friends and not as enemies. We were to fraternise wherever we possibly could with all those elements of Russian society that washed to maintain public order, and we were not to consider what kind of public order it was so long as it was order. As far as the instructions of the British Government were concerned, the forces were everything that the occasion demanded.<\/p><p>I had not been very long in Vladivostok before the Czech and Russian forces on the Usuri were outnumbered, and they retired some fourteen versts in one day towards Nikovsk. My battalion, on instructions, was hurried forward to assist the Czechs, and I need not enter into the business of these operations except to say this, which I think is an important point to remember: This was the time of one of the mast important phases of the War on the Western Front. Germany was then delivering hammer blows at the gates of Paris. There is not the slightest doubt but that the Allies' intention was not so much to be concerned in the internal affairs of Russia as to see if it were not possible to reconstruct the Russian Front so as to draw as many of\nthe German forces as possible from our front on the West and relieve the pressure upon our own Army. There is no doubt that is what we went there for. There is also no doubt, whatever may be the case now, that there was some kind of secret understanding with the Soviet Government and the Central Powers as to the part they were to play in the military operations, for this simple reason which I think is quite clear evidence on the fact which I suggest. On the Usuri there was scarcely a single soldier in the Bolshevik ranks who could speak Russian. They were almost entirely the prisoners of the Bolsheviks, probably under instructions from Potsdam. They were almost exclusively, both officers and men, released German and Magyar prisoners who had unquestionably, under some arrangement with the German-Bolshevik Governments, been put forward to extend, so to speak, the field of operations and as a centre for obtaining supplies for the Central Powers. In the great battle that was fought between the Japanese and this army, supported by the Czechs and detachments of the French and my own battalion, out of some 600 or some 700 men killed in a most murderous fire, with some five armoured trains, I do not believe there was a single Russian among the whole of the killed.<\/p><p>If we were now considering for the first time the question of intervention in Russia I am not sure that I would not take the hon. and gallant Member's view, but that is not the point. There is no peace in Russia, though you have it, here or at least I hope you have. We have not now to talk about intervention. If one could look through the files of the newspapers I should not be at all surprised if one found from the very papers which are opposing any expedition or any assistance ever having been given to Russia some very interesting statements. Some of the papers came to us later on, and they were wondering what the Allies were doing towards assisting Russia on to her legs in order that she might insist in the final stages of the War. Consequently, we are not considering the question of intervention or anything about intervention. It has been done. You cannot go into a country and ask these men to rally round you and reconstruct for your own purposes in order to assist and take off the pressure on your own soldiers and then say, \"Well, gentlemen, we have got peace now; there is no longer a Western Front. Good-bye! We are very sorry to\nlease you.\" Of course, I dare say there are some who would do that; but so far as 1 am concerned&#8212;the hon. Member mentioned the word \"honour\"&#8212;I do not think it would be quite honourable behaviour.<\/p><p>Having disposed of the Magyar and German forces collected under the Bolshevik banner on the Usuri, it then became a question as to whether the mere defeat of these different units, some partly Russian, some wholly non-Russian, was of any use unless somewhere, in some kind of form, some Government, some energetic and determined Government, could be established to administer the territories which had been conquered from the terrorists. We definitely decided to move forward to Omsk, and my battalion took the first plunge. With three months' supplies, it went forward over something about 6,000 miles of railway right into Omsk and eventually to Ekaterinberg. Let the hon. and gallant Member picture Omsk as it was when my battalion arrived, because it is well if you can focus the difficulty that your own representatives had to deal with when they arrived to carry out your mission at the particular point you had instructed them to go to Omsk was in a simply terrible condition. Its population had increased from 60,000 to possibly 100,000 or 200,000.<\/p><p>Then we were faced with another immediate problem. The mere fact that the British, though only 800 men, had arrived at Omsk, gave such confidence to the people all round the country who had been driven from their homes&#8212;sometimes their families half destroyed, many of them living in the forests, fearful to approach human habitation, wondering whether it was a friend or a foe&#8212;all began to collect around this miserable little band of 800 men, with British bayonets, with the result that the population increased from between 60,000 and 70,000 to nearly 700,000. You may guess that you would get all sorts of people amongst that lot, opposite in view, with no kind of order, no police, no anything. It is very nice when you have trouble in your house and you can call on a policeman from outside. That is a jolly fine thing, and it is something that is worth keeping, but when you get into a country where there is nothing of the kind and no order, it is different. Someone looks in at the window and thinks that it is a much better place than they have outside, and if you dispute their right of entry,\nwell, you do not wake up to find yourself dead; I suppose you wake up in the next world to find that out. Someone takes possession&#8212;there is no one to dispute their right to do so&#8212;the bodies are merely tumbled out into the street, and the sanitary cart next morning picks them up, frozen, and takes them away. There is no inquest, no policemen, no anything.<\/p><p>That is the condition that prevailed for sonic time. One thing used to happen pretty regularly. There were three lines along which their murder propaganda mostly went. I sympathised with them in one case. If any officer dared to wear his shoulder strap he was to be executed. That is this gentle, democratic Soviet Government. The next line was that as-they had abolished all law, and declared that for the future nothing but common sense was to make justice between man and man, they naturally abolished lawyers, and there was no close time for them. Probably if there was any good thing about their proposals that was it. For a most astonishing reason, the next class that could be destroyed at sight if they wore their uniform were the cadets, the boys, who attended the schools. Those were the three ostracised classes, officers who dared to wear their shoulder straps, lawyers who were known to be such&#8212; [Laughter]&#8212;and cadets. It is very laughable, but the lawyers did riot laugh. Almost every morning in Omsk, at first, sometimes it would be four officers, sometimes five or six, sometimes nine or ten, and occasionally, General Knox told me, and I know it for a fact from the observations of the supreme Governor, the number would rise to twenty and twenty-four each night, and these officers would be found dead in the street in the morning. Occasionally an officer would be taken into some shed or elsewhere in order to be drawn away from the public streets, and one could see quite clearly that because he had defied them and continued to wear his shoulder strap to show that he was an officer the shoulder strap had been deliberately screwed on to his shoulder before he was killed. This condition of affairs naturally got on to the minds and nerves of the officers, and there being no law and no means by which they could get hold of the murderers, I am bound to confess that eventually the officers banded themselves together, and if there were ten officers murdered one night ten citizens, who they thought might be themselves responsible for the crime against the\nofficers the previous night, were found dead the next night. I do not know, but I dare say there must have been many innocent people killed as a result of this blindly hitting out to try to prevent their own murder. At the same time it is a fact that eventually the officers must have got hold of the right people, because these midnight murders and outrages suddenly ceased. We Pope they got the right people at last. Those were the conditions that prevailed. That scene of blood and murder was the condition of affairs into which we were hurled about this time last year.<\/p><p>The hon. and gallant Member referred to the old directorate. He has suggested that Admiral Koltchak, with the sanction -of the Allies, destroyed the Constituent Assembly. No such thing existed. The Constituent Assembly had existed in Petrograd and was maintained in Petrograd to form a new constitution for Russia, but Trotsky and this gang of murderers that he hon. and gallant Member is so fond of, destroyed that Constituent Assembly.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>I beg to move\n<q>to reduce the Vote by &#163;1.000.<\/q>\nI move this Amendment in order to draw attention to the breakdown of the cable system between this country and the oversea markets. The breakdown is having a very prejudicial effect on the all-important export trade of England, and more particularly the cotton trade of Lancashire. No doubt, some improvement has taken place, during the present year, but I do not think the authorities even now sufficiently realise what a very grave handicap this is, and that the length of time it takes to cable from England to the East has a serious effect upon the welfare of our staple trades. At the present time it takes, on an average, nine to eleven days for a cable to pass from England to Calcutta. It takes eleven to sixteen days for a cable to travel from Lancashire to Karachi, seven days to China, ten days to Bangkok. There was a case as recent as last Tuesday where it took nineteen days for a cable message to come to Manchester from Padang, in Sumatra. I ask hon. Members to realise the effect of these delays upon the transaction of business between this country and the oversea markets. Every commercial contract consists of an offer and an acceptance, and in a trade like the cotton trade the offer must depend upon the then value of cotton. That value fluctuates from day to day, and greatly from week to week, and, of course, an offer which is held up for something like a month before the acceptance is sent back goes absolutely to nothing, because by the time the acceptance reaches this country the value of the cotton may be twice as much or half as much as when the offer was sent out from Lancashire. The result is that business is not being done.<\/p><p>This breakdown is not confined to the cables between England and the Far East. There is great delay in cables between England and Egypt, and an extraordinary delay in the transmission of telegrams from countries as near as France and Belgium, to England. There are many cases, which have come to the actual personal experience of business houses in Manchester, of great delays in the offer or acceptance of business. A telegram offering or accepting business from Paris or Antwerp has been accompanied by a confirmatory letter, and in a very large number of cases the letter has arrived several days before the telegram. There can be no greater condemnation of the management of the present telegraphic system between England and other countries than that, and there could not be a greater drawback to the carrying on of the shipping trade, on which the welfare of so many millions of people depends. I ask the Postmaster-General whether he will not adopt certain specific measures straight away and put an end to this deadlock, so as to give Lancashire and the whole trade of this country those facilities for export trade for which we are entitled to look? It is good to know that the commercial codes are to be allowed again in this country; no doubt that will increase the volume of our oversea trade.<\/p><p>There are many cases where we believe that the reason why commercial messages from England to the Far East and the Near East have not travelled with due dispatch is due to the cables being taken up by far too large an extent with Press news. We have in Manchester firsthand information that the newspapers in India and Shanghai are in possession of news of utterly insignificant social events in this country within a few hours of their occurrence. There was one case where a social event of very minor importance was actually recorded in a Shanghai newspaper on the 27th March, at a time when they had no later commercial news from England than the 11th March. [Hon. Members: \"What was the event?\"] It was the Royal visit to Bethnal Green. Hon. Members will remember the well-known criminal case called the Billie Carleton case. News of that case was flashed to every market of the Far East within forty-eight hours of its occurrence. Any social scandal, any celebrated suicide or murder echoes round the world, while the voice of commerce is hushed. I think\nwe can justly complain that there is an undue dispatch of Government messages along these lines. The right hon. Gentleman stated that the volume of Government messages over the cables to the Far East is about eighteen times what it was in 1914. No doubt a large number of those messages are exceedingly valuable, but a very large number of them must be of relatively minor importance. It does not need anyone to be particularly imaginative to conjure up the kind of message that is flashed across these cables by the Government. \"Soldiers will be demobilised as soon as the political situation allows; compassionate cases will be considered as soon as political exigencies admit,\" and all the other Government messages of a stereotyped character. These messages choke the cables, and the result is that the great commercial houses in England are unable to carry on business with their markets oversea, to the very great detriment of every interest in this country. It is the practice to accept urgent cables from Hong Kong to this country which do not take longer than thirty-six to forty-six hours in transmission. We should very much like to know whether it is possible to have the same urgent rate available for those who wish to send messages, to Hong Kong. If urgent messages can be sent from places like Hong Kong, why should they not be sent from stations in India, Egypt, and the Near East?<\/p><p>We are given to understand from the the speech of the right hon. Gentleman that there is a difficulty due to the want of efficient personnel. I have had several cases brought to my notice of men who have served during the War in the signal sections of the Royal Engineers, and they say that they would most gladly undertake work in the Post Office if they could be placed upon the permanent establishment. One man wrote to me and stated that he had been four years on signal work at Army Headquarters, that he had passed an examination to be a skilled-rate engineer, able to receive and send forty telegrams an hour, and he and many men like him would be very willing to enter the service of the Government if there is a shortage in personnel, provided that they are given places on the establishment. I understand that places on the permanent establishment are refused to these returning soldiers if before the War they did not happen to be in the employment of the Post Office. On that point I\nthink everybody will be in thorough agreement with the observations of the hon. Member for Ince (Mr. Walsh) in regard to the treatment of Post Office servants. If their conditions were made attractive there is no doubt that people would be only too glad to enter into the service. Many of us receive complaints from persons in the employment of the Post Office, and pre-war pensioners, who complain that their pensions are totally inadequate to the present cost of living. We have also complaints about gratuities. We know that many of the 85,000 returned soldiers still labour under a sense of grievance, just or unjust. If the service in the Post Office is made attractive, and if provision is made for highly-skilled, technically-trained returning soldiers, who have not had the good fortune to be in the Government service before or during the War, the alleged deficiency in personnel will be removed, and we may have high hopes that this great breakdown of our cable and telegraph service will be rectified.<\/p><p>Those who are associated with me in this Resolution have no feeling whatever against the Government in bringing the matter forward. We have put it in this form because the breakdown has a most important bearing upon the great problem of reconstruction which occupies everybody's mind. Reconstruction is in a sense a matter that is moral and spiritual. We want to translate into civil life the high standards that have been followed by our fighting men and by the women who have waited for them at home. But no moral and spiritual reconstruction, and no scheme of social reform, no betterment in housing, health, or education, is of any value unless it is built upon the sound, sure, and solid foundation of prosperity on which Old England rested. It is no good trying to translate ideals into realities unless the country at the same time has a sound economic basis. That is the reason why I wish to call attention to this great stumbling-block to the progress of our staple industries. Before the War we can all recall the shining pageant of the British export trade, the ceaseless flow of English goods, English credit, English influence along every avenue of the world's commerce, and it was this system of cables and telegraphs which has now broken down that acted most powerfully as an agent for transmitting the energy of Britain into every corner of the globe. That system has broken down. Of that system the Postmaster-General is the\ntrustee, and it is because we want to see a thorough reformation of that system that I move this reduction.<\/p>",

Friend the information he requires and to take this opportunity of saying a word about this fund which may not be out of place in a new House of Commons. The Treasury Chest Fund consists of a capital sum of &#163;700,000, created by Act of Parliament for the purpose of making temporary advances for any public service and repaid to the fund out of money voted by Parliament to such services or other money applicable thereto. It is, in practice, a banking fund, with a head office in London, for remitting money to all parts of the world where there are British garrisons or troops. No expenditure is finally charged on the fund, and each year, when the accounts are made up, it shows either a profit or a loss. If there is a profit, that is transferred into the Exchequer; if a loss, the amount is provided for out of a Vote by Parliament. With regard to the point my hon. Friend raised, the loss this year has been made almost entirely on the exchange with Hong Kong. Hong Kong has been during the\nWar a very large naval station. There has been a very rapid rise of the dollar, I and, in accordance with the recommendations of a Committee of this House which reported in 1913, the dollar in the East is issued at a fixed rate, determined each month on the average for the preceding month of the exchange rate in Hong Kong for telegraphic transfers on London. When you get a rapid rise, as occurred in the autumn of 1917, then we lose on the exchange. The loss that we show amounts only to a fraction of 1 per cent. on the very large turnover that had been made in the Treasury Chest Fund during the year. In some years we get the benefit of the exchange and we make a profit. That was the case in the preceding year to which my hon. Friend referred. I hope it may be possible that the process from which we suffered in the year 1917&#8211;18 may be reversed in the course of the present year, but, of course, that is a thing over which we have no control. We have also often made a profit on the account, but we have more often, over a series of years, at any rate in recent years, made a loss. That is the explanation of the transaction. We have sundry amounts which have been brought into credit in places where the exchange has been favourable, and a sufficient balance has been accumulated to provide interest, which also comes to the fund. Hon. Members will notice in the statement of accounts that a particularly large sum came from Capo Town this year. There was a reason for that; it was because those who were managing the matter there were apprehensive of the amount which might be required to help to make payments for the troops in South Africa. There we had a substantial payment of interest on money we had accumulated, which is brought to the credit of the fund. In all the circumstances the loss that has been made is one that need not cause us any anxiety, and I do not think the Committee need feel any reluctance in voting this Estimate.<\/p>",
