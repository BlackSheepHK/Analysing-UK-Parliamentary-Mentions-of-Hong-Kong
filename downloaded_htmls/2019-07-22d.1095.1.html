On Friday evening, the police seized a quantity of explosives from a warehouse in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Territories">New Territories</a> along with knives, petrol bombs, corrosive acids and T-shirts supporting Hong Kong independence. On Saturday, there was a large rally in the area known as Central in support of the Hong Kong police. Yesterday, hundreds of thousands of people took part in a largely peaceful march on Hong Kong island; however, some protesters diverted from the approved route and there were clashes with the police, including outside the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Central_Government">Chinese Central Government</a> liaison office. Last night, there were disturbing scenes in the New Territories town of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuen_Long">Yuen Long</a>: a group armed with chains and poles attacked pro-democracy protesters and other passengers at the metro station; 45 protesters were reportedly injured, one critically. We were all shocked to see such unacceptable scenes of violence.</p> <p pid="d1095.2/2">There has been a great deal of speculation about the identity of the group who attacked people at Yuen Long metro station, but it is important that we do not jump to conclusions on their identity until a thorough investigation has taken place. I welcome <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Lam">Carrie Lam</a>&#8217;s statement today saying that she has asked the commissioner of police to investigate this incident fully and pursue any law breakers. We will be keeping a close eye on this, as I know will hon. and right hon. Members.</p> <p pid="d1095.2/3">I condemn all violent acts, but I stand by people&#8217;s right to protest peacefully and lawfully. We must not let the violent actions of a few overshadow the fact that hundreds of thousands of people took part in the march yesterday and did so in a peaceful and lawful manner. In doing so, they were exercising their right to peacefully protest and stand up for their freedoms. We fully support this right, which is guaranteed under the joint declaration. Successive six-monthly reports in this House have highlighted that Hong Kong&#8217;s political freedoms have been coming under increasing pressure, and the House is right to reflect this in its appetite for <a href="/glossary/?gl=19" title="An Urgent Question, formerly a Private Notice Question (PNQ), is a question..." class="glossary">urgent questions</a>, parliamentary questions and statements.</p> <p pid="d1095.2/4">Let me assure the House that the Government remain fully committed to upholding Hong Kong&#8217;s high degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms under the one country, two systems principle. They are guaranteed by the legally binding joint declaration. We will continue to be unwavering in our support for the treaty and expect our co-signatory to behave in a like manner.</p> <p pid="d1095.2/5">Rights and freedoms and the rule of law are vital for Hong Kong&#8217;s future success; for its people, we will continue to stand up and speak out.</p>            </div>

Does he agree that there has been some doubt as to the wording of the governor of Hong Kong&#8217;s promise to suspend the plans around extradition, and that that  could do with some clarification? Does he also agree that huge numbers of people are taking part, which reveals a deep concern about these ongoing proposals, and is there any way that he can use his office to assist in the clarification that the extradition plans will be 100% dropped?</p> <p pid="d1095.3/2">Obviously this month saw the 22nd anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to Chinese rule, and the day was marked by real fear among many people in Hong Kong that the principle of one country, two systems is being reneged on. Media reports paint an alarming picture: 45 people were injured, and of significant concern is that one of those was a journalist, and there is a question over press freedoms and the fact that the police were very slow to respond.</p> <p pid="d1095.3/3">Coupled with the escalation in violence, reports also came out this weekend that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> approved an export license for &#163;1.9 million-worth of telecommunications interception equipment to Hong Kong. Will the Minister tell the House what human rights assessment was made before the approval of that licence given the concerns raised previously about the Hong Kong authorities&#8217; treatment of protesters during student protests in 2014, and how the Government intend to address the ongoing urgent concerns about the protests and the way they are being handled? Finally, will the Minister once more provide assurances that we stand with the people of Hong Kong in defending their democratic right to protest?</p>            </div>

Lady&#8217;s last question, about our standing shoulder to shoulder with the people of Hong Kong in their right to protest. I know that it was a rhetorical question, but it is worth emphasising that of course this country stands shoulder to shoulder with the people of Hong Kong, as I laid out in my opening remarks. On her point about interception equipment, I could find evidence of one licence, but it was an extant licence connected to counter-narcotics, counter-trafficking, search and rescue and counter-terrorism. I would say to the hon. Lady with the greatest of respect that if you will the ends, you have to will the means. She will be familiar with the safeguards that this country has in relation to equipment that a country could use to disadvantage people internally or to pose a threat to its neighbours. They are well rehearsed, and I probably do not have time in responding to her question to rehearse them again.</p> <p pid="d1096.0/2">The hon. Lady mentioned the governor, but I think she meant the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive">Chief Executive</a>. That was a Freudian slip and it is perfectly understandable that she would use that term, but it is important to understand the UK&#8217;s position in all this, because we are simply a co-signatory to the Sino-British joint declaration. We cannot impose things, as was perhaps the case in the past, and neither should we. It is important to understand Hong Kong&#8217;s autonomous behaviour, which we stand fully behind in accordance with the tenets of the joint agreement.</p> <p pid="d1096.0/3">On the status of the extradition arrangements associated with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Lam">Carrie Lam</a>, I think that she has made it fairly clear that they are dead in the water. On the undertaking on one country, two systems, it of course remains our view that that is in the interests not only of Hong Kong but, I humbly suggest, of China as well. We will continue to point that out in our discourse with Beijing.</p> <p pid="d1096.0/4">The hon. Lady rightly commented on press freedom. Of course that is at the forefront of the mind of Ministers in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCO">FCO</a> right now, given that we have recently hosted with Canada the media freedom conference, at which many of these issues were aired. I do not think anybody can be left in any doubt as to the position of the United Kingdom in this matter, which is four-square behind the journalists who serve us so well in articulating concerns and reflecting on world events in the manner that they do. The hon. Lady mentioned police behaviour. It is important that police behaviour in the UK or any country should be fully scrutinised. We have a proud tradition of that in this country, and we want to inculcate those norms and practices elsewhere.</p> <p pid="d1096.0/5">In general, Hong Kong is a peaceful place with a good record for safety as a city. It has an independent judiciary who ultimately would be tasked with forming a view on whether the police have behaved appropriately, but before that, it is important that matters of concern are investigated internally, and I am pleased that the police commissioner and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Police_Complaints_Council">Independent Police Complaints Council</a> in Hong Kong have undertaken to do just that.</p>            </div>

Lady&#8217;s assessment of the deteriorating political situation in Hong Kong. I also share her revulsion at the scenes we saw on our television screens over the weekend. We have called for an independent inquiry, and we would like to know what the scope of such an inquiry would be. That is important, particularly since the situation is evolving. When we originally called for such an inquiry some time ago, we were presented with certain facts, and we were calling for such an inquiry on the basis of what we knew at that time. Things have changed since then, and different things have happened, and we would like such things, including the weekend&#8217;s events, to form part of that inquiry.</p> <p pid="d1098.0/2">This is a rapidly evolving piece, but we need to know to what extent the inquiry will be full, comprehensive and, as the hon. Lady is right to say, independent, which is crucial. It probably is not sufficient simply to have an internal police inquiry, which is what the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC">IPCC</a> would be in a Hong Kong context, and it really does need to involve Hong Kong&#8217;s excellent and well-respected judiciary.</p> <p pid="d1098.0/3">I cannot really speculate on the nature of the individuals who are responsible for last night&#8217;s attacks, and it would be very premature to do so. Those things would need to be explored in any comprehensive inquiry, and the hon. Lady will understand that it would be unwise and unreasonable to speculate at this stage, although she will have seen the same press reports that I have.</p>            </div>

His judgment is spot on in that respect.</p> <p pid="d1099.0/2">My hon.

Friend that working together to ensure prosperity in Hong Kong is vital. On the rule of law, we have to work with a number of systems across the world, and we need to be a little careful about insisting on a particular model. I am proud of our norms and values, and I have no difficulty in trying to inculcate them, but we have to be respectful of our partners. Particularly when engaging on human rights, we need to make it clear where we are coming from and the importance we attach to them, including when we come to strike trade deals. It is perfectly legitimate for such agreements to contain reflections on human rights, but we also have to respect our interlocutors.</p>            </div>

Gentleman refers, it would be perfectly reasonable for such a body to take a view on the treatment of journalists who had been abused. There is currently a worrying tendency around the world for journalists who are doing their very best to promote an open and transparent society and world order to be abused in the way that they sadly have been in Hong Kong recently, as they have in other parts of the world. I share the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s concerns. It is clearly up to the committee to work out how it is going to do its work, but no doubt it will take note of the particular abuse to which he refers.</p>            </div>

Friend is right to say that in 2047 the formal period covered by the Sino-British joint agreement will come to an end. The Government hope that the good practice in that agreement, which we hope will continue during the timeline of this particular agreement, will continue thereafter. In particular, we hope that the commitment to the one country, two state system, and the basic law and everything that is contained within that, including measures to further democracy beyond that which currently exists, will continue. I do not necessarily share my hon. Friend&#8217;s pessimism, but there is real benefit in the special status of Hong Kong as far as China is concerned. I very much hope that if China wants Hong Kong to continue to be a place where business is done and foreign revenue is earned,  it will insist on the continuation of human rights and democracy, which underpin the uniqueness of Hong Kong to the mutual advantage of Hong Kong and mainland China.</p>            </div>

I would hope that China agrees that its special nature is good for China, too. It is good for Hong Kong, and it is good for China. It is good for China&#8217;s prosperity. Articles 45 and 68 of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law">Basic Law</a> contain within them the seeds of advancing democracy. That is why they are there and were signed up to by both the Chinese and the UK Governments in 1984. That is where I would like to see the attention focused in the years ahead, running up to the end of the Sino-British agreement. If we can move towards that, I think China will come to see that it is to its advantage, as well as to the advantage of the people of Hong Kong, that we should advance democracy further in Hong Kong rather than see it pulled back. Unfortunately, that is, as the hon.

The eyes of the international community are on China. It is true to say that, traditionally, China has been fairly reticent about making statements of the sort that the hon. Gentleman was expecting from Beijing, but I hope that I have made it clear in my remarks that we talk constantly with China, with our interlocutors; that we have a good and productive dialogue in the main with Beijing; and that we will continue to enforce the importance of that. That is the way that diplomacy is done. I am confident, because I am an optimist, that China will come to see that its interests, as well as the interests of the people of Hong Kong, are best served by preserving the one country, two systems status that was agreed in 1984.</p>            </div>
