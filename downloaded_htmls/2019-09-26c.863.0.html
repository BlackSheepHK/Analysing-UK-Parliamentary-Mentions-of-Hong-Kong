This is an example of when all sides of the House can come together to discuss an issue that is of joint concern across the political spectrum.</p> <p pid="c863.1/2">I remain seriously concerned by the situation in Hong Kong. Protests are now in their 16th week, and millions have exercised their right to peaceful protest. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> are doing so peacefully and lawfully, but I know the House will join me in condemning the violence that we have seen on the streets of Hong Kong from a minority of those engaged in protests. It is essential that protests are conducted peacefully and within the law, and that the response of the authorities is proportionate.</p> <p pid="c863.1/3">With that in mind, the United Kingdom supports the one country, two systems model and framework and of course the rights, freedoms and high degree of autonomy granted to Hong Kong and its people under the Chinese-British joint declaration. That joint declaration was signed by the Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty">Her Majesty</a>&#8217;s Government in 1984, and the autonomy, rights and freedoms it guarantees are enshrined in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Basic_Law">Hong Kong Basic Law</a>. It remains as valid today as when it was signed almost 35 years ago and is a legally binding international treaty. We expect China to live up to its obligations under it and, as a permanent member of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a>, to its wider international human rights law obligations, including those in the UN charter.</p> <p pid="c863.1/4">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> believe that a resolution can only be achieved with meaningful political dialogue that builds trust between all the parties on all sides. I welcome <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Lam">Carrie Lam</a>&#8217;s formal withdrawal of the extradition Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2019-09-04">4 September</phrase> and some of the incremental steps she has taken to improve the credibility of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Police_Complaints_Council">Independent Police Complaints Council</a>. The initiative this week from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Government">Hong Kong Government</a> to consult the people they serve will be a first step on the essential path towards a more inclusive political dialogue&#8212;one that builds trust with all communities in Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="c863.1/5">In recent weeks, I have spoken to both the Hong Kong <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive">Chief Executive</a>, Carrie Lam, and to the Chinese Foreign <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, State Counsellor <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi">Wang Yi</a>, and I have made it clear that the UK continues to support one country, two systems. I have also made clear, however, our concern about human rights and, in particular, the mistreatment of those exercising their right to lawful and peaceful protest. The concerns of those peaceful protesters should be addressed by political dialogue, not crushed by force.</p> <p pid="c863.1/6">I have also spoken to a wide range of my counterparts internationally, and I welcome the strong statements from our international partners. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> raised Hong Kong at the recent <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a> meeting, where all G7 partners reaffirmed the importance of the joint declaration and called for an end to violence. We will   continue to engage with Hong Kong and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>, reiterating the fundamental importance of upholding the UK-Chinese joint declaration. Hong Kong&#8217;s high degree of autonomy is what guarantees its future prosperity and success. It is incumbent on all sides to respect it.</p>            </div>

Although the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive">Chief Executive</a> of Hong Kong, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Lam">Carrie Lam</a>, has announced that the controversial extradition Bill will finally be withdrawn, this for some is far too little too late. The level of protest has grown in the face of brutal police repression, and I have been appalled by the way that protesters have been beaten by police officers and gangs rumoured to be associated with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Government">Hong Kong Government</a>.</p> <p pid="c864.0/2">Basic democratic freedoms of the press, the right to assemble and the right to protest are enshrined in the Sino-British joint declaration, an internationally recognised treaty to which we are of course a signatory. In the past few weeks, protesters have also been gathering outside the British consulate in Hong Kong demanding that our Government do more. Will the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> please tell the House what contact he has had with the Hong Kong Government about the ongoing protests in Hong Kong and specifically on the issue of police brutality? What dialogue has he had with the Hong Kong Government to promote a move towards universal suffrage as per the joint declaration? What steps are the Government taking to support any holders of a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_national">British national</a> overseas passport in Hong Kong who are facing undue risk or harassment as a result of taking part in the protests?

Lady for her questions and interventions on the substance and the constructive way she has presented them to the House. I share her concerns about the repression of peaceful protest, though mindful, as I have said, that some of the protests have been violent, which is unacceptable too. I also share her concern to make sure that the right of peaceful protest enshrined in the joint declaration is respected on all sides in Hong Kong and by us and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>.</p> <p pid="c864.1/2">I will, if I may, make a couple of further points. The joint declaration, as a bilateral treaty, reflects not just the right to peaceful protest but the basic international human rights obligations, which would apply to China in any event. It is a bilateral expression of those rights, and it is important not just for the people of Hong Kong but for the wider model that China advocates&#8212;the one country, two systems model&#8212;and which we wish to respect.</p> <p pid="c864.1/3">The hon. Lady asked what contact I had had with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive">Chief Executive</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Lam">Carrie Lam</a>. I spoke to her at length on <phrase class="date" code="2019-08-09">9 August</phrase>, and I raised all the issues that I have already expressed, particularly the disproportionate use of force by the police against the protesters. I also raised the issue of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Police_Complaints_Council">Independent Police Complaints Council</a>. In line with and alongside the withdrawal of the extradition Bill, that is an area where the Government in Hong Kong have taken some steps to try to strengthen and   reinforce their impartiality and therefore their credibility. We need to test that very carefully and see whether it produces an impartial and objective review.</p> <p pid="c864.1/4">The hon. Lady rightly raises the issue BNOs, and I thank her for that. The status of BNOs is part of the package that was agreed in terms of the joint declaration. There is no right of permanent residence under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> passport, but it is part of the overarching model of one country, two systems which, at least at this point, we are arguing needs to be respected, but it needs to be respected by all sides, including by China.</p> <p pid="c864.1/5">Finally, on the six-monthly report, I would hope that to be due at the end of October, or by November at the latest.</p>            </div>

Will he also talk to his friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=263" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Chancellor" class="glossary">Lord Chancellor</a> about the presence of UK judges in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Final_Appeal">Court of Final Appeal</a>? We all know that Hong Kong&#8217;s economy is underwritten by the rule of law, as, indeed, is ours. The independence of the judiciary and the ability to have judges who can speak freely and fairly and without threat of influence from Beijing is one of the things that underwrites not just Hong Kong&#8217;s economic expansion but China&#8217;s. Therefore, valuing those judges, knowing that they are an integral part of the rule of law&#8212;not just on commercial rights, but on civil rights&#8212;would seem a very good place for the UK to start.</p>            </div>

Friend, the Chair of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a>. He makes a number of very important and powerful points, and I have been reflecting on them and, indeed, on the reports from his Committee. May I just say that I will of course pass on his comments in relation to the judiciary to the Secretary State for Justice? He makes those points in an important way. Of course, they are good for Hong Kong and its reputation and the wider reputation of China as a place that is open to do business.</p> <p pid="c865.1/2">Let me be clear about this issue of BNOs. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> status, which did not entitle the holders of those passports to a right of permanent residence in the UK, was part of the delicate balance and negotiations that were conducted and then concluded at the time of the joint declaration. We are seeking not to change the status of any one part of that package, but rather to press all sides, including the Chinese, to respect the delicate balance reflected in that package. That is why, for the moment, we will not change or alter the status of the BNOs, but we will make sure that, in terms of their rights and entitlements they are entitled to expect within that status, they have our full support.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c866.1/1">I thank the hon. Lady for the measured and careful way in which she has responded to this issue. Amidst all the Brexit divisions we have, it is important that we have some cross-party consensus where it is practicable on this issue, because that allows us to send the clearest signal to our international partners, and indeed to Hong Kong and China, on its importance, so I welcome that.</p> <p pid="c866.1/2">I share the hon. Lady&#8217;s concerns around the issue of peaceful protest. We have expressed those to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>. I spoke to the Foreign <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> about this. I have also spoken to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Lam">Carrie Lam</a>. The hon. Lady is also right to say that we condemn violence and that it risks tainting the protests, which, on the whole, have been conducted in a peaceful way by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a>.</p> <p pid="c866.1/3">The hon. Lady asked about the independent inquiry. The Administration in Hong Kong have not gone the full way we would like them to, but they have taken steps to reform and reinforce the independence of the police complaints council. Whether that is enough, we shall see. What we need to ensure ultimately is that we have the goal of a proper, thorough and objective review of some of the conduct by the police against protesters.</p> <p pid="c866.1/4">I share the hon. Lady&#8217;s concern about reports of troops being increased at the border. We in this House and across the international community must be clear with our Chinese friends and partners about the Rubicon  that would be crossed if we saw a major <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> in Hong Kong. No one wants to see any repeat of the tragic circumstances in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square">Tiananmen Square</a> all those years ago. We want China and Hong Kong to move forward, not backwards.</p> <p pid="c866.1/5">The hon. Lady made the point that the action on the extradition Bill is not enough, and I share her frustration to see more done on political dialogue. In fairness, it is important to note that steps are taking place this week, and indeed today, to engage local groups in political dialogue. As she said, it is the long-standing view of the UK that there is a transition to universal suffrage for the elections of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive">Chief Executive</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Council">Legislative Council</a>, because that is provided for in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Basic_Law">Hong Kong Basic Law</a>, and that would be the best way to guarantee the stability of Hong Kong, but also to respect one country, two systems, which is advocated by China. There has been no change in the status of BNOs.</p> <p pid="c866.1/6">Overall, I share the hon. Lady&#8217;s concerns. There is not a silver-bullet answer to this. We know that the Chinese Government will be very mindful of behaviour and of its reputation, and of what is going on in Hong Kong in the lead-up to the anniversary on <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-01">1 October</phrase>. We need to make sure in this House and across the international community that we are seized of this issue and that we make it clear to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China">Government of China</a> that we want to respect one country, two systems, but that also needs to be reflected on their side.</p>            </div>

Of course, it is important that we recognise the courageous strength of those in Hong Kong who have protested over the past few months. Indeed, this all takes place on the 30th anniversary of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Way">Baltic Way</a>.  What an inspiration it is to see the spirit of the Baltic Way invoked, with people standing up for liberty and freedom as they rightly should.</p> <p pid="c867.2/2">The Foreign Secretary mentioned the legally binding agreement with China. While it is not for me to defend old empires, he is right that it is, to this day, a legally binding agreement. Of course that must be upheld, not least because international treaties are being picked away at by populists around the world. However, context is everything, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a> that he mentions&#8212;as we know from the conflict in Syria, for example&#8212;is utterly broken. This matter cannot be resolved in a broken Security Council. I have been asking the Government for years what proposals they have for reform of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</a>. That will be pivotal in this affair and much else.</p> <p pid="c867.2/3">Finally, this issue in Hong Kong is undoubtedly falling prey to international disinformation and misinformation campaigns, from China to Russia and many others.

I am going to be a bit careful about commenting on what is really happening in relation to intelligence services from any other country, but one thing I would say is  that it is becoming increasingly clear, in relation to some of the counter-protests, that there are criminal gangs involved, and it is not clear entirely what their links may or may not be with the various administrations. I think, for our part, we need to play this in a very straight way, which is to say that there are some legally binding obligations on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Government">Hong Kong Government</a>, and indeed on China, to respect peaceful protest.

I think he is highlighting, in a very specific way, why having political dialogue leading to the democratic autonomy that is reflected in the Basic Law would be valuable and important, not just for the individuals raising those issues, but for Hong Kong as an autonomous entity within the one country, two systems model, in order to address those issues in a way that is constructive and in the long-term interests of the people of Hong Kong.</p>            </div>

Let me try to address just two of them.</p> <p pid="c870.5/2">When I was in Washington earlier this week, I had a chance to talk to congressmen on both sides of the aisle about the United States legislation, and they are making progress in that regard. My hon. Friend also referred to the forthcoming anniversary on <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-01">1 October</phrase> and some of the wider concerns beyond Hong Kong, and he mentioned Xinjiang. We are concerned about, for example, reports&#8212;and they are credible reports&#8212;of more than 1 million people being held in camps against their will. There is, I think, increasing international concern about that, and  about the repressive mistreatment of those people and its impact on China&#8217;s international human rights obligations. Let me again make the point that China is now a leading member of the international community. It is a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P5">P5</a> member of the Security Council, and it is very important for those basic international obligations to be respected.</p>            </div>

Of course, as was mentioned by <a href="/mp/?p=24711" title="Our page on Jenny Chapman - 'the hon. Member for Darlington (Jenny Chapman)'">Jenny Chapman</a>, if it is all reviewed on the side of China, we would obviously want to think again, but I think that for the moment the right thing to do is convey to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> and the Administration in Hong Kong why it is in the interests of all sides to respect the one country, two systems model.</p>            </div>
