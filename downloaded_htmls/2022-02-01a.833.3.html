                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a813.2/1">My Lords, I speak in place of the noble Baroness, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_McIntosh">Lady McIntosh</a> of Pickering, and welcome the opportunity to speak on the amendments she proposed. I wish she could be here to speak on Amendments 37, 38, 42 and 49. I hope to do justice to her concerns and offer a bipartisan dimension to our treatment of the Bill.</p> <p pid="a813.2/2">It is perhaps important for me to say before launching myself into the amendments that my clear preference would always have been to propose the elimination of <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 11 in its entirety. Having said that, however, I respect the intention behind the amendments in seeking to eliminate the distinction between two tiers of refugees. I hope that nobody groans when we cite the 1951 convention, which prohibits the penalisation of refugees</p> <p class="indent" pid="a813.2/3">&#8220;on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees who, coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened &#8230; present themselves without delay &#8230; and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a813.2/4">The Bill before us purports to change the way in which the provisions of the convention are applied, with important divergences from hitherto accepted practices.</p> <p pid="a813.2/5">I am a member of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=207" title="An international organisation of member states (45 at the time of writing)..." class="glossary">Council of Europe</a>. I was asked to compile a report to commemorate the 1951 convention; my report was endorsed by the Council just a few weeks ago. In writing it, I worked in collaboration with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNCHR">UNCHR</a> officers in London, Strasbourg and Geneva. This has led to my conviction of the vital importance, in seeking a way through these critical issues, of maintaining the closest possible working relationship with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR">UNHCR</a>. Everyone I consulted in writing my report agreed that the key underpinning tenets of the convention are non-refoulement, non-discrimination and non-penalisation. Those are the principles that must be upheld at all costs, however much circumstances may have changed.</p> <p pid="a813.2/6">Although I am hugely critical of the Bill, I must, in reality, acknowledge that the United Kingdom is only one of a number of nations in search of new ways of dealing with what is undoubtedly a global crisis. A wide variety of measures has been put forward across our continent. In my report, I cited the following; some were mentioned in our previous debate. There are those who are pushing asylum seekers back, or else denying them disembarkation. Others are protecting their borders, building fences, sometimes deploying their military and even using live ammunition. Some are transferring their protection obligations to other&#8212;usually poorer&#8212;nations and isolated islands, detaining asylum seekers in poor conditions indefinitely. There are those set on criminalising solidarity and life-saving activities: making the saving of lives, the feeding of starving people and providing shelter to families in need a crime. Nor must we forget those who resort to the use of Covid-19, economic challenges or irregular arrivals of migrants as cover for disproportionate measures, restricting access to asylum and rights. The proposals in the Bill, set alongside the proposals of other nations that I just cited, would effectively undermine the very principles and obligations of the 1951 convention.</p> <p pid="a813.2/7">It is my view that our consideration of these important questions should seek always to be in harmony with the advice of UNHCR. That commission provides authoritative guidance in a manner consistent with the 1951 convention&#8217;s ambition to ensure,</p> <p class="indent" pid="a813.2/8">&#8220;the widest possible exercise of these fundamental rights and freedoms&#8221; by refugees. UNHCR, incidentally, has responsibility for all the 80-plus million refugees spread around the world.</p> <p pid="a813.2/10">The amendments we are considering are seeking what is fundamentally guaranteed by the 1951 refugee convention: namely, fair and equal treatment and, especially, non-discrimination. Not to observe these principles would set us at odds with the demands of international law. What is more, it would create a totally unworkable situation if applied more generally: 73% of refugees are hosted in countries neighbouring their country of origin. The noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Coaker">Lord Coaker</a>, mentioned one such example.</p> <p pid="a813.2/11">The proposals as currently put forward in the Bill would disrupt global co-operation, since no system could be built on the expectation that those countries bearing the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of migrants do more and geographically distant countries do less. Furthermore, no system could be built on the expectation that those arriving in our country unconventionally deserve worse treatment than those who arrive via conventional routes.</p> <p pid="a813.2/12">In Committee, it is important to recognise the exploratory nature of our discussion. The proposal in <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> 37 would remove the differentiation between two categories of people arriving on our shores and vest them with greater dignity and humanity.</p> <p pid="a813.2/13">In conclusion, I find a proposal dominated by the often-repeated slogan &#8220;Taking back control of our borders&#8221; is in direct contradiction to the spirit of those British lawyers&#8212;yes, British lawyers&#8212;who not only helped frame the 1951 convention but ensured at a subsequent meeting of plenipotentiaries that,</p> <p class="indent" pid="a813.2/14">&#8220;governments in the countries of first refuge&#8221; would</p> <p class="indent" pid="a813.2/16">&#8220;grant the right of asylum within their territories with the utmost liberality,&#8221; and that other countries would,</p> <p class="indent" pid="a813.2/18">&#8220;undertake jointly with the countries of first reception to bear the costs arising out of&#8221; such efforts. It went on to urge governments to</p> <p class="indent" pid="a813.2/20">&#8220;continue to receive refugees in their territories and that they act in concert in a true spirit of international co-operation in order that these refugees may find asylum and the possibility of resettlement.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a813.2/21">We should note the key phrases in this declaration: &#8220;utmost liberality&#8221;, &#8220;bearing the costs jointly&#8221;, and</p> <p class="indent" pid="a813.2/22">&#8220;in a true spirit of international co-operation&#8221;.</p> <p pid="a813.2/23">That was the spirit in which British negotiators reached their conclusions in 1951. Somehow, we must rediscover this generosity of spirit that moves beyond the merely contractual, beyond what might appear be mere self-interest, and towards a collective effort in our attempt to find solutions to our problems.</p> <p pid="a813.2/24">This seemed to be what the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> agreed to in her summing up speech at <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> on the Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2022-01-05">5 January</phrase>. On that occasion, after a typically spirited defence of government policy, she readily accepted the need for us to work with our international partners to tackle what really are shared global challenges. She concluded:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a813.2/25">&#8220;All countries have a moral responsibility to tackle the issue of illegal migration.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, 5/1/22; col. 668.]</p> <p pid="a813.2/26">It is not difficult to agree with her on that. But it is harder to accept the assurance she gave that, as she put it,</p> <p class="indent" pid="a813.2/27">&#8220;we remain in line with our international obligations&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id=", 5/1/22; col. 666.]"><i>Official Report</i>, 5/1/22; col. 666.]</phrase></p> <p pid="a813.2/28">A refusal to accept the two-tiered proposals, as put forward in these amendments, would be a small but important step in the right direction. I commend these amendments to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a815.0/1">I would like to say a word in support of the spirit of these amendments. Specifically, I would like to speak in support of Amendments 37, 38 and 42, in the name of the noble Baroness, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_McIntosh">Lady McIntosh</a>, introduced brilliantly by the conscience of the House, the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Griffiths">Lord Griffiths</a>. Yet, my heart is not in this game. This is what Americans call &#8220;putting lipstick on a pig&#8221;&#8212;it is still a pig.</p> <p pid="a815.0/2">The only element of this group which I can whole- heartedly support is that <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 11 should not stand part of the Bill. Our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Committee">Constitution Committee</a> gave us a choice: it said that we should either remove or redraft Clause 11. I understand what all these redrafting amendments are trying to do, but it is not a good idea. This is not a case for &#8220;death by a thousand cuts&#8221;; it is a case for a &#8220;short sharp shock&#8221;. We need to take Clause 11 out of the Bill.</p> <p pid="a815.0/3">Why? Because the refugee convention matters; it is an important plank in the international legal order. Clause 11 flies directly in the face of the refugee convention, because it creates two classes of refugees: one with convention rights, and one without convention rights. The charge that it is a breach of the convention is put authoritatively not only by our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Society">Law Society</a> and  the Law Society of Scotland, but by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR">UNHCR</a> in its 72-page memorandum. That is a pretty authoritative source; indeed, it is the authoritative source. When we set up the refugee convention, we asked UNHCR to be its guardian, to supervise its application, and to report to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General">Secretary-General</a> on <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> on refugees in the signatory states. Therefore, it was not interfering, but doing the job which we, when we wrote the convention, asked it to do. I find it a shaming thought that its report on this Bill will have been seen by all 147 signatory states.</p> <p pid="a815.0/4">Why is UNHCR so sure that the Bill undermines the convention? Clause 11 is the heart of the matter. UNHCR believes that creating a two-tier system for handling asylum seekers&#8212;one class legitimate, one illegitimate&#8212;conflicts with the simple definition of a refugee in Article 1 of the convention. A refugee, says the convention, is someone who,</p> <p class="indent" pid="a815.0/5">&#8220;owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country&#8221;.</p> <p pid="a815.0/6">That is all: he is outside his country of origin. The definition says nothing about any requirement to seek asylum in a particular place, and nothing about regular or irregular routes; it contains no suggestion that he is out of order if he does not seek asylum in the first safe country&#8212;there is no such requirement anywhere in international law.</p> <p pid="a815.0/7">A refugee is a refugee is a refugee, and must be treated as such, according to the provisions of the convention, however he got there. That is what the convention says and that is what we have believed down the years. Stretching the meaning of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_31">Article 31</a>, as the Government seek to do, cannot change or qualify what Article 1 says, or add something that it does not contain. I have set out the definition of a refugee. There are no two categories; the definition is very simple.</p> <p pid="a815.0/8">I am no lawyer, and here I am surrounded by eminent, terrifying legal expertise&#8212;even including the noble and learned Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Clarke">Lord Clarke</a> of Nottingham; as his former private secretary, I am horrified to see him there&#8212;but the definition of a refugee, and of our sin in this Bill, from the UNHCR and the law societies, must be right, because I cannot see how 147 countries would have signed up to the convention if they had thought it meant what the Government now say it means. Four in every five refugees are in developing countries adjacent to their country of citizenship. Would host countries have agreed that guests should never move on, and that they should be required to apply for asylum only in their first host country? Would the developing world have agreed that the developed world could wash its hands of the problem of looking after refugees because they were going to have to stay in the first safe country they reached on fleeing over a frontier? I do not think so. It plainly was not what those who signed up to the convention thought it meant, and the attempt to have an expansive reading of Article 31 and so change the meaning of the convention as a whole, in particular Article 1, looks quite a legal stretch. I agree with our Constitution Committee, the law societies and, importantly, the UNHCR.</p> <p pid="a815.0/9">I feel for the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, because the case she is asked to make on the legal position and the convention seems as eccentric and unconvincing as the claim of the noble Lord, Lord Frost, that you can extinguish the role of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJEU">CJEU</a> in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> by using <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_16">Article 16</a> of the Northern Ireland protocol. I will stay away from the law&#8212;this is a rash foray&#8212;but I will stick with the UNHCR, the law societies and the conventional reading of the convention, which is how 146 countries still read it, and say that we really need to get rid of Clause 11.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a817.0/1">My Lords, <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 11 is the most objectionable clause in this whole objectionable Bill. It has to go, and not just because of what the convention says, our having signed and supported it and so on. It is not just because there is a convention but because the convention is right. However, we have to pick at the Bill. We will have the debate that the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kerr">Lord Kerr</a>, has started us off on so well on Report, but this is our opportunity to see whether there is any give in the Government&#8217;s position and whether there is anything we can, quite bluntly, take apart on Report in a way we have not yet thought of.</p> <p pid="a817.0/2">My noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Paddick">Lord Paddick</a>, the noble Lords, Lord Rosser and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Blunkett">Lord Blunkett</a>, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham have indicated their objection to the clause standing part. Had we been able, under the procedures of this House, to add more than four names, I think there would have been a very long list.</p> <p pid="a817.0/3">We have a number of amendments in this group that are picking at this clause. Some of what I had planned to say&#8212;and probably will say because I cannot edit my notes as I go as quickly as I should&#8212;was covered in the previous group when we debated smuggling. The legislation&#8217;s objective, as it has been explained to us, is to disrupt the criminals who smuggle people. No one in their right mind supports that &#8220;trade&#8221;, but it is based on a premise about what prompts people to seek asylum with which we completely disagree.</p> <p pid="a817.0/4">I said at <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> that the Government have not attempted to walk in the shoes of refugees. I do not resile from that at all. Most asylum seekers would want to travel by a safe and legal route&#8212;they must be desperate to&#8212;but other than in a few narrow circumstances these are not available. The policy rests on deterrence, which is misconceived, because, as has been said, you do not stop to think about whether you will be in group 1 or group 2 when you get here. You do not even think about the chances of being criminalised. I am advised that Clause 11, if enforced, could mean that of those fleeing conflict and/or persecution in Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria and Afghanistan&#8212;the top five countries from which people arrive here, the last stage of the journey by a small boat&#8212;an estimated 9,000 to 21,000 people currently accepted as refugees would be denied protection under the convention. It will be the most vulnerable and women and children who will be affected. The noble Baroness, Lady Lister, was the first to refer to that.</p> <p pid="a817.0/5">I do not think there are any amendments in this group with which we disagree; we just want to get rid of the clause. However, on <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> 39, Clause 11(2) requires that one presents oneself</p> <p class="indent" pid="a817.0/6">&#8220;without delay to the authorities.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a817.0/7">It is not the only instance in the Bill where there is a failure to recognise the difficulties for many asylum seekers who simply cannot tell their story instantly and coherently. The Bill is simply not trauma-informed. I suspect this might in fact be the least troublesome example, because most asylum seekers want to get into the system and to have their application approved as soon as possible, but the difficulties still need to be recognised.</p> <p pid="a817.0/8">Amendments 43 and 50 are to the subsections that give examples of the different treatment proposed for the two groups. The differentiation of treatment, if it should happen, should be completely clear and in primary legislation. We should not just have examples. It should not be variable or vulnerable to being changed or made worse through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Rules">Immigration Rules</a>, which are a matter of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>&#8217;s fiat without touching either <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Parliament">House of Parliament</a>. I am very pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Blunkett, added his name to most of our amendments. I understand why he has had to leave, but it is significant that he did so.</p> <p pid="a817.0/9">Amendments 44 and 45, and similarly Amendments 52 and 53, would challenge the differentiation regarding leave to enter and remain, because how long you are able to remain has considerable consequences for the &#8220;undeserving&#8221; asylum seeker. That is on top of all the insecurity inherent in the reduction of the length of leave and increasingly frequent reassessment processes. We cannot expect people&#8217;s well-being and mental health, or their ability to integrate into the community where they have found themselves, not to suffer in the absence of certainty; nor can we expect landlords or employers to be keen to take on quite short-term tenants and employees.</p> <p pid="a817.0/10">Currently, a refugee can apply for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILR">ILR</a>&#8212;that is, indefinite leave to remain, or, in other words, settlement after five years. What are the criteria for group 2 refugees? What will they have to meet to achieve ILR? Will they have to wait 10 years, like people who have been here on a work visa, and make substantial payments periodically through that period? Quite apart from the impact on the individuals, is this not extra bureaucracy and workload for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a>? What is the estimate of the cost to the Home Office? Will that be reflected in the full economic impact assessment that I believe we are promised?</p> <p pid="a817.0/11">Amendments 47, 48, 51 and 53 are there because, however you travel, family is of the utmost importance. I do not think I need to spell it out; I will just say &#8220;common humanity&#8221; and &#8220;integration&#8221;. Family reunion is recognised as important by the Home Office, even if it is not as extensive as we argue it should be. Perhaps the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> can explain which family member refugees will be able to reunite with, whether that will be an automatic right and whether there will be a fee attached to this route.</p> <p pid="a817.0/12">Amendment 55 is different but the theme is familiar. It would require the Immigration Rules into which these appalling provisions will be incorporated at any rate to be approved by a resolution in each House of  Parliament before coming into force. As I have said, I think all these things should be in the Bill, but we have a provision in here for the rules and that point needs to be taken up. I am pleased to see that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegated_Powers_and_Regulatory_Reform_Committee">Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee</a> takes the same view of the need for an affirmative resolution and even more pleased to note its report, which says:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a817.0/13">&#8220;Given the clause&#8217;s significance and the controversy surrounding it, we consider that, where it is proposed to amend the immigration rules to make different provision for different groups of refugees, the amendment should be subject to the draft affirmative procedure so that it cannot come into force until approved by both Houses.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a817.0/14">However, the short point, which others will make too, is that Clause 11 needs to go.</p>            </div>

We are, after all, the upper House of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Parliament">British Parliament</a>. Their views should be heard.</p> <p pid="a819.0/2">I have some figures here from the latest <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov">YouGov</a> poll on the subject of immigration. The interesting thing is that immigration is now regarded as the third most important subject after health and the economy&#8212;even more important than Covid, curiously; I am not sure about that but, none the less, that is what it says. A previous YouGov poll said that 70% of people thought illegal crossings were a serious issue, so the public are well aware of the issue; indeed, they have been seeing it every night on television, particularly during last summer. Some 63% said that illegal immigrants should not be allowed to settle here while 60% said that they should be removed. In a June 2021 YouGov poll, 60% said they thought that illegal immigrants should be banned from claiming asylum, while only 20% thought they should be allowed to claim asylum. Some 64% thought it was fair to remove people who come from safe countries, while only 15% thought it unfair. Those are opinion polls so take them for what they are worth&#8212;we all have our views about opinion polls&#8212;but they are a snapshot of opinion in the recent past.</p> <p pid="a819.0/3">My own view is that, on an emotional subject such as immigration, you need to develop a policy with which the British people are comfortable. If you do not have a policy with which the British people are comfortable, it will not be sustainable in the long run. I point that out to the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kerr">Lord Kerr</a>, who understandably made a point about our international obligations. If we had had a policy on immigration more widely that the British people had been comfortable with in the last 20 years, we might not have had Brexit. Sadly, whether we like it or not, immigration was a huge issue in the Brexit debate. I put it to the noble Lord that the extent to which people&#8217;s views on immigration were ignored was a factor leading to the decision that we took. I am a remainer, so I regret that.</p>            </div>

There is a case for putting forward what the British people think about this, whether you think it is right or wrong. I do not think it is wholly right but, none the less, we have to take it into account. We have eventually to reach a position where the British people are comfortable with the Government&#8217;s policies; in my view, that is what the Government are trying to do.</p>            </div>

People who have supported a pro-immigration policy&#8212;or a relaxed immigration policy, whatever you like to call it&#8212;have been pretty vociferous over the years; they have not been quiet. We have known what they think. There has been lots of leadership. Leadership is an issue at the moment but I had better not go too far into that. None the less, the people who support an expansive and comprehensive immigration policy have been vociferous; it is the people who are against it who have had their views ignored.</p> <p pid="a820.4/2">I read a book about Dagenham the other day, written by a Labour activist, which pointed out the comprehensive effect of immigration in Dagenham over a 10-year period. It went from being 85% white British to less than 50% white British and the local joke was whether if you went into a shop anyone there would speak English. People appealed to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party">Labour Party</a>, because it was the Labour Party that introduced these policies, and were ignored. Dagenham, a long-standing Labour seat, nearly voted <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> in the last <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a>&#8212;and would have done, if not for the Brexit vote&#8212;because people had been ignored on the issue of immigration.

In my view, it has had a deleterious effect, unfortunately; I would rather we had stayed in the European Union, but that is the fact we have to face.</p> <p pid="a821.1/3">It is generally admitted that we are now dealing with a very difficult, specific problem, one aspect of the whole immigration problem, namely illegal crossings of the channel. It is a small part of the problem that creates a bigger problem. Many people have raised wholesale migration, which I understand is a huge issue which is tackled in many different ways&#8212;through international development policies, as well as immigration policies, and so forth. However, there is a specific problem here which any Government of any colour would have to tackle, namely people smuggling people&#8212;not brandy, tobacco or commodities, but people&#8212;into this country illegally, day after day, against the law. That is something that no self-respecting Government can ignore; they simply cannot.</p>            </div>

But I think he should take account of the extent to which political leaderships affect public opinion. The history of the last decade is a history of one of our great parties swinging right on issues of immigration. It is a history of a referendum campaign, where one side argued that 80 million Turks were going to come and there was nothing we could do to stop them. It is a history of a period in which we have constantly been told that we are beleaguered and the target of innumerable people who wish to come here. As the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Paddick">Lord Paddick</a>, explained earlier in the debate, we are well down the league table in per capita terms for hosting immigrants of any hue. It is not good enough just to say, &#8220;There go my people. I am their leader; I must follow them.&#8221; We are capable of influencing public opinion and that is what we should be trying to do.

My point is a simple one: we have to pay regard to British opinion. It is not as though people  are manipulated; they have their own views. They are perfectly capable of taking a sceptical view of some of the people who have tried to make them do things in the past, frankly. They can form their own views&#8212;I am sure the noble Lord would agree. I was trying to narrow it down to this particular point on the problem of illegal immigration which, in my view, any Government would have to deal with, whatever their nature or colour.</p> <p pid="a821.7/2">As the noble Lord who initiated this debate said, many countries are tackling this problem in quite horrific, awful ways. In comparison with what they are doing, what we are doing is completely rational and sensible. It is trying to make a distinction. There are those who are coming in legally and properly, by the routes which are well known. We have a very good record on that, despite what the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Paddick">Lord Paddick</a>, said, in comparison with the rest of Europe. We have not only a reasonable number of people coming in by the normal asylum-seeking routes each year but also the consequences of the Commonwealth, for example our links with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, with up to 90,000 people having already accepted the chance to come here from Hong Kong. That is something which Germany, France and so forth do not have the same problem with.</p>            </div>

As I understand it, they do not believe that they are departing from the international convention of 1951. Of course, many other countries have taken similar positions. Australia, for example, has divided people into those coming in in the normal, legal way and those coming in illegally, and that has not been denounced by the United Nations. Japan has done the same thing and, interestingly, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democrats">Social Democrats</a> in Denmark are about to too. In Australia, they have a cross-party agreement on the immigration policy. I think the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party">Labour Party</a> ought to be more careful in its view of this because it may well become the Government in future and it will face the same problems which the present Government face. These are not only problems which the Government must face simply to be responsible and give people a sense that they control things and that borders mean something, which is their bottom-line responsibility, but also the issues of immigration.</p> <p pid="a822.1/2">With what we have here, if we can reduce it to the particular problem which the Government face on illegal immigration across the channel, the approach they are adopting helps, first, to deal with the pull factor, by pointing out the advantages of the normal asylum-seeking methods of getting into this country, on which this country has a good record; and, secondly, to dissuade people from adopting the illegal methods which they are at present forced into using.</p> <p pid="a822.1/3">The noble Lords, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Paddick">Lord Paddick</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kerr">Lord Kerr</a>, made the point that they are economists, and I am an economist too. The problem is that, if you expand safe routes, you can never expand them wide enough to take account of all the people who want to come here. That is a simple fact of demand and supply, if I may say so, well known in economics. That is the problem which the Government face. As the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, mentioned in a previous debate, you have to have some limit on the number of people coming to this country for good population control reasons. If you decide on a limit and people are comfortable with that, you can decide how many immigrants will be allowed into the country in any one year and then deal with the problem of illegal immigration. In my view, that is the right order in which this should be dealt with, and I believe the Government are following exactly that policy.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a823.3/1">I am not accustomed to the practices of <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>; I am quite happy to see the debate alternate between different sides. I arrived at this debate&#8212;I regret that I have not got to the earlier debates on this difficult Bill&#8212;intending to listen but not to speak. I was hoping it would help to resolve the dilemma I face, which turns out to be exactly the same dilemma that has just been addressed by my old and noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Horam">Lord Horam</a>.</p> <p pid="a823.3/2">I dare to venture that no one sitting in this Chamber has more liberal instincts than me on the subjects of race, xenophobia, multiculturalism and so on. In fact, one of the satisfactions of finding yourself elevated to the peerage is that you can come into this Chamber, where I suspect 99% of Members have perfectly sound liberal instincts. I have seen society in this country change considerably in my lifetime in the post-war world, and I have said publicly more than once that I think the multi-ethnic and multicultural society in which I now live is a much healthier, stronger and more enriched society than the rather narrow and insular all-white society in which I was born and raised.</p> <p pid="a823.3/3">The 1951 convention was one of the great contributions that British lawyers and politicians made to the post-war world, and it was obviously highly desirable after the horrendous shock of finding that a European country had organised&#8212;or tried to organise&#8212;the industrial genocide of a whole race. That is the context in which it was drafted. So my instincts are of course, first, that we should comply with the convention and, secondly, that this is a suitable place to accommodate the many people who need refuge. We have done so very successfully as a country. Although race relations are a problem in some places in this country, I think that our society has handled this better than any other European country. We do not really have the serious problems that quite easily break out in other countries.</p> <p pid="a823.3/4">But the circumstances have changed worryingly and dramatically. As has been pointed out, because of the horrendously dangerous state of the world, about 80 million people are now displaced, are looking for a better life and would take desperate measures to get it. If my noble friend Lord Horam and I were a couple of 18 year-olds living in Nigeria, I suspect that, if we had more than averagely prosperous families, we would hope that they would raise the money for us to take the horrendously difficult journey of leaving Nigeria to make a new and better life for ourselves. We would then hope for a family reunion and that our family could come and join us once we had made our way in Britain.</p> <p pid="a823.3/5">Among that 80 million&#8212;an extraordinary number&#8212;the favourite destinations are probably the United States, this country perhaps second and then France and Germany. They will want to go to these countries because, in the modern world of communications, they can see and know perfectly well that they are where the quality of life is likely to be best for them, if they can get there. The tenor of the debates that I have listened to so far is that we should make sure that there are legal and safe ways in which, in one place or another, we can consider all of these applications and make ourselves at least as attractive as any other country, particularly at a time when many other, previously normally ultra-liberal countries are setting up very considerable barriers to going there.</p> <p pid="a823.3/6">But we have to reflect on the impact that that might have on our society and culture, because things have been deteriorating recently. The growing public reaction to immigration&#8212;albeit expressed in perfectly civilised ways by most people at the moment, fortunately&#8212;is one of the reasons why our politics is deteriorating so badly. Every democracy in the western world is seeing the rise of right-wing populist nationalism, which I deplore wherever it occurs, including within the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party">Conservative Party</a>. It is rising&#8212;that is the reaction&#8212;and it is leading to developments of a kind that have gone further in other countries. In France, the position of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen">Marine Le Pen</a>, who now even has a right-wing competitor for the vote, shows what can happen when you get the wrong public reaction.</p> <p pid="a823.3/7">Among the public, the overwhelming reaction to the publicised symbol of these worries at the moment&#8212;the dinghies coming across the channel and being picked up&#8212;is that the Government are failing to stop them. The Government do not have the first idea how to do so, and, actually, neither do I. Plainly, you have to rescue these people and bring them here when they are in our territory&#8212;and then they are an asylum and refugee problem.</p> <p pid="a823.3/8">Our success in deporting the ones who are blatantly abusing their claim of asylum is very poor because it is extremely difficult to dismiss the asylum claim when there is so little first-hand evidence. The legal and practical problems of returning them have also proved extraordinarily difficult. If you believe that they have the nationality that they say they have, you then have to hope that the Government of that country will allow you to deport them back. So I even feel that we are at the beginning of this problem: I do not think that the world at the moment is in a state where the  number of displaced people in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East">Middle East</a> and Africa will go down&#8212;indeed, the pressures could grow. So we are in a genuine dilemma. I came to listen to this debate hoping that my mind would be clarified and that I would be converted to the self-confident assertions of people with whom I usually agree on this subject&#8212;but I have not been yet. I still have doubts that the Bill will really make the improvements that are claimed.</p> <p pid="a823.3/9">I close by mentioning this business of making the crossings illegal and giving people a criminal record when they arrive. Will that really give rise to desirable developments? Our incarceration rate is ludicrously high in this country at the moment. We have an excessive number of criminals already in overcrowded prisons like Victorian slums, which are not the right place to punish or deal with them. What will happen to the tens of thousands of refugees if you are going to send them to prisons and detention centres? How will that improve matters, and what will you do when you have refused even to entertain their asylum claim?</p> <p pid="a823.3/10">So the debate so far has not clarified my mind, but I think that the simplistic solutions that have been offered by some of the speakers moving these amendments need to be challenged. I congratulate my noble friend Lord Horam on raising the big dilemma that faces us all. We do not want the equivalent of Alternative f&#252;r Deutschland and the extreme-right parties of other countries being strengthened and provoked if we do not get this right.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a825.0/1">My Lords, I speak solely as a lawyer. I did not speak at <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>; I would have needed to apologise for and explain that a few years ago. Consistently, we have been permitted to engage at a later stage, and that is no longer so.</p> <p pid="a825.0/2">I confess that I have been working hard to try to catch up with the legal appreciation of the effect of this Bill. I wish to respond to the noble Lords, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kerr">Lord Kerr</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Horam">Lord Horam</a>, as a lawyer and in terms of the consistency of the Bill with our international obligations under the refugee convention. Under Article 35, we and our courts are required to have regard to what <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR">UNHCR</a> says on the proper interpretation of the Bill in applying it in this country.</p> <p pid="a825.0/3">Although my views on the Bill overall are still not fully formed, as a lawyer I have come to the clear conclusion that <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 29 and the clauses that follow <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_31">Article 31</a> most directly for present purposes are simply impossible to reconcile with the clear jurisprudence of our courts of the most authoritative nature. For that, reason, I take essentially the same root-and-branch objection to Clause 11 and say to the noble Lord, Lord Horam, that I wonder whether this large proportion of people who, understandably, object to the problems this country has with asylum&#8212;and who would wish to exclude, so far as possible, those who are trying to gain refugee status here&#8212;would add, &#8220;And we don&#8217;t care a fig if what we are doing to give effect to that policy flatly contradicts our international law obligations under the refugee convention&#8221;.</p> <p pid="a825.0/4">Intrinsically, the group of clauses to which I refer, including Clauses 31 and 36, bear very closely on Clause 11, which is of course the subject of this group  of amendments. The centre of the Bill&#8217;s approach, and that of Clause 11, is to try to create a particularly disadvantaged subcategory of asylum seekers, essentially on the footing that they fall outside the protection of Article 31 of the convention. The fact is that Article 31 is addressed both in Clause 31 and, as it happens, in closely similar terms, in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_31">Section 31</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Asylum_Act_1999">Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</a>. So there it is: we are talking about Article 31 of the convention, Clause 31 of the Bill and Section 31 of the preceding legislation, the 1999 Act.</p> <p pid="a825.0/5">Clause 36, more particularly, seeks to override well-established case law most directly. All this is explained in the series of authoritative legal opinions that have been addressed, certainly to me and probably to other lawyers in the House, by the Bingham Centre, the UNHCR and Amnesty&#8212;and by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee_on_Human_Rights">Joint Committee on Human Rights</a>, which is a very authoritative body of both Houses.</p> <p pid="a825.0/6">The Bill now seeks to overcome the effect of a divisional court case known as Adimi. I confess that, way back in the last century, I gave the leading judgment in that case but, much more importantly, it was approved explicitly on the critical questions&#8212;of coming here without delay and so forth&#8212;by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_Committee">Appellate Committee</a> of your Lordships&#8217; House, presided over by the late and much-lamented <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Bingham_of_Cornhill">Lord Bingham of Cornhill</a>, in a case called Asfaw. The reference is 2008 1 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC">AC</a> 1061. It is a compelling leading judgment and indicates that the position, authoritatively decided in accordance with UNHCR advice and all the earlier indicia, is not compatible with what Clause 11, by reference to Clauses 31 and 36, seeks to do: to create this category B, to be regarded as illegal entrants to this country. It is on that basis, and not the narrower although well understandable objections to Clause 11 from other quarters, that I shall particularly resist the inclusion of Clause 11 in the Bill.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a826.0/1">My Lords, in rising to support the proposal that <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 11 do not stand part, to which I have added my name, I declare my interest in relation to both <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAMP">RAMP</a> and Reset, as set out in the register. Along with colleagues on these Benches, I looked carefully at the possibility of making amendments to Clause 11 along the lines of those proposed, and reached the conclusion that the only thing we could fully support was the removal of the clause.</p> <p pid="a826.0/2">The proposal to separate refugees into two groups depending on how they arrived in the country, and whether it was their first country of arrival, are inimical to the whole basis on which the refugee convention is built. It is a betrayal of the letter and spirit of it. The idea that asylum must be claimed in the first country of arrival has no basis in international law; this is the view of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR">UNHCR</a> and of the legal community. If imposed, it would place an unsustainable burden on a small number of nations, most of which are already under immense strain. The whole purpose of an internationally agreed convention is to recognise that the responsibility for the care and support of refugees needs to be carried by the whole global community. We recognise this as a nation by setting up and running resettlement schemes, working with the international community. So to try and declare this for those who claim asylum on arrival here, even if they have passed  through other nations, does not logically fit with our recognition of the need for global collaboration and a global sharing of the demands.</p> <p pid="a826.0/3">I say to the noble and learned Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Clarke">Lord Clarke</a>, that the danger is that we go into a wider refugee debate rather than debating the clause. The vast bulk of the 80 million refugees have no desire to go anywhere other than back into their own country. That is where most of them wish to go; I have seen that and talked to them first-hand.</p> <p pid="a826.0/4">However, let us for a few minutes work with the idea of claiming asylum only in the first nation of arrival, and see how this would work with the proposals in Clause 11 for our nation. We are an island nation; therefore, no one could ever make a first arrival here by land&#8212;no one in group 1. We are an island nation, so arrival by sea is a clear option, but none of us wants to see arrivals by sea in unsafe boats. So the safe ways must be via ferries, or cargo or passenger ships coming from longer distances away. The likelihood that such journeys could be undertaken in a way that is deemed legal under the Bill is very slim.</p> <p pid="a826.0/5">Those fleeing persecution, <a href="/glossary/?gl=140" title="violence occurring within the family" class="glossary">domestic violence</a>, war and the impact of climate change may well have to do so without all the relevant paperwork, and certainly with no valid visa. They might just secure a paid-for passage without all this but it is highly unlikely. It is more likely that they will find themselves having to stow away in a van, lorry or container, or somewhere on the boat, so they will arrive having travelled illegally&#8212;hence they go into group 2. The number who would travel in complete fulfilment of the Bill in a legal manner would be minimal&#8212;almost no one in group 1.</p> <p pid="a826.0/6">We are an island nation, so arrival by air is the other clear option. Stowing away on an aeroplane is decidedly harder than on a ship but might just be possible. However, I think we all understand it is illegal, so such arrivals would go straight into group 2. Perhaps someone somehow manages to purchase a ticket and travel with their own passport but with no visa. As it happens, I was nearly refused entry to a plane when returning home from Portugal last autumn because of an issue over my Covid vaccine passport, so how one would succeed without a valid visa is an interesting question. It might just happen; however, on arrival, there is no visa so they could easily be deemed an illegal arrival, therefore in group 2.</p> <p pid="a826.0/7">Perhaps they have a visa as a student, so entry happens legally. But this student is not simply studying; they are fleeing because they are gay and know that they will be persecuted in their home nation if they come out. That will be made worse for them because they also come from a minority tribe who already feel put down, so on arrival they claim asylum on the basis of their sexuality and the likelihood of persecution. However, this was not the purpose of their visa. This is not theory: it is the story of Azmat, who I, along with several other Peers, met online last week. Such people do not qualify for group 1 but go into group 2.</p> <p pid="a826.0/8"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> resettlement scheme and the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme are not open to all the nationalities most commonly accepted as refugees by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a>. Vulnerable people requiring protection will therefore become group 2 refugees. People cannot jump a queue where there is simply no queue to join.</p> <p pid="a826.0/9">I believe that this clause will effectively make the vast <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of asylum seekers group 2 refugees. I additionally believe that every attempt will be made to reduce what is regarded as &#8220;good cause&#8221; for arriving illegally. Can the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> set out the evidence that shows how reducing the rights and entitlements of refugees will have the effect of actually deterring dangerous journeys? Is there any evidence? Secondly, what estimate has the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> made of the cost of needing to reassess a refugee&#8217;s protection needs every two and a half years, and what impact will that have on existing delays in making asylum decisions?</p> <p pid="a826.0/10">At <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>, the Minister challenged those of us opposed to many aspects of the Bill to say what should happen. On this matter, I believe it is straightforward: accept that, for a wide variety of perfectly reasonable grounds, some people seeking asylum want to do so in this country&#8212;although most actually choose to go to other countries. Huge numbers do not prefer us; they prefer to seek asylum elsewhere. But, for those who do, we must treat them all equally; ensure that there are adequate, well-trained staff to process applications in a timely and accurate way; have a wide volunteer force to support people seeking asylum while they go through that process; and supply good legal aid for people seeking asylum at the beginning of their asylum application. Yes, it will cost more initially, but if the right to work is also granted&#8212;we will come back to that later&#8212;and the process is handled with due speed, it will not cost more than the lengthy periods currently endured by far too many people seeking asylum, together with the costs to the Government of their reliance on the appeals process to ensure that a correct decision is made.</p> <p pid="a826.0/11">Additionally, far more time and energy should be put into the creation of really effective, safe and regular routes. The UK resettlement scheme should be expanded to ensure that it is open to more people who would otherwise use irregular routes. We should make it possible for people to apply for humanitarian visas in order to claim asylum and ensure that all refugees have access to family reunion, with a broader definition of family members who qualify. These all give people ways of cutting out the criminal gang in their journey to safety; we all want to cut out the criminal gangs.</p> <p pid="a826.0/12">The whole purpose of an internationally agreed system is to ensure that all asylum seekers find themselves treated on the basis of an equal opportunity for their case to be presented and heard. Distinguishing in the way proposed is immensely dangerous for such equal treatment and for the maintenance of an internationally agreed system. As framed, these proposals present a nation that wants to be not a global, generous Britain but a little, mean-minded Britain, determined to play less and less of a role in the world. This will not do, and I do not believe that the British public want us to play less and less of a role in the world.</p> <p pid="a826.0/13">I say to the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Horam">Lord Horam</a>, that one of the things that happens when people meet those seeking asylum and refugees, and hear their stories, is that they change their mind and heart. I have seen it time and again in Gateshead, Hartlepool, Darlington, Stockton and Sunderland: people welcome the refugees and  discover that they want these people to be their neighbours and to be part of this nation. This clause needs simply to be removed.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a829.0/1">My Lords, I feel profoundly uncomfortable with <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 11, and I am very tempted to vote for it to be completely removed. But I wanted to listen to the debate, and I am afraid that the people who have argued for the removal of Clause 11 have given me pause for thought, which was not what I expected to happen when I arrived. The reason is the way that this discussion has taken a particular form politically.</p> <p pid="a829.0/2">I am somebody who voted to leave the EU from the left&#8212;in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Benn">Tony Benn</a> tradition&#8212;and I have historically been liberal on immigration. I have fought on many anti-deportation campaigns, and I am not somebody who thinks that one should close the borders. I am, more than anything else, a democrat; even in this House, I try to stay a democrat. I appreciated, with some irony, the comments of the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Horam">Lord Horam</a>, and the noble and learned Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Clarke">Lord Clarke</a>&#8212;Conservative remainers with whom, to be honest, I have not historically had a great deal in common but who raised some important issues that should inform this debate.</p> <p pid="a829.0/3">My concerns about Clause 11 were very well expressed by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham, who explained in great detail where I was finding difficulties with this. But I have a problem with the solution and the way in which this debate has been conducted. I think it is important to consider the British public&#8217;s opinion. It was interesting that a lot of people have asked us to walk in the footsteps of asylum seekers; I think empathy is hugely important and humane. But I also ask noble Lords to walk in the footsteps of the British public, who, if you ask them their opinion, do not all want hanging. Leadership is, broadly speaking, not the same as usurping their perfectly reasonable concerns.</p> <p pid="a829.0/4">What are their concerns? They are not that they do not meet any asylum seekers and, when they meet them, they change their minds; not that they lack generosity; not that they are xenophobic, mean spirited or narrow minded; and not that they want to close the borders and hate foreigners, as is often implied. Their concerns are that they would like control over the borders, which I think is a perfectly reasonable demand. A visceral illustration of a lack of control over the borders has been given to us by those arriving in boats, and we are all trying to untangle what to do about it as humanely as possible. That includes the British public, millions and millions of whom are incredibly generous of spirit towards all sorts of people and do not need lectures from here about how they have to open their hearts to people. They are full of heart-brimming generosity in all sorts of ways. Why do we have an issue here?</p> <p pid="a829.0/5">This is the bit that I cannot untangle. There are people who are seeking asylum legitimately, and one wants to welcome them. There are people trying to come to the country who are undoubtedly illegal immigrants, as anyone would understand them, but because there are very few ways to arrive as an economic  immigrant, they may choose to describe themselves as asylum seekers. On a different set of amendments I will say that we should have more liberal immigration rules that would allow unskilled people to come as economic immigrants to this country.</p> <p pid="a829.0/6">We can see, and it is perfectly reasonable, that you cannot just say to people that everybody who arrives on a boat is obviously an asylum seeker, and that everybody who worries about them arriving must be a mean-spirited, horrible person who hates foreigners. That is my concern. I am trying to untangle that, because I genuinely do not know what to do. As I said, I would be liberal about economic migrants coming to the country, as much as I would about asylum seekers coming to the country, but I feel as though everyone is being forced to declare that they are asylum seekers because it is the only route in where you will not get kicked out. So I think that we are in a mess.</p> <p pid="a829.0/7">The Government need to answer this. What happened in relation to Brexit&#8212;for noble Lords who are interested in this&#8212;was not that people did not want any foreigners to come into the country but that they were told that freedom of movement was a non-negotiable international agreement that nobody could ever debate. So as democrats, people said, &#8220;Well, I live here; I&#8217;m a British citizen&#8221;&#8212;many of them from ethnic minorities, before anyone goes down the racist road&#8212;and they said, &#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t we be able to control who are British citizens who come here?&#8221; That is what happened. Other people said, &#8220;No, we can&#8217;t because we&#8217;re in the EU; we&#8217;ve got no choice&#8221;. So they got annoyed. My concern here is that if we say to the British public, &#8220;You either agree with us or you&#8217;re a xenophobe&#8221;, or, &#8220;You have to agree with us because we&#8217;ve got a refugee convention&#8221;&#8212;another international agreement from 1951, however good it is&#8212;&#8220;and it&#8217;s the only thing going; there&#8217;s no alternative&#8221;, that will also indicate that they have no democratic power.</p> <p pid="a829.0/8">I cannot understand why the Government keep trying to fit in what they are doing to the 1951 refugee convention, which, although one noble Lord described it as having been written in utmost liberality by British lawyers, was written by British lawyers&#8212;not by the British public. I want the <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> to be written by the British public and for the British public, not just by lawyers&#8212;and in 2022, not necessarily referring back to 1951 all the time. I have no objection to that convention, but if it is not fit for purpose in 2022 to take control of our borders, the debate about immigration and asylum seekers will become toxic, if we just keep telling people that they cannot have this discussion. I believe I can convince my fellow citizens to be more liberal on immigration, but not when they are told that they cannot have the debate or that if they want to have the debate or to express worries about people arriving in boats, they must by their very nature be lacking in generosity and xenophobic. That is not the way to go. I am still likely to vote against Clause 11, by the way.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a830.0/1">My Lords, I think we have been having this debate all my adult life and probably all my life, but I am certainly happy to keep having it; there is nothing wrong with that. However, I do think that it is very important in the context of  <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 11 to make a distinction in Committee between immigration and asylum. If I may say so, I do not think that Brexit is terribly helpful to an analysis of Clause 11. It used to be said that for the French, a meal without wine is like a day without sunshine. Clearly, for some people the equivalent is a discussion without Brexit, but I am not one of them.</p> <p pid="a830.0/2">It is important to make this distinction between immigration and asylum, which are both big and important debates, but they are too often conflated&#8212;not just in our discussions in this Committee but to some extent in Clause 11 itself. The noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Horam">Lord Horam</a>, did not have the opportunity to reply to my question&#8212;all sorts of people intervened in his speech, to be fair&#8212;but if somebody is a convention refugee, they are not and never were an illegal migrant. That is incredibly important.</p> <p pid="a830.0/3">I congratulate the right reverend Prelate, who I think gave the speech of this Committee, and not just because I agree with him. I do agree with him, and also the noble and learned Lord, Brown of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaton-under-Heywood">Eaton-under-Heywood</a>, and, of course, the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kerr">Lord Kerr</a>. What was so important about the right reverend Prelate&#8217;s speech was its specificity to the refugees&#8217; journey and the way that that would be affected by this differentiation. I congratulate him on that, because it is a very good way to analyse Clause 11: whether it works and whether it complies with the refugee convention.</p> <p pid="a830.0/4">Why is compliance with the refugee convention so important? It is not like choosing to vote in or out of something that began as a trading bloc but was always a particular grouping of countries rather than the whole civilised world. The reason why the refugee convention is so important is because, after two world wars, it was literally the world&#8217;s apology for the Holocaust. That is the best way that I can sum up why the refugee convention is so important. While Britain did wonderful things, not least standing up to Hitler with lots of Americans and Russians and people from the Commonwealth too, and there are very good things to be said about Britain&#8217;s contribution, there were also less noble things that have to be remembered&#8212;about the people who did not manage to get out, who did not escape the Holocaust, including people who were not allowed into this country and other countries around the world.</p> <p pid="a830.0/5">It was through learning from that experience that we, led by Winston Churchill, decided to have a refugee convention so that in future people would be able to escape, including by clandestine means, with false documents, on little boats or whatever. That has not yet been said. I know it is a sensitive thing to say but, much as I would love to, I am afraid you cannot discuss the intentions of the drafters of the refugee convention without remembering how it came to be. The right reverend Prelate&#8217;s speech was perfect in looking at somebody in that situation today, but it is not a bad idea to look at people who did not make it then either. By the way, we in this country refused refuge to none other than <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>&#8212;something I occasionally remind myself of.</p> <p pid="a830.0/6">Subsequent to the war, the word &#8220;refugee&#8221; became quite a noble concept, particularly during the Cold War, when refugees made us feel really good about ourselves.  They were defecting spies; sometimes they were great athletes and ballet dancers, and so on. The numbers seemed relatively small, but they made us feel good about ourselves, because they were defecting&#8212;escaping totalitarianism&#8212;and this was the place to be instead. We thought that was great. But then the numbers increased because of airline travel, and we were no longer just talking about people escaping across a land border. Particularly post-colonisation, it was open to people to get on planes and come to a country that was not across a land border but with which they had some association&#8212;maybe the language, family, the common law&#8212;and suddenly, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Department">Home Department</a> got a little more concerned about the numbers of refugees.</p> <p pid="a830.0/7">By the way, this is not a partisan issue: if one looks at the history of the refugee convention and its application, Governments of both persuasions have been good and bad in their treatment of both migrants and refugees. Once the first aircraft of, I think, Tamil refugees landed at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport">Heathrow Airport</a> and people claimed asylum, suddenly the Home Department decided to move into territory such as &#8220;carrier&#8217;s liability&#8221;, and not just visas but &#8220;transit visas&#8221; and, in subsequent years, applying the transit visa regime even to countries that we knew to be either war-torn or producing genuine refugees. This happened some years ago and is something that people in both parties do not like to talk about, because it is a slightly dirty little secret that we have been closing this door on genuine refugees for some years. It did not just happen with this Bill, but the Bill is taking it to a pretty horrific conclusion.</p> <p pid="a830.0/8">We have the current proposals in Clause 11 for the two-track differentiation and, thanks to the announcement in <a href="/glossary/?gl=49" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/" class="glossary">the Times</a> mentioned by my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Coaker">Lord Coaker</a>, we have further proposals to differentiate against all men in boats. On Clause 11, to talk about &#8220;differential treatment&#8221; is horrendous in itself when you think about persecution. At the heart of all persecution is discrimination and differentiation; it is about people in a particular country who are being picked on and persecuted on some ground of difference. To then repeat that discrimination and bake it into a system supposedly of refugee protection is not just in violation of the convention&#8212;it is particularly obscene.</p> <p pid="a830.0/9">The way that Clause 11 mashes and contorts Articles 1 and 31 is really quite perverse. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_31">Article 31</a> was designed to give extra protection to the most desperate refugees and to ensure that they were not penalised for coming via clandestine means. The travaux demonstrate this. The drafters of the convention understood that some of the most genuine refugees of all&#8212;the most desperate, the most persecuted&#8212;are, by definition, those who have to come by clandestine means. Article 31 was designed to ensure that we did not refuse or penalise them automatically because of that. In Clause 11, we have almost flipped Articles 1 and 31 over, as the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, said, so that coming by clandestine means now puts you into the worst category. The noble Lord has to be right that when the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR">UNHCR</a>&#8212;the custodians and guardians of the refugee convention&#8212;is as concerned as it is, we are really in trouble, let alone all our domestic <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGOs">NGOs</a> and other international ones.</p> <p pid="a830.0/10">As to the Times report, referred to by my noble friend Lord Coaker, the idea that all these young men are automatically, as a class, to be detained is not just  obvious discrimination and obviously contrary to the refugee convention&#8212;and, by the way, Articles 5 and 14 of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Act">Human Rights Act</a>&#8212;it also seems slightly odd from a Government who do not like people banging on about misogyny, but have no problem with a bit of misandry. Young men are now going to be discriminated against by the Government for being, perhaps, the fittest and, therefore, the ones most able to escape via these unsafe routes. It does not make them less worthy. It just means that the young women and elderly people back home did not have the means of escape; it does not make their escape any less worthy. Desperation looks like that and sometimes it is the fittest who get away.</p> <p pid="a830.0/11">The noble Lord, Lord Horam, talked about the views of people, as did the noble Baroness. I, like the right reverend Prelate, have worked with lots of refugees over the years. I have also conducted polling and talked to people about their attitudes to refugees. I believe in the best of people. People want fair play; people want a sense of control over their lives and, if you like, their borders. However, this is not free movement; this is not immigration policy. This is about saying to people, &#8220;These are desperate people. These are people who want to make a contribution, as so many before them did. Give people decent jobs and services and a decent quality of life and do not divide and conquer or turn people against their neighbours. Let refugees and asylum seekers work and live as neighbours in the community.&#8221; When that happens, people feel positive about refugees and asylum seekers and conduct community campaigns to stop them being deported. I have seen this happen all over this country.</p> <p pid="a830.0/12">In conclusion, I agree with the right reverend Prelate; I am on his team and those who spoke with him. The way forward is family reunion, humanitarian visas and improving the first-tier administration in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a>. I once worked there, and the first-tier decision-making is appalling. By the way, seeking to avoid wars over there is quite a good idea if you are worried about the obligation under the international rule of law to give refuge over here. Noble Lords should think about the consequences. If every country&#8212;particularly every developed country&#8212;around the world adopted the approach in this Bill, would there even be a refugee convention left?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a833.3/1">My Lords, I would like to speak to my <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> 41. It is a very specific amendment relating to <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 11 as it currently stands. Before I turn to that, however, I will take up the words of my noble and learned friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brown">Lord Brown</a> in relation to providing a legal structure for our discussion here. The first thing, which has been emphasised by a number of noble Lords, though not all, is that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_31">Article 31</a> is central to the discussion. This is because it is obvious  that the Government, in relation to Clause 11 and the following clauses, are seeking to interpret and apply their view of Article 31.</p> <p pid="a833.3/2">It has been suggested that we can ignore the convention because we must have regard to what people think today, but I am afraid that we cannot do that. We are a party to this convention: if we do not like it, the Government will have to recuse themselves from it and try to get other countries to change it. At the moment, however, the convention applies.</p> <p pid="a833.3/3">Article 31 says that no penalty shall be imposed on account of illegal entry or presence on a refugee who satisfies three requirements. These are the three requirements set out in Clause 11. The first is that the refugee comes directly from the territory of persecution. The second is that the refugee presents themselves without delay to the authorities. The third is that the refugee shows good cause for their illegal entry or presence. That is what Clause 11 is about. However, you cannot read Clause 11 on its own because the subsequent clauses all have some impact on it. In particular, Clause 36 is critical because it seeks to give a definition of coming directly from the territory of persecution.</p> <p pid="a833.3/4">Noble Lords will see from what I have just described that, although Article 31 says what the Government cannot do&#8212;that is, they cannot impose a penalty if those three requirements are satisfied&#8212;it does not go on to say that, if they are not satisfied, you can have a differentiation such as that in Clause 11. That is a matter of policy, and I can certainly see the force of the argument for saying that this <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">division</a> that has taken place in Clause 11 is sufficiently inconsistent with the definition of a refugee to make it improper.</p> <p pid="a833.3/5">There is a more fundamental point: Clause 36, referred to by my noble and learned friend, in seeking to define &#8220;coming directly from another country,&#8221; says that the requirement is not to be taken as satisfied if the refugee stopped in another country outside the UK, unless they can show that they could not have reasonably been expected to have sought protection under the convention in that country. There is no such qualification in Article 31, and it appears that the Government believe they can, through legislation, elaborate on the meaning of Article 31 in whatever way would best suit the current asylum policy of the day. This, I am afraid, is entirely misguided as a matter of law.</p> <p pid="a833.3/6">As an international treaty, the convention has the same meaning for each and every member state that signed up to it. It cannot bear different meanings for each member state, according to the policy of the Government of the state for the time being. In <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales">England and Wales</a>, the court has, pursuant to its constitutional role of interpreting legislation and written law, held that a refugee may still come directly to a member state, within the meaning of Article 31, even if the refugee passes through one or more intermediate countries, if the final destination of the refugee has always been the state in which the asylum is finally claimed and the halts in the intermediate country or countries are no more than short-term stopovers. My noble and learned friend Lord Brown referred to his judgment in the Adimi case, which decided that very point.</p> <p pid="a833.3/7">On the global picture, to cut matters short&#8212;before I turn to the particular amendment&#8212;I am against the division, the separation, between group 1 and group 2 in Clause 11 because it depends on a requirement, or the failure to meet a requirement, which is directly contrary to the convention. Therefore, I certainly object to the division between group 1 and group 2 so long as Clause 36 stays in its present form, with its present definition of coming &#8220;directly&#8221;, on both logical and legal grounds&#8212;quite apart from the matter of general principle, which other noble Lords have mentioned, about the demeaning nature of distinguishing between two different categories.</p> <p pid="a833.3/8">On another requirement, that of presenting directly to the authorities, I think the right reverend Prelate already referred to the fact that in many of these cases&#8212;for example, wives who have fled from abusive marriages in a conservative religious country such as Pakistan&#8212;people have to flee in a clandestine way. That was the word used before. The idea that they can present themselves straightaway&#8212;for example, to a male representative of authority&#8212;and describe their situation seems unrealistic in many of these cases. Yes, it is true that we welcome large numbers of people under resettlement schemes&#8212;Afghanistan and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> are examples of those&#8212;but when we are talking about these other refugees, whom I would describe as the genuine refugees seeking one by one to escape from persecution, it seems to me that Clauses 11 and 36 as currently worded are inconsistent with the convention. For that reason, like my noble and learned friend Lord Brown, I would object to them.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a835.1/1">Strictly speaking, the legal position is that there is no basis for individuals to enforce the convention, but it is enforceable by other member states, which can complain that this country is not complying with its obligations. I would expect that that may well happen. So far as coming here illegally is concerned, my noble and learned friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brown">Lord Brown</a> referred to the Adimi case, which was about whether there was an illegal entry. He held that there was not, because although these refugees passed through intermediate states, they did in fact come directly. So, the individual is placed in a not very satisfactory situation, but the state can certainly be held accountable in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice">International Court of Justice</a>, and that may well happen.</p> <p pid="a835.1/2">If I may now descend from the wider view to the narrower, I want to deal with a point I have raised in relation to <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 11(3) and other similar clauses which impose a requirement on a refugee. The requirement, as it were, or even a breach of it can be overcome if</p> <p class="indent" pid="a835.1/3">&#8220;they can show good cause for their unlawful entry or presence&#8221;,</p> <p pid="a835.1/4">and there are other provisions saying that this can happen where there is a &#8220;reasonable&#8221; expectation of something happening or where something is &#8220;reasonably practicable&#8221;. In all those cases, I have sought to table an <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> which says that, in deciding what is good cause, practicable or reasonable, the immigration officer should take into account any protected characteristic of the refugee within the meaning of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_Act">Equality Act</a> which is innate or immutable. I do not want to get too involved in the legality of those terms; basically, that is relevant under decisions in our law to people who claim to be a member of a particular social group. Being a member of particular social group that is being persecuted is one of the categories of refugee in Article 1 of the convention, so I do not want to spend too much time on that. There are nine protected characteristics in the Equality Act, but only some of those will be innate or immutable.</p> <p pid="a835.1/5">That expression, &#8220;innate&#8221;, is used in the Bill itself in describing the meaning of a particular social group. Your Lordships will find it in Clause 32, which also expressly states that a</p> <p class="indent" pid="a835.1/6">&#8220;social group may include a group based on a common characteristic of sexual orientation&#8221;.</p> <p pid="a835.1/7">I want to take up that point to explain why I suggest it is necessary that wherever there is a reference to reasonable cause, reasonable expectation or what is practicable&#8212;as I have said&#8212;there is an express statement in the Bill that the fact that the refugee has a protected characteristic which is innate or immutable should be taken into account.</p> <p pid="a835.1/8">I want to take the case of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQI">LGBTQI</a>+ people to illustrate the reasons why. First, experience has shown that, all too often, difficulties arising from a characteristic such as that have not been taken sufficiently into account. The approach to LGBTQI+ refugees has often been woefully inadequate and misguided. It was not until the 2010 decision of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_Committee">Appellate Committee</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court">Supreme Court</a> in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HJ">HJ</a> (Iran) that it was established that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> could not refuse an asylum claim from a gay man or lesbian simply on the basis that if they could reasonably be expected to act discreetly in their home country, rather than live openly with their sexuality, they would not suffer persecution. Therefore, it was only some 12 years ago that the Home Office, which fought HJ (Iran) right up to the highest court in the land, was obliged to accept that its approach to LGBTQI+ refugees, in the words of then Supreme Court Justice Sir John Dyson&#8212;later <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Dyson">Lord Dyson</a> and Master of the Rolls&#8212;frustrated</p> <p class="indent" pid="a835.1/9">&#8220;the humanitarian objective of the Convention and&#8221; denied LGBTQI+ people</p> <p class="indent" pid="a835.1/11">&#8220;the enjoyment of their fundamental rights and freedoms without discrimination.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a835.1/12">Secondly, it is well known that LGBTQI+ refugees face a large number of practical difficulties in claiming asylum. I will address these in due course, when we come to the relevant clauses in the Bill, to show why there has been a failure to satisfy a particular requirement. In the case of Clause 11(2)(b), the issue is whether they presented themselves without delay to the authorities and can show good cause for their unlawful entry. This is the question of clandestine exit. As I have said, it applies also to abused women in abusive relationships coming from a conservative religious community. They  cannot go and buy a plane ticket. They cannot indicate in any way in these countries what the reason for their seeking asylum is. The result could be honour killings, stoning or being thrown off a wall, so they keep their characteristics as far as possible to themselves. It is not surprising that they are slow to report themselves or that their routes here are clandestine.</p> <p pid="a835.1/13">Finally, on this point, the Home Office&#8217;s own statistics show the extent to which claims by LGBTQ+ asylum seekers have been wrongly rejected by immigration officers. Experimental statistics published by the Government in August 2019 on lesbian, gay and bisexual asylum claims show there was an initial decision grant rate of 29% in 2018. However, 38% of appeals relating to LGBT asylum applications were allowed in respect of applications made in 2015-18. These published statistics are qualified in some respects but, in broad terms, they reflect the reality of a substantial proportion of successful appeals. That is why, in my suggestion, wherever we see in this Bill as currently framed any reference to good cause, those with protected characteristics that are innate or immutable must be protected by an express reference on the face of the Bill.</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 11 is not only not about immigration, let alone illegal immigration; it is not even about asylum seekers. It is titled &#8220;Differential treatment of refugees&#8221;&#8212;people who have been recognised and accepted as entitled to asylum in this country. What Clause 11 means is that the Government want to penalise a certain category of people who have been accepted as refugees. On the one hand, we accept them as refugees, but then we are going to turn round and penalise them in various ways for how they arrived. I have agreed with all the critics of Clause 11, and I agree that Clause 11 as a whole needs to get the chop.</p> <p pid="a837.1/2">Clause 11 wants to penalise people with a much-reduced permission to stay; by requiring several frequent applications for further permission to stay; by keeping them in uncertainty for many years; by excluding them from public funds; and by delaying or denying altogether a visa for family reunion. I suggest that this is not only pernicious, as everyone has said, but costly. It is costly to that individual and it is costly to society, because it is not good for society when you have people who are unable to integrate and living with instability, isolation,  possible destitution, homelessness and separation from family. They have been recognised as refugees, which means that we expect these people to be part of our society. I cannot see that it is good for society.</p> <p pid="a837.1/3">I had the opportunity, when the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> was kind enough to meet me, to receive the great news on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSI">CSI</a>. I come at this with an approach of both principle and practicality. As I say, I cannot see that it is in the interests of either society or the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> to have people living in this constant fear of what their futures are going to hold. We are told that the asylum system is broken. We know about the 125,000 unresolved applications. We know about the time and delays; on average, it now takes a year to decide a case. When I was an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEP">MEP</a>, I had people who had been waiting three and a half years for an initial application, with the harm it did to them physically and mentally and to their status within their family as well. How is it going to help the Home Office to have more administration in constantly having to review these applications to decide whether it is going to deny public funds or renew the permission to stay?</p> <p pid="a837.1/4">There is also bound to be an increase in litigation that arises as a result of Clause 11. I appreciated the comments of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Etherton, on the likely legal situation but there is bound to be strain on the legal and judicial systems from all this. I cannot see that this is going to help the problem of overload in the Home Office. It is shooting itself in the foot with all this.</p> <p pid="a837.1/5">I want to say something about family reunion in particular. I had an opportunity with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> of a Private Member&#8217;s Bill on family reunion, which I sort of took in relay from my noble friend Lady Hamwee. That was last September; I do not know whether it will make any further progress. Penalising group 2 refugees through family reunion is going to penalise women and children in particular and remove the largest single visa route by which they have a chance of arriving. Other people have made the point that that is going to create the incentive for dangerous and unsafe routes to this country&#8212;even more business for the smuggling gangs we are told the Home Office is so keen to put out of business.</p> <p pid="a837.1/6">My Private Member&#8217;s Bill wants to enlarge the opportunities for family reunion, particularly by allowing unaccompanied refugee children the right to sponsor their parents and siblings under the age of 25, as well as allowing adult refugees to sponsor adult children and siblings under the age of 25. Clause 11 goes completely in the opposite direction to what I and many other people want, but I do want to ask what the situation would be under <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_8">Article 8</a> because there are no details in this Bill or any of the supporting documents on what the family reunion rights for group 2 would be, other than that the temporary protection status they would get would &#8220;restrict&#8221; those rights. In the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>, Tom Pursglove MP from the Home Office said, in writing to members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Bill_Committee">Public Bill Committee</a>, that</p> <p class="indent" pid="a837.1/7">&#8220;we will not permit <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_2">Group 2</a> refugees to reunite with families unless a refusal would be a breach of our international obligations under Article 8 of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHR">ECHR</a>). Our policy on Article 8 is already clear.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a837.1/8">I am grateful to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Red_Cross">British Red Cross</a> briefing for reminding me that, far from being clear, the Home Office&#8217;s current guidance on Article 8 runs to 100 pages.</p> <p pid="a837.1/9">This Bill will make the family reunion process far more complicated, again going completely in the wrong direction. It is also not clear what level of evidence would need to be provided to substantiate an Article 8 claim. The Home Office has not set out under what circumstances it would consider that a refugee in the UK would not engage Article 8. If you are seeking to have your family, spouse and children come and join you, how would that not come within Article 8, which concerns the right to family and private life? I ask the Minister to give in her reply a bit more clarity about what family reunion rights group 2 refugees would have under Article 8.</p> <p pid="a837.1/10">Clause 11 is not only pernicious in principle: it has bad practical implications all round for the refugee, for our society and for the workload of the Home Office.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a839.0/1">My Lords, I listened carefully to the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, and she quite rightly reminded the House that we are talking about asylum seekers. I have to say that, after that, our paths diverged quite considerably.</p> <p pid="a839.0/2">In listening to a debate covering 16 amendments and a <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> stand part, I discerned three angles. The first, what I might call the ultras, led by the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kerr">Lord Kerr</a>, want to remove the clause completely. The second angle is to take the clause to pieces, as in the amendments from my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_McIntosh">Lady McIntosh</a>, moved by the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Griffiths">Lord Griffiths</a> of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burry_Port">Burry Port</a>. Thirdly, there are the other amendments, described by, I think, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, as picking at the scab. If you leave aside the point that the clause should not exist and take the other two, the inevitable result is that what we are doing, maybe imperceptibly, is widening the opportunity for asylum seekers to come to this country. How many and whether it is a good or a bad thing can be debated, but that is going to happen if we accept the amendments put forward in this group.</p> <p pid="a839.0/3">That, in turn, raises a couple of issues for me about fairness. First, there is fairness to those who have so far followed the scheme for tier 1 and are therefore going to find their position disadvantaged by the arrival of more people who would otherwise have been in tier 2. Once that thread is broken and the rules become more judgmental, then there are obviously issues of fairness for those who have the clearest position.</p> <p pid="a839.0/4">The second question of fairness is about the contract with the British public. In the debate on Clause 9 at the last meeting of the Committee, I discussed the nature of what I call &#8220;informed consent&#8221;. I described it as a concept that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bauer">Peter Bauer</a> had expressed to me half a century ago in a debate at my business school. Here, I touch very much on the point made by my noble and learned friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Clarke">Lord Clarke</a>, and the noble Baroness, Lady Fox. There is a question of informed consent. The informed consent is not absolute; it is conditional. One of the reasons I think we have had reasonably satisfactory race relations so far is the point made by my noble and learned friend Lord Clarke that the public have felt, though stretched,  often badly stretched, their consent is still there. But, as I say, it is not absolute and we need to make sure that the British public is able to see rules that are clear, unequivocal and comprehensible in their impact on them, their families, their communities and the society in which they live. The more complex the rules become, the greater the chances of cases emerging that will endanger and maybe break that informed consent.</p> <p pid="a839.0/5">My second point of concern about this is what I call &#8220;foreign shopping&#8221;. For a number of years I was a trustee of a charity called <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Trials_International">Fair Trials International</a>&#8212;the name is self-explanatory&#8212;which does excellent work in many areas but in particular as regards extradition. We came across the extremely unattractive practice of people seeking extradition going round looking for the best jurisdiction, the best legal system or the best court to enable them to be successful. I think we have to be very careful to ensure that similar practices, which may already exist now, do not grow further as regards asylum seekers.</p> <p pid="a839.0/6">Again, my noble and learned friend Lord Clarke referred to it. He said, &#8220;If I was in Nigeria with my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Horam">Lord Horam</a> and we were deciding we were a couple of likely lads and we thought the future looked better outside Nigeria, we would look around at all the jurisdictions that might offer us the best prospects.&#8221; Now, I think the United Kingdom is an extremely attractive place to go to. We have had a long debate tonight and I am not going to go through the reasons why I think it is. They include a series of things, not least that people can see that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom">Parliament of the United Kingdom</a> spends time talking and thinking about it and is concerned about it. What better way to try and find your way into a country that has the interest and the focus to make sure that even the lowest person is looked after and their rights are protected?</p> <p pid="a839.0/7">When my noble friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> comes to wind up, I hope she will be able to say that the Government are going to look very carefully at the impact of more asylum seekers of variable abilities, perhaps&#8212;more people who may risk breaking the informed consent of the British people. For all these reasons, we need to be very careful before we widen the aperture and widen the opportunities any further than proposed in the Bill as presently drafted.</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 11 and simply want to pose four questions, the answers to which I hope might help clarify the mind of the noble and learned Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Clarke">Lord Clarke</a> of Nottingham&#8212;my home city.</p> <p pid="a840.0/2">First, how is it possible to decide a priori whether someone is an economic migrant or a refugee on the basis of how they arrive in the country? It appears to be a key assumption on which Clause 11 and much of the Bill is based. The evidence&#8212;in particular the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_Council">Refugee Council</a>&#8217;s analysis of channel crossings&#8212;shows that most of those crossing the channel irregularly, and therefore deemed illegal, are likely to be recognised as in need of refugee protection. That does not support the assumption.</p> <p pid="a840.0/3">I recently met virtually with members of the Baobab Centre for Young Survivors in Exile and was told that, in their 32 years of work, they had never met an  unaccompanied young person who had arrived by a safe and legal route, yet all had been fleeing danger, with many having seen family members killed and many traumatised. A constant refrain among the young survivors themselves was that they wished Ministers would put themselves in their shoes&#8212;a refrain we have heard before this evening&#8212;and that they felt the proposed policy was based on a lack of compassion and trust.</p> <p pid="a840.0/4">Secondly, what assessment has been made of the likely impact on integration&#8212;an issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, which Ministers claim is still a goal&#8212;of creating a second-class group of refugees with no security and only very limited rights?</p> <p pid="a840.0/5">Thirdly, what assessment has been made of the case made by a number of organisations, including the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR">UNHCR</a>, that placing restrictions on the right to family reunion for this group will, in the words of the Refugee Council, &#8220;all but destroy&#8221; the</p> <p class="indent" pid="a840.0/6">&#8220;main safe route out of conflict for women and children at risk&#8221;.</p> <p pid="a840.0/7">Fourthly, and finally, why should we accept the Government&#8217;s interpretation of the refugee convention over that of the body with global supervisory responsibility for it? The UNHCR has provided detailed legal observations in support of its claims that the Bill is</p> <p class="indent" pid="a840.0/8">&#8220;fundamentally at odds with &#8230; the United Kingdom&#8217;s international obligations under the Refugee Convention&#8221;.</p> <p pid="a840.0/9">Likewise, Freedom from Torture has published a joint legal opinion from three chambers which states that</p> <p class="indent" pid="a840.0/10">&#8220;this Bill represents the biggest legal assault on international refugee law ever seen in the UK&#8221; and</p> <p class="indent" pid="a840.0/12">&#8220;is wrong as a matter of international refugee law.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a840.0/13">To my knowledge, the Government have not published the legal advice on which their claims that Clause 11 is compatible with international law are based. Will they now do so, particularly in light of the very important speech from the noble and learned Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brown">Lord Brown</a>?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a842.0/1">My Lords, I shall resist the temptation to offer a view on what public opinion is. What I do remember is that a lot of people expressed a view on what public opinion was over climate protesters and people who threw statues into the water at Bristol, but when cases came up before a jury, they reached some very interesting decisions on guilt or otherwise. That suggests that some of those who profess to know what public opinion is may not necessarily be right when the public have a chance to hear the arguments presented to them and are then asked to make a decision.</p> <p pid="a842.0/2"><a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 11 is about differential treatment of recognised refugees and its impact and implications. We believe that it contravenes the 1951 refugee convention. It sets a dangerous precedent by creating a two-tier system for refugees, and it is also inhumane. Under the Bill, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a> will be given sweeping powers to decide asylum cases based on how someone arrives in this country and their mode of transport, not on the strength of their claim&#8212;contrary to the 1951 refugee convention, of which Britain was a founding member.</p> <p pid="a842.0/3">Under the clause, only those refugees who meet specific additional requirements will be considered group 1 refugees and benefit from the rights currently granted to all refugees by the refugee convention. Other refugees who are not deemed to meet those criteria will be designated as group 2 refugees, and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> will be empowered to draft rules discriminating against group 2 refugees with regard to the rights to which they are entitled under the refugee convention, as well as their fundamental right to family unity. The different ways in which those two groups could be treated is not limited in any way by the Bill. Clause 11 does, however, provide examples of ways in which the two groups might be treated differently, even though they are nearly all recognised as genuine refugees. Those who travel via a third country, who do not have documents or who did not claim asylum immediately will routinely be designated as group 2 refugees. The clause goes on to set out how the length of limited leave, access to indefinite leave, family reunion &#8212;that is, whether family members, mainly women and children, are entitled to join them&#8212;and access to public funds are likely to become areas for discrimination against group 2 refugees.</p> <p pid="a842.0/4">The government policy paper, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Plan">New Plan</a> for Immigration, proposed that instead of fully fledged refugee status, group 2 refugees will be granted &#8220;temporary protection&#8221; for a period of no longer than 30 months,</p> <p class="indent" pid="a842.0/5">&#8220;after which individuals will be reassessed for return to their country of origin or removal to&#8221; a safe third country. Temporary protection status</p> <p class="indent" pid="a842.0/7">&#8220;will not include an automatic right to settle in the UK, family reunion rights will be restricted and there will be no recourse to public funds except in cases of destitution&#8221;&#8212; in other words, a state, deliberately created, of complete uncertainty over their future for group 2 refugees.</p> <p pid="a842.0/9">Clause 11 would therefore make a significant and unprecedented change in the law, resulting in the UK treating accepted refugees less generously, based on the journey they have taken to reach the UK and the timeliness of their asylum claim. This attempt to create two different classes of recognised refugee is surely inconsistent with the refugee convention and has no basis in international law. The refugee convention, which was enshrined in UK law in 1954, contains a single unitary definition of &#8220;refugee&#8221;. It defines a refugee solely according to their need for international protection because of feared persecution on the grounds of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. Anyone who meets that definition and is not excluded is a refugee and entitled to the protection of the refugee convention.</p> <p pid="a842.0/10"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commons">The Commons</a> committee considering the Bill heard in evidence from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a>&#8217; representative to the UK that this clause and the Bill were inconsistent with the UN convention and international law. If the Government disagree with that&#8212;an issue raised by my noble friend Lady Lister &#8212;no doubt they will spell out in some detail in their reply their legal argument for saying that the clause does comply with the convention and international law.</p> <p pid="a842.0/11">This is, however, not just a matter of law but of fairness and humanity. By penalising refugees for how they were able to get to the UK, the Bill builds walls against people in need of protection and shuts the door on many seeking a safe haven. Most refugees have absolutely no choice about how they travel. Is it really this Government&#8217;s intention and desire to penalise refugees who may, for example, as a matter of urgency, have had to find an irregular route out of Afghanistan? Are the Government saying that people are less deserving if they have had to take a dangerous route to our shores? Is an interpreter from Afghanistan who took a dangerous journey to our shores less deserving than a refugee who was lucky enough to make it here on one of the flights out of the country?</p> <p pid="a842.0/12">The Government acknowledge that such journeys are very dangerous and sometimes fatal, yet they do not seem to appreciate the compulsion&#8212;that the alternative of not doing so is even worse&#8212;which drives people to make such journeys. If people truly had a reason to believe that they would be safe where they are, they would not make the journey. Simply making the journey more dangerous or the asylum system more unwelcoming will not change that. Of the first 5,000 people who came in 2020 by boat, well over 90% were deemed by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> to be eligible to apply for asylum: they were genuine asylum seekers. They were not here illegally&#8212;but they will become illegal if the Bill is enacted.</p> <p pid="a842.0/13">Penalising people for how they arrived in the UK has particular implications for already vulnerable groups of refugees such as women and those from LGBT communities. Women are often compelled to take  irregular routes to reach safety, as we see only too clearly in Afghanistan. There are simply no safe and legal routes. Under the proposed changes, however, women who arrive irregularly, including through a safe third country, will be penalised and could be prosecuted, criminalised and imprisoned. The same obstacles will apply to those from LGBT communities.</p> <p pid="a842.0/14">Unless the Government can provide safe routes, penalising people for making unsafe journeys is simply inhumane, although, even then, not everyone would have the time or ability to access a safe route, even if one existed. By not providing safe routes, the Government are also fuelling the business model of the people smugglers they claim their proposals will destroy, and then penalising the victims they have had a responsibility for creating. The Conservative-led Foreign Affairs Committee, of which the Home Secretary was then a member, warned in 2019:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a842.0/15">&#8220;A policy that focuses exclusively on closing borders will drive migrants to take more dangerous routes, and push them into the hands of criminal groups&#8221;.</p> <p pid="a842.0/16">The Government&#8217;s impact assessment warns that increased deterrence in this manner</p> <p class="indent" pid="a842.0/17">&#8220;could encourage these cohorts to attempt riskier means of entering the UK.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a842.0/18">As has been said, Clause 11 also says that group 1 refugees must have</p> <p class="indent" pid="a842.0/19">&#8220;come to the United Kingdom directly from a country or territory where their life or freedom was threatened&#8221;.</p> <p pid="a842.0/20">In other words, the Government are setting an expectation that, to be recognised as a refugee supposedly deserving of the support usually afforded, the UK must be the first safe country in which they have sought asylum. Commenting on the Bill, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a842.0/21">&#8220;Requiring refugees to claim asylum in the first safe country they reach would undermine the global, humanitarian, and cooperative principles on which the refugee system is founded.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a842.0/22">It was pointed out in oral evidence to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee_on_Human_Rights">Joint Committee on Human Rights</a> that it was unlikely that</p> <p class="indent" pid="a842.0/23">&#8220;any country close to the main countries of origin of refugees would have ever considered signing a convention if that meant that they would assume total and entire responsibility for all the refugees.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a842.0/24">In addition, when the refugee convention came into being in the early 1950s, there was little or no commercial air travel, so any refugee reaching this country would have to have crossed land borders from safe states. Yet there was no view then that such a refugee should be seen&#8212;as under this Bill and the Government&#8217;s interpretation of the refugee convention in international law&#8212;as a criminal liable to up to four years in prison and to being sent back to France, and with any claim for asylum being regarded as inadmissible.</p> <p pid="a842.0/25">Even within Europe, most of the countries that refugees pass through on their way to the UK already host significantly more refugees and asylum seekers per population than the UK does. According to the Home Office&#8217;s own statistics, the UK is 17th in terms of the numbers it takes, measured per head of population. Unless safe routes are developed, all that will happen is that there will be an increase in dangerous crossings, because that will be the only way in which people can reach the United Kingdom.</p> <p pid="a842.0/26">As it is, France takes three times more asylum seekers than the UK, as does Germany. Global provision for refugees could not function if all refugees claimed asylum in the first safe country they came to. As my noble friends <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Griffiths">Lord Griffiths</a> of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burry_Port">Burry Port</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Coaker">Lord Coaker</a> have pointed out, most refugees are hosted in developing countries and the UK receives fewer asylum applications than most other European countries. Under international law, the primary responsibility for identifying refugees and affording international protection rests with the state in which an asylum seeker arrives and seeks that protection.</p> <p pid="a842.0/27">Clause 11 sets out a non-exhaustive list of the ways in which refugees who arrive irregularly and become group 2 refugees may be treated differently. The Explanatory Notes to the Bill state that the purpose of this is</p> <p class="indent" pid="a842.0/28">&#8220;to discourage asylum seekers from travelling to the UK&#8221;,</p> <p pid="a842.0/29">and to encourage</p> <p class="indent" pid="a842.0/30">&#8220;individuals to seek asylum in the first safe country they reach after fleeing persecution.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a842.0/31">It is not clear, since the Government have provided no explanation, how the stated aim will result from the policy; perhaps the Government in their response will provide that explanation.</p> <p pid="a842.0/32">Evidence from many refugee organisations suggests that refugees seek asylum in the UK for a range of reasons, such as proficiency in English, family links or a common heritage based on past colonial histories. In addition, refugees do not cite the level of leave granted or other elements of the asylum system as decisive factors. The Home Office&#8217;s own study from 2002&#8212;I do not think there has been one since then&#8212;noted that there was little evidence that respondents seeking to come to the UK had a detailed knowledge of UK asylum procedures, benefit entitlements or the availability of work in the UK. There was even less evidence that the respondents had a comparative knowledge of how these conditions varied between different European destination countries.</p> <p pid="a842.0/33">Given that individuals have little knowledge of the asylum systems of the countries they end up in, it is not clear that differential treatment will dissuade individuals from coming to the UK via safe countries. However, what the Government are proposing will certainly result in a refugee population that is less secure, and it will punish those who have been recognised through the legal system as needing international protection, such as women and girls fleeing the Taliban or Uighurs fleeing genocide in China.</p> <p pid="a842.0/34">The Explanatory Notes also state that 62% of asylum claims in the UK up to September 2019 were from people who entered irregularly. This means that the policy intention is to impose strictures on the rights and entitlements of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of refugees coming to the UK, even though we take fewer than comparable countries. Those penalties would target not just those who have entered the UK irregularly or have made dangerous journeys but all those who have not come directly to the UK, regularly or irregularly, from a country or territory where their life or freedom was threatened, those who have delayed claiming asylum or overstayed, and even those who arrive in the UK without entry clearance and who claim asylum immediately.</p> <p pid="a842.0/35">I repeat that Clause 11 envisages that group 2 status will be imposed on recognised refugees and will stigmatise them as unworthy and unwelcome, maintain them in a precarious status for many years, deny them access to public funds unless they are destitute and restrict their access to family reunion. We are talking here about recognised refugees. A number of studies have shown that that precarious status itself is a barrier to integration and employment Yet, despite these challenges, the Bill will specifically empower the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> to attach a no recourse to public funds condition to the granting of leave to group 2 refugees. The adverse consequences of no recourse to public funds conditions will fall not only on the refugees themselves but on their families, including children who travel with them, who are able to join them later, or who are born in the UK.</p> <p pid="a842.0/36">Those consequences have been documented in numerous studies. They include difficulty accessing shelters for victims of <a href="/glossary/?gl=140" title="violence occurring within the family" class="glossary">domestic violence</a>, denial of free school meals where those are linked to the parents&#8217; benefit entitlement and de facto exclusion from the job market for single parents who have limited access to government-subsidised childcare, as well as significant risk of food poverty, severe debt, substandard accommodation and homelessness. Yet the Home Office&#8217;s own indicators of integration framework identifies secured immigration status as a key outcome indicator for stability, which is</p> <p class="indent" pid="a842.0/37">&#8220;necessary for sustainable engagement with employment or education and other services.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a842.0/38">On that issue, in paragraph 58 of its report relating to secured immigration status and the idea of safe routes, the JCHR said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a842.0/39">&#8220;The Government&#8217;s New Plan for Immigration contains a commitment to provide an unspecified number of refugee resettlement places, review support for eligible refugees to come to the UK through the points-based system and consider a new process to enable people in urgent need of protection to travel directly to the UK from their country of origin.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a842.0/40">While we welcome the commitment to safe and legal routes, we were disappointed that, in his evidence to us on <phrase class="date" code="2022-12-01">1 December</phrase> 2021, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> was unable to give any update or detail on how the Government will fulfil those commitments. In their response tonight, can the Government now tell us how they will fulfil those commitments, as the Minister was unable to do on <phrase class="date" code="2022-12-01">1 December</phrase> 2021?</p> <p pid="a842.0/41">There must, frankly, be a suspicion that, more than any other consideration, Clause 11 is about saving the political skin of a Home Secretary and Government who have previously promised their supporters that they would stop people crossing the channel irregularly, only to see the numbers subsequently increase. As a result, Clause 11 is largely silent on addressing the continuing and apparently expanding horrendous activities of the people smugglers and instead concentrates on hitting their victims, nearly all of whom are recognised as genuine asylum seekers.</p> <p pid="a842.0/42">There appears to be little in this Bill that addresses reducing or stopping this awful traffic of people smugglers and in that way reducing or stopping the level of trafficking. That would surely be one of the best ways to address the issue of people crossing the channel in the unsafe way that they currently do.</p> <p pid="a842.0/43">As my noble friend Lord Coaker pointed out, we now find that the Government apparently intend to arrest and lock up all single males crossing the channel. This casts even more doubts on this Government&#8217;s true intentions and motives as far as these proposals are concerned. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us in her reply that what appeared in <a href="/glossary/?gl=49" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/" class="glossary">the Times</a> today &#8212;to which my noble friend Lord Coaker referred&#8212;is just not true and is not what the Government intend to do. Frankly, if we do not have this clear statement, this really will be a very sorry reflection on the motives behind the Bill.</p> <p pid="a842.0/44">We now have a clause and a Bill under which individuals who have been recognised as refugees would be given inferior treatment, based on the way in which they came to the UK. This is contrary to the UK&#8217;s obligations under the refugee convention and inconsistent with the right to private and family life and the prohibition against discrimination under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHR">ECHR</a>. That is why Clause 11 should be removed from the Bill.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a847.0/1">I am sorry to disappoint noble Lords, but I am the lead signatory on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 11 stand part proposal. The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, has kindly allowed me to speak last from this side.</p> <p pid="a847.0/2">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a>&#8212;the UN Refugee Agency&#8212;leads international action to protect people forced to flee because of conflict and persecution. As many noble Lords have said, a 1951 convention and a 1957 protocol together make the refugee convention, which sets out the UK&#8217;s and other signatories&#8217; international obligations.</p> <p pid="a847.0/3">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR">UNHCR</a>&#8217;s considered view&#8212;as well as that of the noble and learned Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brown">Lord Brown</a> of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaton-under-Heywood">Eaton-under-Heywood</a>, from what I understand&#8212;is that the Bill is fundamentally at odds with the Government&#8217;s commitment to uphold the United Kingdom&#8217;s obligations under the refugee convention. Clause 11 is at the heart of this considered view.</p> <p pid="a847.0/4">The Government seem to misunderstand the purpose of international conventions, such as the refugee convention. They have recently adopted the phrase &#8220;different countries will interpret the convention differently&#8221;. Is not the whole purpose of an international convention and its protocols for there to be a shared understanding of what an international convention means, to ensure that each signatory interprets the convention in the same way and acts accordingly? I think that was the view expressed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Etherton. I will address his concerns about protected characteristics in a future group.</p> <p pid="a847.0/5">More honestly, some <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a>&#8212;and the noble Baroness, Lady Fox of Buckley, who has apparently given up&#8212;have called the refugee convention outdated. They say that we should renegotiate or withdraw from it. That is not the Government&#8217;s position. They say that they can treat asylum seekers differently, depending on their circumstances, and that this is in compliance with the refugee convention.</p> <p pid="a847.0/6">Much has been said&#8212;and we have had many briefings on this clause&#8212;but I will restrict my comments to the primary concerns of the custodian of the refugee convention, the UNHCR. It says that the &#8220;first safe country&#8221; principle does not exist in international law,  is unworkable and would undermine global co-operation. This is obviously the case. With most refugees&#8212;at least before the fall of Afghanistan&#8212;making their own way to safety from the African continent, only Turkey and those countries bordering the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> would be legally able to take refugees, if that were the case. The UNHCR says that already three-quarters of refugees are hosted in countries neighbouring their own. Some 85% are hosted in developing and middle-income countries. As other noble Lords have said, almost all the countries through which refugees pass on their way to the UK already have more refugees and asylum-seeking applicants than the UK does.</p> <p pid="a847.0/7">This is a global crisis, requiring a global response in which every country plays its part and where every country, including the UK, takes its fair share of genuine asylum seekers. A disproportionate burden should not be placed on border countries; nor should it be that the further north and west you go, the fewer asylum seekers you have to take.</p> <p pid="a847.0/8">The UNHCR says that the claims of refugees seeking safety in the UK need to be considered solely on the basis of whether the circumstances from which they have fled justify their refugee status. If a refugee is entitled to the rights given to him or her by the refugee convention, all those rights should be exercisable in any convention country, including the UK. This clause would deny recognised refugees the rights guaranteed to them under the refugee convention and international law. That is why it should not stand part of the Bill.</p> <p pid="a847.0/9">The noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Horam">Lord Horam</a>, described me as an economist. I think my tutor at Oxford, Dieter Helm, would disagree with that. In a previous group, I purposely said that I studied economics at university, but I still have no clue about it. The noble Lord talked about illegal immigrants. Other noble Lords tried to correct him. Genuine refugees are not illegal immigrants.</p> <p pid="a847.0/10">The noble Lord, Lord Horam, and other noble Lords talked about public opinion. That is all very well, provided that opinion is informed. Some 94% of immigrants to the United Kingdom are not refugees. If the British public understood that this Bill is only talking about 6% of the people who come to this country, I think they would have a very different view of it.</p> <p pid="a847.0/11">The noble and learned Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Clarke">Lord Clarke</a> of Nottingham, said that the public were concerned about people coming across the channel in dinghies. What the public do not understand is that we do not have record numbers crossing the channel in order to claim asylum by clandestine means. So many are now coming across the channel in dinghies because we have been so good at stopping them getting on the Eurostar and entering lorries and because of security around the ports. It is just that the problem has become a lot more visible than it ever was before. It is not out of control compared with the past.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a849.1/1">My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have spoken in this debate. I have been requested to confirm that I did not send a note to the noble Lord, Lord Green of Deddington. I confirm that I did send him a note. There is no law against it, and I am not sure why I was asked. I sent him a note to tell him that he was right.</p> <p pid="a849.1/2">I welcome my noble and learned friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Clarke">Lord Clarke</a> to this debate; I am very pleased to see him here and welcome his comments. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee">The Committee</a> will be very well served by listening to him, to my noble friends <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Horam">Lord Horam</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hodgson_of_Astley_Abbotts">Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts</a>, and to the noble Baroness, Lady Fox, although she concluded that she was not sure that she could support <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 11. The points that they made around how generous, warm and welcoming this country is and how we must be careful to take public opinion into account are pertinent. The noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Moulsecoomb, said that if you asked the British public, they would bring back hanging; actually, it was because of public opinion that hanging was abolished in this country, so I do not agree with her premise.</p> <p pid="a849.1/3">As the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, said, this group is not, largely, about the 1951 convention but about the point on differentiation. There will be three groups further on dealing with the 1951 convention, but I will answer a couple of points on it now. The noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Griffiths">Lord Griffiths</a> of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burry_Port">Burry Port</a>, said that we should be working with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR">UNHCR</a>. Other noble Lords have made the point that UNHCR disagrees with us. We do not think that there is only one interpretation of the refugee convention. It is for Parliament to decide, and I say to the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kerr">Lord Kerr</a>, that I do not think that is eccentric. It is democracy. It is for Parliament to decide, subject to the general principles of the Vienna convention on the law of treaties.</p> <p pid="a849.1/4">The noble and learned Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brown">Lord Brown</a> of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaton-under-Heywood">Eaton-under-Heywood</a>, referred to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_31">Article 31</a> flowing from Asfaw and Adimi, and asked why we were altering that. Parliament&#8217;s original intention regarding Article 31 is clear in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_31">Section 31</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Asylum_Act_1999">Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</a> that a refugee will not be determined to have come directly if they stopped in a third country outside the United Kingdom unless they can show that they could not reasonably have been expected to be given protection under the convention in that country. The courts have interpreted this more generously and we are therefore taking the opportunity to reset the definition to the original intention of Parliament.</p> <p pid="a849.1/5">The noble and learned Lord, Lord Etherton, made a point about the proposed interpretation of &#8220;coming directly&#8221; under Article 31 of the convention in Clause 36 not being how it was intended by the convention. We have been very clear that people seeking protection must claim it in the first safe country they reach. That is the fastest route to safety. We will not tolerate criminal smugglers exploiting vulnerable people to come to the UK when a claim could easily have been made in another safe country. The convention does not explicitly define what is meant by coming directly and therefore, it is ultimately for our sovereign Parliament to set out its interpretation of international obligations subject only to the principle of treaty interpretation of the Vienna convention.</p> <p pid="a849.1/6">The noble and learned Lord also talked about LGBT+ communities, which again we will come to later. We know that they can have difficulties in making and evidencing a claim. That is why our policies and training are designed to support claimants in being able to explain their claim in a sensitive and safe environment.</p>            </div>

She enumerated four Members of the Committee who had spoken supportively. I think it is the case that none of them argued that the Bill was not a breach of the convention. We had some powerful legal advice that it was a clear breach of the convention. I ask her to remember that the last time this House was asked to pass a Bill that broke an international commitment was on the internal market Bill, and it took the very clear view that pacta sunt servanda mattered and that we should stick to our word.</p>            </div>

I do not think we will turn British public opinion round to the views I personally would like to support if I thought we could. I wait to be persuaded that the Government&#8217;s package will actually work and make the problem any easier. I reject the simplistic solution that all we have to do is provide safe and easy routes and accept that many more people will come, because they undoubtedly will if some of the things that have been proposed are accepted.

I am not convinced that <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.

I hope to persuade my noble and learned friend, but no one piece of legislation will be the silver bullet to solve all the problems. I do not think I have ever made any secret of that, but I thank him very much indeed for his points.</p> <p pid="a851.1/2">To get back to the LGBT+ community, it can have particular issues with claims. There is sensitivity about this. Our guidance on sexual orientation and gender identity was developed to take these issues into account. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR">UNHCR</a>, Stonewall and Rainbow Migration contributed to its development and we are most grateful to them. We will review and update our training and guidance where necessary to support people who are LGBT+.</p> <p pid="a851.1/3">I would like to get back to the first safe country principle, which is internationally recognised. In fact, it underpins the common European asylum system, particularly the Dublin system, which I note that a number of noble Lords are separately seeking to replicate through the Bill. Broadly speaking, the first safe country principle defines countries which are presumed safe to live in, based on their stable democratic system and compliance with international human rights treaties. Dublin therefore functions on a twofold logic: first, that first countries of entry are safe and should normally be responsible for determining an asylum claim; and, secondly, that burden sharing can then take place where there is a family connection in another safe country. In essence, the first safe country principle removes asylum seekers&#8217; ability to choose where to go&#8212;and undertake dangerous journeys in the hands of criminal smugglers to do so&#8212;in favour of safe, orderly, and regular management of flows. That is a reasonable approach.</p> <p pid="a851.1/4">To demand that the UK do more to share the burden, but also to hold that asylum seekers have the right to choose where to claim&#8212;the point that my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hodgson_of_Astley_Abbotts">Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts</a> made, this concept of forum shopping&#8212;is simply contradictory. On this logic, the number of people who claim in the UK is exactly the right number and there is nothing more that the UK needs to do. Conversely, the reason that the Bill enshrines the idea that asylum seekers ought not to choose where they claim, by setting out various measures in defence of the first safe country principle, is precisely because removing that choice enables us to  do more on burden sharing from regions of origin. In what is decidedly a more ambitious approach than anywhere in the EU, such a policy would provide far more generosity, fairness, and control in managing global asylum flows. Can I turn now to pull factors?</p>            </div>

I am not going to commit to publishing the legal advice. I am, however, going to come to her questions later if the Committee will be patient.</p> <p pid="a852.5/2">Can I get on now to pull factors? They are complex, but it is reductive to claim that asylum seekers do not ever make decisions about their destination based on policy calculations. They are like the rest of us; they do not simply respond to one or two factors such as family or language in making a choice. Many more factors come into play in this respect, as my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hodgson_of_Astley_Abbotts">Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts</a> mentioned, and one of those will very naturally concern how to rebuild the life they lost after being forced to flee their country of origin. But to defend the first safe country principle for the reasons I have set out, we must do everything we can to deter dangerous secondary movements from countries that are already safe and provide perfectly good means for a flourishing life.</p> <p pid="a852.5/3">Noble Lords have mentioned <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark,_Australia">Denmark, Australia</a> and Japan. We have seen large reductions in spontaneous intake in both Denmark and Australia, following similar approaches to that which we intend to take. In fact, Australia resettles the single largest number of refugees in the world.</p> <p pid="a852.5/4">My noble and learned friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Clarke">Lord Clarke</a> asked about prosecutions of asylum seekers coming here by small boat. We seek prosecutions only where there are aggravating features, such as major costs and disruption to shipping, or repeated efforts to cross.</p> <p pid="a852.5/5">I categorically reject the contention that the UK does not do its fair share. As the noble and learned Lord has pointed out, since 2015 we have resettled more than 25,000 people, half of whom were children, and that is the most in Europe. That is under national resettlement schemes. We are the fourth highest in the EU in terms of asylum applications to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEA">EEA</a>, EU and Switzerland in the year to June 2021. Our family reunion scheme has seen a further 39,000 people settle in the UK. I want to hold up a prop&#8212;</p>            </div>

I have not tried to mask the figures. I have been very clear about how many people we have taken under national resettlement schemes.</p> <p pid="a853.1/2">I was about to hold up a prop, although I know that is not done in your Lordships&#8217; House. I wrote to the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, who had to go, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Fox; she apologised for that. I wrote to noble Lords about the safe and legal routes, and I think the reason that some noble Lords do not want to acknowledge it is that they do not accept what we have done. I have looked at how many different family reunion schemes we have. We have four, including refugee family reunion. I will spend a moment to really spell this out, because some noble Lords just seem to not want to hear it. We have granted over 39,000 refugee family reunion visas since 2015, of which more than half were granted to children. Comparing that to the Dublin scheme, under the Dublin regulation, we transferred 714 people to the UK in 2019. In the same year, we issued 7,456 visas under our family reunion rules. It does not take a genius to work out that is 10 times the amount. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_8">Part 8</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Rules">Immigration Rules</a>&#8212;paragraph 319X&#8212;allows relatives to sponsor. We also have paragraph 297 and Appendix <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM">FM</a>. Under Appendix FM, in 2020 there were 40,255 family-related visas granted. Please do not keep talking about us undermining family reunion, because we just have not. It is not true. I ask noble Lords to refer back to the letter that I sent to the noble Lord, Lord Dubs&#8212;I think that was last week.</p>            </div>

I confirm to the noble Baroness, and for Hansard, so that noble Lords do not come back at me again and again to make this point, that group 2 refugees will be afforded the entitlements in a way that is compatible with the refugee convention, including family reunion, compatible with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHR">ECHR</a>. Most importantly, they will be provided with protection against refoulement. I make that point again: group 2 refugees will be afforded the entitlements in a way that is compatible with the refugee convention, including family reunion. I hope noble Lords will not come back to that point&#8212;well, they will do so, but I have made my point, I hope.</p> <p pid="a854.0/2">If I can, I will continue on the generosity of the great British public and this Government. Over 88,000 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> status holders and their family members&#8212;almost 90,000, as my noble friend said&#8212;have chosen to apply for the BNO route, with over 76,000 granted it so far. Meanwhile, we led Europe in airlifting some 15,000 people out of Afghanistan to the UK from mid-August under <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Pitting">Operation Pitting</a>. If any noble Lord wants to stand up and say we were not generous in that situation, I beg them to do that now. That is over and above the earlier transfers of around 2,000 locally employed staff and their families under the Afghan relocations and assistance policy. Our new Afghan citizens resettlement scheme also aims to welcome a total of 20,000 people. These people, who noble Lords were talking about earlier, are the most vulnerable people in the world today and our generosity has been exemplary.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a856.2/1">It is differentiation rather than discrimination. The two are quite different.</p> <p pid="a856.2/2">Amendments 44, 45, 47, 51 and 52 seek to remove the powers to differentiate entitlements. As we have noted elsewhere, these powers are broad and flexible; they do not require the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> to act in a particular way. Equally, there is ample discretion available in respect of whether a person is granted group 1 or group 2 refugee status. While the detail will be set out in rules and guidance in due course, suffice it to say that the exercise of the powers in question will be sensitive to vulnerabilities and individual circumstances. That enables us to balance the need to take a tough approach with the need to protect the most vulnerable.</p> <p pid="a856.2/3">We have been clear that our starting point in respect of the length of leave will be a grant of no less than 30 months. Similarly, settlement will be available by virtue of our long-residence rules. We have gone further in our defence of refugee family reunion, noting that we will continue to uphold our international obligations under <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_8">Article 8</a>, but in any event, there is no requirement to apply such entitlements in each and every case. I repeat that we fully intend to be sensitive to vulnerabilities and individual circumstances in that respect. That is why we have retained a considerable amount of discretion in the drafting.</p> <p pid="a856.2/4">Turning to <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> 55, I do not think it would be appropriate or right for us to step outside of the existing power to make immigration rules under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_1971">Immigration Act 1971</a>. This is the same power that we use to implement most other aspects of UK immigration policy, including but not limited to asylum policy. Indeed, areas in which we regularly use <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Rules">Immigration Rules</a> to administer the system include the type of leave to remain,  the length of leave to remain, the routes and conditions of settlement, and family reunion. It would be inappropriate to do otherwise in this case. The rules are the appropriate vehicle: they have a long-standing and clear procedure, with the appropriate level of scrutiny built in. As I have noted, however, I am absolutely committed to this policy being exercised sensitively with a view to protecting the most vulnerable. There will always be discretion in our policies to make the right decisions in each case, and that extends to the Immigration Rules.</p> <p pid="a856.2/5">I cannot agree to Amendment 39, which would remove the requirement for a person to claim without delay to be a group 1 refugee. That means that anyone claiming asylum, regardless of whether that was done at the last moment to defer removal, could be a group 1 refugee. That would undercut the entire purpose of the policy and embolden those seeking to abuse our rules. There are already safeguards within the legislation enabling discretion to be exercised, such that a claim should be made as soon as reasonably practicable.</p> <p pid="a856.2/6">Amendments 43 and 50 would amend the list of ways in which we can differentiate from a non-exhaustive list to an exhaustive one. We must keep all options on the table to prevent dangerous journeys from safe countries, and we can do that only by retaining flexible powers to respond to situations as they arise.</p> <p pid="a856.2/7">Amendment 48 would prevent the ability to differentiate in respect of family members. This is primarily about coherent policy. We should ensure that, where appropriate, family members of refugees are not treated more or less favourably than the lead applicant, but the flexibility that we wish to retain will also enable us to respond sensitively to particular circumstances as appropriate, including in respect of how we treat family members. For example, let us say we discover that a child has been a victim of abuse by their parents and needs to be taken into care. The flexibility in the powers would enable us to respond to such a tragic situation by granting a more generous entitlement to that child compared to their parents, in order to sympathetically reflect the need in those individual circumstances.</p> <p pid="a856.2/8">Amendment 53 would remove the ability to differentiate in respect of requirements for settlement for family members. We must keep all options on the table to prevent dangerous journeys from safe countries, and we can do this only through retaining flexible powers to respond to situations as they arise. That said, I anticipate that many if not most families will receive the same length of leave to remain to ensure that all qualify for settlement on the same terms at the same time. However, we want to retain the ability to respond flexibly to challenging situations that might require us to do otherwise in respect of length of leave for a refugee and their family.</p> <p pid="a856.2/9">I turn to Amendment 41, in the name of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Etherton. I hope I can offer some reassurance that his concerns have already been accounted for in the policy, so there need be no further amendments to the Bill in this respect, as I outlined earlier. We envisage that the provision will apply in cases where a refugee meets the first two limbs of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_31">Article 31</a>&#8212;   that is to say, they came direct and claimed &#8220;without delay&#8221;&#8212;but, at the time of the claim, they had entered or were present in the UK unlawfully, having, for instance, overstayed an economic migrant visa.</p> <p pid="a856.2/10">To illustrate, let us say a person overstayed their visa and then lodged an asylum claim. Because they had entered the UK directly and ostensibly claimed without delay, they might be eligible for group 1 refugee status but, due to having overstayed, we would also check whether they had</p> <p class="indent" pid="a856.2/11">&#8220;good cause for their illegal &#8230; presence&#8221; at the point of claim. If they had no good reason for having been in the UK illegally, they might be liable for group 2 status. An example of where good cause could be shown might be if a person had overstayed their visa and then lodged an asylum claim&#8212;a very similar situation to that described by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham. If their reason for overstaying and lodging an asylum claim while in the UK illegally was on the grounds that they feared presenting to the authorities because they were homosexual, in such a case this may well amount to a good cause.</p> <p pid="a856.2/13">Suffice it to say that the powers in the Bill are broad and flexible and therefore enable us to exercise discretion where appropriate, including with respect to &#8220;good cause&#8221;, which will be reflected in guidance to caseworkers.</p> <p pid="a856.2/14">I turn my attention to <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 11 as it currently stands. These powers are primarily intended to uphold the &#8220;first safe country of asylum&#8221; principle. Clause 11 provides a power, as noble Lords have pointed out&#8212;they are not very happy about it&#8212;for the UK to differentiate according to whether people satisfy certain criteria based on those in Article 31.1 of the refugee convention. The Government have set out their interpretation in Clause 36. I will not distract the Committee from the issue at hand by going through the provisions of Clause 36, because they will be debated in full.</p> <p pid="a856.2/15">If I may just pick up the points made by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Durham, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Ludford and Lady Chakrabarti, on Article 31, the criteria we use as the basis for differentiation are not based expressly on one&#8217;s method of arrival. Instead, they are based on the criteria within Article 31 of the convention: whether someone came directly and claimed without delay, and, where applicable, had</p> <p class="indent" pid="a856.2/16">&#8220;good cause for their illegal entry or presence&#8221;.</p> <p pid="a856.2/17">The clause acts on our commitment to do everything we can to deter individuals, as I have said, from making dangerous and unnecessary journeys through safe third countries, often putting lives at risk. I hope I have fully explained the Government&#8217;s rationale and addressed noble Lords&#8217; questions. If I have missed anything out, I am very happy to follow up in writing but I hope that noble Lords will feel happy to withdraw or not press their amendments.</p>            </div>

It has certainly laid bare the points of difference that are going to have to be resolved at a later stage in the consideration of this Bill. I say to the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kerr">Lord Kerr</a>, that the lipstick is back in my pocket and the piglet is running free.</p> <p pid="a858.0/2">I appeal to the noble and learned Lords who have so helpfully intervened in this debate. I made the case at <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> that I was hearing two legal positions established that I, as a non-lawyer, could not reconcile. I was hoping that noble and learned Lords would bring all their pals in to help us see the basis on which the Government&#8217;s legal judgment is reached, since the Government do not choose to reveal this; perhaps they do not do so habitually. I said that this would help those such as me to understand. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR">UNHCR</a> statement I read&#8212;all 72 pages of it&#8212;is very clear, it really is. I have not heard what convinces me that an opposite case can equally be true. I think we are going to need some help. I implore noble and learned Lords not to go on holiday before Report, please.</p> <p pid="a858.0/3">So we come to the end of this long debate. I thank the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for her spirited response. It is no joke standing there and defending yourself against what you perceive to be the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, but she did it with some courage. I also thank all those who intervened on her because, in this way, we have opened matters up. Before Report, some of us are going to have to do some serious thinking and come back in a focused way to take this matter further in a way that satisfies all of us.</p> <p pid="a858.0/4">Is it not incredible that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> is, this very day, in Kiev in Ukraine, arguing that Britain honours its international agreements directed towards those at the far-flung edges of Europe? I would that he come back in his plane via Turkey, Greece, Spain and Italy to show how he is equally committed to the international agreements and treaties we have entered into in respect of the way we treat refugees. With all that said and a little bluster on my part, I am glad to put the piglet running and out of the way. I beg leave to withdraw the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>.</p> <p class="italic" pid="a858.0/5">Amendment 37 withdrawn.</p> <p class="italic" pid="a858.0/6">Amendments 38 and 39 not moved.</p> <p class="italic" pid="a858.0/7">House resumed.
