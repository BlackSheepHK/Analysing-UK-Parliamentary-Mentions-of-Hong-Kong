                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="e663.4/1">The idea of taking targeted action against human rights violators has received further cross-party backing since then, from hon. Members in all parts of the House, including five former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretaries">Foreign Secretaries</a> and the current Chair of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs. In 2019, it was in the Conservative party&#8217;s manifesto as a clear commitment.</p> <p pid="e663.4/2">Today I am proud that under this <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and this Government, we make good on that pledge, bringing into force the United Kingdom&#8217;s first autonomous human rights sanctions regime, which gives us the power to impose sanctions on those involved in the very worst human rights abuses right around the world. These sanctions are a forensic tool, which allows us to target perpetrators without punishing the wider people of a country that may be affected. The regulations will enable us to impose travel bans and asset freezes against those involved in serious human rights violations. We are talking about, first, the right to life, where it is threatened by assassinations and extra-judicial killing; secondly, the right not to be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; and, thirdly, the right to be free from slavery, servitude or forced or compulsory labour. The powers enable us to target a wider network of perpetrators, including those who facilitate, incite, promote or support these crimes. This extends beyond state officials to non-state actors as well. So if you&#8217;re a kleptocrat or an organised criminal, you will not be able to launder your blood money in this country. Today this Government and this House send a very clear message, on behalf of the British people: those with blood on   their hands, the thugs of despots, the henchmen of dictators, will not be free to waltz into this country, to buy up property on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Road">Kings Road</a>, do their Christmas shopping in Knightsbridge or siphon dirty money through British banks or other financial institutions.</p> <p pid="e663.4/3">The regulations are just the latest next step forward in the long struggle against impunity for the worst human rights violations. We have deliberately focused on the worst crimes, so we have the clearest basis, to make sure we can operate the new system as effectively as we possibly can. That said, we will continue to explore expanding this regime to include other human rights, and I can tell the House that we are already considering how a corruption regime could be added to the armoury of legal weapons we have. In particular, hon. Members will be interested to know that I am looking at the UN convention against corruption, and practice already under way under the frameworks in jurisdictions such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_Canada">United States and Canada</a>.</p> <p pid="e663.4/4">Today we have also published a policy note, which sets out how we will consider designations under these regulations, for maximum transparency. As the House would expect, the legislation will ensure that due process will be followed in relation to those designations, reflecting the process rights contained in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_and_Anti-Money_Laundering_Act_2018">Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018</a>. In practice, those people designated will be able to request that a <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> review the decision. They will be able to challenge the decision in the court. And, just as a matter of due diligence, the Government will review all designations at least once every three years.</p> <p pid="e663.4/5">In addition to introducing this new legal regime, today we are proceeding directly to make the first designations under the regulations. We are imposing sanctions on individuals involved in some of the most notorious human rights violations in recent years. The first designations will cover those individuals involved in the torture and murder of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Magnitsky">Sergei Magnitsky</a>, the lawyer who disclosed the biggest known tax fraud in Russian history. The designations will also include those responsible for the brutal murder of the writer and journalist <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Khashoggi">Jamal Khashoggi</a>, and those who perpetrated the systematic and brutal violence against the Rohingya population in Myanmar. They will also include two organisations bearing responsibility for the enslavement, torture and murder that takes place in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea">North Korea</a>&#8217;s wretched gulags, in which it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of prisoners have perished over the past 50 years. With those first designations, the Government&#8212;and, I hope, the House and the country&#8212;make it crystal clear to those who abuse their power to inflict unimaginable suffering that we will not look the other way. You cannot set foot in this country and we will seize your blood-drenched ill-gotten gains if you try.</p> <p pid="e663.4/6">In practice, targeted sanctions are most effective when they are done through co-ordinated collective action, so we will be working closely with our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a> partners, including in particular the US and Canada, which already have Magnitsky-style sanctions legislation, and Australia, which is considering similar legislation. We will also strongly support efforts to bring an EU human rights sanctions regime into effect and we stand ready to co-ordinate with our European partners on future measures. In fact, I discussed that in Berlin recently with our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3">E3</a> partners.</p> <p pid="e663.4/7">Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, with your permission I would like to end by paying tribute to the man who inspired these sanctions, Sergei Magnitsky, a young Russian tax lawyer. Between 2007 and 2008, Magnitsky exposed the theft of $230 million committed by tax officials in Russia&#8217;s own interior ministry. While others left Russia, understandably fearing for their lives, Magnitsky stayed on to take a stand for the rule of law and to strike a blow against the breath-taking corruption that plagues Russia. That courage cost him his life. He was arrested in 2008 on trumped-up charges of tax evasion and, in a particularly Kafkaesque twist, the very tax investigators that Magnitsky had exposed were the ones who turned up to arrest him. The Public Oversight Commission, a Moscow-based non-governmental organisation, found that while in detention Magnitsky was subjected to physical and psychological abuse amounting to torture. Over the course of his time in prison he developed abdominal pain and acute bladder inflammation, but prison officers cruelly withheld the medical treatment he needed. Eventually, he was transferred to another facility ostensibly to receive medical care. Instead, he was handcuffed and beaten to death by riot police with truncheons. He died on <phrase class="date" code="2020-11-16">16 November</phrase> 2009, aged 37.</p> <p pid="e663.4/8"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> will recall that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=199" title="Also referred to as the ECHR, the European Court of Human Rights was..." class="glossary">European Court of Human Rights</a> found Russia had violated its most basic human rights, from the treatment of Magnitsky in prison to the lack of an effective investigation. None of those involved have ever been brought to justice. Perversely, some have been promoted or even decorated with medals. In fact, the only person ever prosecuted for this appalling crime was Sergei Magnitsky himself after his death; Russian&#8217;s first ever posthumous trial.</p> <p pid="e663.4/9">I pay tribute to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Browder">Bill Browder</a>, who employed Sergei Magnitsky and has campaigned for justice ever since his death. I hope that today we in this House show our solidarity with the family that Sergei Magnitsky left behind: his wife Natalia and his son Nikita. I can tell the House that they will be watching from my office in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a> as we speak. Amidst their enduring loss, they can be proud of Sergei&#8217;s courage, which inspires us to hold up a torch on behalf of all those who perished or suffered at the hands of those we designate today and to keep the flame of freedom alive for those brave souls still suffering in the very darkest corners of the world. I commend this statement to the House.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="e665.0/1">May I start by strongly welcoming this statement and the advance sight of it? It has been, as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Browder">Bill Browder</a> rightly said, a long and difficult journey to persuade the Government to take this step. I know that it has been personally frustrating for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> to be repeatedly challenged by me over recent weeks about the delays when he has spent the last eight years as its champion. For too long the UK has been a haven for those who use corruption, torture and murder to further their own ends. Today, I hope, sends a strong message that the UK is not their home and that their dirty money is not welcome here.</p> <p pid="e665.0/2">I pay tribute, too, to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Magnitsky">Sergei Magnitsky</a> and his family, who have waited far too long for this day. Magnitsky worked for a British company, and it is right that, today, in his honour, we start to clean up the global corruption  that he exposed and that cost him his life. I also put on record our support for ensuring that some of those responsible for his murder are the first to face consequences. The time for action against <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Government">Russian Government</a> officials who oppress <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT">LGBT</a> people, Muslims and other minorities and who use chemical weapons on the streets of the UK is long overdue. This is a profound act of solidarity with the Russian people over those who have made their lives a misery for far too long.</p> <p pid="e665.0/3">I welcome, too, the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s action against those involved in the appalling murder of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Khashoggi">Jamal Khashoggi</a>. I gently say to him that, although today is not the day for sparring across the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a>, it would be welcome if it marked the start of a more consistent approach from the Government towards <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, and in particular the arms sales from this country that are being used to harm innocent civilians in Yemen.</p> <p pid="e665.0/4">Similarly, we are grateful to the Foreign Secretary for including the Rohingya in Myanmar in today&#8217;s announcement. I hope that he will use his new remit to consider why the UK investment arm, CDC, continues to invest in those who are complicit in silencing people who speak out against human rights abuses in Myanmar.</p> <p pid="e665.0/5">I welcome the inclusion of trafficking in the measures; the former Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_Auckland">Bishop Auckland</a> would be delighted to see that, as the Government have previously resisted it. I express serious concern, however, that the Foreign Secretary has not yet been able to persuade his colleagues of the need to include corruption in scope. Corruption and human rights abuses go hand in hand and that must be urgently resolved. The former <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron">David Cameron</a>, expressed regret that he had not acted on the issue earlier:</p> <p class="indent" pid="e665.0/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;I soon realised&#8230;the advantages of working together&#8212;with other countries&#8212;under a common heading&#8230;You get extra clout from coming together across the world and saying with one voice to those who are responsible for unacceptable acts: &#8216;We are united&#8217;&#8221;</p> <p pid="e665.0/7">The Foreign Secretary mentioned the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_and_Canada">USA and Canada</a> and our desire to stand closely with them. They have included corruption in scope and the UK must follow suit.</p> <p pid="e665.0/8">Can the Foreign Secretary confirm that the measures apply to UK overseas territories and Crown dependencies? We must not create a back door that allows the laundering of blood money in the United Kingdom.</p> <p pid="e665.0/9">Will all names be published, including those subject to visa bans? I am sorry to do this to the Foreign Secretary, but I refer him to his earlier words. As he put it:</p> <p class="indent" pid="e665.0/10" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;If we are dealing with people who are complicit in torture and there is enough evidence to substantiate and justify a visa ban, what possible countervailing reason can there be, whether it is to change their behaviour or otherwise, for not making their name public? Would not making their name public deter others?&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2020-04-02">2 April</phrase> 2014; Vol. 578, c. 300-301WH.]</p> <p pid="e665.0/11">He also tabled an <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Finances_Act_2017">Criminal Finances Act 2017</a> seeking a public register of people who are subject to such orders, and he rightly set out in that amendment to ensure that third parties could refer to the list. We agree with him. There must be a clear mechanism for civil society to refer in line with the criteria. Can he give us an assurance that that will be forthcoming?</p> <p pid="e665.0/12">Similarly, will the Foreign Secretary reflect on arrangements in the United States that provide a congressional trigger and allow our Select Committee Chairs to make referrals to the list as well? I can see that   the Chair of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a> is nodding; I would expect him to agree with that suggestion. I hope that the Foreign Secretary will agree too.</p> <p pid="e665.0/13">Finally, as the Foreign Secretary has long championed, we must have transparency in the process. There has been serious concern about the influence of big money on politics. It is essential that there is independent oversight of the list to ensure that nobody can buy their way out of British justice. Will he commit to parliamentary scrutiny of the list and the way that decisions are taken? I know that he will face resistance from colleagues, but we will strongly support him in that endeavour.</p> <p pid="e665.0/14">Today is a day that we stand up against corruption and dirty money and for our values with the full support of this House. There can be no ambiguity and no double standards. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> must lead the way at home and abroad.</p>            </div>

Although it is always a pleasure to spar with her, it is also worth reflecting on those occasions when the House can stand in unison and support such measures. I know that the family of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Magnitsky">Sergei Magnitsky</a> will hugely appreciate her personal solidarity at what will be a difficult time, after an incredible and ongoing march for justice. I also agree with the wider support that she expressed for the designations.</p> <p pid="e667.0/2">Let me try to address her queries and concerns. On corruption, work is under way. We are committed to that. There are different definitions of corruption, which has been one of the challenges at international level, but I agree with the point that corruption and human rights abuses are often interlinked. Indeed, in the case of Sergei Magnitsky, what is astonishing is that we have one of the most egregious corruption cases, coupled with an appalling human rights abuse. I reassure the hon. Lady that that work is under way.</p> <p pid="e667.0/3">The hon. Lady asked about the overseas territories and Crown dependencies, to which the legislation will be extended. The designations will be published online, so her plea for transparency is, I believe, fully met. Finally, whether in relation to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committees">Select Committees</a>, scrutiny of the process or the designations, we would welcome a full and rigorous engagement and scrutiny of all that process. I will not, of course, tell Select Committees or the House how to organise their business, but we welcome that and engage with it.</p>            </div>

We have been waiting for a while for excellent foreign policy suggestions, but we have had three in the past three weeks&#8212;one on British national overseas passports last week, and now this on the Magnitsky sanctions. This is another fantastic policy change by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty">Her Majesty</a>&#8217;s Government, and something that <a href="/mp/?p=10761" title="Our page on Chris Bryant - 'the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)'">Chris Bryant</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a> have been clear on for a number of years. Indeed, I know that the hon. Gentleman will have read our &#8220;Moscow&#8217;s Gold&#8221; report of May 2018, in which this was one of the many recommendations. This builds on his earlier work as a human rights lawyer at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a>, and I pay tribute to him twice over.</p> <p pid="e667.1/2">There has been a remarkable silence on human rights violations in China. As yet, there is no announcement on any sanctions against those who are either exploiting  or abusing the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang, or repressing democracy activists in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>. I wonder whether that is merely because this is the first stage of sanctions and the Foreign Office has not quite yet caught up with it, or whether it is a policy change. I also pay tribute to the few words the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> said about co-operation with others. As he knows, sanctions work best when they work with others. Working with our European and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANZUK">CANZUK</a> friends is an important aspect of that.</p> <p pid="e667.1/3">I also pay tribute to two other people who have done incredibly well: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Bullough">Oliver Bullough</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Harding">Luke Harding</a> are two writers who have brought huge amounts of attention to the problems in the UK system, and I thank them for their work.</p>            </div>

I thought he mentioned three foreign policy triumphs, but I felt a bit short-changed because he missed one out. [Interruption] There is plenty of time yet. I thank him for his warm words. We fully respect and engage with scrutiny from that Committee, but it is also good when we can work together and produce results, and today&#8217;s regulations are an example of that. He asked about China, and recently the Human Rights Council led a statement with 27 countries on the human rights situation in Xinjiang, as well as in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>.

Friend will forgive me, I will not pre-empt what the next wave of designations will be, but I assure him that we are already working on them.</p>            </div>

He is entitled to a quiet moment of personal satisfaction today, and it would be remiss not to recognise his role in getting the House and Government to this point. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_SNP">The SNP</a> certainly supports those measures. We would like to see more of them. We called for them repeatedly for a number of years. I have to say, however, that I was surprised to read about them in&#160;the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times">Financial Times</a>&#160;before we heard about them today. That is something that we should all consider about how announcements are made.</p> <p pid="e668.1/2">I will pick up on two aspects of the statement, particularly on international co-operation. It is vital that the measures, welcome as they are, are co-ordinated across other countries&#8212;obviously with the European Union and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a> partners. I would also like a statement from the Foreign Secretary on how they will interact with British overseas territories. There is already a vast array of loopholes to tax transparency and other mechanisms of accountability. This is a welcome step, but how will it work with the other territories where we have some influence?</p> <p pid="e668.1/3">The Foreign Secretary said in his statement that dictators will not be able to launder their blood money in this country. Who would not be able to support that? Progress on the ground, however, suggests that we have an awful lot still to do. I refer him and the House to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Democracy">Open Democracy</a> report published last month that said that</p> <p class="indent" pid="e668.1/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;400,000 British companies do not, will not or cannot say who controls them&#8221;,</p> <p pid="e668.1/5">and, from its own research, Britain has long operated</p> <p class="indent" pid="e668.1/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;as a global hub for financial crime&#8221;.</p> <p pid="e668.1/7">We have a long way to go to build on today&#8217;s announcements. Scotland is not immune to that. Scottish limited companies have been abusing money laundering. We all need to work on this together. I would be grateful for some statements about how the British overseas territories will interact with the measures and, indeed, on the wider financial transparency reform that we need in order to clean up the UK&#8217;s jurisdiction.</p>            </div>

He is right about international co-ordination; the measures will be most effective if we can conjure a groundswell of co-ordinated action, even if we want to be free to assign the designations as and when we see fit based on the evidence. Co-operation with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a> countries, both those that have existing Magnitsky mechanisms in place and those that are working on it, like Australia, is important. Certain EU member states already have them, particularly in the Baltics, I think, but there is no EU-wide human rights regime. Certainly, if it wishes to consider that, that will be an area for strong ongoing co-operation, notwithstanding our departure from the EU.</p> <p pid="e669.0/2">The hon.

Last week started with an expos&#233; from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Parliamentary_Alliance_on_China">Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China</a> regarding the involvement of Chinese officials and Government in the Uyghur suppression, sterilisation and forced encampment, and it ended with their involvement in the stripping away of the rights and freedoms of the people in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, all the way up to the top.</p> <p pid="e669.1/3">I do not expect my right hon.

Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> that would include the repression of democracy and the rights of assembly and of freedom of speech, and therefore look very carefully at whether <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Lam">Carrie Lam</a> should not be on the list.</p>            </div>

These measures would not have come about without the tenacity and advocacy he has consistently put into this area over many years and on a cross-party basis. As I said, this is a first step, and we will consider how we can proceed, but I make no apology for wanting to make the first step a sure-footed one. Just for clarity, the most serious human rights abuses that we have chosen often are used precisely to suppress peaceful protest or freedom of speech. Magnitsky himself was a whistleblower who was tortured for blowing the lid on the biggest tax fraud that we know of in Russian history. I take the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s wider points. We will look to progress, develop, fine-tune and enhance this regime as we proceed.</p>            </div>

If he has not, I commend it to him. I also commend the incredible courage of the people who documented what happened in Chechnya&#8217;s gay purge, so that formal legal action can begin at some point, whether in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=199" title="Also referred to as the ECHR, the European Court of Human Rights was..." class="glossary">European Court of Human Rights</a> or elsewhere. Clearly, there is a case for sanctions on Ramzan Kadyrov, and on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Putin">President Putin</a>, who gives Kadyrov impunity for his actions. This is a jurisdiction that does not criminalise homosexuality, but there are 72 around the world that do, including 34 in the Commonwealth.

All three of the criteria apply in those cases. Will he look closely at my Tibet (Reciprocal Access) Bill, which I shall be re-presenting straight after this statement? It would ensure access by UK officials to investigate human rights abuses in places like Tibet, and if access were denied, there would be repercussions for Chinese officials based on legislation that had unanimous support in Congress. That would be another tool to confront serial abusers of human rights.</p>            </div>

We have the asset-freezing powers in place; the additional element that makes the Magnitsky model is the visa bans. We will look throughout at ways to fine-tune and strengthen the measures. With corruption, the legal definition is an issue. We want to get it right and to avoid all sorts of people bringing litigation against the Government regarding people on the list; we do not want to mis-step in that regard. Also, we want to make sure we have a firm basis for the regime, so that we are not judicially reviewed, so we have started with the clearest and most serious human rights violations. We want to proceed based on evidence and I am certainly open to further consideration of evidence and information, which we will assess independently, from Members in all parts of the House, and to suggestions of other ways to strengthen the regime.</p>            </div>

As a human rights lawyer, he was well placed to see this through. He will be aware that sanctions are designed to be targeted and focused on individuals, and to change and challenge behaviour.

Indeed, sometimes the primary evidence comes through open-source reporting, so that relationship is very important. As I have said to the House already, we will look at strengthening the regime as we go forward. I am not going to second-guess subsequent designations in relation to China or any other country, not least because of the importance, as has already been highlighted, of making sure that we have a rigorous and judicious process leading up to designation.</p>            </div>

We will have a further debate before recess on the terms of the regulations. I think she will see that it is not just  the direct perpetrators who can be captured, but those supporting and in other ways contributing to the human rights abuse. I hope that that will reassure her, but, as I have said, we will be looking to further strengthen the regime&#8212;for example, in relation to corruption&#8212;in the months ahead.</p>            </div>

He was an incredibly courageous man. I think of him as the Solzhenitsyn of his age. To make these sanctions effective, to deter action and to hold people to account, we do need to work closely with our partners. We are one of the first major countries, certainly in Europe, to draw up this regime and start implementing it. There are some other countries doing so, but the EU as a whole has not adopted it yet. I can tell him that the US obviously has a mechanism in place, as do the Canadians, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Parliament">Australian Parliament</a> is also considering it. We are talking with the full range of international partners, and indeed others, because we think that this provides a strong and resilient model for raising human rights and not allowing them to be swept under the carpet, while still engaging in the diplomacy that is required and all the other things that serve the British national interest.</p>            </div>

This has been a personal crusade of his and this is a great moment not just for him, but for the Government and the country as well. May I press him to go a bit further and a bit faster, perhaps, on the points that he has made about fighting corruption and extending these measures to include corruption? He will understand that while many human rights abusers are indeed corrupt, there are many people who are corrupt but who are not necessarily human rights abusers, and therefore we may be able to get people only on corruption charges. Strengthening that element is vital if we are to be able to get people designated on corruption by Christmas.</p>            </div>

Gentleman rather smartly wove in the non-state actor element of these regimes. That is important, because this is not just about perpetrators who come from arms of the state: there are a lot of other people out there, whether from militia, armed groups, various organisations or organised crime, who are aiding and abetting and supporting these human rights abuses, and we need to target all of them.</p>            </div>
