                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>With your permission, Mr. <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, and that of the House, wish to make a statement on the Five-Power Conference on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_East">Far East</a> Defence.</p> <p>
The conference took place at Canberra on 19th and 20th June, 1969. Hon. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members">Members</a> will already have seen the communique issued at the end of the conference and will be aware that it was primarily concerned with practical arrangements for defence co-operation in the area during the period of our rundown and after our withdrawal from our mainland bases in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South-East_Asia">South-East Asia</a> by 31st December, 1971.</p> <p>
Malaysia and Singapore reiterated that the defence of their two countries was indivisible and the conference welcomed the substantial progress made by these two countries and the decisions they have taken to develop their own defence capability. The steps taken by these two Commonwealth countries formed an indispensable background to the work of the conference as, indeed, did the decisions announced earlier this year by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand">Australia and New Zealand</a> to maintain forces in the area after our withdrawal.</p> <p>
The conference approved the work already done by the three Advisory Working Groups during the past year, set them a programme of further work and instituted a new Joint Service Advisory Working Group to deal particularly with matters which affected more than one of the Services.</p> <p>
One particular area of importance on which agreement was reached was that of air defence, where the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Malaysia">Government of Malaysia</a> announced that it had decided to purchase British mobile radar equipment which will enable the present <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force">Royal Air Force</a> station at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hill">Western Hill</a> to be closed in September, 1971. The new Malaysian radar will form an important component in the integrated system for the air defence of Malaysia and Singapore in which the other four Commonwealth countries will participate and for which Australia offered to provide the first Air Defence Commander.</p> <p>
Among other practical matters agreed in principle were the establishment of a Commonwealth Jungle Warfare Centre, arrangements for the 1970 major exercise in which all five countries will participate, and training arrangements for all three Services. The next Five-Power conference will take place some time after the major exercise planned for 1970.</p> <p>
The conference took place on the basic understanding that the United Kingdom maintained its decision to withdraw its forces from the area by the end of 1971. Very considerable progress has been made in the practical steps that need to be taken by the other four Commonwealth countries to establish defence co-operation within the area. The conference was further evidence of the determination to work together for peace and security and firm foundations have been laid for continuing development. Indeed, the

amount of progress that has been made during the past 18 months is remarkable.</p>            </div>

Will the Government adopt the wise suggestion made last week by the right hon.

Finally, will the right hon.

If our forces are to be there most of the time, why cannot they be there all the time?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I cannot help feeling that the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Hexham (Mr. Rippon) tried just a little too hard to make party points.</p> <p>
If I may answer every one of the five questions in turn, the premise on which the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a>'s policy was presented is now accepted by all the Commonwealth countries. One of the most interesting things to me was that there was no interest whatever in the views, so far as they could be understood, put forward by the right hon. Gentleman the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a> on his recent tour of Australia and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_East">Far East</a>.</p> <p>
To answer the next question, there are no ambiguities whatever in Her Majesty's Government's policy. Indeed, if there were, I am surprised that the right hon. Gentleman would attempt to make such polemical party points about it. But the fact is, as he knows quite


well, that we intend to withdraw all our operational forces from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South-East_Asia">South-East Asia</a> by 1971, and this decision is now accepted by the Commonwealth Governments in the area as a firm decision by Britain. No interest whatever was shown to me by anybody to whom I talked in the very ambiguous, obscure, ambivalent and deliberately equivocal statements by the Leader of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a>.</p> <p>
As for the statement by Lord Shepherd at Bangkok, of course it represents the policy of Her Majesty's Government. Right hon. Gentlemen opposite, so far as I am able to judge from reports in HANSARD, did not on this occasion, as on so many others, take the trouble to read what he said. What he said was that we shall have the capability of providing forces in the Far East after our withdrawal from our bases in Singapore and Malaysia if we think that it is in our interests and it is our duty to do so. This has always been the policy of Her Majesty's Government.</p> <p>
On the question of joint exercises, the total cost of all the training programmes after 1971 which I announced in Canberra will be well under &#163;1 million a year, both in foreign exchange and resources. The cost of our military presence, the withdrawal of which has been attacked by the Opposition, was &#163;80 million in foreign exchange alone and several times that amount in resources. Perhaps the House would find it easier to discuss this question if the right hon. and learned Gentleman could give us some idea of what his leader means by a modest presence in the Far East.</p>            </div>

believe that the business of the House would be forwarded more if they did.</p> <p>
What I said is that we are withdrawing all operational forces from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South-East_Asia">South-East Asia</a>. I have always made it clear that we were keeping a garrison in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> and that we were strengthening that garrison when our forces in Singapore and Malaysia were finally withdrawn.</p> <p>
For the hon. Member to talk about the enormous cost of exercises is&#8212;I hesitate to use the word "ludicrous"&#8212;slightly foolish, since the total cost of these exercises and the training will be well under &#163;1 million a year after 1971. This type of training and exercise would have to be carried on somewhere in the world, whether or not some of it is carried on east of Suez.</p>            </div>

I want to stress this point very seriously. We do not propose to keep any forces in the European area after 1971 in a general capability, beyond those that we require for our formal responsibilities for the defence of Europe and the seas around it. This will give us a general capability which we can, with the agreement of our allies, deploy elsewhere. We shall, however, still maintain a garrison in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> which is a constitutional, colonial responsibility, which we retain so long as Hong Kong is a colony.</p>            </div>

Gentleman, whose return to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_I">House I</a> welcome for many reasons, said that we are maintaining a special capability for operations east of Suez. This is precisely what we decided to renounce, but we shall have a general capability in Europe on which we could draw if we regard it in our interests or as our duty to do so for operations east of Suez. This is leaving out the question of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>.</p> <p>
The right hon.

At present, we have a small number of medium and low-rank British officers at the S.E.A.T.O. headquarters on the planning side, some of whom at any rate we would plan to retain there after the end of 1971.</p> <p>
As to the Commonwealth Jungle Warfare Centre, we regard it as necessary to retain jungle warfare training facilities. We are grateful to our four Commonweath partners for agreeing to participate in the running of the school with us. The total number of British personnel involved permanently will amount at the most to a platoon and a small number of administrative staff. We plan to train one battalion twice a year for a period of about eight weeks each at the school, and to train units and sub-units of a smaller size for the rest of the year.</p>            </div>

It is important for the House to know that any capability or commitment which is intended to be maintained in the area after 1971 by countries outside the area, like <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand">Australia and New Zealand</a>, will be strictly reserved for external defence and not for internal security.</p> <p>
Perhaps I might add, in answer to many earlier questions, that the cost of our activities in this area after 1971, as was said by my right hon. Friend the Member for Easington (Mr. Shinwell), will be very small compared with what it has been in the past. But anyone who has read the papers, or, newspapers, or the <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Times">Sunday Times</a></i> report a fortnight ago, on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_Conference">Canberra Conference</a>, will recognise that what we are prepared to do is very much welcomed by all our Commonwealth partners.</p>            </div>
