                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b1362.0/1">My Lords, it is a great pleasure to introduce <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> 76, whose equivalent was moved in Committee but had its inception in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>. The amendment stands in my name and those of the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Patten">Lord Patten</a> of Barnes, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Albans">St Albans</a> and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, so it is an all-party amendment. It affects <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> eligibility for visas for young people; that is, those who were born after 1997, whose parents qualify but they themselves do not. This was in many respects an omission from the original scheme. I declare my interests as a patron of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Watch">Hong Kong Watch</a> and as vice-chair of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Party_Parliamentary_Group">All-Party Parliamentary Group</a> on Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="b1362.0/2">The original plan was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2022-01-31">31 January</phrase> as a bespoke immigration route for BNO status holders and their family members. It was something that we could all welcome, reflecting our moral and historic commitment; and, indeed, it has been a great success, with over 100,000 applications made to date. However, some 18 to 24 year-olds were unable to access this route. as your Lordships know, this amendment would enable individuals born on or after <phrase class="date" code="2022-07-01">1 July</phrase> 1997 who have at least one BNO parent to apply to the route. As I said, the amendment had its genesis in the House of Commons. I pay particular tribute to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=214" title="Right Honourable is a form of address used within the House of Commons, for..." class="glossary">right honourable</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Green">Damian Green</a> for the work that he put into it, but also to the support of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_May">Lady May</a> and other notable members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party">Conservative Party</a>, as well as the support of the Commons from all Benches on all sides, so this is bipartisan, and bicameral as well.</p> <p pid="b1362.0/3">I pay a special tribute to and thank the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, who has already been congratulated quite a lot today on her notable elevation to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=9" title="The Privy Council goes back to the earliest days of the Monarchy, when it..." class="glossary">Privy Council</a>&#8212;perhaps because of what she did on this amendment. She and her noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Sharpe">Lord Sharpe</a> have engaged very much with those who have signed this amendment. He has significant experience in Hong Kong, so this was close to his heart.</p> <p pid="b1362.0/4">The noble Lord, Lord Patten of Barnes, made a very memorable speech in Committee, which was followed by many people in Hong Kong, let alone in this country, and it says an awful lot that someone who has held such high office in the past is willing to commit so strongly to this, to show that his affection and commitment to the people of Hong Kong remain completely unchanged. Like me, he continues to be concerned about those who will not qualify for this scheme, but that is not the point of the amendment. It is something that others must step up to the plate to do something  about, but I hope especially that those living in other Commonwealth countries can follow the example that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a> have set in issuing a Written Statement which was the upshot of conversations that we had in Committee; the Government</p> <p class="indent" pid="b1362.0/5">&#8220;intend to lay the changes to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Rules">Immigration Rules</a> in September with the changes expected to go live in October&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b1362.0/6">The Written Statement also details the welcome programme led by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Levelling_Up,_Housing_and_Communities">Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities</a>. Its tone and what it says at the end I particularly welcome:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b1362.0/7">&#8220;We look forward to welcoming applications from those individuals who wish to make the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> their home&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b1362.0/8">The Government have taken a positive approach. They have engaged constructively, and this decision is worthy of this country and its special relationship with Hong Kong. It will allow young <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kongers">Hong Kongers</a> who were not eligible for a BNO visa to avoid languishing in the asylum system, unable to work or study. This change of policy will allow these young people to settle more quickly and enrich British society.</p> <p pid="b1362.0/9">I do not need to say very much more, other than to comment on one development in Hong Kong this week which underlines why life has become so difficult for people such as Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and others to whom we referred in Committee. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Harris">Paul Harris</a>, the former chair of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Bar_Association">Hong Kong Bar Association</a> and a veteran human rights barrister, and a man of great standing, has had to leave Hong Kong after police questioned him. It marks another dark day for human rights and the rule of law in Hong Kong. His steadfast defence of Hong Kong&#8217;s beleaguered democracy and his <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> to the draconian national security law provoked the ire of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party">Chinese Communist Party</a> and made him a marked man. For those young people who joined many of the protests and demonstrations, this scheme will literally be a lifeline. I hope that we will then use our standing to convince other countries to follow our example and do the same by extending these lifeboat provisions to enable settlement&#8212;other Commonwealth countries especially, such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia,_New_Zealand">Australia, New Zealand</a> and Canada, which already have significant communities of people drawn from Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="b1362.0/10">I hope that I have been relatively brief, since the House has a lot of other business to accomplish. I beg to move Amendment 76.</p>            </div>

It may have been obvious that I have been able to contain my enthusiasm during much of the discussion of this Bill to within the bounds of public decorum, but on this occasion I want to say without any reservation how strongly I support what the Government have done.</p> <p pid="b1363.0/2">We have a continuing moral responsibility to the people of Hong Kong. Hong Kong has been hit by a mendacious Government in Beijing&#8212;including Mr Putin&#8217;s best friend, we are now told&#8212;who have set about comprehensively and vindictively destroying the freedoms of a great and open society. It is particularly appropriate that we have recognised some of those who have been more affected, particularly with the charges that have  been levelled at them in recent weeks around civil disobedience and freedom of speech. This <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> and the proposals of the Government will help those who have been most affected: the younger <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kongers">Hong Kongers</a> who are the children of people already able to get a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> passport but who unfortunately are in the group born after 1997. It is a very important amendment. I am delighted that the Government have accepted it and that they continue to assert our continuing moral responsibility for Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="b1363.0/3">I expect, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said in our earlier debate, that the young people who come here will make a really significant contribution to this country. One day, I hope, they will be able to return to Hong Kong as a free society. That is not entirely in our hands, though the more we behave like a liberal democracy that believes in liberal democracy, the more likely it is to happen.</p> <p pid="b1363.0/4">I am delighted that I am able on this occasion to say how much I support what the Government have done, and I look forward to doing so on many future occasions&#8212;there have not been quite enough in the past. Maybe that has been my fault or maybe the fault has lain elsewhere, but that is a subjective judgment. I thank the Government very much and hope they will continue to be as open-minded and gracious in the way they respond to good arguments.</p>            </div>

I am in the rare position of congratulating the Government very warmly and thanking them for listening to campaigners, including on their own Benches, in taking this step for the younger people of Hong Kong who have at least one <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> passport-holding parent. I also join the noble Lord, Lord Alton, in congratulating the Government on the welcome programme for the BNO passport holders coming here. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APPG">APPG</a> heard from the noble Lord, Lord Greenhalgh, this week and we appreciated his enthusiastic words on that programme.</p> <p pid="b1364.0/2">I will make one extra point. The all-party group held an inquiry into the treatment of young medics and humanitarian workers in Hong Kong during protests. Those young people had to have their voices disguised to testify to us. I remember one of them, who as he was talking to us on the Zoom call was glancing at the door, saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if the police will come through that door at this moment.&#8221; I have no doubt that some of those young people speaking to us had parents who were BNO passport holders, but some of them did not, yet they were young people who had made similar contributions to that society. My simple question to the Government is: will they in future, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton said, work with Commonwealth countries to see that all of those young people who have made brave contributions to democracy and the rule of law in Hong Kong are able to find a route out if they need to?</p>            </div>
