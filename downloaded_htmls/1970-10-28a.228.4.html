We set ourselves three objectives: to enable Britain to resume within her resources a proper share of responsibility for the preservation of peace and stability in the world; to make good, so

far as possible, the deficiencies we found in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces">Armed Forces</a> and to create a better appreciation of their r&#244;le; and to establish a sound financial basis for defence plans in the future.</p> <p>
Following a searching and critical review of the defence programme we inherited, we have taken a number of major decisions. N.A.T.O. remains the first priority, but these decisions reflect the Government's determination that Britain should also play her part in countering threats to stability outside the N.A.T.O. area. They cover a continuing British military presence in the Malaysia and Singapore area; major improvements in the capabilities of each Service; and, as my right hon. Friend announced yesterday, defence budget targets for the next four years.</p> <p>
First, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South-East_Asia">South-East Asia</a>. We have proposed to the Commonwealth Governments of Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Singapore that five-Power defence arrangements should be established as soon as possible, to which we would contribute forces from the three Services which would broadly complement the contributions of the other four Governments. These arrangements would be based on a political commitment of a consultative nature, undertaken equally by all five Governments, relating to the defence of Malaysia and Singapore; they would replace the Anglo-Malaysian Defence Agreement.</p> <p>
The four Governments have welcomed our planned military contribution. The main components of this will be a number of frigates or destroyers, a battalion group, a detachment of Nimrod long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft and some Whirlwind helicopters. The four Governments have agreed to work out with us the new political arrangements. Consultation on this, and on other aspects of our proposals, is now taking place. We have proposed that there should be a meeting next year of the Ministers of the five Governments.</p> <p>
We are continuing discussions with leaders in the Gulf and other interested countries on how Britain can best contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability in the area.</p> <p>
Next, the capabilities of the Services. We found the Services deficient in both manpower and equipment. The Royal


Navy would have been left with a most serious gap in its capability as a result of the plan of the previous Administration to phase out the fixed-wing aircraft carriers in 1972. We have, therefore, decided to introduce as soon as possible a surface-launched anti-ship guided-weapon system, EXOCET. This system is in an advanced stage of development by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Government">French Government</a>, with whom we are now negotiating an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-French">Anglo-French</a> collaborative programme for its production.</p> <p>
We have also decided to run on H.M.S. "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ark_Royal">Ark Royal</a>" until the late 1970s, thus contributing a valuable increase to N.A.T.O's maritime strength. This decision will not prejudice the gradual assumption by the Royal Air Force of the responsibility for the provision of fixed-wing air support for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy">Royal Navy</a>.</p> <p>
<a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">The Army</a>, as a result of poor recruitment in recent years, is seriously short of the men it needs. The rundown plan of the previous Administration failed to provide adequately for unforeseen contingencies and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_and_Army_Volunteer_Reserve">Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve</a> has been reduced to a level where there is no longer any uncommitted element. As the demands of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> situation have shown, the Army's infantry resources are especially under strain.</p> <p>
The Government have already announced their decision to halt the rundown of the Army to the extent that the manpower shortage permits. Their plans for representative squadron and company units will provide a nucleus for potential expansion and enable the names of a number of famous regiments to be retained.</p> <p>
We have now decided to retain the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigade_of_Gurkhas">Brigade of Gurkhas</a>, whose future was put in doubt by the previous Administration. The retention of these splendid soldiers in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army">British Army</a> will help to relieve the strain on the infantry.</p> <p>
We are also embarking on a gradual expansion of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAVR">TAVR</a> by establishing an uncommitted reserve of initially about 10,000 men, armed with modern equipment though on lighter scales than existing TAVR units. We shall be opening discussions immediately with the Council of Territorial, Auxiliary and

Volunteer Reserve Associations and with the associations themselves.</p> <p>
In addition, we intend to increase our contribution of reserve forces to N.A.T.O. by forming an additional TAVR armoured car regiment.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_Air_Force">The Royal Air Force</a> is short of frontline aircraft, particularly in Germany. We have decided to provide a further four squadrons of Jaguar close-support aircraft for N.A.T.O. in this important r&#244;le. This will be achieved by reorganising our plans for the advanced training of pilots, without reducing the essentially high standard of training, and by revising our plans for the production of Jaguar aircraft.</p> <p>
More information about these decisions is set out in a <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> presented today. They will have to be worked out within the constraints imposed by the current serious shortage of uniformed manpower; and within defence budget targets which, although higher than the provisional allocations to defence published last year by the previous Administration, will make a valuable contribution towards the Government's public expenditure objectives.</p> <p>
We shall not, however, be cancelling any major project now on order; but savings to be made will require us to cut or defer a number of projects of lesser priority mainly in the building and equipment field. The Government are satisfied that these reductions will not affect their ability to meet their planned commitments.</p> <p>
There is much work to be done to put these changes into effect. We are also still examining parts of the defence programme; and the streamlining of the headquarters and the introduction of improved management techniques will continue.</p> <p>
I shall be making a fuller report in the annual Defence <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper">White Paper</a> early next year. But the decisions we have already taken will enable us to make a significant improvement in our military contribution to N.A.T.O. while, at the same time, fulfilling our obligations to our Commonwealth partners in South-East Asia. I also believe that they clearly demonstrate the importance which this Government attach to the security of the nation and the high value we place on our Armed Forces.</p>            </div>

Is he aware, therefore, that in the light of this we are very glad within 100 days to have converted the Government to 95 per cent. of the historic shift that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> brought about in Britain's east-of-Suez presence?

May I ask the Minister a number of specific questions? Is he aware that the party opposite promised that it would go away from fixed ceilings? Is it not going back to this? Is not the ceiling fixed by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=99" title="The chancellor of the exchequer is the government's chief financial..." class="glossary">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> yesterday a ceiling which means that, instead of spending more on defence, a smaller proportion of the gross national product will be spent on defence?</p> <p>
What we would like to know, therefore, and what is not contained in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper">White Paper</a>, is what economy the Government will make&#8212;it should be spelled out and costed&#8212;to meet the extra costs, modest in the case of Malaysia and Singapore, but more substantial in the case of EXOCET and of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Army">Territorial Army</a>. There again, the Government spoke about 25,000 and are now down, I think, to a figure of 10,000.</p> <p>
Can the Minister tell us a bit more about the "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ark_Royal">Ark Royal</a>"? Is it really intended to keep a carrier force of one aircraft carrier? What is the military usefulness of this, especially when it is now so old as to require a great deal of maintenance? What effect will this have on naval manpower? Will it mean having to put frigates into "mothballs"?</p> <p>
Does the Minister have the agreement of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Nepal">Government of Nepal</a> about the new plans which he has announced for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigade_of_Gurkhas">Brigade of Gurkhas</a>?

Have we not had many examples during the past five years of the mistake of making firm pledges on defence expenditure five years ahead?</p> <p>
My noble Friend has not mentioned the Commando brigade, Commando carriers, and assault ships. Are these to be deployed east of Suez or in the Mediterranean?</p>            </div>

I echo entirely the words of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Toxteth (Mr. Crawshaw) about the territorial reserves, but I believe that, in this country, there is an enormous reservoir of people who want to give voluntary service to the community. With the plans we will implement after discussion with the territorial associations, I am confident our initial objective of 10,000 members of the reserves will be met.</p>            </div>

In fact, the right hon.

Friend one specific question. My noble Friend referred to the retention of regimental names. Can he give some indication of the future of the Third Royal Green Jackets, of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyll_and_Sutherland_Highlanders">Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders</a> and of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Hampshire_Regiment">Royal Hampshire Regiment</a>? Two of them have been reduced to only 120 officers and men instead of being abolished completely&#8212;and it was preferable to retain them. Is it intended to expand those regiments to normal battalion strength during the next few years?</p>            </div>

These regiments were to have been disbanded altogether by the previous Administration.
