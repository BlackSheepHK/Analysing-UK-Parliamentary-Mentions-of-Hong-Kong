I will deal with the main subjects in order&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>First, I shall deal with the environment. The meeting agreed a statement&#8212;the Langkawi declaration&#8212;setting out a Commonwealth programme of action to deal with the main environmental problems facing the world. Particular points to which I would draw attention are the commitment to take more account of environmental considerations in reaching economic decisions, the support expressed for existing international environmental organisations, especially the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a> environment programme, the endorsement of the United Kingdom's initiative calling for the negotiation of an international framework convention on global climate change and the encouragement given to developing countries to improve the management of their rain forests, which is very important to arrest the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p> <p>
Our particular concern in the debate on these issues was that any additional resources should not go to creating new bureaucracies, but directly to measures to protect and improve the environment. This concern is fully met in the Commonwealth's statement. The Langkawi declaration is a major achievement for the Commonwealth and particularly for our Malaysian chairman, Dr. Mahathir, on whose initiative it was drafted.</p> <p>
Secondly, I shall deal with southern Africa. Heads of Government issued a statement entitled "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Africa">Southern Africa</a>: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_Ahead">The Way Ahead</a>", which marks a significant step forward on a number of points from earlier Commonwealth statements. It recognises that important changes are under way in South Africa, that sanctions ought not to be punitive and that, if sufficient political progress is made in South Africa, the process of relaxing some of the international restrictions against South Africa should begin. This is the first time that the entire Commonwealth

has adopted this approach. I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> for the skilful manner in which he negotiated those improvements.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth">The Commonwealth</a> statement also contains four main points with which the United Kingdom does not agree and our disagreement is explicitly stated on the face of the document, but without explaining either the view we take or the reasons for it. It was to fill that gap that my right hon. Friend and I decided to issue a separate statement setting out Britain's views on those points. A copy of the statement has been <a href="/glossary/?gl=252" title="This phrase is often used in written answers to indicate that a minister..." class="glossary">placed in the Library</a> of the House.</p> <p>
We believe that the approach set out in our document is the more positive and constructive one and takes more account of the significant changes that are actually happening in South Africa, including the decision taken by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Government">South African Government</a> during the Commonwealth meeting that a major <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress">African National Congress</a> rally may be held for the first time in 30 years, and addressed by Mr. Sisulu. In the light of this and other recent steps, our aim must surely be to reward progress and encourage South Africa further down the path of reform, rather than to respond with more punitive sanctions.</p> <p>
We made it clear in our statement that, instead of making a financial contribution to the proposed agency to report on South Africa's international financial links or to the continuing work of the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on South Africa, we shall make available an equivalent amount of money for additional help to black <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africans">South Africans</a>. I would remind the House of the substantial sums that the United Kingdom is already making available for such help, as well as to the front-line states.</p> <p>
Our statement also announces our willingness to provide financial help to an independent Namibia as well as&#8212;if asked&#8212;military training for Namibia's armed forces after independence. We of course give similar help to Zimbabwe, Mozambique and many other Commonwealth countries in Africa.</p> <p>
Thirdly, Heads of Government had a discussion of the Commonwealth in the 1990s and beyond. They decided to set up a group of Heads of Government&#8212;of which Britain will be part&#8212;to identify the enlarged roles that the Commonwealth might need to play. We welcome that.</p> <p>
Fourthly, we discussed the problem of drugs, recognising the very serious threat that they posed in all our countries and the consequent need for training&#8212;particularly for smaller states&#8212;in customs procedures, law enforcement, in methods of detection, in education and in treatment of addicts. I expressed the hope that by the time of our next meeting in 1991 a large number of Commonwealth countries would have concluded bilateral agreements on freezing and confiscating the assets of drug smugglers. Britain has taken a lead both in the Commonwealth and more widely in concluding such agreements. We have now signed 10 of them, the last one of which was in Malaysia.</p> <p>
Fifthly, the meeting elected <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Emeka_Anyaoku">Chief Emeka Anyaoku</a> as the new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_Commonwealth">Secretary-General of the Commonwealth</a>. He has lived in Britain for many years and is a great friend of our country. The whole House will wish him well</p> <p>
I would draw attention to four further points in the final communiqu&#233;. The first, was a most welcome reference to the importance of Hong Kong's continued success, and a commitment to assist in any way possible in promoting


the continued prosperity of Hong Kong. That was a major British objective at the meeting and will, I believe, offer welcome reassurance to Hong Kong's people.</p> <p>
The second was the reaffirmation of the need for speedy action to deal with the problem of Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong, including as a matter of priority the return to Vietnam of all those who do not qualify as genuine refugees.</p> <p>
The third was a recognition of the need to increase aviation security world wide, particularly important in the wake of the Lockerbie disaster&#8212;<i>[interruption]</i></p>            </div>

The fourth was a call on all Commonwealth Governments to accede to or ratify international covenants on human rights, which a surprising number have regrettably not yet done.</p> <p>
Despite the difference of views on South Africa, this was a valuable and successful meeting and its success owes much to the very skilful chairmanship of <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> Mahathir.</p> <p>
We have disagreed before on South Africa within the Commonwealth, indeed many times, but this has not damaged our relations with individual Commonwealth countries or the institution itself. The Government will persevere with their present policy on South Africa, because it offers the best prospect of peaceful negotiations and of achieving a new South Africa which will inherit a strong economy.</p>            </div>

May I also take this opportunity to welcome the whole of the constructive communiqu&#233; from the Heads of Government meeting in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a> and regret that the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> could not do the same thing?</p> <p>
The Kuala Lumpur meeting exposed discrepancies in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a>'s approach. On the environment, for instance, is it not clear that the Prime Minister's professions of concern for the global environment have yet again been equalled only by her resistance to backing that concern with practical commitments? On overseas aid, the Prime Minister pledged in the Kuala Lumpur communiqu&#233; to make
<q>renewed commitment and effort to meet the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a> aid target</q>
of 0&#183;7 per cent. of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNP">GNP</a>. How does the Prime Minister reconcile that with the Government's record of cutting overseas aid to 0&#183;3 per cent. of GNP during their time in office?</p> <p>
I turn now to the issue of sanctions against apartheid. In Kuala Lumpur, the Prime Minister put her signature to a Commonwealth agreement which her <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> helped to compile and which she herself proposed for adoption, which states:
<q>this is not the time to consider any relaxation of existing sanctions and pressures &#8230; all existing sanctions and measures should be maintained.</q>
How can the Prime Minister reconcile that with her action a short time later when she put out a statement, apparently

without reference to her Foreign Secretary, which was hostile to all sanctions and which stated that the effect of such sanctions would be to "increase resistance to change"? Is that not a gross inconsistency? Would it not be more honest if in future the Prime Minister were to sign all international agreements with invisible ink&#8212;[HON. MEMBERS: "Rubbish."] No, it is true&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>With regard first to the right hon. Gentleman's comments about the global environment, he is aware that this Government have done more to protect the environment than any previous Government; that we have committed the sum of &#163;2 billion to get rid of sulphur dioxide in coal in power stations; that this year, for example, we are spending &#163;1&#183;3 billion on improved water and sewerage, whereas the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> cut such expenditure; that we have the best record in Europe on rivers that flow into the North sea, and so on and so forth. We hosted the ozone layer conference. We are committed to reduce substantially the amount of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFCs">CFCs</a> and to move to a 100 per cent. reduction, provided that the relevant research has produced proper alternative substitutes. It was our proposal to have a global convention on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO">CO</a><sub>2</sub> and the greenhouse effect&#8212;a proposal which was taken up by other nations. On the environment, the Labour party cannot touch this Government's record&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i>&#8212;and nor can many other people.</p> <p>
On the right hon. Gentleman's totally inaccurate comments on our document on sanctions, I must advise him that my right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> actually wrote part of that document, so for the right hon. Gentleman to say that my right hon. Friend did not even see it is to be just about as plum stupid as anyone can get. That document was in response to the four parts of the original document with which we disagreed on the face of the document. We thought it best to set out the reasons for our disagreement in writing, so that people could not quarrel with them.</p> <p>
As for the right hon. Gentleman's general proposals on sanctions, I remind him that the Labour party, when in power, said before the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a>:
<q>We voted against comprehensive sanctions together with France, West Germany, the United States and some other Western countries because we do not agree that the far-reaching economic measures which the resolution calls for would produce the changes in South Africa which we would all like to see.</q>
That was said on 16 January 1978 by the hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merthyr_Tydfil">Merthyr Tydfil</a> and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands), and the


right hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Sparkbrook">Birmingham, Sparkbrook</a> (Mr. Hattersley). The right hon. Gentleman also said, in the <i>Official Report </i>for 7 July 1976:
<q>I do not believe that a policy of general economic sanctions would be in the interests either of the British people or of South Africa."&#8212;[<i>Official Report,</i> 7 July 1976; Vol. 914, c. 1354.]</q>
Moreover, perhaps the right hon. Gentleman should read <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_Tutu">Archbishop Tutu</a> on sanctions when it was proposed that they should be actively imposed on Panama:
<q>These sanctions have led to the destruction of the country's economy, caused immense suffering on the poorest of the poor, increased unemployment and aggravated social problems. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of Panamanians are opposed to sanctions. These sanctions inflict a double oppression on the people of Panama.</q>
Finally, two out of three black <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africans">South Africans</a>, when asked whether sanctions would cause unemployment and whether they wanted them, said no. It is this Government who are in step with the people of black South Africa, not the right hon. Gentleman.</p>            </div>

I have not heard what the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC">BBC</a> said, but what he says gives extra support to the path that we took of making our views absolutely clear in writing. That was much better than giving unattributable briefings, as many other Heads of Government did. Some of them made speeches in public at the opening session of the Commonwealth conference clearly setting out their views. They are therefore not at liberty to criticise us for setting out ours. They must not deny to others the freedom of speech that they adopt for themselves.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I thank the right hon. Gentleman for what he has said about Hong Kong. Singapore has

given about 25,000 certificates to people in Hong Kong. They are not to be taken up immediately but holders may have citizenship of Singapore and not go there for some years. I know that that has been a great comfort to many such people. Some people from Hong Kong have taken houses in Australia and Canada. I think that in the case of Canada people have left Hong Kong to take up residence in cities such as Vancouver. Some reassurance is needed for people in Hong Kong whose residence there is vital for the future prosperity of Hong Kong. They need to be given some assurance that they may leave if things should turn out very badly in order that they may stay there to help Hong Kong to keep its prosperous standing. We hope to bring proposals forward by about the turn of the year.</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman is totally and utterly wrong about sanctions. We have made clear our abhorrence of apartheid and did so in the statement. We not only oppose sanctions but give practical help to black <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africans">South Africans</a> and to the front-line states. For example, we are supporting financially about 1,000 black South Africans on graduate or postgraduate work. We also support black South Africans who wish to purchase houses and special housing for black South Africans. We have given about &#163;1&#183;1 billion to the front-line states so that they may be better able to deal with their economic problems.</p> <p>
We note that some of those who are most ardent about sanctions do not impose them. I find utterly repugnant the fact that the only way the trade sanctions can work is by being punitive on black South Africans. I gave a specific example of a pineapple canning factory that closed a few days ago; because it no longer had the demand from Canada and the United States it was not able to keep going. That put 40 white South Africans out of work&#8212;and 1,100 black South Africans. That will please the right hon. Gentleman, but it does not please me.</p>            </div>

When South Africa gets its constitution reformed and a new Government, that Government will inherit a strong economy. For that there will be one country in the Commonwealth that it can thank&#8212;Britain.</p>            </div>

I should add that before the Commonwealth conference ended&#8212;and it ended very amicably, as one would expect&#8212;barely was the ink dry on the communiqu&#233; than I received a letter from a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_Government">Head of Government</a> of an African country saying that if the financial sanctions that the rest of them had agreed actually worked, it would be very tough on his country and would make things much worse, and could he please have extra aid to deal with it.

Therefore, will she dismiss the synthetic indignation on this subject as the cant that it is? My right hon. Friend enjoys the strongest support in this country for the robust line that she took in the face of the hypocritical pressure on sanctions. Will she tell some of her colleagues in the Commonwealth that if the Commonwealth desires to turn itself into an international tribunal of human rights, there are a great many better targets, from China to Peru and including one or two in the Commonwealth, which might better repay their attention?</p>            </div>

If they do not work, it is because other countries take up the trade. To some extent, that has already happened in South Africa. Our share of the trade in South Africa is less than it was, and Germany and Japan have taken up that trade. If they do work, they work by punishing the most vulnerable&#8212;as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_Tutu">Archbishop Tutu</a> said about Panama&#8212;and making them suffer poverty and even starvation in a country with no social security.</p> <p>
I find it repugnant that people at the Commonwealth conference should sit round a table, having been entertained in excellent hotels with excellent facilities, and decide who will suffer poverty and starvation in another country. We support Operation Hunger, which is aimed at relieving poverty in South Africa. It is absurd that other people in the Commonwealth are trying to magnify what we are trying to relieve.</p>            </div>

that they do not have to go through South Africa. In addition, we are providing military training in Zimbabwe. When I went there recently, there was an unusual occasion when I went to the eastern highlands and, with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Mugabe">President Mugabe</a> on one side and President Chissano on the other, watched British military officers training the Zimbabwean army and the Mozambican army. That is considerable extra help.</p> <p>
Few countries have reached the target of 0&#183;7 per cent. of aid. However, the amount of private investment from this country to other Commonwealth countries is considerable, and one of the highest. It would be higher still if some were to take off some of the central planning and control that prevents a good deal of investment from going to their countries.</p>            </div>

Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has said about that assistance. May I express my profound admiration for her cheerfulness and for the moral courage which she exhibited in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a>?</p> <p>
I suggest that when the agenda for the next Commonwealth conference is prepared, my right hon. Friend suggests to the new secretary-general that he places three documents before all the delegates. The first, if I may say so, is the wonderful cartoon that she and I and those of our generation will remember when Low published it in the <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evening_Standard">Evening Standard</a></i>in June 1940&#8212;"Very well, then&#8212;alone!" I suggest that the second document should be the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International">Amnesty International</a> report, which should be left open at the page marked "India" for all those concerned to see. Finally, may he lay before all the delegates the wonderful speech which was made by Burke in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> just over 200 years ago when he reminded the House that there was no way known to him in which one could "condemn an whole people"?</p>            </div>

I am grateful to him for the confirmation that he gives that our approach of alleviating problems of black <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africans">South Africans</a> is one of practical help and not of posturing. I notice that many of the states in Africa that demand comprehensive sanctions do not apply them themselves. There are, for example, no airlines flying from the United States directly to South Africa, but they fly to the capitals in black Africa, from where the passengers are then promptly flown down to Johannesburg. That hardly seems to be doing what they are preaching.</p>            </div>

We have been very generous, and will continue to be, in

helping Zimbabwe&#8212;I made that perfectly clear&#8212;both with military training and with aid. I do wish sometimes that people would not use some of the language that they do, which tempts one to reply in the same coin. I did not, in fact.</p> <p>
At the same time I expressed to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Mugabe">President Mugabe</a> considerable sympathy with the difficulties that he is in over the ivory ban. There are far too many elephants in Zimbabwe, and they have to cull them, which they do very well. They finance that operation by selling the ivory from the elephants which are properly culled. President Mugabe does not lack support from me in the things which I agree he is doing extremely well.</p>            </div>

Therefore, are not her protestations that she has been exercising free speech and clarification quite preposterous?</p> <p>
Is the right hon.

That is quite clear. Is not the reason for all that the fact that she has a secret agenda with de Klerk, and that her part of that agenda is to prevent change taking place? She makes so much noise about people losing their jobs, but is she aware that people in South Africa are afraid of losing their lives&#8212;or perhaps that is what she prefers?</p>            </div>

I do not necessarily envisage a new role, but the Commonwealth exists on the basis of principles set down in the Singapore declaration in 1971, and those are the principles of freedom under a rule of law and democracy. The 48 and 49 of us co-operate closely on many matters, especially those mentioned by my hon. Friend such as scientific and technical co-operation and the advice upon education and other matters that we give. We also girdle the world and so have an instant way of seeking local views on any matter which may arise anywhere in the world.</p> <p>
One of the most impressive things about the Commonwealth conference is that it is the only big international conference that I attend which requires no translation or interpretation of any kind, making the debate active, without rancour and very clear. Such an organisation has a great future ahead.</p>            </div>

feet and go to work in South Africa in order to get a better living there and they remit a good deal of their earnings to the front-line states. If the economy of South Africa were to collapse, the economies of the front-line states would quickly follow. It is important to keep that economy strong and not to cause more poverty. Britain relieves the people who are being fed under Operation Hunger at a cost of &#163;1&#183;3 million and tries to reduce the hardship there; other people seem to wish to increase it.</p>            </div>
