This morning, Hong Kong time, a group of 51 boat people were returned to Vietnam by aircraft from Hong Kong. All 51 had been screened under a thorough process agreed with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> and they did not qualify for refugee status under the terms of the 1951 United Nations convention on refugees and the 1967 protocol. The repatriation was conducted in line with procedures used worldwide to remove people refused permission to remain in a territory. No firearms were carried. No force was used.</p> <p>
At the international conference on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Chinese">Indo-Chinese</a> refugees in Geneva in June, the international community agreed that refugees would be resettled in other countries, and that those who did not qualify as refugees would not be resettled and should return to Vietnam. I stress that the criteria for establishing who qualifies as a refugee are not decided by Britain, or by the Hong Kong authorities alone, but by agreement with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR">UNHCR</a>.</p> <p>
We, and the UNHCR, have tried, as the House knows, to encourage the boat people to return to Vietnam voluntarily. In the past year more than 600 have done so, but, during the same period, more than 30,000 have arrived in Hong Kong. In all there are nearly 57,000 boat people in Hong Kong, most of whom are not likely to qualify as refugees. The Vietnamese have recently agreed to accept volunteers back at a faster rate, but it is clear that voluntary returns alone will not match the scale of the problem. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of volunteers so far have come from the people not yet screened; of those already screened and found not to qualify as refugees, fewer than 1 per cent. are volunteering to return.</p> <p>
We have therefore had to begin repatriating those who are not refugees and who do not volunteer. The international community have said that they will not resettle those people. If they were not returned to Vietnam, they would therefore face the prospect of indefinite detention in camps in Hong Kong. There is another matter of great importance&#8212;unless it is made clear to people in Vietnam that those who do not qualify as refugees will be returned to Vietnam, Hong Kong faces the prospect of tens of thousands more arrivals in 1990. That is simply not an acceptable prospect.</p> <p>
The arrangements for repatriation have, like those for voluntary returns, been agreed in negotiation with the Vietnamese Government. Vietnam has told us that those who are repatriated will not be punished for leaving. We have given aid to be used to help those being repatriated to settle back into Vietnam.</p> <p>
As the House would expect I have paid attention to monitoring to ensure that those who return are in no way ill treated. Our embassy in Hanoi will be monitoring their conditions both in the transit camp in Hanoi to which they immediately return, and in the villages to which they are returned, as it has been doing for volunteers.</p> <p>
We hope that the UNHCR will agree to help, as he now helps people returning to Laos from Thailand. We would welcome the co-operation of non-governmental organisations.</p> <p>
In the meantime, I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) and the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Ennals">Lord Ennals</a>, who have agreed to go to Vietnam next month as independent observers to report to me on the conditions of those who were repatriated earlier today.</p> <p>
There are still about 40,000 Vietnamese in the camps in Hong Kong who are not qualified as refugees. As I have already mentioned, there is a serious risk of as many thousands arriving next year. That is a serious situation. We shall now be discussing with the Vietnamese Government how to ensure in future the swift and safe return of those who are not refugees. We will talk about ways in which we can help Vietnam to take people back at a faster rate&#8212;both volunteers and those who are repatriated. We will discuss how we can help those who return to be reintegrated into Vietnam. We shall talk, as we have to, about ways to screen new arrivals quickly as they reach Hong Kong so that those who are not refugees can be returned quickly and safely to Vietnam. Those who are refugees will, as at present, be allowed to await resettlement in the West. We shall work hard to find way to check the inflow of Vietnamese into Hong Kong next year, and seek international co-operation on this at the next meeting of the Geneva conference steering committee in January.</p> <p>
I know that there is intense interest in the House in this issue. I believe that my right hon. and learned Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_President">Lord President</a> intends to announce that there will be a day for debates on the Estimates on Tuesday 19 December. This will include a half-day debate on class <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II">II</a>, vote 2, so far as it relates to the accommodation and repatriation of Vietnamese boat people. No further repatriations will take place before that debate.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>It is clear that the hon. Member likes the idea of the 3 o'clock knock by the police. The Government have adopted the policy of the 3 o'clock knock by the police.</p> <p>
Why was the operation carried out under cover of darkness and under the veil of a news blackout? If, as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> says, force was ruled out, why were 150 riot police, equipped with riot helmets, shields and batons, needed to remove 51 people of whom 43 were children and women? Are those really the procedures that are used worldwide to which the right hon. Gentleman has just referred?</p> <p>
Who was responsible for organising and executing this operation? How many among those persons are now claiming that they need the right of abode in the United Kingdom to protect their human rights? If the Government are so satisfied with what they are doing, why did they not invite <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International">Amnesty International</a>, the United Nations Commission for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights">Human Rights</a> or some other internationally recognised organisation to be present when the asylum seekers were removed?</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman referred to screening procedures. Why is there no independent process of appeal for screening procedures? Why are appellants not allowed to put their case personally? Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that such shortcomings do not accord with the concept of the rule of law? If the Government object to free


movement from Communist countries by what they call economic migrants, why were they a signatory to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki_Final_Act">Helsinki Final Act</a> which embodied such principles in Europe? Why did the Government applaud the movement of such migrants from East to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany">West Germany</a> before the opening of the Berlin wall? What is the basis of the Government's discrimination between migrants from different Communist countries in different continents?</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman says that the Vietnamese Government have given assurances about the treatment of returning asylum seekers, but he is unconvincing about how he will reliably monitor such assurances. He says that the embassy in Hanoi will do the job, but he knows that the embassy in Hanoi is not equipped for that as it has only one Vietnamese <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">speaker</a>. How will it be carried out? In any case, if the right hon. Gentleman regards assurances by the Vietnamese Government as being so reliable, why does he deny such an admirable and trustworthy Government economic aid? Vietnam is one of only two countries to which the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Government">United Kingdom Government</a> deny all bilateral economic development aid.</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman just said that he has had to adopt this solution, but the Government have always been determined on it. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a>, the former Foreign Secretary, said last night:
<q>what is now happening was first foreshadowed in a statesment that I made in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> some 15 months ago. The policy has been repeatedly explained to the House".&#8212; [<i>Official Report,</i> 11 December 1989; Vol. 163 c. 782.]</q>
The Government planned, decided upon and wanted that policy, and no rational person could accept the pretence that it has been forced upon them. Far from having no choice the Government have deliberately made the choice of bundling women and children into closed cars under the supervision of riot police, and taking them to an airport in the dead of night and under a news blackout.</p> <p>
The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> said a little while ago that she would impose conditions on whether to attend the forthcoming conference on human rights in Moscow. Bellowing Conservative Members do not care about human rights except when they are attacking certain Communist countries in Europe. The Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> has shown herself to be completely unfit not only to attend any conference on human rights anywhere but even to utter those words.</p>            </div>

Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester,_Gorton">Manchester, Gorton</a> (Mr. Kaufman) began with the operation itself. The policy which it embodies, as he said later in his <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>, has been announced and argued through repeatedly in the House. There can be no possible surprise among any right hon. and hon. Gentlemen that it is being implemented, but we thought it right to carry it through in a way which reduced the risk of violence and force, and that was done.</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman talked about screening. Each applicant for asylum who claims to be a refugee is screened at a two-hour interview and has the right of appeal. That process is monitored by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a>. I recommend the right hon. Gentleman to read the report of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Refugee_Council">British Refugee Council</a>, particularly what it says about screening. In case he doubts the validity of that report, it is signed by two of his most distinguished former colleagues who are respected in the House&#8212;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Ennals">Lord Ennals</a> and Mr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alf_Dubs">Alf Dubs</a>.</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman pretended that there was some discrimination. There is no discrimination. The

crucial test tests who is a refugee. We apply the same test in the United Kingdom, as I know from my last job. The same test is being applied in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>. It is a test laid down not by us but by the United Nations in the 1951 convention. The test is whether an individual has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. That is the United Nations test. We apply it in Britain and it is being applied in Hong Kong.</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman referred to assurances. So far as we and the United Nations can tell, the assurances given by the Vietnamese Government in respect of those who volunteered to go back, have been fully respected. But of course monitoring is important. I agree that it has to start with the embassy, and I am very keen to reinforce it as soon as possible. I am grateful to my right hon. Friend and to Lord Ennals for conducting that reinforcement. I hope that the new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR">UNHCR</a> and our own non-governmental organisations will join in that monitoring. It does not require them to approve the policy; it simply asks them to monitor whether the undertakings given are being fully respected.</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman asked about aid. We are giving some aid to Vietnam to help the people whom we are repatriating or who are volunteering to resettle in their communities. We are prepared to consider further aid, including perhaps through <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGOs">NGOs</a>, but that will have to be negotiated as part of wider arrangements to repatriate boat people.</p> <p>
I listened when the right hon. Gentleman was asked this morning what his policy was. He announced a three-point plan. The first thing that a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> would do is conduct proper screening, but there is proper screening, which I have just described and which is monitored by the UN and endorsed by his right hon. Friends. The second point in his great plan was that refugees would be settled in the West. They are being settled in the West, which is one of the main purposes of the international agreement that was reached last year and in which we are playing our part. Having announced the third part of his three point plan, he forgot what it was, and when he was pressed on what would be done for people who had been screened-out as refugees, he found no answer. He has shown, by his diffidence in putting forward alternatives, some understanding of the realities, but when pressed he has always dodged them&#8212;we cannot do so.</p>            </div>

realities to which my right hon. Friend referred. We come back to the essential distinction, which will become more and more important in the world as we proceed, between people who, quite understandably, want to move somewhere else to achieve a more agreeable life and those who are forced to do so by the well-founded fear of persecution. Those who blur that distinction do not understand its crucial importance to the successful handling of a series of intractable problems, of which at the moment this is the worst.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. He mentions a valid point which perhaps I should have included. For many years, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> under different Governments&#8212;including Labour Governments&#8212;has been pushing across the border between the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Territories">New Territories</a> and the People's Republic people who have

entered illegally from China. The people of Hong Kong cannot understand why a distinction is drawn between that, which has been constantly happening, and the repatriation of the Vietnamese.</p> <p>
I failed to reply to the right hon. Member for Tweedale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Steel) on the question of aid, although I gave an answer to the general point. The reintegration aid being made available for volunteers and for those repatriated last night is $620 per person which goes towards their transport inside Vietnam as well as food, medicines, domestic equipment, training, administration costs and tools. We are perfectly ready to consider expanding and developing that aid. The right hon. Gentleman knows the reasons why Vietnam has not qualified for international aid. It has been connected with the invasion of Cambodia by Vietnamese troops. However, they have to a large extent withdrawn. I regard this as an open question but it is a mistake to suppose that whatever is done about aid will persuade a villager living in the Red river delta to abandon his plans to go to Hong Kong unless and until it becomes clear that such a voyage is not, after a short stopover, a voyage to Vancouver or Australia. That is the illusion that has been fostered among those people. That illusion is damaging to them and we have to end it.</p>            </div>

It is precisely because Hong Kong has followed that policy that it has 57,000 boat people in camps. Her Majesty's Government have made a contribution, but a substantial burden has fallen on the people of Hong Kong.</p> <p>
On the second point, I am not aware of any representations having been made on the return of illegal


immigrants across the border into the People's Republic. It is a practice which has been settled for many years. It occurred even when I served in Peking a very long time ago and it has not attracted particular comment or protest.</p>            </div>

The decision on their future must depend on where their families are. If their parents are back in Vietnam, I suggest that they should go back there, but if their families are resettled in the West, it is sensible that they should join their families in the West. That seems to be a common-sense approach. The hon. Gentleman's rhetoric is damaging because it falls short of the facts. There is a careful screening process to distinguish between those who are refugees and those who are not. Refugees should be accepted and resettled. If the hon. Gentleman and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> parties are beginning to put forward the doctrine that anyone who wants to move from one country to another in search of a better life must, as of right, be accepted there in the cause of humanitarian principle, I can say only that it is a recipe for chaos and great unhappiness throughout the world.</p>            </div>

Some of us have been very much involved in the matter for a considerable time and well understand the complications. However, there is nothing in my right hon. Friend's statement that deals with the basic problem. These migrants are not escaping from tyranny, but from abject poverty. Those of us who have seen them in Vietnam recognise that the fault lay partly with the Vietnamese Government and their policies, but the Vietnamese Government have now changed their policies and that is part of the reason for people leaving. The new system does not subsidise people in factories that produce goods that are not sold, so people have to leave the factories without a safety net. When the people have no hope, they take to the boats and unless we give the Vietnamese people hope by normalising relations and by pressing the United States to normalise relations with that country, by restoring bilateral and multilateral aid and by giving it access to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> and the banks, we shall not stop the boat people. There will still be people leaving because when there is no hope, they will continue to leave and to seek somewhere else.</p>            </div>

He makes the accurate distinction, which has escaped the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a>, between people fleeing from tyranny and migrants who wish to escape from poverty to what they believe is likely to be prosperity. As I have said already, there is a case for looking again at relationships.

We have political and diplomatic relations with Hanoi and that is not in question, but there is a case for looking again at economic relations. As I have outlined, we are already building them up for those who are repatriated and who volunteer to return. I repeat to my hon. Friend, as I have in answer to earlier questions, that whatever is done about aid, the World bank or the relationship of Vietnam with the international community that will not in itself&#8212;and certainly not next year&#8212;deter people who are now planning to sail or to go along the south China coast to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> in the belief that the journey to Hong Kong is halfway to Australia or to Vancouver. We can argue through the remedies that my hon. Friend suggests, but they are not remedies for the immediate critical situation that we and the people of Hong Kong face.</p>            </div>

I support my right hon. Friend in his very lonely and courageous decision. Does he recognise that the Government of mainland China have a substantial interest in the matter and that in trying to prevent increasing numbers of people coming from Vietnam there are interests working in conjunction with the Government of mainland China who wish to persuade the people of Hong Kong that they are as concerned about that colony's future as we are?</p>            </div>

When I met the leaders of some of our non-governmental aid organisations a few weeks ago to discuss Cambodia, I asked and encouraged them to take part in the process of monitoring. As my hon. Friend knows, some of them are already deeply involved in Vietnam. I mentioned the part played by our embassy and the role played by a Member of this House and a Member of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>. I should like to build up those activities. As soon as the new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> is properly in place, we shall encourage him to extend monitoring over and above what the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR">UNHCR</a> already does to include boat people repatriated last night and in future. I should like to build up the widest possible pattern of monitoring and that seems at present&#8212;so far as we can tell&#8212;to be acceptable to the Vietnamese Government.</p>            </div>

Are not the Government placing a false perspective on history by calling the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_boat_people">Vietnamese boat people</a> economic migrants? Does that not deny the whole lesson of history? This whole people is to be discriminated against once more, even under the terms of the United Nations charter. They had more bombs dropped on them in the American war in Vietnam than were dropped throughout the second world war. Their country has been left devastated, their lands poisoned and their children deformed. Does not that mean that we should take a realistic attitude to raising the necessary finance and

ensuring that the rest of the world takes in the boat people and looks after them and that we give proper aid to the peoples of Vietnam?</p>            </div>

Our key objective&#8212;and our urgent objective&#8212;is to prevent new arrivals. Because of the doctrine of first asylum, we do not have a system for turning people round quickly. We cannot act as the United States acts in the case of people coming from the Caribbean. That is one reason why I felt it essential to repatriate to show the people who might even now be planning to come in the spring, when the winds change and the season begins that it is not a happy voyage and will not lead them to resettlement in the West.</p>            </div>
