                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b842.2/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his question and deeply aware of the strength of feeling in this House and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a> about the scenes of violence at the consulate of the People&#8217;s Republic of China in Manchester on Sunday afternoon. I am happy to provide an update on our response. You have been kind enough, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, to indicate that you will allow me to speak for a couple more minutes to set out the position.</p> <p pid="b842.2/2">As the House will know, on Sunday afternoon officials were in touch with Greater Manchester police regarding the incident. On Monday, officials spoke to the Chinese embassy to express our very serious concerns at the reports and demand an explanation. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCDO">FCDO</a> officials were clear that all diplomats and consular staff based in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> must respect UK <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> and regulations. On Tuesday, I announced in this House that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> had issued a summons to express <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Majesty">His Majesty</a>&#8217;s Government&#8217;s deep concern at the incident and demand an explanation for the apparent actions of the staff at the consulate general.</p> <p pid="b842.2/3">Following my statement, the Chinese charg&#233; d&#8217;affaires attended a summons at the FCDO in his capacity as acting ambassador. For the avoidance of any doubt, I should say that the Chinese ambassador is currently out of the UK and it is standard practice in such circumstances to summon the charg&#233; d&#8217;affaires. I should also be clear that receiving an official summons from the Foreign Secretary is not, as has been described, a light rap on the knuckles but the delivery of a stern message, well understood within the context of diplomatic protocol. It is customary for senior officials to deliver such messages. These summons are not an invitation for an ambassador to have an audience with the Foreign Secretary or Ministers; in any case, given that the charg&#233; d&#8217;affaires was involved, it was doubly appropriate that they should be delivered by a senior official.</p> <p pid="b842.2/4">In the summons the official set out that peaceful protest is a fundamental part of British society and that everyone in the United Kingdom has the right to express their views peacefully and without fear of violence. He reiterated our clear expectation that diplomatic and consular staff should conduct themselves in accordance with UK law. We have made it absolutely clear to the Chinese embassy that the apparent behaviour of consulate general officials during the incident, as it appears from the footage&#8212;more of which is coming out, even as we discuss this&#8212;is completely unacceptable.</p> <p pid="b842.2/5">The independent police investigation is now under way. Greater Manchester police have been clear that there are many strands to what is a complex and sensitive inquiry and that it may take some time. As the Foreign Secretary has said, we await the details of the investigation, but in the meantime I have instructed our ambassador  to deliver a clear message directly to the Ministry of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs">Foreign Affairs</a> in Beijing about the depth of concern at the apparent actions by consulate general staff. Let me be clear that if the police determine that there are grounds to charge any officials, we would expect the Chinese consulate to waive immunity for those officials. If it does not, diplomatic consequences will follow.</p> <p pid="b842.2/6">Finally, allow me to reiterate to the House the value that we place on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> community in the UK. When the national security law was imposed on Hong Kong in 2020, this Government acted immediately in announcing the scheme for British national overseas status holders and their dependants. Since then, more than 100,000 people and their families have made the decision to move to the UK to live, work and make it their new home. I want to put on the record, here, now, again and officially, a reaffirmation of our unwavering support for them and our commitment to their safety. They are most welcome here. Recognising the interest that this issue has across the House, the Government will seek to update the House on this matter next week.</p>            </div>

Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25906" title="Our page on Alicia Kearns - 'the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alicia Kearns)'">Alicia Kearns</a>.</p> <p pid="b843.0/2">It is worth reminding the House of what happened in the Chinese consulate&#8217;s grounds on Sunday, where there was an appalling attack on a peaceful protester. We saw appalling videos of Bob Chan being dragged into the consulate&#8217;s grounds and seriously abused, and it now appears that the consul general played a part in that physical attack.</p> <p pid="b843.0/3">Mr Chan is a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> refugee whom we have welcomed over here. I and others on both sides of the House are working together to help people get out of Hong Kong, and that community now feels very frightened by what the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>&#8217;s representatives are doing in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a>. Mr Chan gave a statement to the media for the first time yesterday. His wife and child were in the room, and it was a very moving statement. He spoke of how badly bruised and damaged he is, and how frightened he is. I thought it was very brave of him, because he now fears being targeted by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist">Chinese Communist</a> party here in the United Kingdom.</p> <p pid="b843.0/4">Overnight, we discovered that the consul general has admitted that not only did he take part in the attack but that he was responsible for, in his own words, pulling Mr Chan&#8217;s hair and tearing his scalp. That is the consul general, let alone the others who were there.</p> <p pid="b843.0/5">I have worked with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Parliamentary_Alliance_on_China">Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China</a> and others in this House to help Hong Kong refugees, and I credit the Government for their work to get those with British national overseas passports over here. I now urge the Government to be much clearer than just using diplomatic language; I urge them to make it clear, in the light of this new evidence, that it is not just unacceptable that any consular individual should have taken part in anything like this, but that any consular individual who is proved to have been a perpetrator of this outrageous and violent attack on Mr Chan will immediately be made persona non grata and sent back to China. The Government have the diplomatic power to dismiss them. Whether or not there are criminal proceedings, the fact is we do not want them here in the UK and they must go.</p> <p pid="b843.0/6">I urge my right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> to come to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> and show the resolution that is necessary to send that message to China. He should ignore what other people and officials might say about being careful of tit for tat, get to the Dispatch Box and simply say, &#8220;They will leave the United Kingdom. Anyone involved in that attack is not welcome, and the ambassador will be informed of that forthwith.&#8221;</p>            </div>

We should be absolutely clear that participating in an assault, if that is what is determined to have happened, is completely outside the expectations of our rule of law. If such a thing had taken place in front of the British consulate in Shanghai&#8212;that question was raised in the House only two days ago&#8212;we would, of course, refer the matter to the local policing authorities, as we would have expected in this case. I take his point, which he makes very strongly.</p> <p pid="b844.0/2">My right hon. Friend is also right to insist, as he insisted during Tuesday&#8217;s urgent question, that the diplomatic channel and the legal channel are distinct. I have seen the footage he describes, and I think it looks very black and very damning, but we are going through a process and we need to make a factual determination. Once that is done, and if the situation is found to be as we fear&#8212;that is to say there has been a criminal offence of some kind&#8212;diplomatic consequences will follow.</p>            </div>

Instead of making a statement to this House, which would be the normal way of carrying on, Members have had to secure a second urgent question. What is more concerning is the outrageous admission of the Chinese consul general that he did, in fact, assault <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> democracy protesters in Manchester, which he described as his duty.</p> <p pid="b844.2/3">The Government&#8217;s handling of this issue has been a complete mess. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will know that Labour called for the Chinese ambassador to be summoned so that an explanation could be demanded, but a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign,_Commonwealth_and_Development_Office">Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office</a> statement confirmed that, in a stunning abdication of the Government&#8217;s duties, a civil servant held the meeting with Minister Yang, rather than the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> or a responsible Minister. Although I have the upmost confidence in the abilities of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCDO">FCDO</a> officials to fulfil their responsibilities, there are moments in foreign policy when only an elected Minister will do. Sadly, it appears that what this chaotic Government have unleashed upon the country through their failed economic agenda is now hampering Ministers&#8217; ability to stand up for the most basic rights we hold dear.</p> <p pid="b844.2/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> has the chance to send a clear message not only to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>, but to the Government in Myanmar and any other country that might have a repressive regime and where refugees fear for their safety in this country. He will know that on  <phrase class="date" code="2022-05-12">12 May</phrase>, from this <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a>, we challenged the Government to come forward with a comprehensive safety plan for Hong Kong nationals and others, so I have two questions. Will he meet those from the embassy without any delay to communicate the strong message from MPs about the importance of peaceful protest in this country? Is it the case that Greater Manchester police have not yet received the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV">CCTV</a> footage because the consul general is refusing to hand it over?</p> <p pid="b844.2/5">What will the Minister do to tackle this problem? Is it possible for him to expel the individual and then for that individual to apply to return? If it were that way round, we would at least know that the Government had taken the strongest action possible.</p>            </div>

The ambassador is not in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> and has not been since before the beginning of this week, so he is not available for any kind of diplomatic interaction.

It is a political decision to expel, not a policing one. Will the Minister therefore confirm that, as he suggested from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> just now, his preference is to prosecute these individuals and see them in British prisons?

She has made clear her view that a crime was committed, and that is the view that many others have taken, but it is not a determination of fact  at the level we would need. She may have missed the portion of what I said earlier to my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodford_Green">Woodford Green</a> about the fact that we recognise that the diplomatic channel and the legal are separate, but they are not separate as regards a determination of fact. Those are the proper grounds for us to make a determination as a Government. As regards the political desire, we will be looking at the fact situation as it is brought forward and at the options. She may have missed this too, but I said that I would expect there to be an update to the House next week, as further events play themselves out. We will make a judgment in due course on that basis.</p>            </div>

As others have said, the violent clash between pro-democracy protesters and officials at the Chinese consulate is disturbing and goes directly against the tenets of diplomacy, freedom of speech and protest. Bob Chan, who fled <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> for his life, was pulled through the gates into the consulate and beaten by staff. He was left with cuts and bruises to his face, and video footage shows his hair being pulled by the Chinese consul general, who has already asserted that that was his &#8220;duty&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b846.1/2"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_SNP">The SNP</a> condemns in the strongest terms this violence against peaceful protesters and calls for an urgent investigation.

Even within the Home Office network of relationships, our police are independent of Government, and rightly so for the best rule-of-law reasons, so we will respect that.

Of course, what the Minister should be doing is saying to the ambassador, &#8220;Get yourself back to Britain, so that you can meet with the Minister. If you don&#8217;t get back, it will be a Minister who will be meeting with the charg&#233; d&#8217;affaires on Monday morning, or preferably tomorrow, and, for that matter, we will be expelling the consul general tomorrow because he has clearly been engaged in something that would have got him arrested if it had happened on the streets of the United Kingdom.&#8221;</p>            </div>

That is why I ended my statement with a very specific message of support to them. I have also outlined to the House the measures that we have put in place in the other Departments focused on those people. It is true that they too would expect to live under the rule of law and our police, and in general Greater Manchester police do a sterling job, as I am sure any Manchester MP would say, of protecting the wellbeing of the people of Manchester. I am sure that they will continue to extend that privilege, courtesy and protection to Hong Kong residents.</p>            </div>
