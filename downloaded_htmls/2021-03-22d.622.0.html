It includes satellite imagery; survivor testimony; official documentation and, indeed, leaks from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> themselves; credible open-source reporting, including from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International">Amnesty International</a>; and visits by British diplomats to the region that have corroborated other reports about the targeting of specific ethnic groups.</p> <p pid="d621.1/3">In sum, the evidence points to a highly disturbing programme of repression. Expressions of religion have been criminalised, and Uyghur language and culture discriminated against on a systematic scale. There is widespread use of forced labour; women forcibly sterilised; children separated from their parents; an entire population subject to surveillance, including collection of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA">DNA</a> and use of facial recognition software and so-called predictive policing algorithms.</p> <p pid="d621.1/4">State control in the region is systemic. Over 1 million people have been detained without trial. There are widespread claims of torture and rape in the camps based on first-hand survivor testimony. People are detained for having too many children, for praying too much, for having a beard or wearing a headscarf, for having the wrong thoughts.</p> <p pid="d621.1/5">I am sure the whole House will join me in condemning such appalling violations of the most basic human rights. In terms of scale, it is the largest mass detention of an ethnic or religious group since the second world war, and I believe one thing is clear: the international community cannot simply look the other way.</p> <p pid="d621.1/6">It has been two and a half years since the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Committee_on_the_Elimination_of_Racial_Discrimination">UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination</a> called on China to stop arbitrarily detaining Uyghurs and other minorities in the Xinjiang province. It is over 18 months since the UK led the first ever joint UN statement on Xinjiang at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_General_Assembly">UN General Assembly</a>&#8217;s third committee, back in October 2019. The number of countries now willing to speak out collectively has grown from just 23 to 39 as the evidence has accumulated and as our diplomatic efforts have borne fruit. That is a clear signal to China about the breadth of international concern.</p> <p pid="d621.1/7">Last year, 50 independent UN experts spoke out about the situation in an exceptional joint statement calling on China to respect basic human rights. Last month at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Council">Human Rights Council</a>, I led the calls on China to give the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a> High Commissioner for Human Rights, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Bachelet">Michelle Bachelet</a>&#8212;or some other fact-finding expert&#8212;urgent, unfettered access to Xinjiang. Since then, Ms Bachelet herself has reinforced in the clearest terms the need for independent access to verify the deteriorating situation. We regret that, instead of recognising those calls from the international community, China has simply sought to deny them. Chinese authorities have claimed that the legitimate concerns raised are fake news. At the same time, the authorities continue to  expand prison facilities, surveillance networks and forced labour programmes. China continues to resist access for the UN or other independent experts to verify the truth, notwithstanding its blanket denials.</p> <p pid="d621.1/8">For the UK&#8217;s part, our approach has been to call out these egregious, industrial-scale human rights abuses, to work with our international partners and ultimately to match words with actions. In January, I announced a package of measures to help ensure that no British organisations&#8212;Government or private sector&#8212;deliberately or inadvertently can profit from human rights violations against the Uyghurs or other minorities, and that no businesses connected with the internment camps can do business in the UK.</p> <p pid="d621.1/9">Today, we are taking further steps, again in co-ordination with our international partners. Having very carefully considered the evidence against the criteria in our global human rights sanctions regime, I can tell the House that I am designating four senior individuals responsible for the violations that have taken place and persist against the Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. Alongside those individuals, we are also designating the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Security_Bureau">Public Security Bureau</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_Production_and_Construction_Corps">Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps</a>. That is the organisation responsible for enforcing the repressive security policies across many areas of Xinjiang. The sanctions involve travel bans and asset freezes against the individuals and asset freezes against the entity we are designating. The individuals are barred from entering the UK. Any assets found in the UK will be frozen.</p> <p pid="d621.1/10">We take this action alongside the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU">EU</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US">US</a> and Canada, which are all taking similar measures today. I think it is clear that, by acting with our partners&#8212;30 of us in total&#8212;we are sending the clearest message to the Chinese Government that the international community will not turn a blind eye to such serious and systematic violations of basic human rights, and that we will act in concert to hold those responsible to account.</p> <p pid="d621.1/11">As the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> set out in the integrated review last week, China is an important partner in tackling global challenges such as climate change. We pursue a constructive dialogue where that proves possible, but we will always stand up for our values, and in the face of evidence of such serious human rights violations, we will not look the other way. The suffering of the Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang cannot be ignored. Human rights violations on this scale cannot be ignored. Together with our partners, we call on China to end these cruel practices, and I commend this statement to the House.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d622.0/1">There is no question but that this is a welcome step, and I welcome the moves by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU">EU</a> today and other partners. I am sure the whole House will stand in solidarity with our fellow European parliamentarians who have been sanctioned by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> in response. This is an unacceptable attack on democratic lawmakers simply for highlighting the horrific evidence from Xinjiang.</p> <p pid="d622.0/2">However, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> has just read out the evidence that we have known about for years. He rightly called it barbaric, but when it has come to taking concrete steps, for years he has not listened. He did not listen to his hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25354" title="Our page on Nusrat Ghani - 'the Member for Wealden (Ms Ghani)'">Ms Ghani</a> or his right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10180" title="Our page on Iain Duncan Smith - 'the Member for  Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith)'">Sir Iain Duncan Smith</a>. He did not listen to us. He did not listen to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Deputies">Board of Deputies</a>. He did not listen to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Uyghur_Congress">World Uyghur Congress</a>. Yet suddenly today the Foreign Secretary has discovered a new-found sense of urgency about the desperate plight of the Uyghur, despite that mounting evidence over several years. The truth is that the timing is grubby and cynical; it is designed to send a signal first and foremost not to the Chinese Government but to his own <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Benchers">Back Benchers</a>. It is motivated primarily by a desire to protect the Government, not the Uyghur. For all the talk of being a force for good in the world, it is only when this Government are staring down the barrel of defeat that they discover a moral centre. Only now that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US">US</a> and the EU have acted has the Foreign Secretary finally moved to take this step.</p> <p pid="d622.0/3">I urge all Members, especially those brave and conscientious Conservative Members, to think carefully before accepting that this signals a change of approach from this Government. This week we learnt that, despite his protestations, the Foreign Secretary has been talking up a trade deal with China in private at gatherings with Beijing officials. This week, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> launched his global Britain policy, signalling a closer economic relationship with China. Members had eagerly awaited details of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pacific">Indo-Pacific</a> tilt; we did not dream for a moment, from the talk over the last year, that it would be a tilt towards China.</p> <p pid="d622.0/4">Today is perhaps the most acute example of the Government&#8217;s decade-long incoherent, inconsistent approach to the Chinese Government. On the day the Foreign Secretary finally announces sanctions on some of the officials responsible for human rights abuses in Xinjiang he is also pulling every trick in the book to stop Parliament gaining the power to block any bilateral trade or investment agreement with China based on a determination of genocide.</p> <p pid="d622.0/5">I ask hon. Members to pause and ponder: if this is about co-ordination, why has it taken so long? The Government could have taken co-ordinated action with the United States when it brought sanctions in July last year, or if they felt so strongly they could have moved independently from the EU, as they have done in sanctions on other countries over the last year. Where are the sanctions on officials in Hong Kong when the US took that step this week? We should be taking a leadership approach given our historical commitments in the bilateral treaty, which China is in breach of. We are signatories to the joint declaration, not the United States. Where is the tougher sanctions regime that brings corruption into scope? Why did the Foreign Secretary say at a private gathering earlier this month that he had no reason to think that we could not deepen our trading relationship with China? Why did the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> say last month that he was committed to strengthening the UK&#8217;s ties with China</p> <p class="indent" pid="d622.0/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;whatever the occasional political difficulties&#8221;?</p> <p pid="d622.0/7">If this signals a change in approach, why on earth on the same day as the Government are announcing these sanctions are they twisting the arms of Back Benchers who want to support the genocide <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>?</p> <p pid="d622.0/8">Today I urge all parliamentarians to stand firm: to stand with the public, who overwhelmingly support a principled stance on genocide; to stand with their  consciences; and most of all to stand with the Uyghur people. After a decade of rolling out the red carpet for Beijing and turning a blind eye to human rights abuses, this is the moment when we will finally force a change in Britain&#8217;s foreign policy, live up to our values as a country and be a force for good in the world.</p>            </div>

In relation to the statement, the only bit that has been removed was reference to the individuals sanctioned, because for legal and propriety reasons we cannot give that out in advance. I hope you will accept my apologies for that, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, but we were doing it so as not to frustrate the very purpose of the sanctions.</p> <p pid="d624.4/2">In relation to the remarks, or rather selective snippets, made by the shadow Foreign Secretary, it is wholly inaccurate to suggest that I talked up an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTA">FTA</a> with China. I made it very clear that there was no realistic or foreseeable prospect of a free trade agreement and that the way to deepen our trade with China was for it to improve its human rights record.</p> <p pid="d624.4/3">On the one hand, the hon. Lady welcomes the fact that we have proceeded in concert with 30 partners, including ourselves. On the other, she says it is too slow. It is the Goldilocks of criticism. She suggests it was linked to the Trade Bill. [Interruption.] I know she believes in human rights. I had hoped that she would at least recognise that 30 countries imposing targeted sanctions on China for human rights abuses is an important moment. It is a bit disappointing to hear her trying to score political points in relation to this important step, let alone suggesting that the concerted and unprecedented action of 30 countries is somehow tied up with the UK&#8217;s domestic legislative timetable.</p> <p pid="d624.4/4">The reality, on the genocide <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>, is that we absolutely recognise the ability of this House to hold the Government to account. Through support for the Neill amendment and further concessions, we continue to want to see maximum scrutiny of the Government by Parliament. The reality is that this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a> under this <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> have done more to stand up for human rights around the world than any previous British Government. We have demonstrated that through our diplomatic leadership in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Council">Human Rights Council</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_General_Assembly">UN General Assembly</a> Third Committee. We have  demonstrated it through the actions that we are taking on modern slavery. We have demonstrated it in the offer that we have made to the British nationals overseas from Hong Kong. And we have demonstrated it again today with these Magnitsky sanctions.</p>            </div>

He knows that he has no greater supporters on this decision than the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a>. However, may I ask him&#8212;a gentleman who has devoted so much of his career to human rights law&#8212;what is it in human rights law or in the UN definition of genocide that fails to get him to use the word in this circumstance? My understanding &#8212;I admit I am not a lawyer&#8212;is that the attempted destruction of a people or its culture in whole or in part constitutes genocide. What he has just described to the House sounds to me like it fits that definition, so I am just wondering why he is reticent to use the word.</p> <p pid="d625.0/2">Given that the Foreign Secretary rightly identified that sanctions on individuals operating in the UK are a matter of great concern, will he please let the House know when he intends to bring forward a foreign agents registration Act? He knows as well as I do that there are, sadly, too many British people in the UK&#8212;sometimes, sadly, even former Ministers or those connected to Government&#8212;using their influence in a surreptitious manner to further the aims or interests of a country such as China, which is so violating human rights.</p>            </div>

Moreover, in the immediate aftermath of the review&#8217;s publication, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> lamented that restricting trade because of human rights abuses would mean missing out on growth markets. The Foreign Secretary&#8217;s remarks last week do not chime with today&#8217;s statement. His insistence that the UK will seek to do trade deals with countries that violate standards enshrined in the European convention on human rights&#8212;the very <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> drawn up by British officials after the horrors of the second world war&#8212;marks yet another record low for this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a>.</p> <p pid="d625.2/5">China is a serial human rights violator and we must call out the appalling state-backed human rights violations taking place there. It is crystal clear: it is genocide. Indeed, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newlines_Institute_for_Strategy_and_Policy">Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy</a> think-tank   found that through its actions in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang,_China">Xinjiang, China</a> has breached every single article of the UN genocide convention and has accused China of clearly demonstrating</p> <p class="indent" pid="d625.2/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group&#8221;.</p> <p pid="d625.2/7">Shamefully, the UK Government refused to back the genocide <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> to the Trade Bill, making clear their desire for a trade deal with China as opposed to the preferable tougher approach on human rights.</p> <p pid="d625.2/8">The Foreign Secretary can talk tough on China but until he takes action it does nothing for those living under oppression in Xinjiang and elsewhere. Will he tell the House and the world what specific actions he intends to take to ensure that the UK upholds human rights and that this is a new approach that will not be characterised by the inconsistency, ambiguity and policy incoherence that has defined this Government so far? Finally, will he call out what is happening in China? It is quite simply genocide.</p>            </div>

It is very rare that a tribunal has found human rights abuses to amount to genocide because of the specific legal definition, but we do think the right thing is that a tribunal, whether it is domestic or international, makes that judgment.</p>            </div>

I made it clear that we will never do free trade deals with countries whose human rights records are beyond the pale. We are taking Magnitsky sanctions, as well as modern slavery action measures, precisely because we never shirk our human rights and responsibilities. But we do recognise the value of trade deals, and if we held countries around the world to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHR">ECHR</a>-level standards, we would be&#8212;I do not hear <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Front Benchers calling for this&#8212;ripping up trade deals with Korea, Japan and not engaging with other countries that have either the death penalty or corporal punishment. We take a balanced approach, but, as we have shown today, we will never shrink from standing up for human rights and holding those to account, and we have done more than any other Government in this country&#8217;s history, and certainly more than the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> before.</p>            </div>

It is a delight to hear what he has had to say today, but I wish he would be a little bit less of a lawyer about all of this. Sometimes it ends up looking as if the Government are trying to have it both ways all the time. Yes, announce sanctions against those involved in what I would certainly call genocide in China, but, at the same time, they drag their feet about it, take too long to deal with the human rights abuses in Hong Kong being perpetuated by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Lam">Carrie Lam</a>, and quite often refuse to take action against the dirty money, for instance, from Russia that is coming into the UK. May I urge him to think seriously about how we make the Magnitsky sanctions regime, which he very wisely and courageously introduced, have more of a parliamentary angle to it, so that we can help review and bring these sanctions into place?</p>            </div>

I remember his moral courage and tenacity in calling for it in relation to the Uyghur Muslims. He has complained about lawyerliness. Let us remember that we are talking about a legal regime that imposes visa bans and asset freezes, which affects the rights of others. It is absolutely right that we take very seriously the legal criteria and the evidence base for doing so, and there is absolutely nothing stopping him, either in relation to the regime or by providing evidence to the Government, from playing a full role. However, let us also ensure that we have due process, otherwise the risk is that we trip up, we get legally challenged and we give the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PR">PR</a> coup to precisely those whom we want to be calling to account.</p>            </div>

Does the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> accept that such decisions risk legitimising China&#8217;s failure to abide by its international commitments, and will he agree that it is no longer appropriate for UK judges to sit in Hong Kong courts?</p>            </div>

I have had discussions about this not just with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=263" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Chancellor" class="glossary">Lord Chancellor</a>, but with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Supreme_Court">President of the Supreme Court</a>. We have agreed a common set of principles that should apply. The challenge is whether, by removing UK judges wholesale, we would actually be removing a moderating impact on the way in which the national security legislation is applied. I hope the hon. Lady will know that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Bar">Hong Kong Bar</a> and other countries around the world have suggested to us that they would prefer those international judges to stay. With one narrow exception, I do not think that any other country has removed its judges. We are very much seized of the issue, and I hope that my answer demonstrates that.</p>            </div>

I am curious to know whether the hon. Gentleman is actually advocating that we tear up those existing deals. I do not think that that would be the right thing to do. Of course, different countries have different approaches and different legal systems, but we are very clear that we would never do trade deals with countries whose records are beyond the pale. Notwithstanding whatever trade or investment we have, as we have demonstrated today, we will impose Magnitsky sanctions to hold to account those individually responsible for whatever abuses they may be involved with.</p>            </div>
