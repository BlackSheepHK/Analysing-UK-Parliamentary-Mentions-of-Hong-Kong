                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I wish to make a statement on the recent disturbances in Hong Kong.</p> <p>
The course of events was as follows. An industrial dispute in two factories producing artificial flowers led to minor disturbances during picketing on 6th May.


But what began as a genuine labour dispute then changed its character on 11th May. It was taken up and exploited by local Communists with the aid of hooligan elements, some of whom were paid. Organised demonstrations were mounted as a direct and deliberate challenge to the authority of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Government">Hong Kong Government</a>. In some cases these were orderly, but in others they led to disturbances involving police action. There has been open incitement to violence and to disaffection.</p> <p>
Up to 17th May the demonstrations were confined to parts of Kowloon, but thereafter they spread to Victoria, on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Island">Hong Kong Island</a>. Processions, large gatherings of people, and the sticking of posters on public buildings, while unlawful, were tolerated so long as the demonstrators remained fairly orderly, although noisy. On 20th May, disorder and violence became part of the pattern of demonstrations, and it was necessary to disperse further unlawful processions and assemblies, but orderly groups of 20 were able to present petitions at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_House">Government House</a>.</p> <p>
Throughout the disturbances the Hong Kong police were able to control the situation with the minimum of force. Firearms were used on only one occasion, when a constable over whom petrol had been thrown fired three revolver shots and wounded one man. The greatest restraint was exercised throughout by the police, despite extreme provocation. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> and I have already paid public tribute to them in Hong Kong, and I do so again now. I would like them to know how much we admire their restraint in these very difficult circumstances.</p> <p>
In all, 36 police and 70 demonstrators were reported as injured. Of these, three police and 14 others were admitted to hospital, but have since been discharged. There was one death, that of a bystander who was killed by a stone, and 815 persons were arrested, of whom 65 have been released or acquitted. Of the remainder, 565 have been convicted, and 185 cases are pending. All those arrested are being dealt with by the normal processes of the law. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> may feel that these facts contrast somewhat with other reports which have appeared elsewhere, alleging, for example, that on one day alone

<q>&#8230; at least 200 compatriots were killed or severely injured".</q>
Since 22nd May there have been no demonstrations, but there have been a series of token stoppages. There has been widespread and forthright public support in Hong Kong for the measures taken by the Government to deal with violence, intimidation and hooliganism and to preserve order. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Governor">The Governor</a> has received messages of support from over 500 representative organisations. My latest information is that work at both the factories involved in the original labour dispute has now been resumed.</p> <p>
The House may wish to know that for some time now improvements in labour conditions have been under consideration in Hong Kong, and that I am in consultation with the Governor about changes in the labour <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a>, which, I think we all feel, would be timely. They include such matters as hours of work for women and young persons, and conciliation machinery.</p> <p>
For the future, we must hope that good sense will prevail. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> and I are, of course, in close and constant touch with the Governor. There have been statements alleging that the Hong Kong Government have been acting out of motives of enmity towards China. I do not need to say that we, like all sections of opinion in Hong Kong, have sought, and will continue to seek, friendly relations with China. But the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Hong_Kong">Government of Hong Kong</a> have the duty to maintain peace, order and good government there, for the benefit of all sections of the community, and we have given them clear assurances of our complete support and determination to fulfil our responsibilities in Hong Kong.</p> <p>
Finally, I want to pay tribute to the calm and courageous leadership during these difficult times of the Governor, Sir David Trench, to the ability and determination shown by the whole Hong Kong Administration, to the spendid behaviour of the police and to the spirit of the people of Hong Kong generally.</p>            </div>

First, there are appalling housing conditions in places like <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_Rock">Lion Rock</a> town, the Walled City and Aberdeen, whatever may have been the housing achievements of the past?</p> <p>
Secondly, there is the fact that in a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Colony">British Colony</a> of 4 million, not a single, solitary soul has a vote, save for 10 members of the town council. If direct


elections, for cold war reasons, are impracticable, could we not move toward some form of indirect elections?</p>            </div>

This would introduce much of the kind of thing which the right hon. Gentleman has in mind.</p> <p>
May I make one thing quite clear. There is no indication, paradoxical though it may seem, that either concern about the degee of democratic representation in Hong Kong or about the working conditions have been among the motivations at this time. They may be a part of the deep background, but there is no indication that it has been at this time anything other than what my hon. Friend has said, a degree of political motivation, arising mainly from the ferment of ideas that is taking place in that part of the world.</p>            </div>

We have in Hong Kong the situation of an exploding population, in which tremendous achievements have


been made in the last few years, but where, even so, it is difficult to keep up with the needs. Certainly, one of the needs is for more educational opportunities for secondary school children. It is a question of buildings and teachers, as elsewhere.</p> <p>
This is a very general problem in many parts of the world, where one has the effect of a population explosion. The Government in Hong Kong are very much aware of this and are doing their best. I think that they are achieving some remarkable success in trying to minimise this problem.</p>            </div>
