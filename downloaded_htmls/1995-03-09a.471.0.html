                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p class="unknownspeaker">Mrs. Taylor:</p> <p>I thank the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a> for that information.</p> <p>
Does the Leader of the House acknowledge that it is strange to have scheduled for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday">Monday</a> 20 March the <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> of the Child Support Bill, which I gather comes into operation later next year, whereas important regulations that involve changes to the workings of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Support_Agency">Child Support Agency</a>, which are to come into operation from April&#8212;next month&#8212;have not yet been laid before the House? As those regulations are extremely important and complex, will he ensure that hon. Members have sufficient time to consider them? Will he also assure us that, because of the Bill's complexity, sufficient parliamentary time will be allowed for debate at all stages&#8212;including, if necessary, Report on the Floor of the House?</p> <p>
Two private Members' <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> received their <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Reading">Second Reading</a> last <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday">Friday</a>, with strong support from both sides of the House, as was the case with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights">Civil Rights</a> (Disabled Persons) Bill. As those measures have received widespread support both inside and outside the House and across the political spectrum, the Government should be willing to facilitate further discussion of the Bills by ensuring that they go to Committee. Parliament can then make a decision about the issues involved, rather than being frustrated by procedural devices.</p> <p>
Will the Leader of the House ensure that there is a ministerial statement early next week to report on the poverty summit in Copenhagen, not least because so little has been said or written by Ministers about the Government's attitude to that potentially important summit?</p> <p>
Will the Leader of the House also ensure that Ministers have the opportunity to clarify another issue which, following <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s <a href="/glossary/?gl=25" title="Question Time is an opportunity for MPs and Members of the House of Lords..." class="glossary">Question Time</a> today, I think requires further clarification&#8212;the Government's role in the electricity privatisation and regulation fiasco?</p> <p>
As the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> acknowledged today that Ministers were aware that the electricity regulator was considering a review of the price mechanism, and that they even took legal advice before the flotation of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Power">National Power</a>, and as it is absolutely clear that consumers have been overcharged and that shareholders&#8212;both individuals and pension funds&#8212;have been ripped off, surely the time has come for Ministers to reveal to the House the full extent of their involvement.</p> <p>
Ministers should not hide behind legal advice and say that they were not compelled to disclose information&#8212;so much for open government from that group of Ministers. We need an urgent debate, so that Ministers can face their responsibilities to consumers, shareholders and to the House.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>Perhaps I might take the points made by the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor) in reverse order. The hon. Lady will understand that there was a substantial exchange about the electricity issues that she has touched upon during <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s <a href="/glossary/?gl=25" title="Question Time is an opportunity for MPs and Members of the House of Lords..." class="glossary">Question Time</a> not long ago. I thought that my right hon. Friend the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> set out the position very clearly, and I am not able to add to that.</p> <p>
As to the hon. Lady's penultimate question about the conference in Copenhagen, she will know that my right hon. and noble Friend Baroness Chalker is acting for Britain at that social summit. I think that she is very well qualified to do so, and that she will make Britain's position completely clear.


The second of the hon. Lady's questions related to private Members' <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a>&#8212;she put her questions in what I would describe as a more sophisticated form than usual. However, I have no plans for providing Government time to discuss private Members' Bills or of departing from the usual practices in relation to private Members' Bills.</p> <p>
Lastly, on the Child Support Bill and associated matters, I entirely take the hon. Lady's point about the regulations. We will try to ensure that they are available and are debated in good time, because, as she said, they are due to come into effect sooner than the Bill. Of course, a Bill takes a good deal longer to pass than a set of regulations. The hon. Lady is already making demands for time later in the Session, which constitutes a good reason for getting on with the legislation.</p>            </div>

Given that the matter that has concerned hon.

Does my right hon. Friend consider it appropriate for the House to debate those matters, in the light of the fact that that new service will have a budget of &#163;50 million?</p> <p>
Because the House does not sit tomorrow, however, it will not be possible to give sufficient notice of the establishment of that service, and the necessary statutory instruments will not be able to be laid within the prescribed time. Does my right hon. Friend feel, as I do, that the House should be able to debate those important matters, not least because the approval of the House has already been assumed and staff have been appointed to that new service, offices have been taken on all around the country, and the whole industry is expecting it to be operational on 1 April, yet it has not technically been approved by the House?</p>            </div>
