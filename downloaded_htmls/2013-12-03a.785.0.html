Of course, the whole House wishes to associate itself with your expressions of concern and condolence.</p> <p pid="a.782.1/2">With your permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA">PISA</a>&#8212;programme for international student assessment&#8212;league tables of educational performance published today by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a>. Before I go into the detail of what the league tables show about the common features of high-performing school systems, may I take a moment, as I try to in every public statement I make, to thank our teachers for their hard work, dedication and idealism. Whatever conclusions we draw about what needs to change, I hope that we in this House can agree that we are fortunate to have the best generation of young teachers ever in our schools. The data show that the new recruits now entering the classroom are better qualified than ever before. I would like in particular to thank those head teachers who are, through the new school direct programme of teacher training, recruiting more superb new graduates to teach in our state schools.</p> <p pid="a.782.1/3">Although the quality of our teachers is improving, today&#8217;s league tables sadly show that that is not enough. When people ask why&#8212;if teachers are better than ever&#8212; we need to press ahead with further reform to the system, today&#8217;s results make the case more eloquently than any number of speeches. Since the 1990s, our performance in these league tables has been, at best, stagnant, and, at worst, declining. In the latest results, we are 21st in the world for science, 23rd for reading and 26th for mathematics. For all the well-intentioned efforts of past Governments, we are still falling further behind the best-performing school systems in the world. In Shanghai and Singapore, South Korea and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>&#8212;indeed even in Taiwan and Vietnam&#8212;children are learning more and performing better with every year that passes, leaving our children behind in the global race. That matters because business is more mobile than ever, and employers are more determined than ever to seek out the best-qualified workers. Global economic pressures, far from leading to a race to the bottom, are driving all nations to pursue educational excellence more energetically than ever before. Today&#8217;s league tables show that nations that have had the courage radically to reform their education systems, such as Germany and Poland, have significantly improved their performance and their children&#8217;s opportunities.</p> <p pid="a.782.1/4">No single <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>, or indeed single nation, has all the answers to our education challenges. But if we look at all the high-performing and fast-improving education systems, we find that certain common features recur: there is an emphasis on social justice and helping every child to succeed; there is a commitment to an aspirational academic curriculum for all students; there is a high level of autonomy from bureaucracy for head teachers; there is a rigorous system of accountability for performance; and head teachers have the critical power to hire whom they want, remove underperformers and reward the best with the recognition they deserve. Those principles have driven this coalition&#8217;s education reforms since 2010.</p> <p pid="a.782.1/5">The first reform imperative, of course, is securing greater social justice. It is notable that all the high-performing jurisdictions set demanding standards for every child, whatever their background. Germany, in particular, has improved its standing in these league tables by doing more to promote greater equity to ensure that more children from poorer backgrounds catch up with their peers. The good news from the PISA research is that in England we have one of the most progressive and socially just systems of education funding in the world, but we in the coalition Government believe that we must go further to help the most disadvantaged children. That is why we have made funding even more progressive with the pupil premium. We have extended free pre-school education to the most disadvantaged two-year-olds and changed how we hold schools accountable so they have to give even greater attention to the performance of poor children. I hope that today the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> will acknowledge those steps forward and give their support to our accountability reforms.</p> <p pid="a.782.1/6">The second imperative is a more aspirational curriculum. In successful Asian nations, all students are introduced to more stretching maths content at an earlier age than has been the case here. In the fastest-improving European nation, Poland, every child now follows a core academic curriculum to the age of 16. Our new national curriculum is explicitly more demanding, especially in maths, and it is modelled on the approach of high-performing Asian nations such as Singapore. The mathematical content is matched by a new level of ambition in technology, with the introduction of programming and coding on the national curriculum for the first time.</p> <p pid="a.782.1/7">In our drive to eliminate illiteracy, we have introduced a screening check at age six to make sure that every child is reading fluently. Our introduction of the English baccalaureate, which is awarded to students who secure GCSE passes in English, maths, the sciences, languages and history or geography, matches Poland&#8217;s ambition by embedding an expectation of academic excellence for every 16-year-old. I hope today that those on the Labour <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> will confirm their support for our new curriculum, the phonics screening check and the English baccalaureate. Our children deserve to have those higher standards adopted universally.</p> <p pid="a.782.1/8">The third reform imperative is greater autonomy for head teachers. There is a direct correlation in the league tables between freedom for heads and improved results. That is why we have dramatically increased the number of academies and free schools, and given heads more control over teacher training, continuous professional development and the improvement of underperforming schools. The school direct programme, by giving heads control of teacher recruitment, has improved the quality of new teachers. The creation of more than 300 teaching schools has put our most outstanding heads in charge of helping existing teachers to do even better. The academies programme has allowed great heads, such as those in the Harris and Ark chains, to take over underperforming schools such as the Downhills primary in Tottenham. I hope today that those on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_Front_Bench">Opposition Front Bench</a> will signal their support for these reforms and show that they, like us, trust our outstanding heads to drive improvement.</p> <p pid="a.782.1/9">The fourth pillar of reform is accountability. Those systems that have autonomy without accountability often underperform. Accountability has to be intelligent, which is why we have sharpened Ofsted inspections, recruited more outstanding serving teachers to inspect schools and demanded that underperforming schools improve far faster. The old league table system relied too much on a narrow measurement of C passes at GCSE, which generated the wrong incentives and wrote off too many children. We have changed league tables to ensure that every child&#8217;s progress is rewarded. We have also ensured that children are not entered early, or multiple times, for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCSEs">GCSEs</a> simply to influence league tables. I hope today that those on the Opposition Front Bench will endorse those changes and join us in demanding greater rigour and higher standards from all schools.</p> <p pid="a.782.1/11">The fifth pillar of reform is freedom for heads to recruit and reward the best. Shanghai, the world&#8217;s best-performing education system, has a rigorous system of performance-related pay. We have given head teachers the same freedoms here. I hope today that we can have a clear commitment from all parts of the House to support those brave and principled heads who want to pay the best teachers more.</p> <p pid="a.782.1/12">The programme of reform that we have set out draws on what happens in the best school systems&#8212;identified today by the OECD&#8212;because we want nothing but the best for our children. Unless we can provide them with a school system that is one of the best in the world, we will not give them the opportunities that they need to flourish and succeed. That is why it is so important that we have a unified national commitment to excellence in all our schools and for all our pupils. I commend this statement to the House.</p>            </div>

I am disappointed that he has adopted&#8212;both today and in various media outings&#8212;such a partisan approach to the data from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA">PISA</a>. Rather than throwing chum to his <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Benchers">Back Benchers</a>, he should concentrate on the lessons we can learn from today&#8217;s important study.</p> <p pid="a.784.0/2">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> cannot have it both ways. If, as he said in <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a></i>, the Labour party should take its share of the responsibility for these results, would he not agree that it should also take responsibility for, in his words, delivering the</p> <p pid="a.784.0/3">&#8220;best generation of teachers this country has ever seen&#8221;?</p> <p pid="a.784.0/4">It is clear that for all the hard work of our head teachers, teachers, parents and learning support staff, whom the Secretary of State rightly praised, we have a long way to go in English, maths and science to match our global competitors. These findings are a wake-up call for our schools. The PISA data reveal the continuing strength of east Asian countries and although there are important cultural differences that we should seek to understand, there are also pointers to reform in our schools system. So, can the Secretary of State confirm that part of the success of Singapore and Shanghai is down to the high quality of teachers in the classroom?</p> <p pid="a.784.0/5">In Shanghai, all teachers have a teaching qualification and undergo 240 hours of professional development within the first five years of teaching. Under the Secretary of State&#8217;s deregulation agenda, the South Leeds academy can advertise for an &#8220;unqualified maths teacher&#8221; with just four <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCSEs">GCSEs</a>. We have seen a 141% increase in unqualified teachers in free schools and academies under this Government, so will he join the Schools <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and me in working to secure qualified teachers in our classrooms?</p> <p pid="a.784.0/7">Secondly, can the Secretary of State confirm that part of the east Asian education system is that schools work together, collaborate and challenge each other? Under their system, no school is left an island. Will he now abandon his aggressive discredited free-market reforms to schools and follow the Labour party&#8217;s lead in developing the kind of middle tier that brings schools together to work with, challenge and collaborate with one another?</p> <p pid="a.784.0/8">In 2008, the Secretary of State informed the <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail">Daily Mail</a></i>, his journal of choice:</p> <p pid="a.784.0/9">&#8220;We have seen the future in Sweden and it works.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a.784.0/10">Will he confirm today that that is no longer the case? In fact, no other country has fallen as abruptly as Sweden in maths over a 10-year period. Across all three measures&#8212;reading, maths and science&#8212;since 2009 Sweden has performed very poorly indeed. Many in Sweden regard the ideological programme of unqualified teachers and unregulated free schools as responsible for the drop in standards. The lesson from PISA is clear: we need freedom with accountability, autonomy with minimum standards, or else we end up with the chaos of the Secretary of State&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Madinah">Al-Madinah</a> school.</p> <p pid="a.784.0/11">Finally, does the Secretary of State believe that a culture of zero tolerance for low expectations in other education systems produces high results across the board and that no child should be left behind? Will he use this opportunity to join the <a href="/glossary/?gl=91" title="The office of Deputy Prime Minister is one that has only existed..." class="glossary">Deputy Prime Minister</a> and me in condemning the unpleasant whiff of eugenics from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_London">Mayor of London</a> and instead use the opportunity provided by the PISA data to pursue excellence for all, academic and vocational, in all our schools?</p>            </div>

He taxed me for demonstrating partisanship and indulging in personal attacks. I am glad that we had the opportunity to witness four minutes entirely free from those sins.</p> <p pid="a.785.0/2">First, let me turn to the whole question of qualified teachers. It is the case that there are now fewer unqualified teachers in our schools than under Labour. In 2009, there were 17,400 unqualified teachers, in 2010, just before Labour left office, there were 17,800 and there are now only 14,800, a significant reduction. Indeed, those teachers who are now joining the profession are better qualified than ever before. In 2009, just before the Labour party lost office, only 61% of teachers had a 2:1 or better as their undergraduate degree. Under the coalition Government, the figure is 74%, which is a clear improvement that has been driven by the changes that we have introduced. It has been reinforced by the introduction of the school direct system, which I invited the hon. Gentleman to applaud and welcome&#8212;he declined to do so&#8212;and which has secured even more top graduates with a 2:1 or better, including a first, in our schools.</p> <p pid="a.785.0/3">The hon. Gentleman mentioned Sweden. Unfortunately, it is the case that in Sweden results have slid, but as I said earlier, not only do we need to grant greater autonomy, as has been done for school leaders in Singapore, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, South Korea and elsewhere, but we need a more rigorous system of accountability. We heard nothing from him on how we would improve accountability. There was no indication as to whether or not he supports, as he has indicated in the past, our English baccalaureate measure. There was no indication from him, as there has been in the past, as to whether or not he supports A-level reform, and there was no indication, as there has been in the past, that he believes in a rigorous academic curriculum for all. The terrible truth about the situation that we face in our schools is that Labour does not have a strong record to defend, and it does not have a strong policy to advance. That is why the coalition Government are committed to reform, and that is why, I am afraid, the hon. Gentleman must do better.</p>            </div>

He is absolutely right&#8212;there was a significant increase in investment and, as I mentioned in my statement, we have one of the most socially just system of education funding in the developed world. However, we did not move forward as we should have done. My hon. Friend asks, of course, when we will see the fruits of our reform programme. As <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Schleicher">Andreas Schleicher</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> asked yesterday: is it too early on the basis of these results to judge the coalition reforms? Absolutely, we could not possibly judge the coalition Government on these results, he said. We are &#8220;moving from&#8221; ideas &#8220;to implementation&#8221;, and 2015 would be the very earliest.</p> <p pid="a.786.1/2">My hon. Friend makes the vital point that we need to do more to promote mathematics and science. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_English">The English</a> baccalaureate does that. The increased emphasis in many academies and free schools that have opened under the Government does that, but there is still more that we can do, and I shall meet representatives from higher education and our best schools just before Christmas to see what we can do to encourage more girls to do even better in mathematics and science.</p>            </div>

Should not the Institute of Education and Canterbury Christ Church, two of the biggest teacher training institutions, be held to account, not only for today&#8217;s poor figures but for the country&#8217;s long tail of underachievement? Education academics are quick to condemn much-needed reform, but there is always a deafening silence from them on days&#8212;</p>            </div>

He is a teacher himself, so he knows how important it is to make sure that learning is targeted at children in an appropriate way to recognise the different abilities that different children have at different stages in their lives. Through the pupil premium, we are making sure that more money is spent at every stage of a child&#8217;s life if they come from a poorer background. We are also changing the way in which league tables operate so that more schools have to pay more attention to children from underprivileged backgrounds to ensure that we get the most out of them.</p>            </div>

Member for Derby North (Chris Williamson)'">Chris Williamson</a>, the increase in the number of unqualified teachers in academies and free schools is a direct result of the nationalisation of independent schools. Overall, the reduction under this Government in the number of teachers without teaching qualifications reflects the fact that teachers are now better qualified than ever before. Critically, the decision over who to hire should be a matter for head teachers. It is critical to the success of any education system that we respect the autonomy of great head teachers to recruit people with the right qualifications for their community and students.</p>            </div>
