Yesterday, on <phrase class="date" code="2021-07-19">19 July</phrase>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> joined like-minded partners to confirm that Chinese state-backed actors were responsible for gaining access to computer networks around the world via Microsoft exchange servers. As the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> made clear in a statement yesterday, this cyber-attack by Chinese state-backed groups was reckless, but sadly a familiar pattern of behaviour. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> must end this systematic cyber-sabotage and can expect to be held to account if they do not.</p> <p pid="b809.2/2">The attack was highly likely intended to enable large-scale espionage, including acquiring personally identifiable information and <a href="/glossary/?gl=261" title="patents (for inventions), trade marks, protected designs, and copyrights;..." class="glossary">intellectual property</a>. At the time of the attack, the UK quickly provided advice and recommended actions to those affected. Microsoft has reported that, at the end of March, 92% of customers had installed the updates that protected against the vulnerability.</p> <p pid="b809.2/3">As part of that announcement, the UK also attributed the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Ministry_of_State_Security">Chinese Ministry of State Security</a> as being behind activity known by cyber-security experts as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT40">APT40</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT31">APT31</a>. Widespread, credible evidence demonstrates that sustained irresponsible cyber activity emanating from China continues. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese">The Chinese</a> Government have ignored repeated calls to end their reckless campaign, instead allowing their state-backed actors to increase the scale of their attacks and act recklessly when caught.</p> <p pid="b809.2/4">Statements formally attributing Chinese responsibility for the Microsoft exchange attack and actions of APT40 and APT31 were issued by the EU, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a>, the UK, Canada, the US, Australia, New Zealand, Norway and Japan. That co-ordinated action by 39 countries sees the international community once again calling on the Chinese Government to take responsibility for their actions and respect the democratic institutions and personal commercial interests of those they seek to partner with. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> is calling on China to reaffirm the commitment made to the UK in 2015 as part of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20">G20</a> not to conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property or trade secrets.</p>            </div>

Friend. Will he explain why the Government did not come to the House yesterday to make a statement? Given that this is  an aggressive attack, why are the Government allowing the UK&#8217;s largest silicon chip manufacturer, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Wafer_Fab">Newport Wafer Fab</a>, to be bought by a Chinese firm when they know very well what they are up to? Why is it that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Justice_Department">US Justice Department</a>, also with this, brought federal criminal charges against four named <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSS">MSS</a> officers over their role in the hacking of the American targets, yet no such charges have been brought against operatives here?</p> <p pid="b809.3/4">The integrated review said clearly that Russia was a threat to the UK, but China was merely a competitor. I wonder why, if China goes on attacking us and trashing us, we continue with this deceit when it is quite clear that China is a clear and present threat. Beyond tearing up the treaty, conducting a genocide and upsetting the international order, China has now been found to be conducting systematic attacks on targets in the UK. Will the Government now finally agree to a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing winter Olympics to make their statement clear?</p> <p pid="b809.3/5">On a personal note, you will know, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Speaker">Mr Speaker</a>, that I set up, with others, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Parliamentary_Alliance_on_China">Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China</a>&#8212;politicians left and right in 20 countries who are concerned about China&#8217;s activities. There are over 200 members. I understand now that there is intelligence from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a> sources that shows that a very active and direct threat from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> is aimed directly at the co-chairs of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China. Some of the co-chairs, of which I am one, have now been warned by their intelligence services in receipt of this that they should be very careful and that they will be supported. Can I ask my right hon. Friend to confirm whether his Government are in receipt of this same intelligence and, if so, why have they not informed the co-chairs and others here in the UK, as other allies have done?</p> <p pid="b809.3/6">Finally, Mr Speaker, China is not just a competitor. These attacks tell us that they are a clear and present threat to the United Kingdom and to our beliefs in freedom, justice, democracy and the rule of law and human rights. It is time that the Government stood up, made that clear and boycotted these Olympic games.</p>            </div>

When will the Government finally update it? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> says that this is a pattern of behaviour, and he is right, but Ministers have tried naming and shaming before. It did not work then, so why would it work now? Only weeks ago, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Xi">President Xi</a> said that those who expressed dissent about China&#8217;s actions would</p> <p class="indent" pid="b811.0/3" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;have their heads bashed bloody against the Great Wall Of Steel forged by over 1.4 billion Chinese people.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b811.0/4">Last year the Government were willing to act. They announced targeted sanctions against individuals involved in the Russian state-backed cyber-attack on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Parliament">German Parliament</a>. So why are there no sanctions in response to the Chinese state-backed cyber-attack on, among others, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_Parliament">Finnish Parliament</a>?</p> <p pid="b811.0/5">The truth is that the Government are unable to send a clear, coherent message to Beijing because they are still arguing among themselves. Just two weeks ago, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> was telling <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansion_House">Mansion House</a> that it was time to realise the potential of our relationship with China. While the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> imposes sanctions, the Chancellor is cashing cheques. It is extraordinary that the Minister can stand at the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> today and refuse to tell us how he will safeguard critical infrastructure, or whether he and his colleagues will board a plane to Beijing early next year to participate in a public relations exercise. The seriousness of this attack must concentrate minds. We need a coherent strategy. When are we likely to get one?</p>            </div>

Lady raised, we estimate&#8212;we can only estimate&#8212;that 3,000 UK-based organisations were put at risk by this attack. It was an untargeted action. It was not targeted at specific sectors. We do not believe that Government organisations were a victim of it, and because it was an untargeted action it is not possible for me to give a credible assessment of the economic damage  of this particular attack. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cyber_Security_Centre">National Cyber Security Centre</a> and Microsoft gave advice at the time and, as I say, by the end of March it was estimated that 92% of organisations had installed the patch to protect themselves. Advice is available to any organisation that still thinks it may be at risk in some way, both from the National Cyber Security Centre and from Microsoft.</p> <p pid="b811.1/2">With regard to our attendance at the winter Olympics, my right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> answered that point in departmental questions. There is nothing more that I can add to that.</p> <p pid="b811.1/3">The hon. Lady asked about naming and shaming. The fact that 39 countries collectively put their name to the statement is unprecedented, and it sends a significant signal that countries are working together to steer China&#8217;s actions. China is a significant economic and political player. We cannot pretend that China does not exist. We want China to change its behaviour, and we will work with international partners to urge it to do so. As I say, we reserve the right to take further actions if necessary.</p>            </div>

As I have said, we will  continue to work with our international partners to persuade China to come into accordance with the international standards and norms that we see other countries around the world subscribing to. We want China to be a better-behaved international player. We cannot pretend China away; we cannot prevent China trading and investing around the world, and neither should we, but we should ensure that its behaviour comes into line with the international values, norms and standards that the rest of us subscribe to.</p>            </div>

Friend makes an important point: working with our international partners is an incredibly important part of this. The joint statement that we made attributing responsibility to Chinese state-backed actors is important because it is the precursor that legitimates further actions that we might take. It seeks to make it clear to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> that we can see what is happening&#8212;we are not blind to what is happening&#8212;and there is no veil of anonymity behind which they can hide. That then gives us, as part of the international community, the opportunity to go further if required. As I said in my statement, we have made it clear, and are making it clear, to China that such future actions will not go unresponded to.</p>            </div>

Friend that the UK is very much taking a leadership role with regard to the development of cyber-security and cyber-response. We are always most effective on issues such as these when we work in close conjunction with our international partners, and I can therefore assure him that at multilateral gatherings this will always be one of the issues that is important to us. On the practical steps that people can take, I would urge people to heed the advice from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cyber_Security_Centre">National Cyber Security Centre</a> and take a range of relatively simple and practical steps that will help to protect them and their organisations from cyber-attacks.</p>            </div>

Ultimately it is not the job of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> to dictate to other countries how they interact with China, but we are and will always be a powerful advocate for human rights, for the protection of <a href="/glossary/?gl=261" title="patents (for inventions), trade marks, protected designs, and copyrights;..." class="glossary">intellectual property</a> and for those norms of behaviour that the international community, including ourselves, very much holds dear.

He does make an incredibly important point though, and it reflects the point that I have made that we cannot simply ignore China. A previous question this morning highlighted the fact that China is still heavily reliant on coal as an energy production source, and we know the climate change implications of that. We want China to behave better on the international stage both on things such as cyber-security, <a href="/glossary/?gl=261" title="patents (for inventions), trade marks, protected designs, and copyrights;..." class="glossary">intellectual property</a> and human rights, but also on the incredibly important agenda that will affect our children, our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren, which is the protection of the environment and a move towards greener energy generation.</p>            </div>

Internationally, we will have to look at how we deal with this new sphere of human activity. It is moving quickly and there is not an established framework to which the international community subscribes in the way there is for armed conflict, for example. That is an incredibly important point.</p> <p pid="b821.1/2">I also thank the hon. Gentleman for recognising the significance of having a range of international partners and multinational institutions on the statement that we made yesterday. As I have said a number of times, it is an important but necessary precursor to other actions that we might take. It highlights to China that we can see what action it is taking and also that its actions contradict commitments that it has made. We are not trying to hold China to our standards; we are trying to hold it to standards that it has put forward itself. That is an important part of trying to establish a global acceptable framework on behaviour in cyber-space.</p>            </div>
