We also remember the victims and loved ones of the terrorist attacks that took place in the United States 22 years ago today, including many British citizens.</p> <p pid="c909.1/3">I have just returned from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20_summit">G20 summit</a> in India. At the summit I had three aims: first, to increase diplomatic pressure on Russia and call out its shameful disruption of global food supplies in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea">Black Sea</a>; secondly, to show the world that democracies such as the United Kingdom, not authoritarian regimes, are leading the fight on global challenges such as development and climate change; and thirdly, to strengthen ties and forge new partnerships to deliver jobs, growth and security for the British people.</p> <p pid="c909.1/4">The world faces a moment of danger, volatility and increasingly rapid change, but even as most G20 leaders came together in Delhi in a spirit of co-operation, one did not. For two years now, Putin has lacked the courage to face his G20 peers. Day after day, his actions cause horrendous suffering in Ukraine, violating the United Nations charter, threatening European security and disrupting global energy and food supplies. The spillovers have driven up prices here at home and are hurting people all around the world. Russia&#8217;s withdrawal from the Black Sea grain initiative exposes its willingness to spread that suffering further. While Putin stalls, making unmeetable demands, he is destroying Ukraine&#8217;s ports and grain silos. In just one month, Russia has destroyed over 270,000 tonnes of grain&#8212;enough to feed 1 million people for a year. I can tell the House today that, thanks to declassified intelligence, we know that on <phrase class="date" code="">24 August</phrase> the Russian military targeted a civilian cargo ship in the Black Sea with multiple missiles, demonstrating just how desperate Putin is.</p> <p pid="c909.1/5">At the G20, leaders united in calling out the &#8216;human suffering&#8217; caused by Putin&#8217;s war. Ukraine has the right to export its goods through international waters, and it has the moral right to ship grain that is helping to feed the world. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> is working with partners to get grain to those who need it most. We will provide &#163;3 million for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme">World Food Programme</a>, building on earlier contributions to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Zelensky">President Zelensky</a>&#8217;s &#8216;Grain from Ukraine&#8217; initiative. We are using our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities to monitor Russian activity in the Black Sea, so that we can call it out if we see that Russia is preparing further attacks on civilian shipping or infrastructure, and so that we can attribute attacks should they happen. Later this year, we are hosting a UK global food security summit to put in place solutions for the long term.</p> <p pid="c909.1/6">I spoke to my friend President Zelensky just before the summit. Backed by our support, Ukraine&#8217;s counteroffensive is making hard-won progress. We will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes, until we see a &#8216;just and durable peace&#8217; that respects its sovereignty and territorial integrity. That is the only possible outcome to Putin&#8217;s illegal war, and Ukraine, with our support, will prevail.</p> <p pid="c909.1/7">On my second aim, we showed at the G20 that it is the UK and our partners, not authoritarian actors, that offer the best solution to the global challenges we face. We are playing our part to stabilise the global economy, control inflation and fuel future growth. The latest figures from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics">Office for National Statistics</a> show the UK is leading the way, growing faster out of the pandemic than any other major European economy, and demolishing the false narratives we have heard from the other side of this House. We are also leading the way on development assistance. Instead of loading countries with debt, we are calling for fundamental reforms of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank">World Bank</a>. When I met the World Bank president, I underlined the UK&#8217;s desire to see the bank become more efficient and responsible, sweating its balance sheet to deliver more support where it is needed.</p> <p pid="c909.1/8">We are also leading calls at the G20 to safely harness new technologies to support growth and development, and we are leading action to tackle climate change. While some in Westminster denigrate the UK&#8217;s record on climate issues, out there in the world we are rightly seen as a global leader. We have cut emissions faster than any other <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a> country, with low-carbon sources now providing over half our electricity. We are providing billions for the global energy transition, including through our pioneering just energy transition partnerships. And at the G20 I made a record commitment of over &#163;1.6 billion for the green climate fund&#8212;the single biggest international climate pledge that the UK has ever made.</p> <p pid="c909.1/9">Finally, my most important aim in Delhi was to deliver on the priorities of the British people. In a changing world, we are using our Brexit freedoms to build new relationships with economies around the world. Since I became Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, we have joined the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPTPP">CPTPP</a>&#8212;the most dynamic trading bloc in the world. We have launched new partnerships with Canada, Australia, Japan and the US, covering trade and economic security. We have secured agreements with France, Albania, Turkey and others to stop illegal migration. At the G20, I went further. We signed a new strategic partnership with Singapore to boost growth, jobs and security. I held warm and productive discussions with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_Modi">Prime Minister Modi</a> on strengthening our relationship in defence, technology and a free trade deal between our nations.</p> <p pid="c909.1/10">I also met <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Li">Premier Li</a> of China. The whole House is rightly appalled about reports of espionage in this building. The sanctity of <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> must be protected, and the right of Members to speak their minds without fear or sanction must be maintained. We will defend our democracy and our security, so I was emphatic with Premier Li that actions that seek to undermine British democracy are completely unacceptable and will never be tolerated. I also emphasised the UK&#8217;s unyielding commitment to human rights, and I was  clear on the importance of maintaining stability and international law as the basis for stable relations. China is a permanent member of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</a>, the world&#8217;s second-largest economy and the world&#8217;s largest emitter of carbon dioxide. It has growing influence on others, notably Russia. One of my messages to Premier Li was that China should use its influence to call on Russia to end its aggression against Ukraine. The G20 showed a common purpose on food security, and we need to see that in other areas.</p> <p pid="c909.1/11">This Government have acted decisively to improve our security, blocking China&#8217;s involvement in critical areas such as civil nuclear power, semiconductors and 5G. I pay tribute to the tireless work of our security services. We will shortly set out our response to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a>&#8217;s report on China. In November last year, the Government set up a new Defending Democracy Taskforce. Its mission is to reduce the risk to the UK&#8217;s democratic processes, institutions and society, and to ensure they are secure and resilient to threats of foreign interference. The importance of that work is clear for all to see. Crucially, in taking that approach, we are aligned with each and every one of our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a> allies and with every G7 partner. By speaking frankly and directly, we will ensure our messages are heard clearly and that our interests and values are protected and promoted.</p> <p pid="c909.1/12">At a time of rapid change, we are bringing British values and British leadership to bear on the biggest global challenges. As one of the fastest-growing major economies, the second-largest contributor to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> and a global leader in everything from climate to tech to development, I am proud of the UK&#8217;s leadership. It is through that leadership, working with our allies and partners, that we will increase our security, grow our economy and deliver on the priorities of the British people. I commend this Statement to the House&#8221;.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c911.0/1">My Lords, I thank the Lord Privy Seal for repeating the Statement. It helps the House when Statements are repeated; I am grateful to him for doing so.</p> <p pid="c911.0/2">As the G20 got under way, the scale of the devastation caused by the earthquake in Morocco was becoming evident. Today, the death toll continues to rise towards 3,000, with almost as many reported injuries. I entirely concur with the noble Lord&#8217;s comments, and our thoughts and condolences are with those affected and those aiding the rescue efforts. Alongside other nations, UK specialist search and rescue teams are working with the Moroccan authorities in a race against time to try to find and treat survivors. We know that a number of UK citizens have been affected. I do not know whether the noble Lord can comment on this, but it would be helpful if he could say something about the efforts being made to ensure that UK citizens can return home at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p pid="c911.0/3">As the Lord Privy Seal said, this is the week in which we should remember the victims of the 2001 9/11 attacks and those who risked their lives trying to rescue others. It is a further reminder that we must always strive to make our country and communities safer and more resilient. As we look to secure future  security, we recognise that, for some, their lives will never be the same. With the ongoing war in Ukraine as a backdrop to the G20 in New Delhi, there can be no greater reminder of the need for nations to stand together against terrorism and aggression, and to support countries dealing with major disasters.</p> <p pid="c911.0/4">This year&#8217;s G20 was a real opportunity to secure progress on international issues. With the Government and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> consistently united against Putin&#8217;s unjust invasion&#8212;the noble Lord has made that comment himself&#8212;and seeking international co-operation to help Ukraine, I think we all would have hoped for an unequivocal statement from the G20. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_Privy_Seal">The Lord Privy Seal</a> may not wish to comment on that, but I suspect he would concur that that is also what he would have sought. It would have been a hugely significant expression of support if the international community had agreed to work towards an agreement about repurposing Russia&#8217;s frozen assets to help reconstruct Ukraine. The fact that it was not an unequivocal statement of support means that, whatever its other merits, the communiqu&#233; is a disappointment.</p> <p pid="c911.0/5">We generally welcome and encourage the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>&#8217;s comments on global food supplies in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea">Black Sea</a> and his personal condemnation against Putin. The Lord Privy Seal will know that the need for further action is urgent. Can he say anything more or give an update on preparations for the November summit on food security? Does he have some detail on whether, and what, progress was made in this regard in Delhi?</p> <p pid="c911.0/6">The inclusion of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union">African Union</a> in the G20 reflects Africa&#8217;s progress as the world&#8217;s fastest-growing continent. We should also support the increasing role of Africa on the world stage. Does the noble Lord consider that the inclusion of the African Union might represent a step towards a greater role for African states in, for example, the UN?</p> <p pid="c911.0/7">The important announcement of a new partnership for global infrastructure and investment represents an exciting prospect for the world to have an alternative to China&#8217;s intercontinental belt and road initiative, but that partnership will not involve the UK. I have a number of questions on this that I hope the noble Lord can clarify. Did we decline the opportunity to sign up, or was it never on offer&#8212;were we not offered the opportunity to do so? Will there be opportunities for the UK to play a role in these arrangements in the future? How does it fit in with Ministers&#8217; ongoing rhetoric on global Britain when we are not part of such an exciting and crucial partnership?</p> <p pid="c911.0/8">I will also ask the noble Lord about the trade deal between the UK and India. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> has referred to the &#8220;real political momentum&#8221;, but there does not appear to be any tangible evidence of that following the summit. Can the noble Lord shed some light on the reasons for Mr Hunt&#8217;s optimism? This is a key government promise, yet deadlines have been and gone. There does not appear to be any progress, but he might be able to enlighten me: can he identify and outline the genuine progress, or is it still wishful thinking at this stage?</p> <p pid="c911.0/9">So, there is no UK-India trade deal and we are being left out of the new infrastructure and investment. Those are worrying indicators for the UK. Can the  noble Lord say something about what our strategic plans are for the future of the UK and our place in the world?</p> <p pid="c911.0/10"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_US">The US</a> has the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act">Inflation Reduction Act</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU">EU</a> is relaxing the rules to allow for greater green subsidies. The Government may disagree with those policies, but their promises of increased global trade and this wonderful new land of increased investment post Brexit are just not being met. Whatever disagreements we have on foreign and domestic policy, we do agree on the UK&#8217;s potential. With our expertise and creativity, we should be able to attract investment and trade, but it has to be as part of an international, outward-looking strategy for the economic, environmental and foreign policy challenges of the future. I have no doubt that we can meet those challenges, but if this Government are to do so we need to see a better, confident and credible plan.</p>            </div>

From these Benches, we also send our sympathies to the people of Morocco in the aftermath of the earthquake. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> is already sending search and rescue teams, but do the Government have any plans to contribute financially to the reconstruction effort which is now under way and which is going to be long and arduous?</p> <p pid="c913.0/2">On the outcome of the G20, I probably should not admit it, but I have some sympathy with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>. There are deep and unbridgeable rifts between G20 members on a range of issues, most notably Ukraine, and it would be unrealistic to expect harmony to have broken out on all these in Delhi. It seems to me that criticism of the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> on this ground is pretty naive. As is so often the case with this kind of summit, the value appears to lie principally in the discussions which were able to take place outside the full sessions, so I believe it had considerable value despite the inability to make progress on some of the big issues.</p> <p pid="c913.0/3">On Ukraine, we applaud the Government&#8217;s attempts to get more grain out of the country. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> discussed this issue at length in the Statement and said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c913.0/4">&#8220;The UK is working with partners to get grain to those who need it most&#8221;.</p> <p pid="c913.0/5">Will the noble Lord explain what tangible support the UK is giving or planning to give to increase the volume of these much-needed grain shipments?</p> <p pid="c913.0/6">The Prime Minister held a much-heralded meeting with President Modi, principally to advance a trade deal between our countries, but as the noble Baroness said, the Statement is extremely coy about any progress made. There was much speculation in the run-up to Delhi that a deal would be struck before Christmas. Can the noble Lord give the House an assessment of how realistic he believes such a timescale to be?</p> <p pid="c913.0/7">One of the principal announcements around the summit, as the noble Baroness mentioned, was the signing of a new partnership for global infrastructure and investment. The UK was not a signatory to this agreement despite having been involved in its inception. Can the noble Lord tell the House why not? It has the  potential to be a significant counterweight to China&#8217;s belt and road strategy and is therefore of direct relevance to our trade and security. Will the UK make any financial contributions to the initiative or take part in discussions with the other partners on its future?</p> <p pid="c913.0/8">The Prime Minister gave a detailed account of his discussions with his Chinese counterpart, but the words &#8220;Hong Kong&#8221; do not appear in the Statement. At present, the Hong Kong authorities, with Beijing&#8217;s backing, are actively offering bounties against pro- democracy <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kongers">Hong Kongers</a> now in the UK. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_States">The United States</a> has sanctioned those responsible for the crackdown in Hong Kong, but this Government have surprisingly failed to sanction a single person. Will the Government now specifically condemn what would, in effect, be kidnapping and commit to protecting Hong Kongers in the UK? Will they use sanctions, like the Americans, against those responsible for dismantling Hong Kong&#8217;s democracy?</p> <p pid="c913.0/9">The principal aims which the Prime Minister set in attending the G20 were: maintaining pressure on Russia; showing that the UK is leading the fight on global challenges such as climate change; and strengthening international ties. Those are admirable but need to be pursued consistently, so it is a surprise to see that the Prime Minister has decided not to attend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_General_Assembly">UN General Assembly</a> later this month. This is the largest international summit and an annual opportunity to promote our values and our policy priorities. Can the noble Lord explain why the Prime Minister has decided not to go to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a>, and could he suggest to him that it is not too late for him to change his mind?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c914.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful for those responses, and I will try to pick up at least some of the points made. Anything I do not, I will try to pick up later. First, I am grateful for and share the sentiments that noble Baroness and the noble Lord expressed about the catastrophe in Morocco. I lived through an earthquake of 6.5 on the Richter scale and saw the damage it did to property, lives and communities. The degree of devastation and force that one experiences is unimaginable. At 6.8, this earthquake was twice as strong as the Italian earthquake to which I refer. One can only begin to imagine the horror and the scale of what needs to be done. Our thoughts and prayers remain with everyone who was affected, as the whole House has said. We are supporting our Moroccan friends, as was acknowledged in the House. We have deployed emergency response teams to Morocco to assist with rescue efforts. They are in Marrakesh. They have started search and rescue efforts. We also are deploying a medical assessment team to assist in the work. As for helping British nationals, this is an important issue. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Foreign_Office">The Foreign Office</a> has already received a small number of requests for assistance from British nationals in Morocco. We stand ready to assist British nationals, and consular support is available 24 hours a day, every day.</p> <p pid="c914.0/2">The noble Baroness and the noble Lord asked whether the communique could have said more about the atrocious activities of Russia. One would always wish that one might say more about those matters. The reality is that this was a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20_summit">G20 summit</a>. In fact, one of the extraordinary and notable things about it was that  in some paragraphs of the communique India and, indeed, China&#8212;I think for the first time in such a community&#8212;assented to a call for a just peace based on territorial integrity for Ukraine. If you look at the text, you will see that implicitly <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_India">China and India</a> committed to support a just and lasting peace. That is an important matter. These are delicate diplomatic issues. Every nation has its own perception of the world, but the G20 was able to come forward together with that very important statement.</p> <p pid="c914.0/3">On Ukraine, obviously much of that was covered in the initial Statement. We continue our full degree of support. I was asked about the use of frozen Russian assets for the purposes of reconstruction. We are committed to exploring all legal routes for using frozen Russian assets for reconstruction in Ukraine. We laid legislation in June to enable us to keep sanctions in place until Russia pays compensation. In fact, that delivers on the commitment the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a> made earlier this year that sovereign assets will remain immobilised until Russia pays for damage it has caused to Ukraine.</p> <p pid="c914.0/4">I welcome what the noble Lord and the noble Baroness said about global food security. This was a very important step forward at the conference, particularly against the background of the Russian attacks on grain. I was asked what the further steps would be. On <phrase class="date" code="">20 November</phrase>, the UK will host a global food security summit towards zero hunger and ending malnutrition. This will work on bringing leadership internationally and strengthening key science, technology, finance and climate partnerships to prevent famine, wider food insecurity and malnutrition. It will be an important moment for this country but, much more importantly, for international co-operation. I am sure that noble Lords will welcome that.</p> <p pid="c914.0/5">I was asked about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union">African Union</a>. We are delighted that there was agreement to African Union membership of the G20. As global leaders, frankly, we need to ensure the focus of the international system and the benefits of development, trade and prosperity are more equitably shared than is the case today, and the presence of the African Union should help us to achieve both and so&#8212;I say to the noble Lord, Lord Newby&#8212;would African representation on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a>. These are issues on which we reflect.</p> <p pid="c914.0/6">As far as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership_for_Global_Infrastructure_and_Investment">Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment</a> is concerned, noble Lords should remember that this initiative was launched during our own G7 presidency in 2021. It is something that the UK is much committed to. We have announced a series of flagship projects working with G7 and other partners to deliver responsible development. This is an interlocking set of initiatives. As regards this particular initiative, which was agreed at the G20, Japan did not sign it, for example, and neither did Italy. It is an agreement relating to a particular set of nations and fits in to a wider framework of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. Under our British investment partnership approach with India, we have invested more than &#163;2.3 billion to support 600 enterprises employing about half a million people.</p> <p pid="c914.0/7">I was asked by both parties about the relationship with India. We are not setting a date on any specific target. The talks that took place involving the Foreign  Secretary, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and their counterparts were extremely positive and constructive. We will continue to negotiate with India to secure a comprehensive and ambitious trade deal. Round 12 of negotiations concluded on <phrase class="date" code="">31 August</phrase>. Meetings took place. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Business and Trade met with India&#8217;s Ministers for commerce and finance, and they discussed how to make further meaningful progress on the admittedly complex next phase focused on goods, services and investment. Our Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_Modi">Prime Minister Modi</a> reaffirmed their joint commitment to securing an ambitious deal that helps us to unlock greater opportunities for trade. We must get the right deal; the answer is to get that, not a deal by a specific target date. The discussions were constructive and helpful.</p> <p pid="c914.0/8">I totally agree with what the noble Lord said about Hong Kong. We discussed that briefly yesterday. I can assure him and other noble Lords that we will take the most vigorous action against anyone involved in threatening or undermining the security of those good people from Hong Kong: refugees from the tyranny of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party">Chinese Communist Party</a> whom we have all united in welcoming to this country. We will support them, both nationally and internationally.</p> <p pid="c914.0/9">On the grain initiative, which I was asked about, that is obviously important. We welcome the efforts of Turkey and the UN to try to get this matter moving again. We call on Russia to return to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea">Black Sea</a> grain initiative. That was in the communiqu&#233;. Russia must engage seriously with Turkey and the UN and we are engaging with both to support diplomatic efforts. As I said in the Statement, Ukraine has the right to export its grain.</p> <p pid="c914.0/10">Let us not forget that the UK&#8217;s total military, humanitarian and economic support for Ukraine now amounts to &#163;9.3 billion. I can assure the House that, both in seeking to open the grain routes and in other areas, we will continue that support, on which this House is resolutely united. I am grateful to both parties for that.</p>            </div>

Obviously, I associate myself with the sympathies expressed over the horrific earthquake in the Atlas mountains and the need to rally round and support Morocco, which will be an increasingly important country for our own relationships in the coming decades.</p> <p pid="c916.0/2">I would have liked to hear a slightly tougher line come out on Ukraine, as I think we all would. Clearly, more persuasion is required to establish that we are not talking just about ideology, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_and_East">West and East</a> and all those out-of-date concepts. We are talking about a direct, criminal assault on humanity and the stable world order. The sooner that message is established everywhere, regardless of trade or past connections, the better for bringing Russia to book.</p> <p pid="c916.0/3">One omission did surprise me; in fact, the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, mentioned it and my noble friend also made some comments. It is on the accession of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union">African Union</a>&#8212;all 55 countries&#8212;to the G20. This is an enormous change. If they all turn up, it will completely swamp the G20; even if just their secretariat  and leadership turn up, this really does remind us of the change in the world balance of power, prosperity and development in the future.</p> <p pid="c916.0/4">Africa is heading for a population of 1 billion within this century. What is happening in Africa and India makes them increasingly the pivots and central points in the balance of world development, and between the attempted hegemonies of China to overthrow the world order of the last 50 years and the kind of balance we would like to see here in Britain, which is one of independence for more and more countries as they face the problems of the future.</p> <p pid="c916.0/5">It is also worth remembering that 21 of those 55 countries are members of the Commonwealth. As I said, I am quite surprised that more was not made of this in the Statement itself. I do not know whether my noble friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> would like to comment a little further, but this is where our interests will be increasingly focused and where the new priorities in our foreign policy need to be sharpened up; so, I would welcome perhaps a little more on how the African Union fits into this completely changed world scene, but I thank the Minister all the same for making the Statement.</p>            </div>

I fear that it is a few years, perhaps decades, since I had a hand in the drafting of prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=34" title="Ministerial statements are made after questions and urgent questions,..." class="glossary">ministerial Statements</a>, so I cannot comment on the selection of material, but I can certainly say that the Government and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, all of us, do support and welcome this. It is something that was negotiated with the positive support and promotion&#8212;with other nations&#8212;of the United Kingdom.</p> <p pid="c917.0/2">It is absolutely vital that we make progress with relations and support for Africa. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> is one of the largest supporters of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme">World Food Programme</a>. We provided over &#163;330 million of funding in 2022, including to Africa. Trade should also be a force for good. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Africa">In Africa</a> it is a remarkable and welcome thing that 98% of goods imported to the UK from Africa will enter tariff-free. These are things we must continue. We have &#163;3.4 billion of green investments in Kenya, for example. I can certainly undertake to the noble Lord that the Government are very much seized of the importance of that great continent&#8212;the continent of the future.</p> <p pid="c917.0/3">As far as Russia is concerned, I did allude to the difficulties of agreeing. For 20 nations to agree words is often a diplomatic task, but it is fundamental&#8212;a point that I made in my initial response&#8212;that all G20 members, including actually Russia, committed in the declaration to a</p> <p class="indent" pid="c917.0/4">&#8220;comprehensive, just, and durable peace in Ukraine that will uphold all the Purposes and Principles of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Charter">UN Charter</a>&#8221;.</p> <p pid="c917.0/5">That is something that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Zelensky">President Zelensky</a> asked for last year at the Bali summit, and something that we will advance. If you think about it, Lavrov was there&#8212;Russia was at the G20 and under the terms of the declaration Russia has told the leaders of the biggest global economies that it will uphold all the principles of the UN Charter and refrain from the use of force  for territorial acquisition. Unless Putin withdraws his troops, he will have lied to the world&#8212;perhaps not for the first time.</p>            </div>

On climate change, there is no doubt that the UK is seen, rightly, as a leader. I repeated some of the reasons for that in the Statement. At the G20 we made a $2 billion pledge&#8212;&#163;1.6 billion&#8212;to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Climate_Fund">Green Climate Fund</a>. That maintains our position as one of the top donors to the world&#8217;s biggest climate fund. I think it was a little churlish of the noble Lord, for whom I have the greatest affection, to say that no commitment was displayed. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> has been a top donor to the fund since its inception in 2015 and, frankly, this latest pledge ensures that we will remain so.

I think that says quite a lot about diversity and opportunity in this country. I realise that the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> comes from a well-heeled background: nevertheless, it is wonderful to see a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Prime_Minister">British Prime Minister</a> from that background representing us.</p> <p pid="c918.4/2">On Morocco, is the Minister aware of reports that that country is turning down aid from some countries? As for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_India">China and India</a>, of course, however well we may do in this country on getting our carbon emissions down, it will pale into insignificance if we cannot get those countries&#8212;and indeed the US&#8212;to bring theirs down.

I think it is the first time in four or five years that there has been a meeting with such a high-level member of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>, and he was certainly told in no uncertain terms what the UK thinks in relation to human rights, Hong Kong and other matters.</p> <p pid="c919.0/2">I will not follow his comments on the nature of the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>. I think the Prime Minister values the relationships we seek to forge internationally across the world. If, by some good fortune, his personality is helpful in a particular relationship, that would be good fortune, but let us not underestimate that getting diplomatic deals is not a matter of sentiment. Of course, one applauds the diversity that one sees in all parties at the moment, but getting deals is a matter of hard negotiation. That is what counts at the end of the day &#8212;not sentiment.</p> <p pid="c919.0/3">I have not seen the reports that Morocco is turning down support, but I will look into the matter and refer the noble Lord&#8217;s comments to my colleagues in the Foreign Office. I believe the noble Lord asked another question, which has slipped my mind. I will look at Hansard, if I may, and follow up on it.</p>            </div>
