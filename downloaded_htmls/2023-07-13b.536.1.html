Some of those individuals now reside in the UK. As I said at the time, that is completely unacceptable. Since then, the authorities in Hong Kong have taken further steps to silence and intimidate those individuals by targeting their families and alleged associates who remain in Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="b535.1/3">Last week, five individuals were arrested by the Hong Kong police. On Monday, family members of one of the named individuals, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Law">Nathan Law</a>, were detained for questioning by the Hong Kong police, and have since been released. That is a very worrying development. It is a campaign of fear intended to intimidate and silence those who seek to speak out peacefully against oppression and the erosion of rights and freedoms. It is a choice that the Hong Kong authorities have taken, no doubt emboldened by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>&#8217;s imposition of the national security law. It will only further damage Hong Kong&#8217;s international reputation and standing.</p> <p pid="b535.1/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> declared the national security law a breach of the Sino-British joint declaration, and brought together the international community to condemn its imposition. We introduced the bespoke visa route for British nationals overseas. Hongkongers have since made the UK their home and are making a valuable contribution to our communities. We suspended the UK-Hong Kong extradition treaty immediately and indefinitely. We also announced the extension to Hong Kong of the arms embargo that has applied to mainland China since 1989, as updated in 1998.</p> <p pid="b535.1/5">I would like to make it exceptionally clear that we will not tolerate attempts by the Chinese or Hong Kong authorities to intimidate or silence any individuals in the UK. Any attempt by any foreign power to intimidate, harass or harm individuals or communities in the UK will not be tolerated. That is an insidious threat to our democracy and fundamental human rights.</p> <p pid="b535.1/6">On <phrase class="date" code="">3 July</phrase>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> called on the Hong Kong authorities to end their targeting of those who stand up for freedom and democracy. They have not heeded that call. At the instruction of the Foreign Secretary, his senior official will formally protest recent actions by the Hong Kong authorities with the Chinese ambassador. We have consistently made clear our objections to the Beijing-imposed national security law with the Chinese Government, and will continue to do so. It has stifled <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> and criminalised dissent. The authorities claim that it has brought stability to Hong Kong, but what it has really done is stifle the unique character of the city, diminishing its pluralism and vibrancy. If that course of action continues, it will alienate business and the city&#8217;s international financial status will be at risk.</p> <p pid="b535.1/7"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hong_Kong">The Hong Kong</a> and Chinese authorities repeatedly condemn comments in this House and by the Government as interfering in their internal affairs. As a co-signatory to the joint declaration, we have the right to make clear  our position. We will not be deterred from doing that. We will also make it clear that, as a co-signatory to that declaration, China is breaching agreements that it signed up to uphold. The national security law should never have been imposed in 2020, and should be removed. The independent <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Human_Rights_Council">UN Human Rights Council</a> concurred with that in its report on Hong Kong last year, as have many of our partners in the international community. No one living in the UK should feel inhibited by that law in any way. We will always stand up for the right of freedom of expression.</p> <p pid="b535.1/8">This is not what the UK wants for Hong Kong&#8217;s future. Hong Kong&#8217;s way of life, prosperity and stability rely on respect for fundamental freedoms, an independent judiciary and the rule of law. We will continue to stand up for the people of Hong Kong, to call out violations of their rights and freedoms, and to hold China to its international obligations. I commend this statement to the House.</p>            </div>

The handover agreement promised Hong Kong certain liberties and freedoms, with a clear separation between the judicial systems of Hong Kong and the mainland, and the expectation of a move towards full democracy and universal suffrage for the election of a chief executive in the territory of Hong Kong. However, those freedoms have now been comprehensively eroded, with the system in Hong Kong barely distinguishable from that on the mainland and the levels of repression ever increasing.</p> <p pid="b536.1/3">The implementation of the national security law is only truly beginning to be felt. It is clear that Beijing is attempting to ensure that its writ is felt not just in Hong Kong but around the world. Just days after the announcement of arrest warrants for Hongkongers abroad&#8212;including some who have sought refuge here in the UK&#8212;the Chinese Government have again demonstrated their intent to harass and intimidate those who bravely resist their steady erosion of the rights promised to the people of Hong Kong in 1997.</p> <p pid="b536.1/4">This latest move is particularly chilling. Targeting activists&#8217; families is a sinister step, and it is incumbent on us to renew our condemnation of those actions as one unified voice across this House. However, it is not a surprising move, given that the actions of the Chinese Government have been ratcheting up in the past year, including the beating of demonstrators outside the consulate in Manchester, the bellicose language used against the state&#8217;s opponents and growing accusations of Chinese espionage in the UK. The fear of the many thousands of Hongkongers who have come to this country to seek safety is growing. The knowledge that their families in Hong Kong are seen as fair game by the authorities there demands stringent and urgent action.</p> <p pid="b536.1/5">It is over a year since I first urged the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> to bring about cross-Government work to ensure the safety of Hong Kong dissidents here. We have had two further <a href="/glossary/?gl=19" title="An Urgent Question, formerly a Private Notice Question (PNQ), is a question..." class="glossary">urgent questions</a> on that point,  but today I do not believe the House is satisfied by the Government&#8217;s actions. The complacency cannot continue, given the reports that a Chinese spy attended a briefing here in Parliament just this week. Could the Minister clarify her assessment of that urgent situation? Given the activities of the last week, will she outline what consideration she has given to a sanctioning regime that fits the ratcheting up of pressure on dissidents and those trying to live their lives here in the UK in safety?</p> <p pid="b536.1/6">There are steps that the Government should and could take today to send a clear signal to Beijing that those actions will not be tolerated. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> should take them. I said it last week and I will say it again: it is time for the Government to grow a backbone.</p>            </div>

I assumed it was going to say something really important, but I should have known better.</p> <p pid="b537.1/2">It has taken 11 days for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a> to come to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a>&#8212;11 days after the bounties were placed on the heads of eight people, three of whom are here in the United Kingdom. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Law">Nathan Law</a>&#8217;s family had their house raided and were taken into the police station. I do not know how much more we need to know about what is going on in Hong Kong and the abuses to take some action.</p> <p pid="b537.1/3">I have some very simple questions to ask my right hon.

Will the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> finally meet Nathan Law, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Lau">Finn Lau</a> and Chris Mung, the three people the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCDO">FCDO</a> have refused to meet throughout the whole time they have been here escaping the clutches of the security forces in Hong Kong? Why will it not meet them? Will the Government now sanction <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lee">John Lee</a>, the chief executive of Hong Kong? America has sanctioned something like 10 officials in Hong Kong. We were the ones who jointly ran the place and we have sanctioned zero people. Let us get something going here to show them what is going on.</p> <p pid="b537.1/4">Will the Government tell us whether they are able to block Interpol red notices for Hongkongers from third countries? That is vital&#8212;they are scared stiff about what will happen to them if they move anywhere. After the lack of support for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Lai">Jimmy Lai</a>&#8212;who is a British citizen, not a joint national, and the Government will not simply say that&#8212;do not the Government agree that  our approach to joint nationality now needs to change? We need to be clear that British citizens have the right to be protected by us.</p> <p pid="b537.1/5">It is time we stopped worrying about upsetting the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>, and started defending those who are in our protection and representing British citizens properly. It is time to act, not come here to make fake statements.</p>            </div>

I am pleased that Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a> granted me the opportunity to do just that, so we can, for the second time in two weeks, sadly, discuss these entirely shocking and unacceptable behaviours by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>.</p> <p pid="b538.0/2">In answer to my right hon. Friend&#8217;s questions, on sanctions, as the House knows too well&#8212;sadly, as we have to sanction often, we say this often&#8212;it is not appropriate for me to speculate on who may be designated in future, so as to avoid reducing the impact of any designations. We will continue to keep all issues of potential individual or enterprise sanctions under review. That relates not just to China, but to all such countries across the world. As colleagues know, we are using our sanctions powers extensively to ensure we degrade as much as we can Putin&#8217;s illegal war.</p> <p pid="b538.0/3">On Mr Lai, who is a dual British national, I have raised, as do our teams in Beijing, consular access for Mr Lai. The challenge we are faced with is that under the Vienna convention it is for the resident country to determine whether a dual national is entitled to that. Sadly, in China and Hong Kong, it is not given. We continue to press for that.

However, I think we are all in agreement that the imposition of the bounties is an unacceptable and dangerous precedent, as is the barely veiled threat to the families of the Hong Kong activists living abroad. That is also intolerable.</p> <p pid="b538.2/2">On behalf of my party, I welcome that the Governments of the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia have all called for the bounties to be withdrawn. We support those calls. We remain deeply concerned by the continuing erosion of Hong Kong&#8217;s fundamental rights, freedoms and autonomy. The disturbing and worrying announcement of the bounties can be seen as the most drastic law enforcement action since the initial arrests that followed the introduction of the national security law in June 2020. Already, the eight activists are living in self-imposed exile, and the announcement of warrants and bounties makes their lives immediately all the more stressful. I hope that the Minister can help to reduce some of that stress.</p> <p pid="b538.2/3">Can the Minister confirm that it is illegal to issue and pursue bounties in the UK and that the Government will prosecute anyone who takes up those bounties? Can the Minister confirm whether the UK will co-operate  with Australia and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US">US</a> on an Interpol early warning system to protect pro-democracy activists living overseas? When the bounties were issued 10 days ago, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> did not summon the Chinese ambassador to express their concerns face to face. Why did they not do so at that time? I am also concerned about the lack of Government action on holding Hong Kong and Chinese officials accountable for their ongoing crackdown on human rights. When will Ministers finally sanction those responsible, such as Hong Kong Chief Executive <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lee">John Lee</a>?</p>            </div>

It is an unacceptable situation. The wider challenge around the national security law, which we continue to call to be lifted, is simply that it highlights the unacceptability of the Hong Kong authorities&#8217; decision to target leading pro-democracy figures who are here under the safety that the UK provides them with. We continue to make those objections absolutely clear. Indeed, diplomats&#8212;our team from the consulate general in Hong Kong&#8212;attend NSL47 court proceedings and will continue to do so, despite the limitations on their ability to do that.</p>            </div>

As I say, over the weekend, I will read in detail the report from a Committee that always has a depth of wisdom, because it includes those who have spent many years in this House and who understand the workings of our democracy and Parliament. We will  continue to work with it, but I dispute that there is not clarity. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>&#8217;s speech at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House">Chatham House</a> a few months ago set out a very clear framework around protecting our assets, aligning our interests where we can, engaging on many issues&#8212;many of which will be beyond our borders&#8212;and working together on issues such as development and climate change challenges. That was very clear. The integrated review refresh, which was published a couple of months ago, set out in more detail what that means. We have a clear direction of travel in which we are very comfortable working, and the whole of Government is aligning around that to deliver positives, where necessary, and to protect UK interests as required.</p>            </div>

The reports of undeclared police stations in parts of the UK were very concerning and were taken   very seriously, because any foreign country operating on UK soil must always abide by UK law. The police have done a substantial amount of work and have examined those allegations. They have not, to date, identified any evidence of illegal activity, but none the less, these so-called police service stations were established without our permission. Their presence, whatever the low level of administrative activity they were performing, has worried and intimidated many who have left China and sought safety here in the UK. We have made it clear to the Chinese authorities that the existence of undeclared sites in the UK is unacceptable and that their operation must cease. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese">The Chinese</a> authorities have confirmed that they have now been closed.</p>            </div>

They have no validity here in the UK, and we will continue to raise the threatening behaviour that has been seen towards the family members of those who are here in the UK for their safety. When the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>&#8217;s senior official meets the Chinese ambassador, these issues will be raised very clearly.</p>            </div>
