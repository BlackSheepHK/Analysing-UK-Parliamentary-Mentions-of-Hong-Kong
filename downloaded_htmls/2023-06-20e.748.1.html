                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="e721.0/1">Let me first thank all right hon. and hon. Members who have taken part in debates on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Bill">Finance Bill</a> so far. Today is Report stage, but there has been intense scrutiny of many measures in the Bill, not just line by line in Committee on the Committee Corridor but, importantly, in <a href="/glossary/?gl=96" title="The clause by clause consideration of a parliamentary bill takes place at..." class="glossary">Committee of the whole House</a>. I hope that I will hear from right hon. and hon. Members on some of those discussions.</p> <p pid="e721.0/2">We are focusing on a number of proposed amendments to the Bill, which I will address in turn. Many of the Government&#8217;s amendments focus on ensuring the proper functioning of the legislation in response to scrutiny from businesses, business representative groups, parliamentarians and feedback. Others take forward responses to substantive issues that have emerged during the Bill&#8217;s passage. This is an exercise of how scrutiny in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> works, and I hope it works well. I will address each Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> in turn in this part of the debate. To reassure colleagues, I want to listen to the debates that will follow on non-Government amendments and proposed new clauses, and I hope to deal with points raised by right hon. and hon. Members when I wind up.</p> <p pid="e721.0/3">Government amendments 9 and 10 seek to ensure that our policy of full expensing achieves its intended affect. The existing wording can result in balancing charges being incorrectly calculated by not applying the correct apportionment to the disposal receipts. This is a straightforward and necessary technical adjustment to a policy that will help businesses to invest with confidence and boost UK productivity.</p> <p pid="e721.0/4">Government amendments 11, 12 and 13 provide that both the decarbonisation allowance and the existing investment allowance in the energy profits levy work as intended. They correct unintended exclusions by revising definitions to ensure that the investment allowances apply throughout the UK, in UK waters and on the United Kingdom continental shelf.</p> <p pid="e721.0/5">Government amendment 14 is a minor technical amendment that concerns the lifetime allowance&#8212;specifically, in <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 23, which allows modifications of certain existing transitional protections to ensure that stand-alone lump sums can continue to be paid to those who are entitled. The amendment clarifies the tax treatment for any amount above the limited <phrase class="date" code="">5 April</phrase> maximum. The amendment is required to avoid an unintended outcome that would otherwise arise as a result of the removal of the lifetime allowance charge, whereby those who are entitled to stand-alone lump sums may not have been able to access their full benefit. The amendment corrects that. We are grateful to members of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Majesty">His Majesty</a>&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_and_Customs">Revenue and Customs</a> pensions industry stakeholder forum for raising the issue.</p> <p pid="e721.0/6">New clause 4 relates to the domestic minimum top-up tax, which is part of the global minimum tax agreement. That agreement protects against large multinational groups and companies using aggressive tax planning and shifting their UK profits overseas. The amendment simply puts beyond doubt that the commencement date for the domestic top-up tax aligns with the multinational top-up tax and the internationally agreed timings, and  no earlier. The start date is for accounting periods beginning on or after <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2023</phrase>. We will discuss the global minimum tax agreement in more detail later, precisely because it is of particular interest to right hon. and hon. Members. I will respond to those further arguments and suggestions when I wind up.</p> <p pid="e721.0/7">Amendments 15 and 16 relate to the Bill&#8217;s provisions on alcohol duties and seek to ensure that alcoholic products produced overseas and imported into the UK are not excluded from the new draught relief or small producer relief. This is a technical amendment to ensure that the new reliefs apply equally to alcoholic products produced domestically and overseas and meet the originally intended policy aims. The amendments mean that the condition to be approved by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMRC">HMRC</a> applies to UK producers only.</p> <p pid="e721.0/8">Government amendment 17 on the electricity generator levy seeks to ensure that the provision works as intended and in accordance with the policy that the Government set out at the end of last year in its published technical notes in legislation. It will confirm that receipts of joint ventures attributed to their members are taxed whether or not the member is a generator, to ensure that those members are liable as intended. The amendment will ensure that the Government&#8217;s policy intention is clear in the specific provisions for joint venture members, and that the electricity generator levy collects the right amount of tax from the correct taxpayers.</p> <p pid="e721.0/9">Government amendments 18 and 19 intend to avoid any uncertainty for those planning new deposit return schemes, which introduces rules on accounting for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAT">VAT</a> on deposits charged under statutory deposit return schemes. The amendment will put beyond doubt that VAT is due on unreturned drink deposits, removing any uncertainty for affected businesses.</p> <p pid="e721.0/10">New clause 5 makes technical changes to ensure HMRC&#8217;s civil information powers work as Parliament intended, to support its tax collection functions. The new clause will clarify the law to put beyond doubt that HMRC may continue to collect what is termed &#8220;communications data&#8221;, including essential information such as names, addresses and dates of birth from businesses and third parties. Following a recent change by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> to its interpretation of communications data under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigatory_Powers_Act_2016">Investigatory Powers Act 2016</a>, the clause will simply ensure that existing legislation continues to function exactly as Parliament originally intended, including the important safeguards already in place for the protection of citizens&#8217; data.</p>            </div>

There was a great deal of concentration and discussion, as I recall&#8212;the House will have to forgive me as I am rolodexing back several years in my memory&#8212;about the meaning of communications data, because of the sensitivities in  relation to some of the powers rightly given to our security services in order to safeguard national security and for other purposes.</p> <p pid="e722.1/2">There has been some debate about how the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">General Data Protection Regulation</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Act">Data Protection Act</a> apply in the years that have fallen since. The clarification has been made because the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> wanted to ensure that it defines that accurately, protects citizens&#8217; rights and permits Government agencies, law enforcement agencies and other agencies to collect and review the data necessary to protect us all. We are tabling this <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> now at the first opportunity we have had, to ensure that that phrasing still permits <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMRC">HMRC</a> to collect the vital data that we need to ensure that our taxes are collected properly. To sum up my point on new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 5, the civil information powers allow HMRC to continue to collect vital revenue to fund our public services.</p> <p pid="e722.1/3">In conclusion, the Government&#8217;s proposed amendments will ensure that the legislation works as it should and that HMRC has the powers it needs to continue collecting tax revenue that is vital to fund our public services that so many in our country rely on. I will, of course, address all amendments tabled by other Members when I wind up later. I very much want to listen closely to the debate that will now follow. In the meantime, I commend amendments 9 to 19 and new clauses 4 and 5 to the House. I urge hon. Members to accept them in due course.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="e723.0/1">It is important, briefly, to first recognise the context in which we consider amendments and new clauses to the Bill. Yesterday we heard the news that the average rate for a two-year fixed-rate mortgage has now breached 6% for the first time since December. That news will leave the 400,000 people across the country whose existing fixed deals end between July and September feeling anxious and fearful. They face the prospect of having hundreds of pounds less in their pockets each month when their current deal expires and they have to re-mortgage. That is not to mention all those on variable rates, who have already seen their payments rise relentlessly as a result of interest rates going up again and again.</p> <p pid="e723.0/2">Across the country, mortgage payers are facing interest rate rises to above 6% for the second time in 12 months. The first time came in the wake of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a>&#8217; disastrous mini-budget last autumn; now it is because inflation means that banks expect interest rates to stay higher for far longer than anyone feared. The truth is that mortgage payers are feeling pain because the Tories crashed the economy and have no plan to fix it. What is more, we know the current increases in mortgage payments come after 13 years of low growth and stagnant wages. They also come after 25 tax rises by the Government in this Parliament alone, increases that have pushed the tax burden in this country to its highest level in 70 years.</p> <p pid="e723.0/3">I will begin considering the detail of our amendments on Report by focusing on something very rare indeed: a tax cut from this Government. That tax cut is included in <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 18. Through that section of the Bill, the Government will be spending &#163;1 billion of public money a year to benefit the 1% of people with the biggest pension pots. Ministers may claim that their decision  was driven by a desire to get doctors back into work, but since the policy was first announced the Government have flatly rejected any call to consider a fairer and less costly fix targeted at doctors&#8217; pensions.</p> <p pid="e723.0/4">It is not just Labour who have been questioning the Government&#8217;s approach; the Conservative Chair of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_Committee">Treasury Committee</a>, <a href="/mp/?p=24785" title="Our page on Harriett Baldwin - 'the hon. Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin)'">Harriett Baldwin</a>, said that even she was surprised that Ministers had opted for a blanket cut rather than a bespoke policy for doctors. That is why we will be voting today for our <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 1, which deletes clause 18, thereby abandoning plans for this blanket change that fails to spend public money wisely. As our new clause 1 makes clear, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> should finally do what so many have been calling on him to do and produce an alternative approach to pensions that is targeted at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a> doctors and provides taxpayers with value for money.</p>            </div>

I am trying to work out exactly what point was being made there, but I think the overall point is clear.

Can he not see the difficulty of having a specific regime for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a> doctors? For example, if he were to bring in a specific regime, would it apply to doctors who also work in the private sector? What would happen if an NHS doctor changed career and became an accountant? There are other areas where we have difficulty securing the services of public servants beyond a certain point, for example judges, prison governors or senior police officers. Is he proposing that each of those areas should have their own specific scheme and that therefore we should build a sort of rats&#8217; nest of complexity around pensions?</p>            </div>

Gentleman for his comments, but I feel he is misguided in claiming that it is somehow only Labour calling for a doctors-only pension scheme to be investigated. I referred to the Chair of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_Committee">Treasury Committee</a>, but I could also refer to the current <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a>&#8212;the current Chancellor&#8212;who less than a year ago suggested that we should go for a doctors-only scheme. All we are asking is for the current Chancellor to do what he told himself to do less than a year ago and investigate the possibilities. That is important, because that is how we spend public money wisely.</p> <p pid="e724.3/2">To return to air passenger duty, Ministers may try to point out, when we discuss it later in the debate, that the lower rate of domestic air passenger duty has been accompanied by the introduction of an ultra long-haul rate. But when taken together, the air passenger duty changes in the Bill are set to cost the taxpayer an additional &#163;35 million a year. That cannot be the right priority for spending public money. In Committee, we tried to get to the bottom of why this tax cut is being prioritised.</p>            </div>

We are trying to challenge the position of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> on air passenger duty.</p> <p pid="e725.1/2">Whatever the UK Government say, the reasoning behind air passenger duty changes have been hard to come by.

I asked the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> whether, if someone were to travel by helicopter around the UK, for instance from London and Southampton, that would be subject to air passenger duty. I could equally have asked if that would be the case if someone were to get a helicopter ride from London to Dover. At the time, the Minister clarified that there is no air passenger duty other than on fixed-wing aircraft, so that anyone wanting to make short hops in a helicopter can rest assured that this tax would not apply.</p> <p pid="e725.1/3">I also asked the Minister whether, if someone travelled on a private jet around the UK from, say, London to Blackpool, what rate of air passenger duty would apply in that case. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> confirmed that private jets will not benefit from the domestic air passenger duty cut&#8212;something the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> may want to let his neighbour on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street">Downing Street</a> know. Finally, I asked the Minister what rate of air passenger duty would apply if someone lived in the UK but was travelling to another home of theirs, let us say in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Monica,_California">Santa Monica, California</a>. The Minister did not say at the time whether such a flight would attract the ultra long-haul rate, but my understanding is that it would not, so anyone on the Government Benches who needs to fly to their <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles">Los Angeles</a> home will not be hit.</p> <p pid="e725.1/4">It is clear from the Tories&#8217; approach that they have no idea how to spend public money wisely, and that their judgment over what to prioritise is at odds with the British people. Under the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> in this Parliament alone, people across Britain have faced 25 tax rises and 12 interest rate rises. Yet the Tories think the priorities for taxpayers&#8217; money in the middle of a cost of living crisis should be tax cuts for frequent flyers and for those with the very largest pension pots. The truth is that under the Conservatives, working people always end up paying the bill.</p>            </div>

Gentleman for his <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>. At one point I thought he was touching on a point that we might agree on, which is that spending public money is about priorities. It is about making choices on how to spend public money wisely. That is important at any stage for any Government, but in the middle of a cost of living crisis, when household budgets are being stretched and people are facing mortgage payments going up relentlessly, it is more important than ever that we prioritise the spending of public money and spend taxpayers&#8217; money wisely. That is really at the heart of the argument I am making. We need a fairer tax system in this country, but time and again the Conservative Government have ignored chances that were in front of them to do something about it. Our new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 9 relates to the Government&#8217;s approach to non-dom tax status&#8212;the &#163;3.2 billion a year loophole that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> called &#8220;that non-dom thing&#8221;.</p> <p pid="e726.0/2">As we discussed in Committee, clause 36 will affect non-doms who claim the remittance basis, as it will stop them using a non-UK holding company to avoid tax on chargeable gains made on a UK business. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> may remember that when we debated non-dom tax status on <phrase class="date" code="">31 January</phrase>, she was keen to claim that the measure we are now considering would &#8220;close a loophole&#8221; in the non-dom legislation. However, she was not so keen to explain that, as the Government&#8217;s own policy paper admits, the measure will raise&#8212;on average, over the next five years&#8212;just one twentieth of the &#163;3.2 billion lost through non-dom tax status every year.</p> <p pid="e726.0/3">Labour believes that if people make Britain their home, they should pay their taxes here. That patriotic point should be accepted in all parts of both sides of the political divide, but Ministers in this Government, under this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister">Prime Minister</a>, seem desperate to defend the non-dom loophole. We will keep pressing the Government to think again and to follow our plan to abolish non-dom status, replace it with a modern system, and use the money raised to strengthen the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a>, childcare and the economy.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="e726.2/1">I would welcome a more extended debate about non-dom tax status. That might be slightly outside the remit of today&#8217;s debate, but I refer the hon. Gentleman to some very good research conducted by the London School of Economics and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick_University">Warwick University</a> on the impact of people potentially leaving the UK as a result of any changes in non-dom status. Getting rid of  non-dom status would still net &#163;3.2 billion a year according to the work done by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSE">LSE</a> and Warwick, which is based on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMRC">HMRC</a> data which they have looked at and which constitutes reputable evidence showing what would happen in that event. As I have said, we would replace non-dom status with a modern system like the one that operates in many other countries around the world.</p> <p pid="e726.2/2">Let me link the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point to the point made earlier by <a href="/mp/?p=24903" title="Our page on Richard Drax - 'the hon. Member for South Dorset (Richard Drax)'">Richard Drax</a>. This is about priorities. What is the priority for expenditure of &#163;3.2 billion a year? Is it protecting non-dom tax status, or is it strengthening the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a> and childcare? That is at the heart of the question we are asking today.</p> <p pid="e726.2/3">As well as closing the non-dom loophole&#8212;about which I could speak at length&#8212; we will keep pressing the Government to close gaps in their approach to the windfall tax on oil and gas giants. Our new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 8 presses them to think again about their investment allowance loopholes. We believe it is wrong for Ministers to leave billions of pounds of windfall profits for oil and gas giants on the table when some of that money should be helping to support families through the cost of living crisis.</p> <p pid="e726.2/4">We know, of course, that making our tax system fairer is not just a question of having the right legislation in place domestically; it is also a question of working with other countries to end the race to the bottom among large multinationals around the world. As our new clause 7 makes clear, we want the Government to remain committed to implementing the global agreement on a minimum rate of corporate tax. This landmark deal from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> is an important step towards ending the international race to the bottom on tax, as it calls time on large multinationals which operate in the UK but use low-tax jurisdictions overseas to avoid paying their fair share of tax. When large multinationals do that, it flies in the face of the British sense of fairness, it deprives public services in our country of much-needed funding, and it undercuts and undermines British businesses that play by the rules.</p> <p pid="e726.2/5">As we have made clear throughout consideration of the Bill, we are glad to see this legislation being implemented. We want to see the global agreement in place so that large multinationals pay a minimum level of 15% tax in each jurisdiction in which they operate. We have raised the need for such an international deal many times with the Government. Indeed, I first pressed Treasury Ministers on the subject more than two years ago, on <phrase class="date" code="">13 April 2021</phrase>, during <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> of an earlier <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Bill">Finance Bill</a>. At the time, we suspected that the Government might be dragging their feet because they wanted to keep alive the possibility of a race to the bottom in the future, but now, with Ministers having finally agreed to implement the deal&#8212;albeit in a version that they allowed to be weakened from what was originally proposed&#8212;<a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> to it has galvanised those on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> Back Benches.</p> <p pid="e726.2/6">Two days ago, <a href="/mp/?p=24778" title="Our page on Priti Patel - 'the right hon.

The headline described the common-sense approach taken with the global minimum corporate tax rate&#8212;the approach that her colleagues on the Conservative <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> want to implement&#8212;as a</p> <p class="indent" pid="e726.2/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;radical plan for permanent worldwide socialism&#8221;.</p> <p pid="e726.2/8">The right hon.

Efforts to scupper the implementation of the deal constitute an astonishing act of self-sabotage on our public finances. The reality is that if the UK walks away now from implementing these rules, businesses will simply be taxed by other countries which have implemented the deal. Let me reassure the Minister that if the amendment is pushed to a vote by Conservative Back Benchers, we will oppose it, so Ministers need not worry about whether they will be able to vote it down even if they lose their <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> through a Back-Bench rebellion.</p> <p pid="e726.2/11">What on earth does this situation say about the state of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> and about the weakness of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>? The amendment, which brazenly undermines the Government&#8217;s position, has been signed by right hon. and hon. Members who, within the last 12 months, have held the offices of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister">Prime Minister</a>, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Levelling up, Housing and Communities, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and a raft of other ministerial positions.

Member for Richmond (Yorks)</phrase> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak">Rishi Sunak</a>) became the third Conservative Prime Minister to be forced from office in 12 months, and an MP who supports this amendment took over his role? The truth is the Conservatives have now become totally incapable of offering any certainty or stability, but that certainty and stability is what businesses and investors so desperately want so that they can play their part in growing our economy and raising living standards for people across Britain.</p>            </div>

The amendments to which I am speaking would give legislative effect to the recommendations of the report we published last week on the work of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Tax_Simplification">Office of Tax Simplification</a>. The report is on the Table, and I encourage all hon. and right hon. Members to read it.</p> <p pid="e729.0/4">Across the House, I think we can all agree that, regardless of the level of tax, the tax system itself has become far too complex. To give an example, as a result of the Committee&#8217;s current inquiry on tax reliefs, we have finally found out how many tax reliefs there are in the tax code&#8212;1,180. The unnecessary complexity in our tax code makes the tax system expensive and difficult for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMRC">HMRC</a> to administer, makes the tax system confusing and makes it difficult for taxpayers to understand the choices on offer and the consequences of those choices for their after-tax income.</p> <p pid="e729.0/5">A complex tax system can be hugely costly for taxpayers and for those responsible for compliance with the tax code. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Secretary">Financial Secretary</a> to the Treasury was kind enough to give evidence to our Committee on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAT">VAT</a> system last week, and she described it as the &#8220;most complex&#8221; part of the tax system. VAT creates a crippling compliance burden for small businesses and, as a result, there is a massive pile-up of companies just underneath that &#163;85,000 turnover threshold. This shows that small, potentially dynamic, growing businesses&#8212;the engines of our economy&#8212;would rather stay under the threshold than deal with the VAT system.</p> <p pid="e729.0/6">Unfortunately, the VAT threshold is far from the only cliff edge in our tax and benefits systems. At worst, these cliff edges result in people being worse off for earning more money. In recent evidence to a joint session of the Treasury Committee and the Work and Pensions Committee, we heard how people can suddenly find themselves much worse off, after losing entitlements such as free school meals and council tax support, when they earn only a little more money. Indeed, next winter a person who earns an extra &#163;1 will take home &#163;900 less because they lose the cost of living support entitlement, which we reflected in a recent report. People would actually be better off by working less, or perhaps not working at all, and surely that is something we do not want to see in our tax and benefits systems.</p>            </div>

Not only do the wealthiest get the best tax advice, but general financial advice has now become so expensive in this country that only 8% of our constituents can afford to pay for it.</p> <p pid="e730.0/2">I turn to the example of a young father of, say, three children who is doing well at work and who gets a promotion taking his income above &#163;50,000 for the first time. We might think this would be unadulterated good news but, actually, the tax system will send him a message that this is perhaps not such a wise thing, because he will immediately go into the upper tax threshold and his marginal rate of tax will be 40%. He will get the extra 2 percentage point national insurance surcharge as well. If he has a student loan, 9% might be taken off the outstanding balance. And of course child benefit will start to taper. For a father of three children, that could mean a marginal withdrawal rate of a further 29%. Our potential go-getter would be left with only 20% of the pay rise he had been awarded, and this applies to the kind of people we want to encourage to take on pay rises and extra work because it is good for the economy.</p>            </div>

The point I am trying to make with my amendments, which I hope he will support, is that, by abolishing the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Tax_Simplification">Office of Tax Simplification</a>, we lose not only a source of valuable advice on how to simplify the tax system but the message that we want to do so, which I know the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> wants to convey.</p> <p pid="e730.2/2">Higher up the income scale, the &#163;100,000 income bracket triggers the withdrawal of the very welcome steps we have taken on tax-free childcare and the personal allowance. This means that a family with two children in full-time childcare, if they happen to live in London, would be better off earning &#163;99,999 than earning more than &#163;150,000 because they would have a more than 100% withdrawal of extra earnings in that income bracket, which is very distorting. It provides disincentives to work, and we see that obstacle to economic growth reflected in the workforce numbers produced by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics">Office for National Statistics</a>.</p> <p pid="e730.2/3">The Chancellor agrees that</p> <p class="indent" pid="e730.2/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;the tax system is overcomplicated and the trend of ever more complication must be reversed.&#8221;</p> <p pid="e730.2/5">It is surprising that, on coming to office, he chose not to reverse the abolition of the Office of Tax Simplification. It was established in 2010, and it was given a ringing endorsement by the Treasury in its 2021 statutory review. Disbanding the independent champion for simpler tax sits very uncomfortably with the Government&#8217;s insistence that tax simplification is a priority.</p> <p pid="e730.2/6">However, the most important factor in securing tax simplification in practice would be for the Chancellor to take on the personal responsibility for simplification that he pledged to take, which brings me to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_Committee">Treasury Committee</a>&#8217;s new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 2. We have heard that, while the Treasury and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMRC">HMRC</a> focus on new taxes, the Office of Tax Simplification did important practical work seeking to simplify the existing tax system. We also heard in our evidence session that the Office of Tax Simplification did good work listening to taxpayers to understand how the complexity of the tax system works against them. The reports of the Office of Tax Simplification were published very transparently, unlike the private advice given to Ministers, and they facilitated parliamentary scrutiny of tax simplification efforts.</p> <p pid="e730.2/7">The Chancellor told us that he intends to be a Chancellor who makes &#8220;progress on tax simplification.&#8221; I welcome the simplification of the lifetime allowance, which the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> opposed earlier, but the Committee wants the ability to hold him accountable for that. Under new clause 2, the Treasury would report to the Committee annually on the Chancellor&#8217;s promise to simplify taxes.</p>            </div>

Friend for that <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>, which made me think immediately of the measures in this Bill on the increased rate of corporation tax. That in itself is controversial, but we now have these ladders between 19% and 25%. Our Committee would be interested to see the letter that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Secretary">Financial Secretary</a> has undertaken to write to us annually include an assessment of not only new measures such as that on the behaviour of businesses&#8212;I highlighted the impact of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAT">VAT</a> measures just now&#8212;but of the existing body of tax law. As with the simplification of the  lifetime allowance, we must ensure that this Treasury and these Treasury Ministers focus relentlessly on how they can simplify the complexity and the behavioural signals that our tax system is sending, which are deterring people from entrepreneurialism, taking on extra work and earning higher incomes.

Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 3, which would compel the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> to assess the impacts of the Bill on poverty and inequalities, and, subsequently, our health.

So the ask is simple: that the Government should disclose their evaluation of the impact of their economic policies on the health of our constituents&#8212;that is it. It is fairly straightforward, and I think we are all aligned on that; these are ambitions the Government have professed to have in their levelling-up agenda. My new clause would contribute to that and to the achievement of the reduction in health inequalities to which the Government say they aspire. They should have nothing to fear from the transparency that this new clause would bring.</p> <p pid="e732.0/9">As we know, there is overwhelming evidence that socioeconomic inequalities are the key determinants of our health and, consequently, our health service use; inequalities in income, wealth and power will determine how long we are going to live and to live in good health. It is, therefore, only reasonable that the Government report on how the Finance Act will have an impact on those inequalities. For example, life expectancy for men is four years lower in Oldham than it is in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>&#8217;s <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>. In the past 13 years, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldham_Council">Oldham Council</a> has had &#163;230 million in funding cut from its central Government funding&#8212;that is 29% of its total budget in 2010. It has received funds through the competitive bidding processes for the towns fund and levelling-up fund totalling &#163;44 million. A <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCSE">GCSE</a> in maths is not required to see the shortfall there. However, in Surrey, where the Chancellor is an MP, people have seen their council budget cut by just 8.3%. The issues are clear when we compare that 8.3% with that 29%.</p> <p pid="e732.0/10">How can it be right that in the sixth richest country in the world people are dying younger because of their socioeconomic position? Poverty and inequality are not inevitable; they are political choices that can have deadly consequences. The pandemic revealed that stark reality, exposing how our structural socioeconomic inequalities impacted on who was infected by covid and their experience of the disease. People on low incomes were more likely to be infected and to die of covid; within that, and at  every other level of the income hierarchy, people of colour and people with disabilities were disproportionately represented in case numbers and deaths. If we are to prevent the same mistakes from happening, the Government must listen. If they do not listen to me, they should listen to Professors Sir <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Marmot">Michael Marmot</a>, Clare Bambra and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Pickett">Kate Pickett</a>, and to countless others. There is overwhelming evidence to show that structural inequalities in our country drove the unequal death toll from covid.</p> <p pid="e732.0/11">Michael Marmot revealed that instead of narrowing, health inequalities, including how long we are going to live and to live in good health, were getting worse; prior to covid, our life expectancy and healthy life expectancy was getting worse. Most significantly, his analysis showed that unlike the situation in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of other high-income countries, our life expectancy was flatlining. For the poorest 10% of the country, including in my part of the world, it was actually declining, with women being particularly affected. He showed that &#8220;place matters&#8221;; living in a deprived area in the north-east was worse health-wise than living in an equally deprived area in London.</p> <p pid="e732.0/12">Sir Michael also emphasised that it is predominantly the socioeconomic conditions that people are exposed to, not the NHS, that will drive their health status and how long they will live. Analysing the abundant evidence available, he attributed the shorter lives that people in poorer areas such as my north-west constituency are predominantly living to the disproportional Government cuts to local public services, support and income that they have experienced since 2010&#8212;and then the pandemic hit. As the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Audit_Office">National Audit Office</a> and others have outlined, it was always a question of when, not if, there would be a pandemic. Like many of us, Sir Michael has pointed out that the Government&#8217;s hubris can be seen not only in their pandemic management but in the high and unequal covid death toll. Improving our health and wellbeing must be a priority of this Government and an outcome of our economic&#8212;and other&#8212;policies.</p>            </div>

When we look at the socioeconomic inequalities and the social determinants of health, we see that they include both the quality of housing and people&#8217;s opportunities for healthy living. That all has an impact, but we know that our socioeconomic determinants are the key drivers&#8212;the most important ones&#8212;of our health outcomes. There is indisputable evidence about that, which is unfortunately not reflected in some of the choices the Government are making.</p> <p pid="e733.1/2">I am glad that my party has recognised that, along with the importance of tackling socioeconomic determinants of health, in our health mission. We will take a health-in-all policies approach to tackle the socioeconomic inequalities driving health inequalities across our country. We will create a Marmot England and introduce new mission-delivery boards to ensure Government Departments work together to tackle health inequalities. My new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.

As we have discussed previously&#8212;I was going to touch on this&#8212;the United States is not in a position to introduce the policy. It is a fact&#8212;politics in the US is like politics here or anywhere in the world&#8212;that the Republican party has made it abundantly clear that it will not allow this policy to go through. It wants to go further and to bring in legislation that will put retaliatory measures in place against countries that impose the new tax and burdens on US businesses and multinationals.</p> <p pid="e734.2/2">Returning to the amendment, I will come on to some specifics with regard to the dialogue I have been having with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> on this subject.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="e735.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. I would rather businesses had zero taxation policies. I should declare an interest: when I was a Treasury <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> many years ago, I undertook the fiscal review of oil and gas. Frankly, we need to do everything to stimulate investment in both oil and gas and renewables. I would like to see consistency in policies on that.</p> <p pid="e735.0/2">Specifically to my point about multinationals and how they are taxed in jurisdictions, I support the Government in the sense that it is right to look to close tax loopholes where we see companies operating in multiple jurisdictions, but the plans for a global minimum tax are wrong, as I have raised in the House before. They are wrong and flawed for a number of reasons.</p> <p pid="e735.0/3">No one would deny that the introduction of such a measure is complex&#8212;it is not straightforward. I paid attention to the comments made by the hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ealing_North">Ealing North</a>. There is no point just saying that we need to crack on and implement this; we have to do it in the right way, which is why I put forward the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>. It even gives the Government scope for more time to look at the complexities around its implementation and to look at what our competitors are doing. We should not rush headlong into this. These are complex changes that will be challenging to enforce; I will speak about that, too.</p> <p pid="e735.0/4">I believe the measure is anti-competitive. It undermines our fiscal sovereignty. Without labouring the point too much, we have left the EU. The Government have the ability to make their own tax <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> and fiscal sovereignty is crucial to this, too. Why are we are now going to surrender tax powers to the will of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a>?</p> <p pid="e735.0/5">Economic growth has already been mentioned by my hon. Friend the Chair of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_Committee">Treasury Committee</a>. We do not want to undermine our ability to be a low-tax global beacon of free trade. The Government are pursuing policies such as freeports. We all welcome that when it comes to competition, but we do not want to encourage a culture of subsidies, which this policy will do.</p> <p pid="e735.0/6">I believe that Governments and Parliaments must have flexibility to set their own fiscal policies and tax rates, striking a balance across all sectors, including multinational companies and small and medium-sized enterprises. Speaking as an MP for Essex, which is known to be an entrepreneurial county, SMEs are the backbone of our economy. We have to strike a balance between being competitive and having low tax rates to attract investment, and generating revenue to support public services&#8212;I agree with the hon. Member for Ealing North about that. If we are not competitive, we will not have the tax revenues to support public services. However, a minimum corporate tax would prevent us from doing that.</p> <p pid="e735.0/7">There are problems with the OECD&#8217;s plan, which is why I want to have greater scrutiny on implementation. The enforcement and implementation mechanisms are unclear and countries could find ways around them,  which should concern us. They could find loopholes to circumvent the policy. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> looks set to gold plate measures. We follow rules and standards when we sign up to them, which is the right thing to do when it comes to our Government policies. The same cannot be said for more than 130 countries that have taken an interest in the matter. For many, agreeing to the OECD framework appears to be more about rhetoric and the ability to take action on taxing multinationals, than making the changes necessary and following the committed approach that this Government plan to take. I have no doubt that the Minister will want to speak about that, because the Government are being diligent in their approach and more scrutiny is required.</p> <p pid="e735.0/8">Moreover, limiting fiscal freedoms opens the door for countries to entice investment from big businesses with big subsidies, which distorts the market. All hon. and right hon. Members will understand that in a subsidy race we simply cannot compete with the United States or even China. Some countries can pump millions of dollars into supporting investment from multinationals. That is not what we do in this country.</p> <p pid="e735.0/9">We are more competitive as a country in being able to deploy a full range of fiscal and tax-cutting powers, than we are in a race to the bottom with subsidies. There are serious concerns about how these plans will be enforced and, importantly, how disputes between countries will be resolved. I understand that negotiations with the OECD are taking longer than expected, which is not a surprise, and I think it will be some time before an agreement is reached, but by baking into primary legislation a requirement for us to implement without any further flexibility, we risk blindly signing up to a package where foreign officials could overrule decisions and interpretations in our own jurisdiction and in on our own Government.</p> <p pid="e735.0/10">The peer review panels, being set up to review implementation, could be made up of representatives from China or other hostile states&#8212;for example, Russia&#8212;all countries which are involved in the process and states that have concerning records on human rights, war crimes and other conflicts, which we debate in this House day in, day out. Frankly, they do not meet our standards and we should be cognisant of that. Our tax affairs could be judged by representatives from states that many in this House are concerned about.</p> <p pid="e735.0/11">There is then the issue of the date of implementation, which I have referred to in my amendment. The Government have been clear that they will implement the policy by the end of this year&#8212; as <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 264 states, from <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2023</phrase>. This measure, despite the concerns I am raising, can only have a chance of succeeding in the way the Government hope if it is implemented in a constituent manner by all states&#8212;or, if not that, by a critical mass&#8212;at the same time. This is where we have concerns. We are just not seeing this right now in other countries and among our competitors, because they are not as wedded to the date as we are. I understand why we have to put down the date to enshrine it in law.</p> <p pid="e735.0/12"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_States">The United States</a>, as my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24903" title="Our page on Richard Drax - 'the Member for South Dorset (Richard Drax)'">Richard Drax</a> has mentioned, will not be able to take this through to implementation by 2024. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republicans">The Republicans</a> in the House of Representatives are opposing those plans. But as well as opposing and preventing the US&#8212;our largest trading power&#8212;from introducing them, they are threatening retaliatory measures  on countries that implement the policy, and in doing so will penalise US-based companies. So we could have a situation where this Government introduce a tax measure that adversely impacts on our trade and investment with the US. Of course, that could have an impact on trade negotiations and some of the work that other Departments are doing&#8212;such as Business and Trade, for example.</p> <p pid="e735.0/13">It would be interesting to know from the Minister whether this issue was discussed by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the President in their recent bilateral talks. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_US">The US</a> is crucial in this, but it is not just the US that will not implement the policy. The EU members are not going to implement the policy fully on day one. They have been given six years to implement tit. In Asia, major economies and competitors are setting dates behind the UK: Japan, Singapore, Thailand and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>. Although that the Government have been clear about their intent, we need to know what they intend to do on implementation. I have put my own concerns about this tax on the record. I think the date is wrong.</p>            </div>

The purpose of scrutinising the Bill and discussing the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> is about the implementation and how the Government will pursue that. We have big concerns. Other countries are not moving forward, so we will be the first. We need a sensible and practical course of action. My amendment is reasonable.</p> <p pid="e737.1/2">I have had discussions with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> in particular. He has given some very clear assurances that, in the light of the points that I have raised, not just today but previously, and the conversations that I and all colleagues who have signed the amendment have had, in respect of the implementation of the tax, the Government have committed to bring to this House regular updates on what the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> is proposing with regards to policing pillar 2. That speaks to my point about how all the enforcement mechanisms will work and about whether countries will be circumventing the rules and the structures of pillar 2. Also, before the summer recess, they will bring forward some detailed assumptions and modelling. The Treasury has forecast and scored, as I understand it, the expected tax revenues from pillar 2. That is something that I have been pursuing and asking specific questions about. It is important that we understand not only what revenues are gained, but the costs that will be incurred, particularly by businesses.</p> <p pid="e737.1/3">I have received clear assurances that the Government will publish, ahead of the autumn statement, details on the compatibility&#8212;or even the lack of compatibility&#8212;and  interoperability of the US&#8217;s global minimum tax legislation and that proposed by the OECD. That, of course, has an impact of double taxation for companies.</p> <p pid="e737.1/4">The Government will come to the House at future fiscal events&#8212;the first one being in autumn this year&#8212;to present an assessment of the progress that countries are making around pillars 1 and 2 and around the policy itself. That ensures that the Government are providing very structured updates within the fiscal framework on the impact of this policy on our economy, as well as that of major economies not implementing the policy by 2024. There are substantive commitments from the Government. I commend the Chancellor, who has been incredibly constructive in discussions. I am grateful to him and to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, because she and other colleagues have had to do much of the heavy lifting.</p> <p pid="e737.1/5">To be clear, I will not press the amendment to a vote. I have had this commitment from the Chancellor in writing. There has been an exchange of letters between us. It is very important to put it on the record that he has been very constructive on the specific requests that I have made.</p> <p pid="e737.1/6">To conclude, I would love there to be more flexibility on this policy. The Government have a big opportunity in the next six months of this calendar year, before the commencement date, to look at what other countries are doing, to look at what they have learned and to reflect on the macro-economic backdrop facing us right now&#8212;not just domestically for businesses, but internationally.</p> <p pid="e737.1/7">Let me turn now to the administration of capital allowances, which we have discussed in previous debates. Those allowances will still pose burdens to businesses. Conservative Members must ensure that it is not a Conservative Government who are putting burdens on businesses, but that they do everything possible to bring down the tax base and the tax burden, and to simplify taxes for businesses.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="e738.1/1">Before I turn to the new clauses and amendments before us, it is worth reminding ourselves briefly about the debate so far, not least that the Bill was derived from a Budget that had the stated intention of seeing the debt, borrowing and inflation all fall. As the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Secretary">Financial Secretary</a> has said previously, debt servicing costs are down, and indeed they are&#8212;they are down from last November, but massively up from the previous year. She said that the fiscal targets are to be met. Again, indeed they are. The debt target in particular is forecast to be met in five years&#8217; time measured against the fiscal charter, but it will be at 0.2% of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a>. That is &#163;6 billion out of a GDP approaching &#163;3 trillion. As I have said before, these are very fine margins.</p> <p pid="e738.1/2">Although it is true that having a weather eye on debt and deficit&#8212;the big macro-economic indicators&#8212;is important, so too is immediate help for families suffering from high inflation, high energy prices and spiralling  mortgage costs. Those things, however, are all sadly absent from the Bill. That is important because the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBR">OBR</a> has told us that living standards will fall by 6% over this fiscal year. That will be the largest two-year fall since <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics">Office for National Statistics</a> records began in the 1950s. It is important because inflation is still at 8.7%, and it is far worse for certain essentials such as sugar, at nearly 50%. Remember that inflation was forecast to fall to 2.9% by the end of this year. Since then, it has been revised up to 5% by the end of this year. That means that the forecasts and the pain keep rising.</p> <p pid="e738.1/3">We know that real pay is not keeping pace with inflation. Troublingly, the Government are keeping their head in the sand regarding the inflationary impact of Brexit, ignoring even the former Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, who could not have been clearer about the contribution Brexit has made to the soaring inflation we face.</p> <p pid="e738.1/4">I turn to the amendments and new clauses we are considering on Report. New <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 1 calls for a review of alternatives to the abolition of the lifetime allowance, and amendments 1 to 6 delete clauses associated with the abolition. On <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>, I suggested the need to probe this matter in Committee. The decision to remove the cap on lifetime pension allowances, which will cost around &#163;3 billion, will benefit a tiny number of already pretty comfortably off or very well-off people. I also suggested that, if the measure was genuinely designed to lift certain categories of worker&#8212;doctors in particular&#8212;out of a pension and employment trap, the Government should, to be brutally honest, have come up with a much better and far narrower solution.</p> <p pid="e738.1/5">My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25314" title="Our page on Kirsty Blackman - 'the Member for Aberdeen North (Kirsty Blackman)'">Kirsty Blackman</a> also raised the matter in the Committee upstairs. She made the point that a significant number of questions have been raised in the House and elsewhere about the lifetime allowance and the problem it has caused, particularly for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a> doctors, but went on to quote <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsten_Bell">Torsten Bell</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_Foundation">Resolution Foundation</a>, who noted that 20% of those who will benefit from the change in the lifetime allowance work in the finance industry, meaning that nearly as many bankers as doctors will benefit. That surely cannot have been the intention. We are pleased to support new clause 1, because it seeks not simply a review, but a review that will make recommendations about how a more focused alternative could be delivered.</p> <p pid="e738.1/6"><a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> 7 seeks to remove entirely the abolition of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Tax_Simplification">Office of Tax Simplification</a>, and new clause 2 seeks reports based on metrics to measure the performance of tax simplification. We will support both if they are voted upon. My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25305" title="Our page on Douglas Chapman - 'the Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Douglas Chapman)'">Douglas Chapman</a> provided some excellent context in Committee, arguing that</p> <p class="indent" pid="e738.1/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OTS">OTS</a> achieved a significant amount during its 12 years of existence and, with greater ministerial support for its proposals, could have achieved much more.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Finance (No. 2) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Bill_Committee">Public Bill Committee</a>, <phrase class="date" code="">18 May 2023</phrase>; <br><strong>c</strong>. 136.]</p> <p pid="e738.1/8">He also quoted George Crozier of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartered_Institute">Chartered Institute</a> of Taxation, as many have done over many years, who said that there had been</p> <p class="indent" pid="e738.1/9" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;useful reforms to employee expenses and inheritance tax reporting,&#8221; and that</p> <p class="indent" pid="e738.1/11" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;every Finance Act of the last decade has had measures in it which owe their genesis to the OTS, and which have made navigating the tax system easier for one group or another.&#8221;</p> <p pid="e738.1/12">My hon. Friend also made the rather important point that it was the independence of the Office of Tax Simplification that made it stand out from anything that can be provided in-house. We will back amendment 7 and new clause 2 if they are pressed to a <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">Division</a>.</p> <p pid="e738.1/13">If I may say a few words about Government new clause 4 and Government amendments 9 to 13, they appear to come under the category of tidying up and clarification. New clause 4 in particular ensures that both domestic and international top-up taxes commence at the same time, and the other amendments ensure that reliefs and charges operate as intended.</p> <p pid="e738.1/14">However, I am rather less sanguine about Government new clause 5. Ostensibly, it is required to deal with the situation where</p> <p class="indent" pid="e738.1/15" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;financial institutions are regarded as telecommunications or postal operators&#8221;.</p> <p pid="e738.1/16">For example, subsection (5) of Government new clause 5 suggests that paragraph 19(4) and (5) of schedule 36 to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Act_2008">Finance Act 2008</a> be removed, but paragraph (19)(4) says:</p> <p class="indent" pid="e738.1/17" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;An information notice does not require a telecommunications operator or postal operator to provide or produce communications data.&#8221;</p> <p pid="e738.1/18">That is a protection against the requirement to produce data in certain circumstances. Paragraph 19(5) defines &#8220;communications data&#8221;, &#8220;postal operator&#8221; and &#8220;telecommunications operator&#8221; as per the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigatory_Powers_Act_2016">Investigatory Powers Act 2016</a>&#8212;the very legislation that inserted those protections into schedule 36 to the Finance Act 2008 in the first place. Government new clause 5 not only affects the financial institutions regarded as telecoms or postal operators but, it would appear on my reading, removes protections in the Act for all telecommunications and postal operators not to be required to provide certain information in certain circumstances.</p> <p pid="e738.1/19">The Financial Secretary said she would answer questions at the end in her summing-up, and my questions are rather simple. What problem is Government new clause 5 designed to address? Why has a potentially significant amendment such as this come so late in the day? Is it even remotely appropriate that a criminal justice measure, the Investigatory Powers Act, should be amended in a potentially significant way through a late-delivered new clause on Report of a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Bill">Finance Bill</a>?</p> <p pid="e738.1/20">New clauses 3 and 8 to 14 call for reviews or reports of one form or another on the public health and poverty effects of the Bill, the oil and gas profits levy allowance, the impact of those with non-dom status, the bands and rates of air passenger duty, the impact of tax changes on households, and the effect of the Bill on the affordability of food and on small businesses. We are happy to look on those positively, although I am not certain that new clause 12 should really be opening the door to reducing the electricity generator levy. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lib_Dems">Lib Dems</a> have disappeared, but I would have said to <a href="/mp/?p=26086" title="Our page on Richard Foord - 'the hon.

It is also sadly true that none of the Government changes offer any hope of substantial help for the cost of living crisis any time soon. I fear that the Bill, and the Budget it derived from, will go down in the missed opportunity category.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="e741.0/1">I will speak to part 2 of the Bill, clauses 46 to 60, to which Government amendments 15 and 16 refer. In general, they relate to duty rates and any exemptions that apply thereafter. The Government&#8217;s objectives have been to simplify the system, to have an emphasis on health and healthy consumption, and, of course, to support pubs. In general, these are significant changes that have a positive impact on the hospitality sector.</p> <p pid="e741.0/2">When the Exchequer Secretary&#8217;s predecessor, my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25414" title="Our page on James Cartlidge - 'the Member for South Suffolk (James Cartlidge)'">James Cartlidge</a>, said at the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> that the Bill delivers the Brexit pub guarantee, there was significant enthusiasm within the sector to recognise and interpret a long-term commitment. There are two elements that immediately stem from that. The first is that these are changes that can be delivered as a result of Brexit; there were difficulties, challenges and nonsensical structures in the sector that could not be amended while we were a member of the EU. That is a major positive impact. However, the significance of the Brexit pub guarantee is that it will be long-term and we look for it to be ever extended.</p> <p pid="e741.0/3">I pay tribute to the Exchequer Secretary, who has engaged with me on some of the points that I have already made, but also to his predecessor, to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a>, and to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> when he was Chancellor, for recognising the opportunities to amend duty rates. That can genuinely help the hospitality sector, particularly pubs.</p> <p pid="e741.0/4">The original draught duty relief, which was in the Budget two years ago, was set to be 5% and to come into force this year. This year&#8217;s Budget and the Bill increased that to 9.1%, which will make a real difference. It follows the theme, all being well, of a continuing differential between rates that apply to the off-licence trade and those that apply to pubs and the general hospitality sector. The Government have therefore taken important, positive steps, which are welcomed far and wide.</p> <p pid="e741.0/5">We are trying to encourage people to consume alcohol in pubs more often than at home&#8212;clearly, there is an overhang from the covid pandemic&#8212;and to recognise the challenges that publicans, pub companies and brewers have faced in recent years. In the year to April, 4,600 pubs  closed. That demonstrates the challenge that publicans and pub companies face. The Bill shows the importance that we as parliamentarians place on having the pub in the community, where people can consume alcohol in a safe space, and anyone who drinks to excess is monitored and encouraged to do otherwise by the publican, friends and other hostelry customers.</p> <p pid="e741.0/6">The pub sector is hugely innovative. Pubs employ people flexibly and offer great opportunities to young people. I know that they are keen to work with the Department for Education, the Treasury and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Work_and_Pensions">Department for Work and Pensions</a>. A meeting is coming up between the pub sector and the Department for Work and Pensions to ascertain how the apprenticeship levy can be used to reach people who are currently far away from the employment market. Pubs can offer flexibility, which can help bring those people back into the labour market.</p> <p pid="e741.0/7">My specific comments will relate to alcohol that is served on the premises, but is consumed off the premises. The common phrase that the industry uses is &#8220;decanting.&#8221; That gives rise to a new complexity, to which <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 52 refers. I recognise that one of the motives for changing the duty rates was to simplify the structures. The historical structures were hugely complex, expensive to administer and expensive for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMRC">HMRC</a> to interpret and collect. However, I cannot understand why, in simplifying the procedure, we are introducing a different tax rate for people who are served on the premises and consume at home.</p> <p pid="e741.0/8">Let me explain the market, because the first stage is to understand the marketplace. We are talking about a tiny proportion of the market&#8212;comprising possibly 0.1% of alcohol that is served on the premises. The market encompasses ale enthusiasts who take one or two pints home at the end of the day. Perhaps some people do not want to stay in the pub late and are happy to consume those one or two pints at home. Those ale enthusiasts usually take them in specially designed decanters to maintain the freshness of the beer. Another environment would be a tap room in specialist consuming environments such as a brewery, where people go to taste the different ales on offer.</p> <p pid="e741.0/9">The Bill proposes to apply the higher duty to those who are served alcohol on the premises and consume it at home. There are significant challenges in collecting that duty and in monitoring which pint has been served in a takeaway canister and which has been consumed on the premises. Some canisters hold two pints. A consumer may well drink one pint on the premises and take the second pint home to drink when watching the football on Sky. I am not sure which rate will apply in such a case and how we would prove whether the pint had been drunk on or off the premises.</p> <p pid="e741.0/10">I know that my remarks sound a bit facetious, but I do not mean them to be. I want to give full credit to the Exchequer Secretary, who has engaged and explained the reason for the difference in duty. It is to stop large outlets such as supermarkets choosing to serve alcohol on the premises and thereby benefiting from the lower duty. I recognise that that is a risk. Smaller shops such as corner shops could also try to apply for a licence to serve alcohol on the premises. That would change the nature of consuming alcohol. We like pubs because people can drink on the premises in the safe and healthy environment that I described.</p> <p pid="e741.0/11">Collecting the extra duty will be complicated. It will be onerous for the publican to monitor which pints have been served for takeaway. As I said, some may be drunk on the premises and some drunk off the premises. I repeat that that will apply to only 0.1% of the beer that is served on the premises. Although I recognise the serious risks that the Exchequer Secretary highlighted to me, I cannot accept that it is beyond the wit of the Treasury and the industry to devise a solution. I ask the Exchequer Secretary to re-engage with the industry to ascertain whether there is a much easier solution so that we can table specific provisions in future <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> to overcome the challenges.</p> <p pid="e741.0/12">The draught duty relief provision has already had a technical error. It was originally targeted at containers that hold 40 litres or more, but those are rarely used in the industry. I understand that officials simply googled the size rather than engaging with the industry to come up with an ideal solution. Thankfully, the legislation has changed that to 20 litres, which is a workable size. The good news has continued through our placing a lower draught duty on alcohol served on the premises.</p> <p pid="e741.0/13">The Government have made a good move. They have responded to calls from the industry, be they from small brewers, large brewers, pub companies, freehouses or individual publicans. That is recognised far and wide as a major step forward. The relief has increased from 5% to 9.1%. It will make a real difference to saving pubs, keeping them open and fulfilling the Government&#8217;s agenda to encourage people to drink safely and to drink less alcohol in general. It will help keep the pub at the heart of the community.</p> <p pid="e741.0/14">I ask the Exchequer Secretary to look at the tiny element I have described because there is a risk of undermining the good work that has been done for just 0.1% of beer that is consumed by people who choose to have one pint at home after they leave the pub. I hope that he can come up with a clause that will meet the needs of the industry and avoid the real risks that he previously highlighted.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="e743.0/1">It is pleasure to speak to <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 21, which stands in my name. I also want to speak to the amendments on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Tax_Simplification">Office of Tax Simplification</a>, which my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24785" title="Our page on Harriett Baldwin - 'the Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin)'">Harriett Baldwin</a> tabled and I was happy to put my name to.</p> <p pid="e743.0/2">In my more naive and mischievous days, I occasionally tabled amendments to Finance <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> that called on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OTS">OTS</a> to review elements of tax. The last time I tried that was on corporation tax in about 2014 and the amendment was accidentally passed in the Bill Committee. I say &#8220;accidentally&#8221; because neither side knew that we were voting for the amendment. We thought we were voting to withdraw it and we had to rewrite history quickly and pretend that the amendment had not been passed. I have not been able to serve on a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Bill">Finance Bill</a> Committee ever since, or indeed any Bill Committee, so perhaps I could recommend that as a tactic for Members who do not enjoy them as much as I used to.</p> <p pid="e743.0/3">If we were being slightly mischievous, we could say that 13 years of the OTS has not resulted in a tax system that is a great deal simpler than the one we have now, but that is probably more the Treasury&#8217;s fault than the OTS&#8217;s. The serious point is that we need to find a mechanism whereby we can simplify our tax regime. It  has got ever more complicated, and at some point we will see taxes start to fall over, because the complexity of different policy ideas over time that conflict with one another leaves us with a system that is incredibly hard to follow and to comply with and is putting undue costs on individuals and businesses.</p> <p pid="e743.0/4">We could, in a rolling programme, find a way of taking out some of this complexity by being a bit clearer in our policymaking about what we are trying to do. Are we trying to raise income? Are we trying to encourage or discourage certain behaviours? Are we trying to virtue-signal? Are we trying to win votes? Sadly, we do all those things at the same time, sometimes in conflicting ways, and end up with a rather strange system.</p> <p pid="e743.0/5">The amendments I want to speak to are about the global minimum corporate tax. I think I am the lone voice on the Back Benches who likes to speak in favour of this. I remember looking at this issue before I came here. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> has spent a very long time trying to find a solution to base erosion and profit shifting. A few years ago, it produced 15 or so ideas that were quite worthy but made absolutely no progress. The Government then introduced the diverted profits tax in the UK to try to tackle this issue on a domestic basis. It would be a terrible signal if the UK, having been one of the countries that signed up to this, now decided that we want to delay implementation and not go ahead with it.</p> <p pid="e743.0/6">To be fair, no other solution has been found to how we can stop certain large multinationals trying to hide revenue in low-tax jurisdictions that has no commercial basis for being there. We have tried changing transfer pricing rules, we have tried country-by-country solutions, and we have tried more reporting&#8212;we have tried all manner of things, but none of them has managed to fix the problem. That is why the two pillars in the most recent OECD deal, while far from perfect, are the best we are going to get. If we do not go ahead with those, we might see some even more radical, less consensual, less well thought-through ideas being brought in. We even see the UN starting to play in this space, and there is a real risk that what it produces may not be consistent with a coherent tax regime.</p> <p pid="e743.0/7">I am not the biggest fan of the OECD. I once described it as the &#8220;Organisation for Excessively Complex Drivel.&#8221; If we read the rules that we are putting through today, there is a real sign that it is excessively complex, and that was my motivation for tabling amendment 21. We probably could have found a better way of achieving the same thing, rather than UK-headquartered groups having to go through a very complicated series of calculations for every subsidiary they have in an overseas regime to try to work out whether they have paid the 15% minimum tax, when the headline rate in those countries is 25% or 30%, and it is extraordinarily unlikely that they will not have paid that 15% tax, and there may well have been timing differences that have to be worked through to try to prove that. That will be a huge compliance burden, and it will not add very much. It will not collect any tax, and it will just make these rules look a lot worse than they are.</p> <p pid="e743.0/8">The purpose of amendment 21 is to offer the Government the chance to extend the power that the transitional, lighter-touch regime we are allowed to use for the first three years of the rules that has been agreed by the OECD and use it for a bit longer, especially if not every  country in the world is following our early implementation of these things, to try to avoid us imposing a compliance burden in the UK that will not exist elsewhere. I accept that that is not currently in the OECD agreement.</p> <p pid="e743.0/9">As more and more countries try to put these rules into their own domestic law, I think we might see them realise how fiendishly complicated they are and start to look for simpler ways of implementing them, so that we can focus on working out where real tax abuse&#8212;avoidance and evasion&#8212;is taking place and go and collect the tax that is not being paid, rather than having a big compliance burden. There are plenty of precedents for how we can do that in our own tax rules. We had the worldwide debt cap, which we do not need any more, so we scrapped it, but that had a gateway test. Companies went through a simple test, and if it was clear that they were innocent, they did not have to go through the full detail of the rules. I am sure that we could find some way around that. Our old foreign-controlled company rules had a list of territories that were treated as good unless there was any avoidance going on, and we could use a model like that.</p> <p pid="e743.0/10">I want to touch on why it is important that the UK takes a lead on this. I think it is fair to say that our overseas territories and Crown dependencies have been among those that have behaved the naughtiest around the world in terms of certain tax behaviours that they have encouraged or permitted in their jurisdictions. We are not going to get global progress on this issue if the UK is not at the forefront. If we say we will wait for the pack, half the world will think, &#8220;Well, they&#8217;re the ones that have been responsible for a whole chunk of this. If they&#8217;re not going to do it, we&#8217;re certainly not going to do it.&#8221; It is important that we are seen to take a lead in tackling this. Getting this right is hugely popular. Our constituents do not want to see large multinational corporations hiding their profits in low-tax jurisdictions. This sort of relatively moderate measure that we are opting into as part of a global deal does not have any sovereignty concerns.</p> <p pid="e743.0/11"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_US">The US</a> approach has been through various iterations. I was at a lecture by Pascal Saint-Amans a couple of weeks ago, who was the OECD director who brought through the deal. He tells the story that the negotiations were going nowhere until the US representatives at the negotiations when <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Trump">President Trump</a> was in office said, &#8220;Actually, what we want is a minimum corporate tax.&#8221; The whole room was astonished that the Americans had moved from not really wanting it to suddenly coming up with an idea.</p> <p pid="e743.0/12">What we have here, in many ways, is a Trump-era US solution. We can see that, because the Americans introduced their own base erosion and anti-abuse tax in 2017, or BEAT&#8212;another great acronym&#8212;which started out at 5% but is now at 10% and will go to 12.5%, so they are almost at 15% already. They also have their global intangible low-taxed income regime, which is an even better acronym: GILTI. I urge the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> to think of great acronyms for new tax rules, because I think a global anti-avoidance rule called GILTI sends the right message. That is, again, a US domestic attempt to tackle US corporations moving intangible income offshore. The minimum corporate tax of 15% that we want to introduce is trying to tackle exactly the same problem.</p> <p pid="e743.0/13">We should not forget that most of the multinational corporate tax avoidance we have seen has been by US multinationals using US rules that were badly written because the US did not really care what happened overseas and allowed companies to play around with its sub-part F entity classification rules, basically to avoid US tax and avoid everybody else&#8217;s while they are at it, as they could get away with it. I would not take too many lessons from the US on this issue. In fact, its domestic policy is to introduce something quite similar to try to tackle a problem that it has created and exacerbated around the world.</p> <p pid="e743.0/14">We can set an example to the US and encourage its politicians to see that such a thing has been done in the past and should not be allowed to continue. We want responsible corporates around the world that are trading multinationally to pay the right tax in the right jurisdiction. I accept that that is not easy, and it is a complicated thing to get right, but that is what we want to see. I think we will see increasingly that consumers do not want to buy services and goods from corporations that are engaging in that sort of outrageous behaviour. If they carry on like that, it will be damaging to the US economy, so I would urge it to get on board with these rules. I certainly urge the Government not to give any sign that we are backsliding. It is the right thing to do. It is by no means perfect. I am sure we can improve the detail of it, but the principle is there, and we should go ahead and implement the deal.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="e746.0/1">I should have known by now that my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24965" title="Our page on Nigel Mills - 'the Member for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills)'">Nigel Mills</a> would put his points succinctly and with expertise. He has taken me a little by surprise in ending as he did, but I thank him greatly for his comments.</p> <p pid="e746.0/2">May I conclude this stage of the scrutiny of the Bill by first of all genuinely thanking all right hon. and hon. Friends and Members for their contributions on Report? It has genuinely been the sort of scrutiny that shows this House in its best light: although there has been a certain amount of party politicking in certain parts of the Chamber, a very detailed set of questions and concerns has been raised about some of the most complex parts of the Bill. When I responded to the Chair of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_Select_Committee">Treasury Select Committee</a>, my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24785" title="Our page on Harriett Baldwin - 'the Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin)'">Harriett Baldwin</a>, in giving evidence last week, I said that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAT">VAT</a> is the most complex part of tax law, which in itself is incredibly complex. I think I am about to prove that pillar 2 may be joining that very elevated rank.</p> <p pid="e746.0/3">If I may, I shall concentrate on some of the amendments that have been the focus of the House this afternoon; I hope colleagues will understand if I do not address some amendments that have not been spoken to, or will not be pushed to a <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">Division</a>. First and foremost, I will deal with tax simplification&#8212;in new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 2 and <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 7, which have been tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Worcestershire">West Worcestershire</a>. Again, I very much thank our Treasury Select Committee colleagues for their interest, their expertise and their commitment on this issue, and their scrutiny of opportunities for tax simplification. I have read the report already, which I hope shows my commitment to simplification. I hope my hon. Friend will understand if I do not respond in detail to the report now; we will of course respond formally to it in due course.</p> <p pid="e746.0/4">My right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> and I remain deeply committed to simplifying the tax system. My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25346" title="Our page on Kit Malthouse - 'the Member for North West Hampshire (Kit Malthouse)'">Kit Malthouse</a> intervened earlier on: he is a chartered accountant, so he knows with great expertise just how complicated some aspects of the tax system can be. I very much share the Chancellor&#8217;s ambition and determination to try to bring some simplicity to some of these reliefs and rules. We very much want to engage constructively with the Treasury Select Committee and, indeed, the whole House in our efforts to do so.</p> <p pid="e746.0/5">If I may, I will just touch on amendment 7. We have introduced through this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Bill">Finance Bill</a> our determination to put simplification at the heart of the tax system and our consideration of it, which is why we will not be able to renege on our commitment to abolish the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Tax_Simplification">Office of Tax Simplification</a>. We are going to stay the course with that policy, but we genuinely see the Bill as an opportunity to enable us to put simplification at the heart of the Treasury.</p> <p pid="e746.0/6">With regard to new clause 2, the Chancellor has set a clear mandate to Treasury and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMRC">HMRC</a> officials to focus on both the simplicity of new tax policy design and simplifying the existing tax rules and administration at all times. At spring Budget, the Chancellor announced the first steps of that work, including a range of improvements to make it easier for businesses, especially small businesses, to interact with the tax system. That includes&#8212;this is by no means an exhaustive list&#8212;a systematic review to transform HMRC guidance and key forms for small businesses, and a consultation on expanding the cash basis, which is a simplified way for over 4 million sole traders to calculate and pay their income tax. As my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24829" title="Our page on Andrea Leadsom - 'the Member for South Northamptonshire (Dame Andrea Leadsom)'">Dame Andrea Leadsom</a> said, these need to be practical simplification measures. I very much hope that the consultation on the cash basis will provide some of that practicality that she and others so wish for.</p> <p pid="e746.0/7">We are also taking further action to simplify the tax system through the Bill. A great example of that is the permanent &#163;1 million limit to the annual investment allowance, which provides 100% first-year relief for qualifying main and special-rate investments in plant and machinery, simplifying the tax treatment of capital expenditure for 99% of businesses. The Bill will also simplify the process of granting share options under an enterprise management incentive scheme. We also announced at spring Budget our efforts to simplify the customs import and export processes. That includes opportunities to streamline customs declaration requirements and engage with traders on plans to rationalise and digitise HMRC&#8217;s authorisation processes, all of which is obviously essential with our bright new future out of the EU.</p> <p pid="e746.0/8">The Chancellor has also set out that he is asking officials to consider tax simplification ahead of every fiscal event. Of course, hon. Members will have ample opportunity to scrutinise the Government&#8217;s progress on simplification through the finance Bill process each year. We also continue to publish tax information and impact notes, which set out the expected impact of tax policy changes on individuals and businesses, and HMRC&#8217;s annual customer experience surveys, which measure taxpayers&#8217; overall experience of interacting with HMRC.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="e748.1/1">That is a very interesting point. I hope the Chair will not mind my saying so, but when I gave evidence last week, quite rightly I was challenged about how we measure success. This is incredibly complex, as my right hon. Friend will appreciate. For example, with the corporation tax rises, we have introduced the tapering because we have the policy intent of trying to help businesses that are small or perhaps finding their feet, and we do not want to be charging them 25% corporation tax if they have not reached the levels of profit set out in the Bill. The metrics we will use are very much being considered. I am not in a position to commit to those metrics at the moment, but I promise I will come back to her when we have a settled package that we think will address not only the concerns of the Committee but the wider concerns beyond simplification, such as fairness and encouraging growth.</p> <p pid="e748.1/2"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMRC">HMRC</a> also reports annually in its reports on its objective to make it easy to get tax right. As I have just set out, we are actively considering how to develop a suite of metrics to measure progress on that. Precisely because we recognise the concerns and the thoughtful considerations of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_Committee">Treasury Committee</a> and others across the House, I was very pleased at being able to intervene on my hon. Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Worcestershire">West Worcestershire</a> to commit today to reporting annually&#8212;that is, in each tax year&#8212;to the Committee to provide an overarching summary of the Government&#8217;s progress on the simplification. To be very clear, I intend that to start this tax year, because I take this very seriously and I very much hope that Committee members and others in the House will share my intentions in so doing. I therefore hope that my hon. Friend and Committee members will not feel the need to press their amendments and new clauses.</p> <p pid="e748.1/3">I turn now to the subject of the global minimum tax legislation, which is again a complicated area. If I may, Madam <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>, with your munificence, I will just spend a little bit of time on it, precisely because I understand the concerns that my hon. Friends have and, indeed, the level of scrutiny they have quite rightly given it as the Bill has made its journey through the House. First and foremost, if I may&#8212;I am very keen to get this on the record, because I know that my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24778" title="Our page on Priti Patel - 'the Member for Witham (Priti Patel)'">Priti Patel</a> will rightly expect such commitments on the record&#8212;before I make the commitments that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> has made in his letter, I will set out the background to pillar 2. Although my right hon. Friend the Member for Witham clearly has a great deal of knowledge about this area, it is fair to say that not everybody in Parliament will have the same understanding.</p> <p pid="e748.1/4">By way of an explainer, pillar 2 will ensure that large multinational groups with revenues of more than &#163;750 million pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15% in every jurisdiction they operate in. It is designed to protect against the risk of harmful tax planning by multinational groups and to promote fair and open competition on tax policy. It is really to prevent those large multinationals from shifting profit out of the UK to those parts of the world that charge far lower tax  rates than us. This will help to ensure that profits generated here in the UK are taxed in the UK, and it will strengthen the UK&#8217;s international competitiveness through placing a floor on the low tax rates that have been available in some countries.</p> <p pid="e748.1/5">A lot of questions have been asked about implementation, and I shall go into detail on them in a moment, but if we do not implement these rules, the tax will still be collected, but by another jurisdiction. That is because pillar 2 is designed as an interlocking set of rules ensuring that low-taxed profits will be taxed even if the UK or other countries do not move ahead. This is why we are determined to introduce or implement pillar 2 from <phrase class="date" code="">31 December</phrase> this year, along with other EU member states and with Australia, Canada, Japan and Switzerland, so that we are moving in lockstep with our international peers.</p> <p pid="e748.1/6">Before I answer some of the questions that my right hon. Friend the Member for Witham has rightly raised, let me put on record my sincere thanks to her, and to other colleagues and friends who signed her <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>&#8212;and to whom I have spoken over many months in the run-up to today&#8212;to scrutinise what this means for the United Kingdom and for businesses. I absolutely understand why they are asking the questions. As I said, this is Parliament at its best, and I am genuinely grateful to her for raising these questions. What is more, the Chancellor is grateful. My right hon. Friend wrote to the Chancellor, and I am pleased to inform the House that he replied to her in the following way, to ensure that we all understand and appreciate the levels of scrutiny that have taken place.</p> <p pid="e748.1/7">The Chancellor maintains that the Government are sadly not in a position to support the amendment, but we recognise the importance of these matters to hon. Friends and Members of the House. On that basis, the Chancellor and I are happy to provide an update on pillar 2 implementation as part of the forthcoming fiscal event in the autumn, and if necessary in the spring. That update will include the latest revenue forecast from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBR">OBR</a>&#8212;that is an important point&#8212;and a status update on international implementation, which is a point that hon. Members are focused on. It goes without saying&#8212;I hope my right hon. Friend and others know this&#8212;that the Chancellor and I stand ready and are happy to continue to discuss such issues with her and others, as we move towards implementation towards the end of the year.</p> <p pid="e748.1/8">Quite rightly, my right hon. Friend and others have posed questions, and I will try to answer some of them. I was asked about implementation, which I completely understand. The member states of the EU are committed to implementation, and the EU directive in place is legally binding. The directive allows small member states&#8212;defined as those with 12 or fewer parent entities, and, therefore, those that are much smaller than our economy&#8212;more time to introduce the rules. Those countries are very few, and are not in the same economic position as the United Kingdom. They will not get an advantage from delaying implementation, as the directive requires other EU member states to collect the tax instead.</p> <p pid="e748.1/9">I have also looked to countries such as Thailand, Singapore and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> has a large and mixed economy, where it is appropriate for us to take action to combat aggressive tax planning and support  measures that support competition. Australia, Japan and Canada, which are our peers by size and shape of economy, are also implementing that rule. Indeed, Japan&#8217;s 2023 tax reform Bill was enacted after passing Japanese procedures in March. It will be introducing the income inclusion rule from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April</phrase>, four months after us next year.</p> <p pid="e748.1/10">On the States, I understand why the question is being posed, and my hon. Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_Valley">Amber Valley</a> set out some of the history behind where America has got to. In 2017, the US introduced a minimum tax on the foreign income of its multinationals, and it has recently introduced a minimum tax on the domestic income of large groups, including foreign headed multinationals. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_US">The US</a> already has in place rules that operate on a similar basis to pillar 2, and it has been one of the strongest advocates for developing a global standard. It has maintained its commitment to align its rules with the agreed pillar 2 template, but until that happens, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> inclusive framework members, including the US, have agreed how the US rules and pillar 2 rules should interact, to ensure that US multinationals are subject to the same standard as groups in other countries. That is an important context.</p> <p pid="e748.1/11">If it is not implemented in the UK, what does that mean? Again, the question posed is a fair one. Generally, the international top-up tax is applied at the top of the business, and at the level of the ultimate parent entity. If that jurisdiction has not implemented the rule, the taxing right passes down the ownership chain of the business, until there is an entity in a jurisdiction that has implemented the rule. This is why without UK rules, this tax&#8212;chargeable in the UK, if it did apply&#8212;would be payable to another jurisdiction unless and until we implement the rules.</p> <p pid="e748.1/12">I very much understand the concerns raised about sovereignty. We retain the sovereignty to set our corporation tax rate. It is still the lowest in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a>, and we can use important tax levers to boost investment, including the UK&#8217;s world-leading R&amp;D credit and full expensing regimes announced in the Budget. We have also ensured that UK tax reliefs such as the refundable R&amp;D credit will not be treated as depressing the effective tax rates of claimants. We have been able to achieve that because we have been at the forefront of discussions and negotiations on these rules.</p> <p pid="e748.1/13">On the point about how these rules are agreed, implemented and who holds who to account, the model rules were agreed by consensus requiring the agreement of each country and jurisdiction. It is then up to each country and jurisdiction to implement the rules. There is not a higher body than jurisdictions here to do so. I very much understand the concern about innovation and growth. We will remain free to use the corporation tax system to support innovation, business investment and regional growth through R&amp;D tax credits, enhanced capital allowances and tax reliefs in investment zones. We must continue to work together with our partners to avoid a subsidy race that could distort trade or impact sectors.</p> <p pid="e748.1/14">In answering those questions, I hope I have addressed some of the issues that Members have raised in relation to pillar 2. I very much hope that my right hon. Friend the Member for Witham, having brought the scrutiny which would be expected from her, will feel able not to press her amendment to a vote.</p> <p pid="e748.1/15">On the lifetime allowance and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a>&#8217;s new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 1 and amendments 1 and 6, the Opposition just do not seem to get it. This measure has been brought forward to help the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a> retain those doctors and consultants whom we are so desperate to have in our NHS looking after our constituents and helping to cut the backlogs, as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has set out as one of his five priorities. That is why we have introduced this policy. <a href="/mp/?p=25801" title="Our page on James Murray - 'The hon. Member for Ealing North (James Murray)'">James Murray</a> seems to think&#8212;and we have had this conversation many times before&#8212;we could have dreamt up a proposal dealing just with doctors in the same amount of time it took us to bring in this policy&#8212;two weeks. The fact is that this measure started having an impact on our doctors, our consultants, our chief constables and others this tax year, as hon. and right hon. Friends have set out. We want to make that change precisely because we believe that our NHS and public services deserve it, and that is why we are bringing that lifetime allowance forward.</p> <p pid="e748.1/16">Moving to the non-doms point, this is again a conversation we have had repeatedly with those on the Opposition <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>. The hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ealing_North">Ealing North</a> asked about the &#163;830 million and seemed to question it. I am sorry to break it to him, but that has been scorecarded by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Budget_Responsibility">Office for Budget Responsibility</a>. It has certified it, costed it and said that it will bring in &#163;830 million over the scorecard period.</p> <p pid="e748.1/17">My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24740" title="Our page on Alun Cairns - 'the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Alun Cairns)'">Alun Cairns</a> raised important questions regarding alcohol duty. He welcomes the changes in the round, but as the chair of the all-party parliamentary beer group, it is understandable that he is asking whether the draught relief is designed to apply to off-trade pints as well as on-trade pints. I am afraid that it is not, because we want to support consumption of beer in pubs. It is one of many ways not only to support our local pubs, but also to secure opportunities arising out of our exit from the European Union. Only pints in pubs will be subject to this measure, not pints poured into takeaway containers. The industry body the Campaign for Real Ale has lobbied to ask that that could happen. We have looked at the idea carefully, as has the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25858" title="Our page on Gareth Davies - 'the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Gareth Davies)'">Gareth Davies</a>, but we have serious concerns that it would overcomplicate the draught relief. I hope to reassure my right hon. Friend and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAMRA">CAMRA</a> that takeaway services can continue so long as the beer comes from a full-duty barrel. I am reminded that takeaway off-trade beer accounts for 0.1% of beer sales, but, when the Bill passes its <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Reading">Third Reading</a> today, I am sure that we will all be raising a pint in celebration.</p> <p pid="e748.1/18">We touched briefly on the electricity generator levy, which is payable only on the portion of revenues that exceeds the long-run average for electricity prices. We have done that carefully to try to ensure that we achieve the Government&#8217;s wanted net zero ends while looking after customers. New clause 12 perhaps misunderstands how the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGL">EGL</a> operates, so we urge colleagues to reject it. In relation to the energy profits levy, it is important to note that the Government expect it to raise just under &#163;26 billion between 2022 and 2028, helping to fund the vital cost of living support that we have discussed.</p> <p pid="e748.1/19">In relation to air passenger duty and new clause 10, we have made changes to take advantage again of our post-EU freedoms and to support the United Kingdom.  We want friends and family to be able to fly to see each other across the United Kingdom. I am not quite clear whether Labour understands that or is now against helping friends and family across the UK to reunite. I am sure that all will become about as clear as its &#163;28 billion U-turn.</p> <p pid="e748.1/20">I turn to new clause 5. <a href="/mp/?p=11973" title="Our page on Stewart Hosie - 'The right hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)'">Stewart Hosie</a> asked why are we making this change on Report. It became apparent that a welcome clarification by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> on how information is obtained for criminal investigations means that some data that is genuinely needed by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Majesty">His Majesty</a>&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_and_Customs">Revenue and Customs</a> to check a person&#8217;s tax position is deemed as communications data. The clarification aims to secure that into law. We are trying to do it as quickly as possible, which is why it is in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Bill">Finance Bill</a>.</p> <p pid="e748.1/21"><a href="/mp/?p=25034" title="Our page on Debbie Abrahams - 'The hon. Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth (Debbie Abrahams)'">Debbie Abrahams</a> raised the duty to report on public health and the poverty effects of the Bill. We already publish data on people in both relative and absolute low-income households each year through the &#8220;Households below average income&#8221; publication. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_Reform_and_Work_Act_2016">Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016</a> also requires us to publish statistics on the percentage of children in relative and absolute low income, combined low income and material deprivation and persistent low income. I very much hope that she will welcome the &#163;3,300 on average of help that we are securing for families across the United Kingdom in these difficult times.</p> <p pid="e748.1/22">To conclude&#8212;[Interruption.] I thought that the House might be interested in some of the details; apologies for that. The Bill contains a number of important measures that will support the UK economy, people and businesses. I therefore urge the House to reject the proposed non-Government amendments for the reasons that I detailed, and agree to the Government&#8217;s amendments and new clauses. In closing, I thank everybody involved for their contributions to our discussions not just today but in the months that have led up to this.</p> <p pid="e748.1/23">Question put and agreed to.</p> <p pid="e748.1/24">New clause 4 accordingly read a Second time, and added to the Bill.</p>            </div>
