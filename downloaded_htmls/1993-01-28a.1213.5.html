Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Yardley">Birmingham, Yardley</a> (Ms. Morris) made a justifiable complaint about the nature of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> paper and the difficulty of following the order of debate.</p> <p>
Even those of us who have sat in the House for many years are experiencing difficulty&#8212;and I confess that I am among them&#8212;but for no reason to do with the Chair or the authorities of the House. We all acknowledge that the treaty is exceptionally long and complex and that the Bill is exceptionally short.</p> <p>
Perhaps I may suggest a way of simplifying that aspect. Many years ago, your predecessors, Mr. Morris, hit on the idea of producing an informal, provisional list of selected amendments. I understand that previously the selection had not been announced until the first amendment in the group was reached. That innovation has proved most successful. I therefore suggest that when you, Mr. Morris, publish the successive daily list of selected amendments, the amendments and new clauses that are additions to the groups are underlined or have some signature, to make it clear that they are new. That could save many right hon. and hon. Members a lot of time, and would perhaps assist the Committee in the debates.</p>            </div>

At the beginning of yesterday's debate, I raised with the Second Deputy Chairman the singular nature of three amendments under consideration &#8212;<a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> No. 110, and new clauses 12 and 13. I asked in particular whether consideration could be given to a separate vote on them at the end of the debate. The Second Deputy Chairman replied:</p> <p><q>The occupant of the Chair always takes note of requests for Divisions. However, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">Division</a> that the right hon. Gentleman seeks would take place not at the end of this debate, but when the appropriate point on the selection list is reached."&#8212;[<i>Official Report,</i> 27 January 1993; Vol. 217, c. 1087.]</q>
I believe that there was some misunderstanding. The Second Deputy Chairman obviously took on board my point about the new clauses, but I believe that amendment No. 110 can be voted on at the end of the debate. I wanted to point that out to you, Mr. Morris, because I believe that my previous submission was slightly misunderstood.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>As you indicated, Mr. Morris, I was proceeding with my speech when the 10 o'clock rule struck us last night. Up to that point, the theme of my speech had been the amazing contrast in the Bill's provisions, in respect of the open door that article 8a allows to 300 million citizens&#8212;to nationals of European states. Article 8a(1) states:
<q>Every citizen of the Union shall have the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_States">Member States</a>".</q>


That seems an enormous enhancement of the right of entry to this country of 300 million Europeans. That open-door, free movement contrasts with the tightening controls and the fortress Europe approach towards the rest of the world and third countries. I maintain that considerable discrimination would be involved in the way in which we treated different people according to whether they were European nationals or people from third countries with connections to ourselves.</p> <p>
4.15 pm</p> <p>
I pressed the Home Secretary on how on earth we were to have effective border controls and distinguish between Europeans and non-Europeans without proper inspection of passports. He said that he always made it plain that we intended to maintain some form of passport control in the United Kingdom, but I was not impressed by the evidence that he gave, because the Commission does not accept the British and the Home Secretary's position. It states that it is a right accorded under the treaty and, therefore, in the last resort it should be determined by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice">European Court of Justice</a>. It has not come to that, but I put it to the Committee and to the Government that it is a very real apprehension and I should be interested to know what serious legal advice the Home Secretary has had that the British case could be sustained in the European Court of Justice against the pressure of the Commission and presumably that of other member states.</p> <p>
There is also the obvious practical problem of distinguishing between different European citizens. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> refers specifically to the necessity of maintaining some safeguards and checks because of the requirements of law and order and our legitimate worries about drug smuggling, terrorism, and so on. How can frontier control be maintained without taking a good look at the passports of those coming in? We do not need an elaborate procedure but simply the right and the insistence that we can look at people's passports.</p>            </div>

Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> and treaty arrangement that we have entered into. It is a profoundly worrying and unacceptable part of the treaty arrangement.</p>            </div>

<q>If the Community is to become a genuine internal market, and if this market is to operate under the same conditions as a national market, physical controls must be abolished. This means the abolition of all controls (formalities, procedures, checks, examinations, inspections, etc.) at internal frontiers, just as there are no border controls between regions in national markets.</q>
What is being suggested there is obvious. Already, at any rate in the eyes of the Commission, we are part of not just a single geographical area but of a union in which citizens have the right to move from, say, Germany to England and back again&#8212;if need be to reside here, look for jobs and stay&#8212;just as citizens of the United States have the right to move from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> to California and stay there, look for work and otherwise move backwards and forwards at will.</p>            </div>

If we are concerned about good race relations, we must have fair and firm immigration policies.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I hoped that I had already addressed this at some length. I shall not go over again the fact that the right hon. Member is speaking about article 8a and competing interpretations of that, which goes back to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_European_Act">Single European Act</a> which the House accepted many years ago.</p> <p>
On the question of freedom of movement and right of residence here, the right hon. Member is correct that under this Bill there is freedom for any EC national to live and work here so long as they are self-supporting, but there are set exceptions, which we can debate later, for those excluded on public policy, public security or public health grounds.</p> <p>
I spent a long time yesterday trying to explain that neither the treaty nor the Bill transfers control over

immigration policy to the European Community. Indeed, immigration matters are expressly excluded from Community competence unless the double lock in article K.9 is turned, both by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=205" title="An informal reference to the Council of the European Union." class="glossary">Council of Ministers</a> unanimously and then by this House and Parliament, ratifying any agreement in the Council. If we look at what we are actually debating and these matters of law and order and safeguarding, in paragraph 5 of article 100c expressly says that it is
<q>without prejudice to the exercise of the responsibilities incumbent upon the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_States">Member States</a> with regard to the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security.</q>
The same proviso occurs in article K.2, which is also part of this treaty. Paragraph 2 of the article says:</p> <p><q>This Title shall not affect the exercise of the responsibilities incumbent upon Member states with regard to the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security.</q>
Our checks against terrorism and against crime and smuggling do not require systematic frontier controls of everybody crossing the border, but matters essential for our security and protection against international crime can be specifically defended by the agreements we have entered into.</p>            </div>

Article 8a is not before us now. The right hon. Gentleman keeps asserting that he is worried by the Commission's interpretation of article 8a. My hon. Friends keep reminding us that the Government have continued to regard our obligations under article 8a as quite different, and we maintain that position.</p> <p>
This agreement does not transfer any sovereignty away from us towards the European Community except in article 100c which transfers the comparatively small matters of the list of countries from whose nationals we require visas and the format of that visa&#8212;what it looks like. That transfer to Community competence, which is convenient and efficient, does not begin to produce all the bogeys that the right hon. Gentleman and my hon.

It should be borne in mind that the Bangemann wave question emerged from discussions between the Home Secretary and the Commission.

Does not the Home Secretary agree that we are dealing with an amending treaty? The treaty that we are discussing &#8212;the treaty on European union&#8212;amends the updated treaty of Rome. It is rather like an amending Bill, which, in amending an existing Act, gives rise to a new Act.

That is a major transfer of one of the crucial aspects of sovereignty as we have known it. It is deliberate.

Gentleman that fisheries legislation which was passed

by the new Parliament following the 1987 election was, in effect, set aside under the judgment of the European Court. That legislation was not introduced with malign thoughts. The Government believed that it was compatible with their obligations under the subsequently amended treaty of Rome. They were wrong then, and they are likely to be wrong in this case. If there is a scintilla of doubt, we should not touch something that extends the remit of the European Court.</p>            </div>

Friend aware that, in the matter of interpretation, there is a difference between the Home Secretary and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commissioner">European Commissioner</a>? The European Commissioner says one thing and the Home Secretary says another. How confident can we be that the views of the Home Secretary will always prevail? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> said yesterday:
<q>It is the case that Commissioner Bangemann asserts the view that under article 8a we are obliged to abandon what the Community would call internal frontier controls, which means checks at our ports and airports into European movements, but that is not a position that has ever been accepted by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a>.</q>
What the Home Secretary says is completely different from what the Commissioner says. Yesterday he went on:
<q>I have had discussions with Commissioner Bangemann on ways in which EC citizens can be distinguished from third country citizens".&#8212;[<i>Official Report,</i> 28 January 1993; Vol. 217, c. 1127].</q>
The Home Secretary has never explained how that will be done. Is it to be a case of differentiating between a white person and a black person? This is another example of differing interpretations.</p>            </div>

People can be stopped at any time. In Brussels, it is quite common for people employed in various sections of the Community to be stopped on the street and asked to present their papers. At no point has


the Home Secretary made it clear that legislation of this type can be made to work only by insisting that the police have the constant right to stop people and ask them for clear identification. By implication, that means identity cards, and all that goes with them, once people are in the country. If one accepts that that is what lies behind this, one can see why Mr. Bangemann has decided that we can go ahead quite cheerfully with waving people through at ports of entry.</p>            </div>

If we abandon the control of entry, there must be something to take its place.

That does not make for good police-citizen relationships, and it is something which most people in Britain would find profoundly unattractive. It is a powerful additional reason for not abandoning frontier controls.</p>            </div>

I simply come back to this point. There is no secret about it: the <a href="/glossary/?gl=234" title="The European Commission is the politically independent institution that..." class="glossary">European Commission</a> and most of the other European countries wish to create a state, and they know very well that, in order to create a state in western Europe, one must build up certain powers that have previously belonged to national Governments. They have moved across a whole range of matters. They now want a common foreign policy, a common defence policy and all the things that characterise a separate sovereign state.</p> <p>
One of the half-dozen quite crucial matters is the right of citizens of a state to go wherever that state claims to have its own boundaries. It is clear to me that the European semi-state&#8212;it is not yet a fully fledged one&#8212;is claiming the rights of citizenship and of abode throughout the whole area of the so-called European union.</p>            </div>

I just want to say a few words about what the Home Secretary said to us. He told us that we have no need to worry about the implications for national control and immigration because of article 100c, and that, if there is any problem, it is not because of what is in 100c. It is because of what was done by nasty <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Thatcher">Lady Thatcher</a> in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_European_Act">Single European Act</a>; it is her fault and no responsibility of ours, so if there is any problem it is hers.</p> <p>
I hope that the Home Secretary will take rather seriously what I am going to say now. If he takes that view, will he please go back and read what was said at the time of the Single European Act when certain hon. Members, including myself and my hon. Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldridge-Brownhills">Aldridge-Brownhills</a> (Mr. Shepherd), who asked questions were told that there was no need to worry about terrorism and all the rest of it becausee adequate safeguards were written into the treaty and that everything was fine and dandy. Let us look at <i>Hansard</i> and the words of the Home Secretary himself. There we see it written out clearly and specifically. On control of terrorism and the rest of it, he says that the new agreement that they have come to is that
<q>In the case of &#8230; other EC nationals, the purpose of the check [at the border] is simply to establish their nationality".&#8212;[<i>Oficial Report,</i> 17 December 1992; Vol. 216, c. <i>445.</i>]</q>

There is now no requirement to look at a passport, no requirement to talk to someone and no requirement to do anything, unless it is to find out that someone is an EC national.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> will say that there may be advance warning. Of course it is possible that the police will say that three terrorists are coming across the border on 14 July at 3 o'clock and they will be there, waiting for them. But how on earth will a normal person, watching border controls, contain terrorism or control drug peddling without the opportunity of looking at a person's passport and asking him some questions?</p>            </div>

We were told at the time of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_European_Act">Single European Act</a> that we would maintain control over immigration policy. There was no suggestion at that stage that we would have to put up with the "Bangemann wave". We were told that if we wanted to stop people at our frontiers and look at their passports, we could do so. We have discovered that we were wrong and that the Government have discovered that they were wrong. If the Government were wrong then, how much more likely are they to be wrong now in their interpretation of these provisions?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>It is well known that I have always taken the view that we should change our special provisions in relation to the Republic of Ireland. That is a separate issue which was determined by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Parliament">British Parliament</a>. The hon. Member is well aware of my views, because I believe that we have a fundamental duty, for the safety of our people, to take all possible steps to control the small minority from other countries who want to engage in terrorism, killing and violence.</p> <p>
I hope that hon. Members will consider carefully this new concession by the Home Secretary. In fairness, he was in a difficult position. He was confronted by Mr. Bangemann who said that on 1 January all border controls in Europe must go and that anyone who got into another country should be able to come here, and it was made clear by the Commissioner in a public statement that after 1 January, unfortunately, if we stopped anyone coming across the borders within Europe we would be taken to court.</p> <p>
As he set out in a statement, the Home Secretary had a meeting with Mr. Bangemann. They have not agreed on anything, he says&#8212;"Nothing has been decided"&#8212;but the fact is that because of the adoption of this new situation they have put the matter off. Now it will go to court and, sadly, because of the wording of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_European_Act">Single European Act</a>


we will probably lose the case. It has been put off by coincidence until, no doubt, we have finished discussing the Maastricht treaty. In any case, hon. Members should be aware that we were misled at the time of the Single European Act, and this alone should make us think very carefully indeed.</p> <p>
Does it really matter about frontier controls? It matters desperately because all hon. Members are concerned with maintaining good race relations. I am sure that, whether hon. Members support a weak or a strong immigration policy, we at least agree that we have a duty to try to maintain good race relations. If hon. Members have any doubt about the importance of this, they should look at what happened in Germany when people there gained the impression that the influx of refugees from eastern Europe was out of control. The moment that the British public gains the impression that we will be unable to control the number of people coming into this country for any reason whatever, it will have a fundamental effect on race relations.</p> <p>
Although Southend is one of the nicest places in the world, I was appalled at some of the letters that I received on the admission to a nearby borough of 12 refugees from, I think, Bosnia. I met them. They were Muslims and very nice people, but the fact that they were going to appear on the council list of a neighbouring borough caused a great deal of resentment among some people in Southend and nearby. Hon. Members should be aware that the moment that the public gain the impression that we are not totally in control of entry across our borders, nasty things will happen in race relations, and the people who suffer will not be people like us; it will be the immigrants, the people with black faces. We should be concerned about our duty to them. The best thing that we can do for them is to give the clear impression to the public that we are in control and that we will not have a situation where people can go across our borders without difficulty and without being impeded in any way.</p>            </div>

If a criminal is coming into this country, we would ordinarily notify customs and immigration of the name, and possibly provide a photograph, of the individual. There may not be a photograph, but one of the first areas of investigation in excluding persons is the name factor. How is the name of a person coming into this country identified without looking at a passport or other document? I am having great difficulty understanding how the Home Secretary intends to enforce the law and order and criminal provisions in this measure.</p>            </div>

People should think about it, especially those Euro-nuts who want to give all the powers to Europe. If people who are known criminals, terrorists, traders in blood are coming across the border, how can they be identified? There may be wonderful police intelligence, one may know that they are coming, but if one cannot look at the passports or talk to those people, how can they be identified?</p> <p>
This is a fundamental change in our practice. It was announced by the Home Secretary on 17 December. Who

agreed to this? When did the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> agree to it?

I am a supporter of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_European_Act">Single European Act</a>. I joined my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor) in voting for its consequences. I was then in complete agreement with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Thatcher">Lady Thatcher</a>. I do not know whether she has changed her mind about the Single European Act. We are discussing article 8a of the Single European Act, which is something to which we all agreed some years ago. I have explained the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a>'s view of article 8a and the obligations which we have entered into. The description that I have given is indistinguishable from that which was given to the House when we signed the Single European Act and when we took the Act through the House. That remains the policy of the British Government.</p> <p>
It is true that I had a disagreement on the interpretation of article 8a with Commissioner Bangemann. I do not know what the view of his successor will be, but the British Government are quite clear about the obligations that they have entered into.</p> <p>
The debate on these amendments today is on the basis of a pillared approach precisely because we are not conceding to the European Community institutions, the European Court or the Commission any control of our immigration policy. I cannot, in an <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>, go into how we work under article 8a, but at the moment policemen do not stand alongside the immigration officers looking at every passport; customs officers do not look at every passport. Of course, we will retain our frontier controls because our immigration officers must be satisfied that those going through the European channel are European nationals. The immigration officers are accustomed to dealing every day with people like me who have forgotten their passports. They have all kinds of people coming through&#8212;</p>            </div>

If he looks back, as I hope that he will, to the debates on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_European_Act">Single European Act</a>, he will see that we were treated then, as we are being treated now, with absolute contempt. They said our points were silly, nonsense, rubbish. I know that the Home Secretary has not had time to read this treaty, but I hope that he will look


back at those debates, the questions that were asked and the challenges that were made. He will see that we were given a clear, specific assurance that we would still maintain total control of law and order and terrorism. Sadly, this is not the case, because of a decision, not made by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>, but announced by the Home Secretary in a parliamentary answer on 17 December.

A lot of political leaders have moved in a crab-wise manner, disguising what they are really doing. Would it not be far better now for people who take the view of the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Dykes) to say that they support the treaty, are in favour of the free movement of people and the abolition of internal frontiers, and are proud of the fact, because that is what they want? In other words, should they not tell the truth about the thrust of the treaty?</p> <p>
Instead, we have the Home Secretary telling us not to worry what Mr. Bangemann says or what the Commission says, because it is all right and we do not really intend to abolish frontiers. Is not that the difficulty, that people have not been frank and open and honest about their intentions?</p>            </div>

I do not want to make a habit of making long speeches in these debates. I just want to make some specific points and seek opinions on them.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> said that nothing much will go under K.9; we can stop it by a veto, and that will be that. That is an over-simplification because, once the original decision has been made on the kinds of things that will be done, there can be <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> votes thereafter. But the worry is that, if there is a situation in which the members of the Community agree unanimously&#8212;that is, with the inclusion of Britain&#8212;on a new rule or policy, and the people of Britain decide on reflection that they do not like it, and the Government or Parliament say that they do not like it, nothing will be able to be done about it. That is the one thing that we should be absolutely clear about. Whilst we may accept that there is unanimity under article K.9 and that the Government will be in a position to say no, the fact is that if the agreed policy turns out to have unfortunate consequences, or if Parliament and the people of Britain decide that they do not like it, there is nothing we can do unless a further decision is taken at the Council.</p> <p>

Friend but, clearly, he has not had time to read article K.9 on which he is lecturing at such length. Article K.9 makes it quite clear that nothing can be brought into Community competence, beyond what is covered by article 100c, unless there is a unanimous vote of the Council, including the British representative. Incidentally, it also includes the vote of the Danish representative who, under the present Government, is even more emphatic than we are that Denmark does not wish to extend competence in this respect. My hon. Friend wandered, saying that if there was a <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> vote something would happen, but there is not a word of that in article K.9.</p> <p>
Even if the British and Danish Governments were to change their minds and join in a unanimous vote to extend competence, article K.9 gives the House an absolute right to refuse to ratify it. It is what is called a double lock. That destroys the foundation of my hon. Friend's speech which is that what we are debating today brings immigration issues into Community competence. He is plain wrong. He is an extremely intelligent and sensible man with great expertise on Europe, but he has either not read or not understood a word of the article.</p>            </div>

<q><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Council">The Council</a>, acting unanimously on the initiative of the Commission or a Member State, may decide to apply Article 100c of the Treaty establishing the European Community to action in areas referred to in Article K.1(1) to (6), and at the same time determine the relevant voting conditions relating to it.</q>
That may or may not mean something, I do not know, but it clearly refers to determining
<q>the relevant voting conditions relating to it.</q>
We could disregard those words, say that they are rubbish and irrelevant and say, "Teddy Taylor hasn't read the treaty", although the Home Secretary said that he himself had not read it. However, the plain fact is that if all member states unanimously agreed to, say, policy A and policy A turned out to be a disaster, something which the Government, Parliament and the people of Britain find appalling, we cannot repeal that policy ourselves. We are handing over decision-making to a new European state. Although the Home Secretary may say, "Not at all, you are being misleading", it is so.</p> <p>
If we pass a law on asylum or immigration and decide, on reflection, that it is not working out and that nasty things are happening, we can at present pass an amending law. We should appreciate the fact that, even with unanimity even if we disregard the words that I read out and even if we say that we can stop it, if we hand over powers and then find that it does not work out and has nasty consequences for immigrants and for us, there is nothing we can do about it.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>Of course I will. We should know what we are doing. If under article K.9, we hand over the right to decide, we do not have the power unilaterally to change any subsequent decision.</p> <p>
A third important point to bear in mind is that the forum for and type of decision-making in the European Community is different from that of the House. There are 12 member states and, inevitably, gaining acceptance for one policy might mean needing support in a different area of policy, perhaps on financial control or food. That will mean that issues are not decided on their merits.</p> <p>
If anyone doubts that, let him ask himself why Britain and France recognised Croatia, which has unfortunately created terrible problems in Yugoslavia. We knew that to

do so was contrary to our policy; we knew that it was wrong and silly and that the Croats were not in control of their country. We also knew that, by so doing, we created fear and panic among the Serbs. However, the Germans wanted our support for unrelated matters, and they got it. The point is that the pattern of decision-making is different.</p> <p>
In all sincerity, I ask the Home Secretary to accept that something serious is happening. I hope that he will accept that if we pass powers to another body which then makes decisions which we find damaging, we can do nothing.</p> <p>
Let us stick to article 100c. In his interesting speech, the Home Secretary said, "Don't worry about article 100c, there's nothing much in it". He said that we were merely to have a harmonised visa certificate, one or two changes. If that means only that every European state is to have the same visa form, what is the advance in that? How does it help anyone in the world if 12 countries have the same forms printed in the same language? Presumably it will cost something to produce them, but where is the benefit? This is the Home Secretary's proposal, so I should like him to tell us the advantage of having the same form with the same words over the present words. I can see none.</p> <p>
As the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> said, sometimes I do not read things carefully enough. I see that the splendid Minister of State, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> is here&#8212;he reads things carefully and sometimes reads treaties. What is the advantage of having a common visa form? There must be a reason for it.</p>            </div>

We are being asked to approve that measure today.It will cost something; I do not know how much and the Government always underestimate. Surely there is supposed to be some benefit in changing the forms. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> should tell us what it is. We need money for many things, and the Government are up to their ears in debt. I am told that borrowing is now an amazing &#163;1 billion a week, so we should be watching expenditure.

There are advantages for efficiency, although not great advantages, in having a visa document which looks the same issued by the 12 states. It is a small matter of convenience and efficiency. I said earlier that it was not a great matter, and it is not one about which most people would get as steamed up as my hon. Friend. He has finally got himself in order and spoken about something of relevance to the treaty of Maastricht. Does he feel so passionately about this instrument of our national sovereignty that the form for British visas should look different from that used by the other 11? Is that what makes his heart beat faster?</p>            </div>

<q>In the event, as the House will know, only two immigration matters will be taken into Community competence; first, a substantive one".</q>
And what is that substantive matter? It is the very matter that the present Home Secretary now dismisses as nothing:
<q>&#8212;the common visa list&#8212;which is the agreement on the countries whose nationals would require visas for entry to the Community: and secondly, the more technical question of the format of a common visa."&#8212;[<i>Official Report,</i> 2 March 1992; Vol. 205, c. 26.]</q>
The previous Home Secretary considered those substantive matters, but now when the hon. Member for Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor) tries to argue about them they are dismissed.</p>            </div>

Once that happens, our present power under British law to restrict the people coming into this country would no longer exist as a power that we can exercise through the British courts as the final arbiter of rights.

We are doing something stupid, bureaucratic, nonsensical and unnecessary&#8212;unnecessary, that is, unless, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Burton (Sir I. Lawrence) said, the single form is required because it will carry single benefits and single entitlements and rights. My hon. and learned Friend hit the nail on the head. I am sure that he is right. But if he is not, no other reason has been put forward.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> says that we should not worry about article 100c because there is nothing much in it. Yet we shall pass over to the EC&#8212;by <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> voting, after 1996&#8212;the right to decide which people need visas. That is


supposed to be of no significance. They will be sitting around the table&#8212;let them decide by majority voting. Well, I believe that it matters quite a bit.</p> <p>
Until now this country has decided which countries we wish to be subject to visa requirements. We have taken into account all kinds of considerations. With the Caribbean, for example, the considerations have included our long-standing friendship, and the Commonwealth connection. One of the other countries affected will be the United States of America. At present we do not need visas to go there, and a lot of us think that that fact is important&#8212;some may think that it is not&#8212;for establishing the continuing bonds between Britain and the United States. The plain fact is that after 1996 that will all be scrapped. The Home Secretary may say that I am talking rubbish or nonsense, or being silly, but I beseech him to look at the list.</p> <p>
I happen to have a copy of the list of proposals published by the Schengen countries. No doubt the Home Secretary will say that that will be different from the EC list, but the Schengen countries are substantial, and following their discussions they published a list. We also have the Government's list. If we look under the letter B we discover that the proposals involve visas for countries such as Bahrain, Belize and Barbados, which are not on the list of countries for which we now require visas. Those are just three countries, but they are rather important ones.</p> <p>
Hon. Members should be aware that after 1996 it will not be the Government who determine the places where visas are required. If a majority of EC countries say that they want or do not want visas for certain places, there will be nothing that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament.

Maastricht is clearly the end of the road, but the prospect of the powers of the House fading away would not matter so much if they were going somewhere over which the people had some control. That would not matter two hoots.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I cannot reply to that question in detail, because much wider issues would be involved&#8212;the same issues that are involved when people ask, "Can Parliament pass a law to withdraw from the EC?" To answer that question would be to stray from the debate. But I can tell my hon. Friend that the only case law on the subject involves Greenland, which was linked to the EC, as we all recall. The only way in which Greenland could get out of the EC, after an election, was not to pass a law in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_Parliament">Greenland Parliament</a>, but to ask all the member states to pass a law allowing Greenland to leave. I do not want to go into that big issue now, but my hon. Friend should

be aware that there is a great difference of view on whether Britain would have that right. I think that we would not. I do not think that it would be possible for Britain to withdraw from the EC or any of the obligations unless every other state passed a law to allow us to do so. That is the view that I have always taken, and if there is any doubt about it, Greenland provides the example. The other countries had to pass a law, and Greenland had to give up many of its fishing grounds, which it greatly regretted.</p> <p>
Apparently, the first aspect does not matter at all, because the Home Secretary could not give us a reason for it. However, the second aspect is rather more important, and I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will accept that. If, for reasons of friendship or co-operation, for the sake of improved relations, or because of an emergency, we wanted to operate a regime between us and another country whereby visas would not be needed, we should no longer have that power. It would have gone. If we do not like what the Europeans do by <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> vote, too bad.</p> <p>
What about the people of Britain? If we introduced visas for the United States, some of them might be angry. They might send letters to their <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a>; they might demand a debate in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>. They might even take the matter into account in an election&#8212;but what is the point? Their views do not matter, and they will have no influence on these events at all.</p> <p>
This is an important democratic issue. Hon. Members will recall that higher interest rates were forced on us by the exchange rate mechanism, despite mass unemployment in this country&#8212;</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I shall come to my final point then, Mr. Morris.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> says that there is nothing much to these matters. He is sure that the lists will be drawn up by sensible people in a way that we will like. The fact is that that may not happen. I plead with him to remember what happened with article 8a. We know that the Commission takes a view of that article wholly different from the Government's. The Home Secretary said in a statement issued in September 1992:
<q>Nothing has been decided and there is much more work to be done. We agreed that our officials should continue to work on the details.</q>
Article 8a means the abolition of frontiers, just as I said that it would at the time of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_European_Act">Single European Act</a>. It is not just a matter of people being able to visit Britain after having obtained a visa for Italy. Everyone will have the right to reside or visit. We should remember the number of refugees in Germany&#8212;they will all be able to come here, without restriction. That has not happened yet because it has not yet gone to the court. The Home Secretary has had discussions with Mr. Bangemann, and although he is no longer in his post, someone else is, and it is hoped that something will be done. We have all heard about the waving of passports, known as the Bangemann wave. If we lose the case at the court, all our discussions about controls will fade into insignificance. People wanting to come to this country will need no visas if they come from any other European country.</p> <p>
We know that the Italian controls are practically non-existent and that Greek controls&#8212;apart from at Athens, where they are tight&#8212;are limited.</p> <p>
Although the Commission has threatened us with proceedings in court, it has apparently now agreed not to go ahead pending discussions. Still, I believe that individuals could take us to court. If they do, it will be catastrophic. Perhaps then the people of Britain will realise that our controls have gone. The Home Secretary is well aware that that could happen, but he will say that he hopes it will not.</p> <p>
All this arises out of article 8a, even though we were told at the time that there was no need to worry about it &#8212;that we would still have complete control over immigration. I ask the Home Secretary to acknowledge that this House has been misled time and again. Anyone who says that article 100c will not inevitably lead to visitors&#8212;unless they are identified beforehand as terrorists &#8212;being able to enter this country from every other European country is kidding himself. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> has told us not to worry&#8212;that the article does not entail that at all. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> will say that someone visiting France on a visa will not be able to get into Britain automatically. What should I tell people who want to visit Britain after 1996? Should they go to the French embassy and ask for a visa? Should they also go to the British embassy and ask for one? The implications of the common visa and of the wording of the treaty as it touches on common external frontiers are clear. The Government say that they reserve the right to refuse people entry if they are criminals or terrorists. If the Minister thinks that article 100c does not matter, I ask him to look back at 8a.</p> <p>
I know that the Home Secretary has been through the nightmare of discussions with Bangemann and others. All this is very frightening, after all. What is proposed is dangerous, silly, damaging to our democracy and potentially damaging to the good race relations that we have in this country.

We need to stop beating about the bush. Article 100c exists to keep black people out of Europe&#8212;and to keep Arabs and Russians out of Europe. The intent behind it is racist, and it will create an operational structure that is racist, building on trends that already exist. That is why I am proud to go into the Lobby to vote against this racist measure, and to join my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) in so doing.</p>            </div>

Large numbers of Germans, for instance, might want to come here. Why Germans would want to come and enjoy our lower standard of living is beyond me. It is of course inconceivable that anyone on benefits in Germany would want to come here to increase

his standard of living. This is not really about what happens inside Europe: it is about creating a barrier around Europe. It is a move towards fortress Europe, and the people who will suffer are those outside it.</p> <p>
I am always amazed by the naivety of so many Labour federasts, who keep pointing to all those dreadful Tories who pass all this awful racist legislation but who believe that, as soon as Maastricht is in place, everything will be wonderful and all the wicked legislation will be overturned. There are historic trends towards racism in Europe, and this House has pandered to them under <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> and Labour Governments&#8212;and Maastricht panders to them further.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I was speaking not only about black British people being harassed at passport control but about the people who accompanied my hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) who led the activities in Maastricht. Those people were harassed on the streets by the police zeroing in on them. Most of the other European countries have not given their immigrants equal rights. They have not given them the vote or protection.</p> <p>
One of my closest colleagues went to lecture to West German Social Democrats shortly before unification. The lecture and the debate was about what parties of the left should be doing for women. My colleague asked those who were, I suppose, the most progressive members of that party, the sort of people with whom we find ourselves in agreement, what programmes they had instituted for Turkish women who were living there, some of them for 20 to 30 years. The reply was, "We don't do anything: they will be going home one day." That is how much further many of our European partners have to go to catch up with even the limited anti-racist measures in this country.</p> <p>
My hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) made a brilliant speech. I do not think that he could see the approval, the absolutely elated look, on the faces of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> civil servants in the Box behind the Chair. They were nodding enthusiastically as my hon. Friend gave the most clear exposition of Government policy that we could have heard. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> was nodding. He was clearly delighted, because, as he has told us, he has not read the treaty and could not have done anything like as good a job as my hon. Friend.</p> <p>
One almost had the feeling of watching an American gangster movie in which Mr. Big sits and beams with delight as his bright young protege announces some new way of ripping off society and making them rich. It was like coalition government, and a perfect defence of the Government's position.</p>            </div>

Friend would find it interesting to go to the Library and look at the volumes of <i>Hansard</i> containing the debate on the Bill dealing with Kenya Asians in 1968. That was one of the most disgraceful periods in Parliament's history: overnight, after a wave of hysteria and racism in Britain, we stripped black British citizens of their right to come to this country. The legislation was overwhelmingly carried. Who was in the Lobby against it? There was a handful of left wingers and some honest right-wing Tories who thought that it was a disgrace.</p>            </div>

My hon.

He took so many interventions from my hon. Friends that he could not fit mine in.

Friends and what he called the honest right wing of the Conservative party. My hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor) has said that he is against article 100c because it takes away our right to exclude people from this country and would open the door to unlimited immigration. The hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) says that he is against 100c because it is designed to exclude black people who would otherwise come here.</p> <p>
If either of them looked at 100c, they would see that it does not bear at all on the right to decide who comes to this country or on immigration control. Could they agree that one of them must be wrong? What is the reason for the objection to 100c that this hard-left, hard-right coalition somehow agree to see between the lines?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>Not only does the Home Secretary not read the Maastricht treaty: he does not listen to his colleagues. They object because they believe in the nation state and in the right of the British people to determine these matters. I oppose it because I am opposed to racism wherever it raises its head. Those are the issues that will put us in the same Lobby.</p> <p>
When someone is in the Lobby only he knows why he is voting that way. I do not have the slightest qualm about


that. I have found myself in the Lobby with the hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Paisley">Ian Paisley</a>) on one or two occasions, but I imagine that neither he nor I would wish to tell our constituents too much about that. We were there because we believed that something was wrong. The reasons were irrelevant, because at the end of the day what matters is how one votes. I am voting against 100c because it is racist, and that is it.</p> <p>
While listening to my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield, I was struck by the number of times that I have been involved in debating about high principle and policies and been carried away by it all. I came out thinking that I had achieved something, but six months later I asked myself, "What has happened to it? How was it translated into reality?"&#8212;because that is a different matter. I have sat on committees that took decisions which we thought were great, but a year later nothing had filtered its way down through the dross.</p> <p>
Our debates in Committee have to be considered in the context of what is happening outside, who administers the policy and who makes the day-to-day decisions. How will the immigration officer interpret what we say against the long background of tradition on how we approach these matters?</p> <p>
I am not happy with the origins of the measure. Many of my more naive colleagues pop up and down at party meetings and speak about awful happenings at Trevi, saying that this legislation will drag them all out into the open. It will not. Nothing in the treaty will bring Trevi decisions into the open so that they can be debated in Parliament, and to imagine that that will happen is an illusion. The treaty will legitimise what is discussed in private in Trevi. In effect, the situation is worse, because the structure includes the Schengen group, which has its own tightly defined agenda. Its members also attend Trevi meetings and dominate them.</p> <p>
People in the Labour party have been complaining for years that a party within a party can have disproportionate effects. That is why Militant was expelled. Half a dozen people can agree in private and dominate a bigger meeting because they work together. That is happening in Trevi. The reality is that, if there was anything of which the Government could be proud, they would publish it.</p> <p>
What happens at Trevi? Representatives from each of the Twelve sit around and decide how to keep people out of Europe. They work out which country has the most restrictive policy to keep Arabs, for example, out of Europe, and they all adopt it as the norm. They work out which has the most restrictive policy to keep people from the Caribbean out of Europe, and they all adopt it as the norm. That is why the meetings are not public. It is the most disgusting exercise of hidden racism that we have witnessed in recent years. I am not surprised that the Trevi group is not prepared publicly to state what is happening, or to open its meetings to the press and the public.</p> <p>
What is Trevi there to do? We need only to look at the list of policy areas that it considers&#8212;it is an insult. It discusses terrorism, arms, rabies, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS">AIDS</a> and immigrants. What does that list say about those who participate in Trevi and how they perceive immigrants to Europe? Immigrants are dealt with in a group whose remit is to tackle AIDS, terrorism and rabies. That does not fill me with enthusiasm about what Trevi discusses. I am happy to <a href="/glossary/?gl=176" title="To allow another Member to speak." class="glossary">give way</a> to the Home Secretary if he will say that he is

prepared either to publish the details of those meetings or to argue at the next meeting that Trevi's meetings should be held in public.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>My hon. Friend is absolutely right.</p> <p>
What worries me most about article 100c is a phrase that I mentioned yesterday in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>:
<q>a threat of a sudden inflow".</q>
That clearly shows how the drafters of Maastricht see the people of the third world&#8212;a threat. That underlies the whole logic of the article. I fail to understand how anyone who professes to have any degree of socialism or even any commitment to social justice could vote for a treaty that includes such a phrase. It is blatantly racist. My hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield is grimacing, but that is what I believe. Anyone who is not prepared to vote against the treaty is acceding to racism and even supporting it.</p> <p>
Even if everything else in the treaty was wonderful, would still vote against it because of that phrase in article 100c. Those of us who represent communities with large numbers of immigrants know how things work today, and we know that the treaty will make that worse. We are already operating an immigration policy&#8212;which, to our


shame, has been accepted and perpetuated by past Labour Governments. There has been 30 years of pandering to racism and introducing more and more restrictions to prevent people from coming to this country.</p> <p>
After housing, the second largest number of complaints I get from my constituents is about immigration policy. Those of us who represent areas with mixed communities know that, if one of our constituents married a white person from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia,_New_Zealand">Australia, New Zealand</a> or America, that partner would be in this country within weeks, if not days. If that constituent married someone from India or the Caribbean, it could be three years, four years or never before that partner was admitted to this country.</p> <p>
5.45 pm</p> <p>
That is the context in which we must consider the treaty. It does not start with a blank sheet of paper; it is laid on top of what already exists. It is a clear sign that the nations of Europe view people outside as a threat. We could not find any organisation among the black or brown people of Britain that does not see the proposal as a fortress Europe to exclude those from outside, to keep the wealth of Europe away from the third world and to keep the people of Europe pure from
<q>a threat of a sudden inflow",</q>
as the treaty puts it.</p> <p>
I should be happy to <a href="/glossary/?gl=176" title="To allow another Member to speak." class="glossary">give way</a> to any hon. Member who could interpret that phrase in any other way. It is an attitude that we have seen before, including in the House.</p>            </div>

I suspect that the reference to "a threat" in the treaty is concerned mainly not with countries outside Europe, but with the other countries of Europe where there may be severe problems, such as civil war.

Does my hon. Friend accept that those Labour Members who believe in the nation state are far from being racist? Like my hon. Friend, they are anti-racist. Some of them, including me, voted against the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Immigrants_Act_1968">Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968</a>, which took away the rights of so many people who should have been allowed to come here.

The threats talked about by Le Pen, Jacques Chirac and others are posed by people of a different colour and culture. Is that not borne out by the fact that it is the clear intention to expand the EC to take on board countries such as Russia, Czechoslovakia and Poland, so that the people of those countries will not be seen as a threat? Therefore, the only threat that would be perceived would be from people of colour, not from people in eastern and central Europe.</p>            </div>

Friend says clearly applies to persons from the Caribbean, India or Pakistan, he will see that article 100c, paragraph 2, concerns the need to introduce a visa requirement for countries which previously did not have such a requirement. The list of countries requiring visas produced by the Schengen countries includes the Caribbean countries, India and


Pakistan, and so on, and likewise with the United Kingdom list of countries whose nationals require a visa to enter this country.</p> <p>
Therefore, paragraph 2 cannot apply to those countries, because their nationals already require a visa to enter Britain or the EC. It must be directed at countries whose nationals do not presently require a visa&#8212;for example, Poland&#8212;where there might be some civil disruption which necessitated EC countries producing a visa requirement to cope with that emergency.</p>            </div>

We have seen what has happened under visa restrictions. During the past few years, the Government have introduced visa restrictions for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankans">Sri Lankans</a>, with the result that the flow of refugees from Sri Lanka has dried up. They could not get here. How could they? How can one obtain a visa while fleeing death? A person about to be bumped off cannot stand outside the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_High_Commission">British High Commission</a> waiting for it to open in the hope of obtaining a visa to get out of the country. People escaping countries do so without visas or with false passports.</p> <p>
Then the Government introduced visa requirements for Ugandans, despite that holocaust, and that flow of refugees dried up. Then they did it for the Kurds and that flow dried up. Then they did it for the Yugoslavians, with the exception of people from Slovenia and Croatia, and that flow of people dried up. Visas are used to keep people out. They are used to prevent genuine refugees from coming here.</p>            </div>

Once such powers have been handed over, and, as some people may have noted, the European Court, after certain procedures under article K.6 had been followed, could take up the running of all this, not only might the system deprive our own Parliament and people of making decisions, but the decisions could be taken with increasing authority at the centre, by the unelected bureaucrats in the EC.</p>            </div>

It is difficult enough to persuade this Government to allow someone into the country without having to trundle off and raise such issues in Brussels, where everyone will be passing the buck, blaming the <a href="/glossary/?gl=205" title="An informal reference to the Council of the European Union." class="glossary">Council of Ministers</a>, and saying that a decision was not their fault and that they would have liked it to go the other way.

If the Maastricht treaty created a democratic Europe, that would unite people across Europe. Instead, it is a treaty that creates bureaucracy and rule by bankers.

I hope that that will not happen.</p> <p>
My hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield made the most impressive presentation of Government policy that I have heard for a long time. He drew our attention to what has happened to asylum seekers during the past 20 years. He told us that, in 1972, 13,000 asylum seekers applied to come to Europe, and virtually all were granted admission. Last year, 600,000 applied, but only 20 per cent. were granted admission. I should have loved him even more if he had developed that argument to explain why.</p> <p>
Much of the argument on the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Bill and now on the Maastricht treaty and article 100c is based on the concept of the economic migrant who is abusing the situation. Many people who have been in politics for a long time will remember having struggled to get out of the country some trade unionist from El Salvador who was under threat of assassination, or some <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> leader who was being threatened by some brutal dictatorship somewhere.</p> <p>
That is the concept of asylum that we have in the back of our minds. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Nations">The United Nations</a> definition of an asylum seeker is someone who is in fear of persecution. As the world has changed, those seeking asylum in Britain have come from areas of armed conflict. They did not come because our social security system is the envy of the world &#8212;that is about 30 years out of date. If that were their motive, they would go to Germany, which pays decent rates.</p> <p>
Applicants to enter Britain come from areas convulsed by violent struggle&#8212;Sri Lanka, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, and Ethiopia. Often, they come from countries to which we have supplied arms, or with which we have some historic colonial link. They are not economic migrants, but people running in fear of their lives.</p> <p>
Let us consider the closest European conflict. The United Nations definition does not, we are told, apply to such people and to the 600,000 that I mentioned. Surely someone is in fear of persecution if that person is a Muslim woman being kept in a camp in Bosnia and raped daily by Serbian guards as part of a systematic campaign of terror and intimidation. I would say that such a person is a refugee, whether or not she fits neatly into the United Nations definition. I wish that my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield had gone on to argue that the United Nations definition was much too narrow.</p>            </div>

The defence made so far in the debate is that unanimity is required, and that Britain will be able to operate its veto. What will happen in a crisis, when Britain's budget rebate may be at stake? Several other countries around the table could say, "If you are not prepared to drop the unanimity rule, we will vote not to renew your budget rebate."</p> <p>
That is exactly the kind of horse trading that we have seen in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=205" title="An informal reference to the Council of the European Union." class="glossary">Council of Ministers</a> and at European summits. Our veto is not guaranteed for all time. A point will be reached at which a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a> will be prepared to surrender their veto, and that will be the end of it.</p>            </div>

Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Selly_Oak">Birmingham, Selly Oak</a> (Dr. Jones), the way that amendments have been submitted, collated, and selected, and the general confusion surrounding all that, makes for extreme difficulties. It comes down to opinion.</p> <p>
I wish that people's optimistic hopes about what the treaty would achieve were right. If so, I would vote for it. However, that is not the world that I know from my experience in local government and after six years in the House. One cannot work on the assumption that one can place the best interpretation on things, or that everyone will act with the best of motives. Usually, exactly the reverse is true: once people put their grubby little hands on a bit of power, they use it in their own interests.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>The one example used in all law courses about the problems of interpreting <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> relates to a matter that is nothing like as complicated as the treaty. In 1968, the House passed the legislation on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Transport">London Transport</a>, which included a <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> saying that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_London">Greater London</a> council should have the power to subsidise fares for whatever purpose. The then <a href="/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a> for Finchley explained that that meant that there could be subsidised fare reductions, but when the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Lords">Law Lords</a> came to examine that legislation, they decided that it meant something completely different. If that is what the Law Lords can do with one simple sentence, I dread to think what they, or the European Court, could do with a treaty of such complexity.</p> <p>
When one compares the Maastricht treaty in all its complexity and deviousness&#8212;though perhaps one should not use that word&#8212;with the simplicity of the American constitution, one sees what a nightmare is being created for lawyers and judges.</p> <p>
I am drawing to a conclusion. I intended to make only a brief speech, but I received so much support from members of my <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> that I kept giving way.</p> <p>
I spoke earlier of the flow of refugees that had dried up as visa restrictions were imposed. As a consequence, of all those who sought asylum in this country every year, only about 30 arrived with visas. That is why the Government introduced carrier liability. One sees Mr. Big sitting on the Government <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Bench">Front Bench</a>, saying, "This is all going to be wonderful," yet what was done by those who preceded him as Home Secretary the right hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_Valley">Mole Valley</a> (Mr. Baker) and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Waddington">Lord Waddington</a>? Theirs is a record of restriction and control.</p> <p>
The Government now rely on foreign airlines to act as a policing arm for Britain, to keep refugees out. British immigration officers are sent to other countries to stand by airline desks and persuade airline operators that certain persons should not be allowed to enter Britain. That is the most appalling abuse. British immigration officers are sent to train airline officials in other countries how to decide whom to keep out of Britain. We talk about defending the powers of the House and of the British people, but in practice we are devolving those powers because there is a desire to keep people of colour out of Europe.</p> <p>
Also depressing is the fact that the new Europe will decide which countries are safe. It will be interesting to hear from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> the thoughts of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a> on that aspect. The Maastricht treaty will be used to draw up a list of safe and unsafe countries before we decide who we will accept as refugees.</p> <p>
What will happen in the case of Turkey? Will it be decided that Turkey is a safe country because it is part of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> and an ally&#8212;or will those responsible be honest and offend Turkey by saying that it is a very unsafe country if one is a Kurd and has been subject to abuse, bombing, intimidation, and the suppression of one's culture? What nonsense. I suspect that the Foreign Office


is not happy about that, and that it sees a nightmare of strange relationships as European Ministers sit down together and decide categories of safe and unsafe nations.</p> <p>
The truth is that at the end of the day this is part of a long degeneration and that is why it has been seized upon so eagerly by both Front Benches.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I am sorry, Mr. Lofthouse, but I was led astray by an older man.</p> <p>
I see the measure as a further degeneration from a point of principle. Just over 30 years ago, the House debated immigration policy for the first time, when the Macmillan Government proposed restrictions to keep black people out of Britain. Now that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> papers have been released, we can see that there was a fear of racism and the fear that there would be a backlash. Rather than standing up to that and educating people, the Macmillan Government gave in.</p> <p>
I remember those debates&#8212;they were the first of which I was aware. I was 16 at the time, and I saw one figure of principle, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Gaitskell">Hugh Gaitskell</a>, who opposed that law because it was racist. He believed it was racist, and he said so; he knew that he was alienating voters, but he fought for what he believed was right.</p> <p>
The treaty and the clauses are the result of 30 years of degeneration from that point of principle; 30 years of running in the face of racism rather than standing and challenging it; 30 years of pandering to racism by jacking up entry restrictions. Every time the Labour party has made a concession, racists in society have said that it is still too lax, and restrictions must be still tighter. We have reached a point where that means the most appalling injustice for many citizens of Britain.</p> <p>
If one marries a white person in America, Australia or Canada, that person will be allowed into Britain within days, but one can marry someone from India or Africa and never get them into Britain. Even after two or three children have been born into that marriage, an

immigration officer can still say that he thinks it was a marriage of convenience. That is a disaster, and it has done a great deal to undermine morality in British politics.</p> <p>
I am not attacking only the <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> party, although it is marginally worse. I remember that it was a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> who stripped British citizens in Kenya of their right to come to Britain. I sat through five years of Labour government between 1974&#8211;79 waiting for them to repeal the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_1971">Immigration Act 1971</a> that the right hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Bexley">Old Bexley</a> and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath) had introduced and that we condemned in <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> but left on the statute book.</p> <p>
I remember reading in the accounts of that time, the biographies and diaries, the response to that wave of racism when <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Gordon_Walker">Patrick Gordon Walker</a> was defeated in the 1964 election. Were we principled? No. When Sir Frank Soskice, the then Home Secretary, presented a paper about immigration policy to the Labour Cabinet at the end of 1964, he said to the Cabinet: "Let us be absolutely serious about what we are talking about here. If we don't act to stop immigration, within a generation all our people will be coffee-coloured".</p> <p>
The debate on immigration has been a despicable record that besmirches the House. We have given in to reaction again and again and Maastricht is part of that. Finally, as I said earlier, even if everything else in the treaty were wonderful, I would vote against it because of this one <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a>.</p>            </div>

The outstanding thing about the debate this afternoon has been the fact that no one has stated or acknowledged that the free movement of persons is in itself an enormously desirable objective. Surely the free movement of persons is a great advance in civilisation. It is a desirable and humane objective to which right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House should aspire.</p> <p>
6.15 pm</p> <p>
Although I fear that it is not practicable to contemplate the establishment of free movement of human beings all over the planet, at least a regime of free movement of persons throughout western Europe would be a significant advance of civilisation.</p> <p>
There is a great danger that we shall fail to see the wood for the trees and become so bogged down by the detail &#8212;constitutional, bureaucratic, administrative or otherwise&#8212;that we shall fail to see the great principles enshrined in the treaty and the Bill, which ratifies it. Surely the achievement of the ideal of free movement of persons, which is already enshrined in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_European_Act">Single European Act</a>, is a positive step forward.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I know that my hon. Friend shares with me a commitment to free market principles, so surely in the future it is right that people should be able to move. Market principles and constraints will operate so that if everyone wants to install himself in, say, London or Paris, rents will rise and wages will fall because the supply of labour will be greater than demand and people will move away again. Therefore, the natural economic mechanism will work towards equilibrium, even if we never finally achieve it. My hon. Friend should be satisfied by that response as I know she shares my faith in the economic mechanism.</p> <p>
The second thing that struck me about the debate was the suggestion that was almost explicit in the speech by the right hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethnal_Green">Bethnal Green</a> and Stepney (Mr. Shore) and was implicit in a number of interventions by Conservative Members, that somehow the establishment of the principle of the free movement of persons in the European Community would compromise the national sovereignty of member states. I thought that that was an extraordinary suggestion.</p> <p>
After all, before 1914 we had free movement of persons in western Europe. One could go to Victoria station and buy a ticket to Paris, Rome, Vienna or Berlin and travel to those places without any bureaucratic let or hindrance and without showing any passport or visa. One can make many comments about the world of pre-1914 Europe, but one thing from which it surely did not suffer was a lack of national sovereignty because we ended up with an appalling fractricidal conflict which was, I suppose, the ultimate proof of national sovereignty.</p> <p>
We need not feel that there is any conflict between the principle of national sovereignty and the free movement of persons. Surely the re-establishment of the free movement that was enjoyed in the civilised world before 1914 is a considerable advance. Thank goodness we can now look forward to it after the unhappy interval of most of the 20th century.</p> <p>
It is also more than a little naive of hon. Members, most of them Conservative, to believe that frontier controls are an effective way of barring the entry of illegal immigrants or criminals, including terrorists. So many millions of people cross internal frontiers in the Community every day that it would be impossible for immigration officers at those frontiers to examine microscopically every passport presented to them and ask the many questions necessary to make the controls effective. The only answer is to have better internal controls, and I hope we shall have them. We must vet social security registers and have more checks on employers suspected of employing illegal immigrant labour.</p> <p>
If we are to make a reality of the free movement of people in the Community&#8212;a desirable objective which every humane person supports&#8212;we must also strengthen controls on the external frontiers of the Community. I am not satisfied that we should leave it to, say, a Greek immigration officer on the Thracian frontier with Turkey to decide who shall and shall not come into the Community and thereby acquire the right to install himself or herself in Lincolnshire. A successful regime of free movement must be based on the same high standard of control of immigration applying at all external frontiers.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>This is the first time I have spoken on the Bill and on the treaty on European union, so at the outset I express my appreciation to the British Management Data Foundation Ltd., which was responsible for producing consolidated text without which I would have been in the same difficulty as the Home Secretary, who confessed his problems in coping with the legislation. Like him, I cannot claim to have read and fully digested the entire text, but without the document we would have been floundering.</p> <p>
There has been much discussion about the extent to which decisions on immigration policy would be subject to unanimity or qualified <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> and the extent to which the competency of the Community could be extended to cover other matters. Assurances have been given by the Home Secretary and others about there being a double lock on those matters, so that we need not be concerned about whether there are adequate safeguards for national sovereignty and the authority of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Parliament">British Parliament</a>.</p> <p>
I intervened yesterday to point out that part of the difficulty stemmed from the fact that we did not have in the United Kingdom constitution an adequate procedure for dealing with those issues. We do not have an adequate ratification procedure. What in substance we are doing in these proceedings is ratifying the treaty on European union. We are doing that not by considering the treaty but by debating a short measure of two clauses. To smuggle in the substantive provisions of the treaty on European union, we must go through the elaborate procedure of tabling hundreds of amendments, some of which, according to our procedure, are selected and others are not.</p> <p>
In that context, I agreed with a point of order raised by the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) about the difficulty in following the procedure. Life would be easier and our proceedings would be more coherent if we adopted the sort of procedure followed by other member states by which the treaty is embodied in legislation. Legislators can then discuss the provisions of the treaty in a coherent way.</p>            </div>

Many Community provisions are operated through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council">European Council</a>.

I was glad yesterday to hear the Home Secretary express surprise that certain documents relating to the convention on frontiers had not been lodged in the Library. He promised to make them available and I am glad that he has done that. If we are to deal effectively with matters arising under the treaty&#8212;immigration, security, policing, justice and so on&#8212;we must examine the way in which information comes to us, in particular ensuring that it is readily accessible.</p>            </div>

However, I certainly agree about the unsatisfactory way in which the Trevi group has operated and I take his point about our Government's policy being decided in those discussions and, consequently, not fully debated here. Perhaps, as a result of those proceedings, we shall move into a slightly better phase and reform our procedures. The fact that the treaty on European union is putting ad hoc arrangements with Trevi on a more formal footing and providing a better basis for them to proceed may give this House, if it changes and adapts its procedures, the opportunity to have some involvement in matters that have hitherto been dealt with

through Trevi and other ad hoc groups. So there might be some occasion for improvement, if we so decide, if we address ourselves, as I think we must, to the issue of dealing with policy matters, and if the treaty goes ahead. It is essential for the House to get to grips with the issue.</p> <p>
That was a comment on our discussions yesterday. Our problems would be eased if we had a proper application procedure.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I eschew the temptation to reply to that very valuable and interesting <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>. The hon. Member has a fair idea of my views on the matter, but I was reflecting on the difficulties arising because we do not have a procedure for ratification.</p> <p>
Dealing with the relationship between articles 100c and K.9, which was discussed at some length yesterday, another point that occurs to me is that with this procedure, as with so many things in connection with the European Community, we are dealing with a ratchet effect. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> said that we do not have to worry, because there will have to be a unanimous decision before various matters move from unanimity to qualified <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a>. That is all right up to a point, but there only has to be one decision and it is over the dam and never comes back. We only have to have a <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> or a different Government who decide to adopt a different policy and it goes over the dam and moves from unanimity to qualified majority, and it never comes back. That is part of the problem.</p> <p>
I remember many occasions on which the former right hon. Member for Finchley, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroness_Thatcher">Baroness Thatcher</a>, used to complain about the attitude within the British body politic about socialism and the ratchet effect. She was determined


to unwind that, and succeeded. Unfortunately, it will take a considerable effort to unwind the ratchet effect that is operating here.</p> <p>
Hon. Members have pointed out that much of what we are dealing with here is related to free movement of people and passport and border control provisions. They flowed from the basic concept of the free movement of persons which was written into the original treaty of Rome and was one of its central provisions. If free movement is to be implemented, it produces a common travel area within the entire Community. It is extending to the entire Community the common travel area that exists within the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles">British Isles</a>. Perhaps that is not a very good point or a helpful or encouraging analogy, but basically that is what it is doing.</p> <p>
When people were expressing concern about whether extension of the common travel area would have implications for the powers under the prevention of terrorism Act or exclusion orders to deal with terrorism, the Home Secretary offered reassurance. I should like him to look more closely at that reassurance. He was referring us to paragraph 3 of article 48 of the treaties, which says:
<q>It shall entail the right, subject to limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health:".</q>
At first sight, that seems to preserve measures such as the prevention of terrorism Act because they come under public security, but paragraph 3 of article 48 is under the heading "Workers" and paragraph 1 of the article is about freedom of movement for workers which shall be secured, and so on. Article 8a, which is about citizenship, will be discussed later. It says:
<q>Every citizen of the Union shall have the right to move and reside freely within the territory &#8230;".</q>
There may be a difference of meaning between citizen and worker and I should like the Minister who is to reply to consider that. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am_I">Am I</a> right in suggesting that the power to have limitation on public security grounds operates only with regard to movement of workers and not with regard to the movement of people who are not workers? I hope that I am not right in that supposition, and I hope that it is possible to have restrictions on public security grounds generally, because they are extremely necessary and desirable.</p> <p>
If we move into this new era of freedom of movement and a common travel area within the Community, it also follows, as has already been said, that controls designed to prevent crime and terrorism will have to switch from borders to operate internally. If we are to enable those to operate effectively internally, it is no good requiring every citizen to carry a passport at all times, to enable them to establish their identity. The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), who was opposing the suggestion, said that an inevitable corollary of adoption of the travel area will be a requirement for identity cards and a power for the police to be able to stop people and require them to establish their identity. I agree with her that if we go down this road we shall go to that conclusion. She did not like that conclusion, but I have no problem with it. I think that it would be desirable and necessary, in order to have some effective control on drugs and terrorism, but it is only a small point.</p> <p>
The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) said that other steps would have to be taken to ensure that checks were made within member states. He

pointed out, for instance, that checks would be necessary to ensure that people were not employing immigrant workers. That is an excellent idea; I hope that, at the same time, the authorities will check that employees are not "doing the double".</p> <p>
This group of amendments is headed "Justice and Home: Frontiers, Visas, Asylum". I want to concentrate not on the detail of article 1000c, as most hon. Members have, but on article K.1, and, in particular, paragraphs 7 and 9. I trust that I am right in thinking that I shall remain in order in so doing: I tried to track down all the amendments listed under that heading, but that proved very difficult.</p> <p>
Article K, and indeed title VI as a whole, set out provisions for
<q>Co-operation in the fields of justice and home affairs.</q>
The concept of co-operation is fine in theory, and, were they to be implemented effectively, the provisions in paragraph 7 of article K.1, which refers to
<q>judicial co-operation in criminal matters".</q>
and in paragraph 9 of that article, which refers to
<q>police co-operation for the purposes of preventing and combating terrorism",</q>
would be excellent. I do not want my comments to be misinterpreted: I do not want it to be thought that I consider co-operation anything other than necessary and desirable. The effectiveness of co-operation, however&#8212;I refer to intergovernmental co-operation, under article K &#8212;depends crucially on the integrity of the Governments of member states, and on their willingness to co-operate.</p> <p>
I cannot discuss police co-operation in the handling of terrorism without mentioning the serious terrorist problem that exists within the Community. Co-operation is supposed to deal with that, but we must ask whether the necessary integrity exists. Progress will depend on a recognition by member states that they have a common interest, and should pull together. It ought to be incompatible with the existence of a European Community for one member state to have a territorial claim against another; it should be even more incompatible with the existence of such a Community for one member state with a territorial claim against another to pursue that claim actively.</p> <p>
Claims that are merely historical survivals, as it were, may not cause much of a problem. Within the British Isles, however, a member state has a territorial claim against another, and is actively pursuing that claim in terms of diplomacy and discussion. During the recent inter-party talks on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, we discovered that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Government">Irish Government</a>, far from eschewing their territorial claim, were using the talks to advance it. That is one of the reasons for the foundering of those talks.</p> <p>
Hon. Members who watched the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC2">BBC2</a> programme "Timewatch" last night will have noted that, in the recent past, the Irish Government even contemplated advancing their territorial claim by means of armed aggression: indeed, they put in train the necessary steps for a form of proxy warfare whereby they would support and assist a terrorist organisation. Moreover, they contemplated the further step of actual invasion. The programme referred to a planned invasion of the spring of 1970, but did not deal with the planned invasion of August 1969. I know that the programme makers gathered material relating to that invasion; I am surprised that no mention was made of it.</p> <p>
I observe some puzzlement on the Conservative Benches. I should be delighted to be able to go into the


matter in detail, but I shall not do so, Mr. Lofthouse: we are now dealing with the general principles of the treaty. My basic point is that co-operation on matters relating to security and terrorism depends on the existence of the trust and integrity that are so sadly absent now.</p> <p>
When I mentioned the matter in business questions this afternoon, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a> said that we should focus on the present co-operation. My colleagues and I believe that the present co-operation is a sham: we could demonstrate that time and again by referring to the tremendous incidence of cross-border-related terrorism, and to the conspicuous inability of the Irish army and police to prevent such crimes&#8212;or, except very rarely, even to detain those involved.</p>            </div>

I feel that that is the crux of what the hon. Gentleman is trying to say. Perhaps, by implication, he has said it; but he has not spelt it out clearly.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>In so far as controls on movement within the Community are diminished, there is a real prospect of that. It will be easier for terrorists to move from one part of the Community to another. That has already happened in regard to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_IRA">Provisional IRA</a> terrorist operations on the continental land mass: for instance, a terrorist cell that appeared to be based in Holland proved to be active in Belgium and western Germany, and to be moving easily between frontiers. Interestingly, they were the frontiers of the countries involved in the Schengen agreement&#8212;the countries that have gone furthest in achieving the necessary co-operation in dealing with cross-border matters. They allow a degree of what might be called hot pursuit; in some areas, joint patrols operate. Yet the terrorists were clearly exploiting the borders.</p> <p>
Greater freedom of movement will mean greater danger, and will lead to a need for further safeguards. I mentioned those earlier when I spoke of the need for identity cards. If we do not consider such matters, the position will worsen. Moreover, we may appear to endorse the Government's current belief that co-operation exists. Under article K, a new procedure will be established, a committee of officials will be appointed to consider the issues involved, and it may become easier for Ministers to lull themselves&#8212;or deceive themselves&#8212;into thinking that co-operation exists where, in practice, it does not. That is already happening, to an extent, in relations between Her Majesty's Government and the Government of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republic">Irish Republic</a>. Her Majesty's Government think that there is co-operation; but that co-operation is strictly limited and not entirely sincere. The enactment of the legislation will provide further opportunities to deceive an Administration who have already proved remarkably gullible.</p> <p>
As well as dealing with police co-operation on terrorism, article K refers to judicial co-operation. That, too, would be highly desirable if it were effective. I hope that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will give us a progress report on what is happening in the Community.</p> <p>
The European convention on the suppression of terrorism, which was adopted many years ago, provides for extradition in certain circumstances. I understand that discussions about new extradition arrangments are taking place in Europe. I should be interested to know what is happening on that front. What are the current plans and proposals with regard to judicial co-operation relating to criminal matters? The European convention on the suppression of terrorism has not been a success. There are far too many loopholes in article 1, and unfortunately the provisions in article 2, which apply it to almost any offence, have not been implemented.</p> <p>
There is a paradox in regard to extradition to which I should like to refer briefly. If we are to have European union, with free movement, we ought to adopt measures such as those that were adopted in the middle of the 19th century in the British empire. In that case, the assumption was that Her Majesty's courts in any jurisdiction, being the courts of Her Majesty, were worthy of utter and implicit faith. In the middle of the 19th century there was introduced the procedure referred to as backing of warrants. A warrant in respect of a fugitive from one jurisdiction was automatically backed in another jurisdiction. There was no inquiry into the grounds on which the warrant had been issued; the courts were all Her Majesty's courts. Whether the incident involved a colony or the home country, the warrant was effective. That is how matters should be in a union.</p> <p>
One might expect that the courts in one jurisdiction within a European union would treat as valid all the actions of the courts in another jurisdiction in that union. That would represent movement in the direction of the backing of warrants.</p> <p>
In fact, in respect of extradition matters, we are moving in the opposite direction. Into our backing of warrants, the Government&#8212;at the behest of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Government">Irish Government</a>, I think&#8212;are introducing more pure extradition procedures by way of a speciality rule. It may be&#8212;who knows?&#8212;that they will move to a prima facie rule. In the area of judicial co-operation, it is curious that, in respect of these matters, we are moving in the direction opposite to that in which we should be moving.</p> <p>
I finish by making a simple point: while co-operation is useful, we should not be blinded to the fact that we shall have to do the job ourselves. There ought to be co-operation in respect of security, terrorism and judicial matters, but we ought not to lull ourselves into the belief that co-operation in itself will do the job.</p> <p>
The Government are not prepared to accept the <a href="/glossary/?gl=234" title="The European Commission is the politically independent institution that..." class="glossary">European Commission</a>'s view with regard to immigration provisions. They insist on retaining some measure of control within the United Kingdom, even if only by way of requiring people to produce passports briefly. Implicit in that approach is that the Government do not intend to rely on the decisions of officials in Germany or Greece or Italy or Spain and that they want to reserve the right to make decisions on their own. It is right that they should do so, and the same approach should be adopted to co-operation


in respect of terrorism and justice. By all means, let us have co-operation, but let us not believe that that in itself is sufficient. It will still be necessary for Her Majesty's Government to take care of their citizens' basic right to live free from terrorism and to enjoy a fully effective judicial system.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>Before hearing the speech of the hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Bann">Upper Bann</a> (Mr. Trimble), I felt that the Committee was in danger of forgetting the very real value to British people, and indeed to the people of other countries in the European Community, of much closer co-operation in dealing with crime of all sorts. The hon. Gentleman has done us a favour by reminding us of that fact.</p> <p>
At a time when terrorists and drug traffickers do not respect national frontiers, when technology enables money to be transferred from country to country and from continent to continent at the flick of a switch on a computer terminal, it is clearly sensible to try to strengthen methods and institutions of international co-operation against crime.</p> <p>
The question that has divided hon. Members is the extent to which the provisions of the treaty are likely to be effective. Perhaps more significant&#8212;a great deal of time has been spent on this point&#8212;is whether the constitutional framework provided in the Maastricht treaty and in this Bill contains adequate safeguards for British national interests, adequate controls for the Parliament and Government of this country in respect of crucial matters of policy.</p> <p>
I am not completely uncritical of various aspects of the Maastricht treaty. It is a compromise, and it contains some provisions that I would rather not see there. However, I am genuinely suprised at the strength and passion of the criticism that some of my hon. Friends have levelled at those aspects&#8212;in particular, article K. Article K and the more general provisions intended to strengthen cooperation against crime and to control immigration are of positive value to the people of the United Kingdom.</p> <p>
I should like to deal first with a criticism that was expressed most strongly by my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor) but was echoed by several other hon. Friends&#8212;that the United Kingdom risks being invaded by hordes of foreigners and that, under this treaty, we shall surrender our right to lay down immigration rules. Certainly there is a problem about immigration control, but it arises from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_European_Act">Single European Act</a> and from the differing interpretations of it by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom">Government of the United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=234" title="The European Commission is the politically independent institution that..." class="glossary">European Commission</a>, rather than from the treaty. I echo what several of my hon. Friends have said about the importance to this country of the preservation of good race relations and strong and effective control of immigration. However, even if the Maastricht treaty were rejected by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Parliament">British Parliament</a>, that dispute&#8212;that potential challenge to our control over immigration&#8212;would remain. It does not matter whether the treaty is accepted or rejected so far as that dilemma, that potential for argument and dispute, is concerned. It derives from the Single European Act, and it will remain.</p>            </div>

Friend echoes the substance of an <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> that he made earlier. The problem of the irreversibility of a decision to cede a particular aspect of policy to Community competence is not unique to the Maastricht treaty. It is something that is inherent in membership of the European Community itself.</p> <p>
If my hon. Friend and those who take his part on this point wish to say that the United Kingdom should withdraw from the European Community, that is a logical, coherent position to take. But if they believe that the advantage lies with the United Kingdom remaining a member of the EC, they must accept that measures ceded to Community decision-taking can only then be reversed either by agreement or by the very drastic step of seeking to bring into question our very membership.</p>            </div>

Friend and others who share his views should have their say, and they have been given ample opportunity to contribute in their particular and distinctive manner on the several days that the Committee has sat.</p> <p>
I go along with my hon. Friend to this extent. I too believe that we should seriously question the direction in which, it sometimes seems, the European Community is inexorably developing. I sympathise with those hon. Members who have looked back at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_European_Act">Single European Act</a> and who feel that, whereas they signed up for a deal and were told that there were limits to Community competence, the goalposts have now been changed and we have gone back on what had apparently been firmly agreed.</p> <p>
I give strong support to article K and to the other intergovernmental pillars which form part of this treaty, because, for the first time in treaty form, they offer an alternative model of European co-operation, one which I think is more in the interests of the people of this country than the classic federalist model which is honestly and openly espoused by, for example, Mr. Delors, Mr. Kohl and even one or two hon. Members on the Government Benches.</p>            </div>

There are areas in which it is right for Community institutions to have the proper competence, but why does my hon. Friend think it necessary that potential competence with, in some respects, minimal parliamentary scope for <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>, on these sensitive issues should be passed by the House through this treaty to European institutions?</p>            </div>

I believe that the respective constitutional requirements should be <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Parliament">Acts of Parliament</a> where a change in British domestic law is required, as we are doing with the treaty and as we have done in respect of other international conventions, freely negotiated by British Governments, in judicial and police co-operation&#8212;where we have negotiated conventions on extradition and on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, and they have been translated into British domestic law through Acts of Parliament, going through all their stages in both Houses.</p> <p>
I hope that, over the next 10 to 12 years, we can move away from the federal model of Europe towards one which is more confederal, under which we escape this idea of being bound on the travelator to some predetermined destination, and instead can co-operate, one country with another, ceding limited and defined areas of policy, like the single market, for decision on a supranational basis, but around that having a whole gamut of different areas and systems of co-operation to suit the particular needs of various groups of countries which are yet all members of one European union.</p> <p>
Intergovernmental institutions for co-operation against crime and against illegal immigration will form an important part of that Europe of variable geometry which I wish to move towards. I hope that we can ratify this treaty quickly and get on with the task of building intergovernmental co-operation because that, more than anything else, will put the United Kingdom in the strongest possible position when we approach the next round of EC negotiations.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>This is the first time that I have sought to speak in the debates of the Committee. Last night, my right hon. Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethnal_Green">Bethnal Green</a> and Stepney (Mr. Shore), in a most eloquent and thoughtful speech, asked a number of questions, to which so far he has received no answer. I hope that the Home Secretary will seek the leave of the Committee to intervene again so that he can give full replies to the questions asked by my right hon. Friend.</p> <p>
For instance, will it be possible for EC nationals coming to the United Kingdom under the free movement arrangements to establish a business without any evidence of funds? Will it be possible for them to apply for local authority housing? My right hon. Friend asked a number of other questions and, before the Government seek to move the closure of the debate, I hope that we will receive answers to them. I shall be asking the Home Secretary a number of other questions, to which I hope we shall receive answers tonight.</p> <p>
Underlying this debate is the concern of many of us about the inbuilt unfairness, racial discrimination and other difficulties which non-EC nationals will experience in seeking to exercise their right to free movement, and the difficulties, racial discrimination and problems that non-EC nationals wishing to come to the European Community, including the United Kingdom, will experience.</p> <p>
Under the free movement arrangements, members of the family of an EC national are able to come to this country, including the person's spouse, their children under 21, their other children and grandchildren if still dependent, and their dependent parents, grandparents and great grandparents.</p> <p>
Many of us deal daily with the difficulties of many of our constituents in seeking to obtain permission for their spouses and dependent children to come to this country. Those difficulties are extremely protracted, and it often takes years to secure permission for spouses and dependent children to come to the United Kingdom. Our constituents in that position are very envious indeed of the extensive rights that are being given to EC nationals as far as dependent relatives are concerned.</p> <p>
I want also to point to the difficulties which the Government have in recent months put in the way of dependants of former detainees in the former Yugoslav states wishing to come to this country. Yesterday, I received a reply from the Under-Secretary to a parliamentary question, which reads as follows:
<q>My right hon. and learned Friend the Home Secretary has, however, decided that close dependants of the 1,000 former detainees will be allowed to join them for the duration of their stay. Generally, close dependants are regarded as the spouse and children under 18. However, in respect of the former detainees, we are also prepared to consider applications for visas from fully dependent and unmarried daughters over 18 and under 21, from elderly or sick parents, and from other relatives living in the most exceptional compelling compassionate circumstances.</q><q>The available information on other dependants of asylum applicants is that since the introduction of the visa requirements for nationals of certain parts of former Yugoslavia on 6 November 1992 about 20 people from the former Yugoslavia have been granted entry clearance to join relatives in the asylum-related cases.</q>
I repeat, just 20.</p> <p><q>In addition, under the arrangements I announced to the House on 30 November 1992, 130 close dependants of the


former detainees have so far been granted clearance to come to the United Kingdom. Sixty five applications by more distant relatives have been refused.</q>
Sixty-five have been refused, and I understand that they include elderly grandparents. It is shameful that the Government, with the situation in Bosnia, about which we all know and which has been referred to during the course of the debate in the Committee, should be allowing only such a small number of very close dependants to come here. I believe that this is a matter which the Home Secretary should reconsider urgently.</p>            </div>

The hon. Gentleman will remember that we recognised Bosnia and Croatia; we did not want to, but it was done by unanimity because of pressures within the Community. Through the same sort of pressures, we could unanimously decide to transfer asylum and immigration policy to European institutions. It would come back here for a vote late at night to be ratified, and that would be it. Before there is a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a>, the Conservative Government could have done all that, transferred all those powers.

Not a word was said by the Home Secretary during the course of that debate about the fact that three days later he was going to introduce visas for Bosnia.

Gentleman made, on top of the 40,000 residents of the former Yugoslavia who had come here before I introduced visas, we have undertaken to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> to take 1,000 former detainees, plus their dependants&#8212;about 4,000 in all. The first groups have arrived, and the second group is arriving imminently, dependent upon transport being able to get them out of Croatia, where they are making their way. We are certainly undertaking to admit close relatives of those persons.</p> <p>
So that the hon. Gentleman is not misled by my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Mr. Marlow), if we pass this Bill and ratify this treaty, the powers of the House and the Government to determine those matters will not be affected by one iota. Under the Maastricht treaty, matters of asylum are not brought within Community competence. So the hon. Gentleman can happily keep on making these points, but I hope that he will concede that so far we have made a more generous response than any other state in Europe to the request from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR">UNHCR</a> to take former detainees from the former Yugoslavia.</p>            </div>

Having taken in refugees and their immediate relatives, we cannot accede to what the hon.

If under the offer that we have made we admit a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_Muslim">Bosnian Muslim</a> who has been a detainee in a Serbian camp, we would obviously expect to admit his wife and children, but why should a grandparent who presumably lives in some other part of former Yugoslavia&#8212;for example, in Slovenia where there is not and has not been a war&#8212;also automatically qualify to come here as a refugee?</p> <p>
The hon. Gentleman cannot make sweeping assertions to the effect that the grandfather of every refugee we admit should also be admitted. As he always uses such amazing language to express his strictures on our immigration policy, it is not as outrageous as he suggests that we ask where the grandfather has been living and why he wants to come here.</p>            </div>

In confirming that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=205" title="An informal reference to the Council of the European Union." class="glossary">Council of Ministers</a> would have the right to extend its jurisdiction to immigration and asylum policy, will he reflect that, whether decisions are taken unanimously or through <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> voting, they are often taken on linked motives? For example, Croatia was recognised only under enormous pressure from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Government">German Government</a>.</p> <p>
In my hon. Friend's opinion, was it or was it not connected to the survival of the exchange rate of the pound and the deutschmark and to many other considerations? Does he not think that there are grave dangers in that process?</p>            </div>

throughout the Committee stage of the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Bill. I am sorry if I irritate the Home Secretary from time to time with the way in which I seek to defend the interests of my constituents, but it is a cross that I am afraid he will have to continue to bear.</p> <p>
The determination of citizenship, which is the basis of today's debate, is a matter to be decided by each member state. Of course, it is clear that, for the United Kingdom, European Community nationals are British citizens, British subjects under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Nationality_Act_1981">British Nationality Act 1981</a> who have a right of abode, and British dependent territory citizens who have that status by virtue of a connection with Gibraltar.</p> <p>
Various statements have been made in these debates about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> citizens and those of other former dependent territories. A contrast has been noted between the way in which France treats, for instance, the citizens of Guadeloupe and Martinique and Portugal treats the citizens of Macau. It is entirely a matter for the French and Portuguese to decide that the citizens of those territories are assumed to be EC nationals of those member states.</p> <p>
Only this week, I was in conversation with a number of representatives from Hong Kong who came to talk to hon. Members. They said that they would like to be treated by the United Kingdom in the way that the French are treating the citizens of Macau.</p>            </div>

Of course, it is not inconceivable that, after 1997, a <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of states could require the imposition of visas. Bearing in mind the brave attempts of Mr. Patten to increase democracy in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, the Government might say that they did not wish to, but were being forced to accept the imposition of visas on the citizens of Hong Kong by a majority of EC member states.</p> <p>
That is a graphic illustration of the difficulties that we could encounter in the foreseeable future, and it shows the ease with which the Government might be able to distance themselves from an extremely embarrassing situation by


blaming the provisions of the Bill and a majority vote of EC states. They could say that they had to acquiesce to the imposition of visas on the citizens of Hong Kong.</p> <p>
In a written reply last December, the Home Secretary said:</p> <p><q>I shall be considering what further changes might be made in the course of 1993 to United Kingdom immigration control arrangements, vis-a-vis other member states of the European Community, in the furtherance of our policy of reducing checks on EC nationals to the minimum level compatible with the retention of effective immigration control of third-country nationals together with adequate safeguards against the entry of terrorists and other serious criminals." &#8212;[<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1992; Vol 216, c. <i>446.</i>]</q>
That was in the context of the draft convention on the crossing of external frontiers. When the Home Secretary was interviewed by <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian">The Guardian</a>,</i> he seemed aghast and astonished, and did not know whether hon. Members had even seen that document, let alone considered it. After an embarrassing hoo-hah, the document has at last been <a href="/glossary/?gl=252" title="This phrase is often used in written answers to indicate that a minister..." class="glossary">placed in the Library</a>, as we heard earlier in the debate.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I am referring to the draft convention, Dame Janet, which deals directly with the subject matter of the debate. There seems to be some doubt and uncertainty about the extent of the provisions that we are debating, and I am informing the House about the extent of the draft convention. I shall soon finish.</p> <p><q>Articles 18&#8211;25: provide for member states to mutually recognise each other's short stay visas and, in the longer term, for the introduction of a uniform visa valid for travel throughout the European Community.</q>
I shall not complete the account of the rest of the articles, but I should be grateful if the Home Secretary would tell us when he believes that the convention will he agreed. I am grateful to the Library for producing research paper 93/7, page 12 of which says:</p> <p><q>Primary legislation would probably be needed to enable the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> to comply with certain of its provisions. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Asylum">The Asylum</a> and Immigration Appeals Bill 1992&#8211;1993 provides that passengers in transit need visas, and additional powers may be needed to enable air transfer passengers not seeking entry to the UK to be examined and granted leave. It would be necessary to adjust the legislation or rules as follows: &#8230; to

allow for short stays of three months as defined in the Convention. At present, the rules allow a maximum stay of 6 months".</q>
Will the Home Secretary break the habit of a lifetime and tell the Committee clearly whether he intends to reduce the period for which visitors to the United Kingdom are allowed to remain here from six months to three months this year? That is a matter of considerable concern, because the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Bill has abolished the right of appeal for people refused a visit to the United Kingdom. If the maximum period of stay were reduced from six months to three months, that would compound the sense of anger, injury and resentment already caused.</p> <p>
If the Home Secretary would intervene and tell the Committee clearly one way or the other, that would be much appreciated by thousands of my constituents who are anxious not only about the Government's past actions on immigration policy in general and on visitors in particular, but about their future actions.</p>            </div>

We have not ratified the convention, and at the moment we cannot do so, because of a dispute between Spain and ourselves over Spain's wish to maintain its border with Gibraltar. When it is ratified, some changes will be needed to domestic legislation and rules to bring it into effect. That will be within the competence of the House, and I shall then be able to discuss matters relevant to that debate, which are not relevant now.

I hope that the computer will be on my side and my question will be listed, which will enable the right hon. and learned Gentleman to give a direct reply to my direct question. I stress the great importance which many of my constituents attach to it.</p> <p>
My second point concerns the need to introduce visa exemptions for short-stay visitors who have visas or residence permits issued by other member states. Abolishing the visa exemption stamp and re-entry stamp was one of the silliest things that the Government have done in the past 12 months. It has caused considerable difficulty to many of my constituents. Again, the Government were rushed into that decision primarily on the grounds of cost rather than because of any other consideration.</p> <p>
The section also says that there will be a joint computerised list of inadmissible persons&#8212;those in prison for at least 12 months in a member state, or guilty of repeated immigration offences, for example. We are told that work is already under way.</p> <p>
Several hon. Members have asked today what the point of the visas is. What is the purpose behind the plan for common visas? Clearly it is designed to build up an enormous computer database.</p>            </div>

If we are not careful, he will soon be making a speech about the Dublin convention on asylum seekers. We have ratified that, through the ad hoc committee of Immigration Ministers. The convention that the hon. Gentleman is talking about is now before that ad hoc committee, and it has been agreed in principle but not ratified. Currently, I am afraid, it is not likely to be ratified in the near future.</p> <p>
Such discussions take place now. Like my predecessors, I regularly go to Europe and discuss such matters at meetings of the ad hoc committee of Immigration Ministers. That is my responsibility in government, and it also falls solely within the responsibility of this Parliament. I am accountable to Parliament for these matters, and no one has ever bothered to challenge them in the past.</p> <p>
The Bill simply puts arrangements which are already in place on a more formal footing. If Maastricht is ratified, the hon. Gentleman will get more information about these discussions than he has been able to obtain in the past. There will be no surrender of our sovereignty or control. Although this is an interesting debate, and I accept that I am accountable for what I have agreed to in the Dublin convention, it has absolutely nothing to do with Maastricht. The hon. Gentleman's right to raise these matters on behalf of his constituents is not even faintly affected by this debate.</p>            </div>

There has been a coalition between Front-Bench spokesmen across the Chamber in this debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) was moved to say late last night that not only is there a coalition between them but they also all happen to be lawyers. They seem to be trying to kid us that these matters have no implications for other areas. In that they are terribly wrong. All of them are related, all of them are linked.</p> <p>
The main objective, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) said, is to keep out of fortress Europe as many black and Asian people as possible and to create as much difficulty as possible for black and Asian non-EC nationals living in the European Community who seek to exercise their rights to free movement within it.</p>            </div>

It may be convenient for the Home Secretary to say that the House will not be prevented from debating these issues: that may well be true. A county council is not usually fettered in what it can debate. The problem is that it does not always have powers to do anything. If Maastricht goes through, we will be unable to have an asylum and immigration policy different from that laid down by the European Community, because of the reserve powers that the Community holds to take asylum and immigration into its jurisdiction.</p>            </div>

Gentleman's notion&#8212;that under the treaty these matters will effectively be dealt with as if the Community were a single state. Implicit in that is the idea that no Community national would ever be persecuted in circumstances arising under article 1 of the Geneva convention. Given the unfortunate and depressing assessment of what is happening in Germany at present &#8212;the persecution of people who have gone to that country and the revival of fascism there&#8212;would the hon. Gentleman be satisfied if the same sort of principles were applied under the treaty as appear not to be applied to those being persecuted in Germany?</p>            </div>

When we challenged the Under-Secretary in Committee about what would happen when someone was returned, having sought asylum in this country, to a so-called safe third country, he said that he did not know&#8212;it was not his business. That shows the compassion of the Government.</p> <p>
The Bill also requires those seeking asylum to be fingerprinted. We could not even get the Government to set an age limit below which a child should not be fingerprinted. They even refused to exempt lone children seeking asylum here. As far as I know, only one Conservative Member voted against one of the most offensive clauses, although others abstained.</p> <p>
Conservative Members' education about these matters is not quite as good as it could be, but I trust that, when the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Bill returns from <a href="/glossary/?gl=112" title="During a debate members of the House of Commons traditionally refer to the..." class="glossary">another place</a>, where I hope that their Lordships will defeat <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.

Once we take joint action, a joint policy emerges, and once there is a joint policy at the European level, we can never take back control of it.

We held an exhaustive discussion on article K.3(2) yesterday. Decisions under it must be taken unanimously. That means that the British and Danish Governments would have to agree to them, and it is quite plain that no foreseeable Danish or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a> would so so.</p> <p>
They also require the approval of the House, because, even under article K.3(2), conventions must be carried forward in accordance with constitutional arrangements in each member state. The double lock is most unlikely to be unlocked in the foreseeable future. That is why I say that, in this part of the treaty, nothing is being brought into the Community's competence except the list of countries from which we require visas, and the format of the visas.</p>            </div>

These are important matters, directly bearing on the question of my right hon. Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethnal_Green">Bethnal Green</a> and Stepney, who asked what information will be required when an EC national, with his large army of dependants&#8212;they are unacceptable if they come from Bosnia&#8212;applies. I see the Home Secretary laughing, but these are serious issues. Let us not forget that 300 million EC nationals could come here if they wished to.</p> <p>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East that it is unlikely that 300 million EC nationals will seek to come to Britain. However, that might happen and even <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun">The Sun</a></i> might one day be persuaded to issue some warnings about it. I urge the Home Secretary to think about that.</p>            </div>

He has made that comment several times, but it does not mean that he has answered the questions that were put to him. The question to which he refuses to turn his mind relates not to the matters in article K and article 100c but to the basic matter in article 8a:</p> <p><q>Every citizen of the Union shall have the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_States">Member States</a>, subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in this Treaty and by the measures adopted to give it effect.</q>
Will the Home Secretary address those conditions and other matters in the treaty so that we may know what right has been given to 300 million Europeans and so that we can judge how such rights compare with rights that may be extended to people from third countries, those who are not Community nationals?</p>            </div>

I shall conclude by referring to the difficulties faced by many British citizens when visiting other EC states and outline a case with reference to France. Late last night, my hon. Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Isles">Western Isles</a> (Mr. Macdonald) raised the issue of the legal position of a French citizen who was refused the right to enter the United Kingdom. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> looked a bit perplexed, and on brief reflection denied that a French citizen refused a right of entry to the United Kingdom had any remedy in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice">European Court of Justice</a>.</p> <p>
One of my constituents, a British citizen recently refused entry to France, is seeking compensation from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Government">French Government</a>. If he is not given satisfaction, he intends, on legal advice, to take the case to the European Court. The incident occurred in early December, and my constituent, who was travelling on a British visitor's passport and also had in his possession his British citizen certificate, was refused entry at Calais by a French immigration officer who could not speak English, who did not endeavour to get assistance from a colleague who did,


and who did not bother to make any inquiries of officials in Dover or anywhere else. My constituent was back on the ferry within 14 minutes of seeking entry to France.</p>            </div>

Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Mr. Lennox-Boyd), perhaps the most relaxed and laid-back member of the Government, told me:</p> <p><q>A copy of your letter has been faxed to the Consular Section of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Embassy">British Embassy</a> in Paris. They will take the matter up directly with the French Immigration Service. As you say this matter is distressing. It is very rare for immigration officers to take exception to British nationals travelling on British Visitors Passports. I will write to you again when we receive a reply from the French authorities.</q>
No reply has yet been received. Although my constituent is a British citizen, he was travelling on a British visitor's passport because of the horrendous difficulty in obtaining a British passport. As the Home Secretary knows, long delays led to those who were entitled to British passports seeking visitors' passports at post offices. I hope that the Home Secretary will ensure that those entitled to British citizenship and to British passports will be able to get them reasonably quickly. I also hope that he will ensure that non-EC nationals settled

in the United Kingdom will be able to travel to other EC member states for a period of three months without the need to apply for a visa.</p>            </div>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_99">Article 99</a> states:
<q><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Council">The Council</a> shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament">European Parliament</a> and the Economic and Social Committee, adopt


provisions for the harmonization of legislation concerning turnover taxes, excise duties and other forms of indirect taxation to the extent that such harmonization is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market within the time limit laid down in Article 7a.</q>
It is important to emphasise the words
<q>to the extent that such harmonization is necessary to ensure".</q>
Labour has not supported and does not support the contention that it is necessary to make indirect tax rates the same to ensure that the single market operates effectively.</p> <p>
In particular, we have vigorously opposed any moves to end the opportunity for Britain to levy a zero rate of value added tax. We equally oppose the move that the Government are reportedly contemplating, to impose VAT on newspapers, books and publications in the forthcoming Budget. Any such move would place a wholly undesirable burden on consumers and would inflict gratuitous damage on important national industries at this time of deep recession. What is more, such a change could not be justified as necessary for the functioning of the single market.</p>            </div>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_99">Article 99</a> in its new form would surely give the Community that very power. Unlike the existing article 99, which is entrenched in the treaty of Rome, there is no escape <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a>, as the Home Secretary was vigorously advocating in the last debate saying that article 8a was not relevant because it already exists. This is a new article 99 and if the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> is carried, as I hope it will be, the Bill will provide that no regulation or directive from the European Community can increase or apply VAT to anything which is at the moment derogated. I would have thought that that would have appealed enormously to my

hon. Friend. Surely it is the legal and precise reading of such an amendment because we would have a new article 99 after the treaty of European union.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I have made it clear that I do not interpret article 99 as involving that danger. Moreover, I would not advocate supporting an <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> that would wreck the treaty.</p> <p>
In any event, it is somewhat ironic that we are debating this part of the Bill today, four weeks after the advent of the single market and the 31 December 1992 deadline set out in article 7a to which article 99 refers. The single market is of course already with us and this evening's debate provides us with an early opportunity to press the Government on their judgment of how well or badly the new arrangements are working out in practice and, in particular, on how things stand in regard to the operation of the new VAT regime.</p> <p>
The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will have seen many of the reports in the press highlighting the difficulties which are all the more serious because they impede consumers and businesses from making the most of the opportunities which the single market offers.</p> <p><i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a></i> of Monday 18 January reported a number of serious problems. It said that:
<q>Accountants &#8230; phone lines have been jammed by companies who cannot ship goods around Europe because of tax difficulties say the situation is chaos with no prospect for improvement for months yet.</q>
Christine Sanderson of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_Waterhouse">Price Waterhouse</a> was quoted as saying:
<q>Many people do not understand what the changes are and so they are not properly prepared. But the most disappointing aspect has been that various countries are not prepared. We had believed that government would get their act together.</q>
The article continues:
<q>Trouble spots have emerged in Spain, Portugal, Italy and, perhaps more surprisingly, in Belgium and the Netherlands where lorries have been kept waiting at customs points while officials checked documents which in theory should no longer be required.</q>
The article goes on to itemise other difficulties:
<q>Huge backlogs in handing out VAT numbers on the continent. VAT registration is absolutely essential to the working of the new system.</q>


Although Britain is well prepared in that respect, those other member states which have used other tax codes have now had to dish out many new tax codes specifically for the purpose of VAT. The article continues:
<q>Price Waterhouse estimate that there are 'millions' of VAT numbers to be issued, a process which could take years. Companies selling to buyers who have not yet received a VAT number could find themselves liable for the payments which may not be recoverable.".</q></p>            </div>

May I also back-track to support the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing), who I call my hon. Friend for these purposes, in regard to his point about derogation. As leader of an <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> party, I have always taken the view that whenever we are in doubt we should oppose the Government of the day, whatever colour it may be, to safeguard those who send us here.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I agree with the first part of what the hon. Gentleman said. Clearly, it is incumbent on Governments to get their act together for the introduction of the new VAT regime. Can the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> say what information the Government now have on the adequacy of those preparations and how far are other countries properly geared up to issuing VAT numbers and to the full and fair administration of the new system?</p> <p>
I now return to the other difficulties itemised in the article. They include confusion over goods currently in Customs warehouses awaiting export. The article stated:
<q><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Holland">In Holland</a> and Belgium, tax authorities have told companies they will not release goods that entered warehouses before January 1 unless VAT is paid first. This form of back tax is not legal, according to British tax opinion.</q>
It would be helpful to have the Government view about that. The article went on to refer to what it described as
<q>the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEC">EEC</a>'s infamous simplification directive, which was intended to make it easier for companies exporting to buyers in one EC country via a middleman in a third member state &#8230; That has already broken down in Spain. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spanish">The Spanish</a> have said they will not implement the directive until September, so British companies selling indirectly to Spain will have to register there temporarily.</q>
It concluded by drawing attention to what it described as
<q>the biggest problem yet to come.</q>
That was the need for companies, by 10 February, to file details of their January exports and imports with national tax authorities. It pointed out that the relevant form
<q>asks 19 different questions, including the weight of the goods shipped, their value and a code number.</q>
Although ignoring those is a criminal offence, the article said:
<q>one medium-sized exporter &#8230; reckons it will have to double its export clerical staff to deal with the new requirement, which in the past was handled entirely by government officials.</q>

May we have the Government's estimation, on the basis of information available to them, of the extent of those difficulties and what is being done about them?</p>            </div>

Whereas ordinary imports and exports can be dealt with&#8212;it will take time, but such matters will eventually be sorted out&#8212;the authorities have not got anywhere near sorting out the intercountry, third party trade, where a trading body buys from one country and sells to another, conducting a valuable wholesaling function. Proper provision has not been made for that. It may be months before those concerned even begin to work out satisfactory solutions.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I share my right hon. Friend's concern about that serious issue. I fear that the problems will result in what was intended to be a better system getting off to a damaging start. As he says, it could act as a great disadvantage to a country such as ours. A great proportion of our production goes for export, exceeded, sadly, by the faster rising level of imports. Are the problems to which I referred confirmed by the information that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> is receiving? If so, what action is being taken by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a> and other member states to resolve them?</p> <p>
Further to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing), will the Minister state the British Government's position on, and interpretation of, the Community's legal position on the future of the legally binding minimum VAT rate of 15 per cent., which the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> conceded in July last year was part of the package which then enabled Britain to retain its zero rates, at least to the end of 1996, when the agreement comes up for review? An article in the <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times">Financial Times</a></i> on 28 July last year said:
<q>There is still some confusion about whether member states have committed themselves to having a legally binding minimum VAT rate for ever. Mr. Lamont indicated that the directive would lapse if ministers failed to reach unanimous agreement on a renewed legally binding minimum before 1996. The Community would then be subject only to last year's non-binding accord.</q>
It reports others as disagreeing, pointing out that Mr. Jorge Braga de Macedo of Portugal, who was the Chancellor's predecessor as president of the Council of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Ministers">Finance Ministers</a>, believed that
<q>the legally binding minimum would be automatically renewed if they failed to agree. That would deprive dissenters, possibly including Britain, of any effective veto.</q>
That issue is of great concern to hon. Members and I hope that the Minister will give a clear answer, including the benefit of the legal advice that the Government are receiving on the issue.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>There will be other occasions to deal with matters such as those. I am anxious to remain in order and to relate my arguments to the amendments now before the Committee. I have already made it clear that the Labour party does not believe it necessary to levy the same rate of indirect tax for the single market to operate properly.</p> <p>
I have put a number of questions to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>. Given the importance of developments that will be occurring in future years on the subjects I have raised, perhaps the Minister will give the latest Government thinking on the arguments for a move to an origin-based system rather than the destination-based system of VAT that is now operating. The change has been advocated by the Commission and others. What is the Minister's response, for example, to the arguments advanced by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpler_Trade_Procedures_Board">Simpler Trade Procedures Board</a>, known as Sitpro, that an origin-based system would be an improvement because it would replicate the domestic system, dispense with the requirement for a European sales listing, eliminate the need for evidence that goods have left the country and avoid the complex problems of triangulation&#8212;or strangulation, as some in the trade are already calling it?</p> <p>
May we also be assured that if the Government were looking to an origin-based regime, as the Commission is likely to press member states to consider, our zero rates could be retained? It is important for us to know what stance the Government are taking on Community discussion of those important policy issues.</p> <p>
Have there been any developments since the draft 7th VAT directive was considered by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=248" title="In a normal session there are up to ten standing committees on bills. Each..." class="glossary">Standing Committee</a> on 2 December? At that time we debated, in particular, the question of the rate of VAT on imported works of art. Hon. Members in all parts of the House expressed concern about the future of London's international art market, which is worth well over &#163;1 billion a year, if the proposals set out in that draft directive and imported works of art were to come into effect.</p> <p>
The directive would impose VAT of at least 5 per cent. on art entering the EC, and that could have grave consequences for British and European culture, discouraging the repatriation of art which has already gone abroad and provoking an outflow of the national heritage. We have seen from the Irish experience what such attacks can do to the art market. We continue to urge the Minister to accept the recommendations of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Heritage_Select_Committee">National Heritage Select Committee</a> and adopt a vigorous stand against those potentially damaging proposals. Will he set out the Government's position on that issue?</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> and I have exchanged correspondence about the bloodstock industry. The advent of the single market and the lower rates of VAT applied in other member states have presented a dire threat to that industry because of the obvious attractions for buyers and sellers to trade in markets where the lower rate of VAT is charged.</p> <p>
So serious is that situation that Tattersalls, in response to its clients' preferences, have moved their yearling sales to Fairyhouse in Ireland for next September and in a news release announcing this sad fact it said:</p> <p><q>This decision has been brought about by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Government">United Kingdom Government</a> steadfastly refusing to give the industry the competitive low rate available under EC law. Separately, they are considering the possibility of extending VAT registration to racehorse owners</q>
I will come back to that in a minute. I am aware that there are ongoing discussions between representatives of the industry and of the Government on this and of the fact

that some schemes attempting to ameliorate the situation have been put forward, namely, proposals on distance selling, on dispatch and acquisition and the flat rate farming scheme which we shall be debating again next week.</p> <p>
However, there have been problems about this between the Government and the industry. In that same news release, Tattersalls said:
<q>in the last few days</q>
this was dated 24 November&#8212;
<q>an unexpected change has emerged from discussions with <a href="/glossary/?gl=74" title="http://www.hmce.gov.uk/" class="glossary">Customs and Excise</a>. Previously we had been assured by Her Majesty's Government that all horses coming to Newmarket from Ireland and France and being sold by United Kingdom Flat Rate Farmers would be sold free of all United Kingdom VAT,</q>
&#8212;as stated in its previous press release of 21 September.</p> <p><q>Customs have now changed their previous interpretation so that all Yearlings, previously purchased with Irish or French VAT charged in either of these two countries, would have to be sold by Flat Rate Farmers with VAT in Newmarket or VAT would have to be charged on entry into the United Kingdom.</q>
So I ask the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paymaster_General">Paymaster General</a>, as those most closely involved in this remain very concerned about the situation and the implications for the industry, what the Government will do about this. It is an industry in which Britain is a world leader and many jobs depend on it. It is imperative that it is not damaged further. I ask the Paymaster General to assure the House that the Government will give urgent and sympathetic reconsideration to those matters. I think he should look again at the proposal to allow racehorse owners and traders to register, as they can do in nine of the 12 member states. That is one of the key steps which have been suggested by people in the industry as being of most assistance in resolving the crisis.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I did not make that suggestion, but I ask the Government sympathetically and urgently to reconsider the whole situation. It is not the only suggestion put forward to remedy the situation. I understand from Tattersalls that allowing breeders and owners to register for VAT would equally well meet the concern and prevent a valuable industry from being threatened and destroyed in the way that this industry otherwise looks likely to be destroyed.</p> <p>
Another specific area on which I would like the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paymaster_General">Paymaster General</a> to elaborate is the ending of restrictions on the importing of goods for personal consumption and the consequent changes in Customs procedures. He gave me an estimate in a written parliamentary reply that the prospective revenue loss due to this is likely to be &#163;250 million a year. Does that estimate still hold good in the light of the experience they have had so far of the new regime? Has he also been able to evaluate the likely extent of smuggling and other dealing in contraband as a result of the changes and what measures have the Government put in place to combat them? Is he satisfied that the Excise have the officers that they need properly to combat smuggling? Everyone in the House will be particularly concerned about the position with drugs and weapons. It is imperative that the staff are in place to do that job. There have been cuts in staff and


redeployment and the larger estimates made at one time of the numbers of officers which were likely to be needed to be appointed have not been met and there is concern among the employees of <a href="/glossary/?gl=74" title="http://www.hmce.gov.uk/" class="glossary">Customs and Excise</a> about how far they are being given the resources to do the job.</p> <p>
It is important that the Government respond to that anxiety which is shared by most of the public. Has the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> been able to evaluate the likely extent of smuggling as a result of the changes, what measures the Government have put in place to combat that risk and whether they are contemplating further measures?</p> <p>
The fourth area in which the House needs some assurances is the new Community VAT regime. There will be no intra-Community trades statistics for the first six months of operation of the new system of VAT payments and trade statistics. I can well understand, given the Government's abysmal record on trade, why it might suit them never to have trade statistics again but, given the obligation to publish them and their importance, I hope the Paymaster General can assure me that the system will at least be running adequately to provide statistics after the six months hiatus. Will the figures which are then provided be properly comparable with those previously gathered on the old basis?</p> <p>
I can see the hon. Member for Southend, East (Sir. T. Taylor) shaking his head but, given the way that other important Government statistics, for example on unemployment, have been manipulated, it would not surprise me at all if we found as a consequence of this that valid statistical comparisons were made more difficult rather than being facilitated. I hope the Paymaster General will say that those fears are not properly grounded. Can he tell us whether the figures for the first half of the year will be made available and on what basis will the estimates be made?</p>            </div>

in which we could engage at some point; but I wish to ask the hon. Gentleman a question that is limited to the specific confines of the Committee stage of this Bill.</p> <p>
Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the only change involved in article 99 of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_European_Act">Single European Act</a> is the introduction of further consultation with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_and_Social_Committee">European Economic and Social Committee</a>? In supporting the Act, did not the House effectively agree to the objective of harmonising taxation? The implementation of that objective is extremely interesting; but the commitment was made under the Single European Act, which had the support of the House&#8212;including the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash).</p>            </div>

Members to have a full opportunity to question the implications of article 99&#8212;even hon. Members who voted for a very similar measure in the past. Implications tend to become apparent as systems develop, and as people analyse the legal ramifications.

I had some responsibility for the sixth directive: I was in the chair at the time. When we agreed the provision on harmonisation, no time limit was in operation. In the case of article 99, there is a time limit. That makes a world of difference: it is easy to talk about harmonisation in the distant future, but time limits force us to confront the realities rather more urgently.</p>            </div>

I see that certain former Treasury Ministers on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Benches agree with my position. Nothing that I say should be taken as any hint at decisions which, in any event, have not yet been made.

The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> may make some observations about them, but until they are advocated it would be difficult to do more than that. In Standing Committees it is unusual for a Minister not to reply, particularly where there is a group of amendments. I hope, Mr. Morris, that you will bear that in mind. Can the overall debate be properly concluded unless there has been such specific debate?</p>            </div>

Then hon. Members may seek to catch the Chairman's eye. Indeed, I have been noting the names of hon. Members who have risen, and I hope to be able to call them. It is normal for any new elements that are raised to be dealt with by the Minister if he feels that that is the

proper course. This should not have to be put on the record time after time as amendments are dealt with. That simply takes up the time of the Committee fairly uselessly.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>As long as the hon. Gentleman appreciates the limited nature of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> that he has moved. We do, however, consult widely on proposed tax changes in this country. Treasury Ministers are frequently asked in Finance <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> to consult more rather than less, so to be asked to consult less is a slightly novel experience.</p> <p>
Amendments Nos. 422 and 423 are also puzzling in their intentions, if one reads them carefully and tries to apply them. Amendment No. 422 implies that deleting article 99&#8212;something which is not proposed by the treaty, the Bill or any of the amendments, so no one is supporting it&#8212;might somehow lead to an end to the derogations that permit the United Kingdom to have its various zero rates. But it is the sixth directive and its children which embody the agreement to the continuation of our zero rates. If, which no hon. Member on either side of the House is suggesting, we deleted article 99 and did not replace it, it might be said that there would then be no vires for the sixth directive, and that would include both the agreement for us to continue our zero rates and, for that matter, the part of the agreement under which otherwise we could not have the zero rates.</p> <p>
Amendment No. 422, therefore, would not in any way safeguard our zero rates, and the hon. Member for


Oxford, East was quite correct, if I understood him aright, in what he said about the effect of his hon. Friend's amendments.</p> <p>
Amendment No. 423 uses a different approach. It proposes that we should not have the authority to make any further agreements for excise or other internal taxes. That would be a mistake. After all, there may well be moves for further or other simplification of value added tax, for example, or other changes proposed for the protection of the United Kingdom revenue which might become necessary, and we might think it desirable to propose such changes to our colleagues in the Community for Community law or to the House, or to both. It is likely that in the future hon. Members on both sides will wish us to press for items of simplification and other changes which might be made but which would be prevented if amendment No. 423 were carried. It would freeze the indirect tax system from the moment that the treaty came into force.</p> <p>
I could not recommend such a course to the Committee and it may be that no hon. Member will, on reflection, want to pass any of these four amendments on their own merits.</p>            </div>

It was difficult to draft amendment No. 422, but the intention is other than as he interpreted it. The intention is that article 99 remain, but, in so far as future use of it may, as stated in the amendment, end current derogations, it should not have that effect. As the right hon. Gentleman will know, under the sixth directive it would be possible after 1996 &#8212;admittedly, it may be a matter of unanimity&#8212;for those existing derogations to disappear. We are suggesting in the amendment that that power be not available under article 99. I hope that the intention is clear, even if the drafting is defective.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>The hon. Gentleman has been kind enough to make the intention clear. He is right in saying, of course, that it would require unanimity. That is something which we have stuck to rigidly; indeed, we have not had to hold out for it, as all the member states are satisfied that unanimity is the right way to settle these tax matters, although sometimes it is quite a laborious process to arrive at proposals that are satisfactory to all. The difficulty of arriving at unanimity has been evident in connection with the various directives regarding VAT, some of which were passed later than we would have wished, in the interest of making good preparations.</p> <p>
I was asked to comment on the progress that was being made on this in other member states. The hon. Member for Oxford, East drew particularly on one press cutting in asking his questions. I am glad to be able to say that, if he refers to some other press reports, which are substantially confirmed by the information which the United Kingdom Customs is receiving, he will see that there have been relatively few problems at the borders. According to the <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times">Financial Times</a></i> of 22 January, for example,</p> <p><q>the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Market">Internal Market</a> has got off to a good start.</q>

As far as we can see, the frontier Customs staff in all the other member states have, in the main, turned out to be well prepared. There have been some exceptions. Some late decisions were taken, on about 29 December, in Spain and Portugal about certain agricultural and transitional Customs duty arrangements, which led to some early confusion, and there were also some commercial movements of excise goods about which there were misunderstandings in several member states regarding requirements for special accompanying documents, leading to delays in some circumstances.</p> <p>
There have also been some very encouraging reports about terrific improvements in delivery times, for example, for British exporters as a result of the elimination of routine Customs controls at the frontiers. One company reported a reduction of 17 hours in the journey to Spain as a result of the absence of Customs formalities at the United Kingdom end or at the various countries in between and the Spanish border itself. That highlights one of the important advantages of the single market for United Kingdom business.</p> <p>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned particularly in this context difficulties in issuing VAT registration numbers and asked what progress had been made. My advice is that only Germany has still to complete issuing VAT registration numbers. It may surprise hon. Members that Germany might be a laggard in a bureaucratic matter of this kind, but apparently it has had to change its system to take account of the new arrangements. I am sure that Germany will complete the process by the end of this month. The feedback from various consultative bodies, such as the VAT Practitioners Group, or the London part of it, and the Joint Customs Consultative Committee is that things are going well. There are a few teething problems, but they are being sorted out by working groups in Brussels.</p> <p>
At this week's meeting, Spain agreed to complete the necessary simplification provisions as a matter of urgency and is no longer requiring middle men in the triangular transactions to register for value added tax, one of the points to which the hon. Member for Oxford, East referred. All in all, it means a major reduction in the bureaucractic burdens on business. An independent consultant drew up an important report for us, which stated that the reduction in bureaucracy from the new system would be worth &#163;135 million a year to British business.</p>            </div>

I shall consult my colleagues at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</a> who are especially expert and I shall write to him.</p> <p>
The speech of the hon. Member for Oxford, East ranged much more widely than the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>. He spoke in general about the harmonisation of taxation and said, among other things, that the Labour party was not wedded to unity on taxation rates across the Community. Nor are the Government.</p> <p>
It is perhaps necessary to make a musical analogy when discussing this issue. People sometimes confuse harmony with unison. When musical instruments or singers play or sing in unison they use the same notes. Harmony involves different notes that blend with each other to create a pleasing overall sound. It is the notion of different notes leading to harmony that we seek in the tax system, rather than the unison or unity which is sometimes mistakenly mentioned in these discussions. Tax harmonisation does not mean that every member state has to have exactly the same tax system or rate. The differing systems should be able to work together, and that is what we have been thinking all along.</p> <p>
The hon. Gentleman drew attention to the next possible stage, the move to the origin system. The next step will be proposals from the Commission. I can see that there are some advantages in the origin system&#8212;the hon. Gentleman quoted the Simplified Trade Procedures Board in that context&#8212;but it is much too early to express a view, as the Commission has not produced its proposals. In fact, I believe that they are only in their early stages, if they exist at all. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commission">The Commission</a> is not due to produce any proposals until the end of 1994, so there is no question of our discussing them. However, I understand the hon. Gentleman's point.</p> <p>
In talking about the future, the hon. Gentleman mentioned the 15 per cent. minimum rate of VAT. I can assure him that in the absence of further agreement between the member states, the agreement lapses at the end of four years.</p>            </div>

Recently most attention has been paid to the amount of duty paid, but I shall return to the subject of cross-border shopping in a moment.</p> <p>
I was about to mention racehorses, which are not, I admit, immediately relevant to the amendments&#8212;or, indeed, anything to do with them. The hon. Member for Oxford, East was correct to say that the horse racing authorities have told us of their proposals, which I hope will enable more owners to register for VAT under the present rules. <a href="/glossary/?gl=74" title="http://www.hmce.gov.uk/" class="glossary">Customs and Excise</a> are preparing a technical paper on those matters, and I am keeping in close touch with all the relevant interests.</p> <p>
I promised to return to cross-border shopping and other such matters. The hon. Member for Oxford, East asked me if I could revise the estimate of &#163;250 million given in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Book">Red Book</a> for the previous Budget as the likely loss of revenue resulting from cross-border shopping. It is difficult to make an accurate estimate, and we have no reason to revise the original estimate at the moment. We do not have sufficient information about the amount of cross-border shopping and its effects on revenue to carry out such a revision.</p>            </div>

Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagan_Valley">Lagan Valley</a> (Mr. Molyneaux) seems to have left the Chamber for the moment, but he will know that in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> the land border provides a lot of scope, especially for shoppers from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republic">Irish Republic</a>, with its separate tax rates, to say nothing of the present exchange rates.</p> <p>
There have been various reports recently, notably the BBC "Food and Drink Programme" the night before last, which pointed out, I am told, that many of the more expensive wines are cheaper here than in France. So even with wine, cross-border shopping does not take place in only one direction. Apart from the legitimate transfer across borders for personal consumption of goods on which duty has been paid in other Community countries, there is also smuggling. As the hon. Member for Oxford, East said, goods on which overseas tax has been paid are brought across borders for resale in this country.</p> <p>
We have set up some flexible anti-smuggling teams and appointed some Customs officers who are devoted to the task of chasing up breaches of the law in this respect. I am glad to say that they have already had some success. Nearly every day they have managed to charge someone with this offence. I can give the Committee an absolute assurance that anyone who we have reason to suppose has brought goods across for sale will be hounded, and prosecuted when that is appropriate, to ensure that those who smuggle goods across and resell them feel the full strength of the law. They must be left in no doubt that this activity is illegal.</p> <p>
9.30 pm</p> <p>
The Customs have been enjoying a certain amount of co-operation from legitimate traders who realise the dangers. I welcome that; I encourage legitimate traders and members of the public who have information about offences of this kind to contact Customs and give them every assistance in this important aspect of their work.</p> <p>
I have covered most of the items mentioned by the hon. Member for Oxford, East, although a great many of them were well outside the terms of the amendments&#8212;which in any case should not commend themselves to anyone in the Committee.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I was rather struck by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paymaster_General">Paymaster General</a>'s musical analogy&#8212;of harmony rather than unison. I am sure that the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing), who was struck by it too, would agree that we regret the decline in our nonconformist chapels of the practice of singing in four-part harmony and its replacement by the practice of singing in unison, which reduces the force and quality of the singing. When I thought about it, however, the analogy seemed slightly far fetched. Different factors are at stake in taxation.</p> <p>
My enthusiasm for the analogy was much greater than my enthusiasm for <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> No. 9. My lack of enthusiasm for that amendment was even more profound than that of the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith), who damned it with very faint praise. It would remove from the legislation what we already understand to be the law and practice in our relations with the Community in tax harmonisation matters, and it would not impose on us new and unjustified requirements of harmonisation.</p> <p>
I say that as one who shares the scepticism expressed around the Chamber tonight about undue tax harmonisation. The crucial phrases that will appear in the Act and which appeared in the treaty of Rome and our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_European_Act">Single European Act</a> commitments relate to harmonisation
<q>to the extent that such harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and functioning of the internal market".</q>
That, and that alone, is justification for harmonisation. There is a powerful case for harmonising taxes if differing tax rates can be used to favour the goods of the home country as against those of the country in the Community seeking to export to that country. That is what it is for and, in the case of excise duties, it can be significant.</p> <p>
This is a difficult area to resolve&#8212;there are health and social policies at stake&#8212;but it is significant if a product made in the home country is taxed much more favourably than a potential substitute product imported from another country. All the arguments about wine, beer and cider come down to this in the end: how to avoid one country favouring its products at the expense of the products of other countries in a supposedly single market.</p> <p>
That consideration, however, does not bear on the sale of similar goods in any one country. If lawn mowers are taxed at the same rate at the point of sale, it does not make much difference if they are charged at another rate in another country&#8212;except to the extent that that promotes cross-border shopping. Up to a point, cross-border shopping is not all that deplorable. At least to some extent it encourages people to move around the Community and has brought many of our citizens to the realisation that, far from these islands being the sole civilised parts of the

world, there are many good things going on in other parts of Europe. People have become more enthusiastic about going there and enjoying them.</p> <p>
At some point, cross-border shopping becomes such a threat to the trade and industry of some countries that they are led, for normal market reasons, to seek to harmonise tax rates. That is the natural way in which tax harmonisation will be achieved, and it will occur if individual member countries think that it is not in their interests to maintain the disparity. To that extent, our ability simply to please ourselves about our tax rates is reduced by the amount of trade. However, we want trade and a single market will enable people to pursue it.</p>            </div>

There are instances&#8212;I have quoted some from excise duties and there are also some in the VAT field&#8212;of countries preserving a differential to protect a home-produced product against competition from a similar, imported product. It would usually have to be because the products are slightly different but still capable of being substituted one for the other and serving the same purpose &#8212;perhaps of inducing a state of alcoholic cheerfulness or whatever. The denial of equal treatment for the imported product is normally what is at stake.</p> <p>
There have been profound differences of view between this country and the Commission about what is necessary for the achievement of the single market. The differences were widest when <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Cockfield">Lord Cockfield</a> was at the Commission. When Madam Scrivener took over, a significantly more amenable attitude was apparent. The noble <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Lawson_of_Blaby">Lord Lawson of Blaby</a> described the replacement of Lord Cockfield by Madam Scrivener as the replacement of an English dogmatist by a French pragmatist. That was the case. I found Lord Cockfield's attitude on this issue extremely dogmatic and, although it was elegantly expresssed, it was a quite unnecessary promotion of harmonisation. It is a pity that such a good servant of the European cause felt that he had to go so far over the top on this issue. I welcomed the subsequent changes of policy because they represented a much more realistic approach to tax harmonisation.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I reiterate that if all similar products sold in a country are taxed at the same level there is no compelling need for harmonisation whether from the top or from the bottom. I can buy a newspaper or a book in this country free of VAT. I can choose either <i><a href="/glossary/?gl=49" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/" class="glossary">The Times</a></i> or <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Figaro">Le Figaro</a></i> and my purchase is not influenced by different tax rates. There is no need for the Government to slap VAT on books or newspapers for there to be a free market in those goods. It is only when the lack of harmonisation distorts the marketplace in favour of the product of one country over another or if the amount of cross-border shopping is


great that a problem arises. In the first case, because the Government are normally trying to favour their own producers, it may be necessary for the Community to take action to secure harmonisation. In the case of cross-border shopping, it is much more likely that normal market considerations will lead the country concerned to say, "We are putting ourselves at a disadvantage and will have to modify our tax regime even if we might not otherwise have chosen to do so."</p> <p>
Those are the natural ways to proceed, and the article that we are discussing in no way impedes that process. I see no reason to change it, not least because it is already our law on the basis of our previous treaty commitments. It is quite unnecessary to amend the treaty in this way.</p>            </div>

The first is that made by the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)&#8212;that there is no need to vote on the amendment because it was tabled merely as a means to provide a good debate. That point was sharpened by the hon.

That is the Labour party's position, which is very much supported by the Government, because it suits them just to have little debates that proceed along regular lines and move the Committee stage on&#8212;but not too fast.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I accept that, Mr. Morris. I only made that point as it was part of the reason given for voting against the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> made the point that they did not want a vote on the amendment&#8212;they just wanted a debate. I was making a passing remark that that view was supported by the Government, because it is in their interests to keep the debate moving a little, but not to vote on amendments.</p> <p>
The second reason for voting against the amendment is that suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor), who has been here for many of the debates. He said that it had all happened, everything had been done and article 99 was already in the treaty. A few commas may have been changed, but I accept that it is basically the same article that was in the main treaty. My hon. Friend felt that, because it was already in the treaty, there was no point in voting against the amendment. Confirmation of that view, if any were needed, is the agreement reached by Ministers on 27 July to harmonise VAT.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Opposition">The Opposition</a> have posed some interesting questions, and people are beginning to take note of some of the effects of this aspect of the treaty. The Opposition's questions to my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, as far as they went, were good. The general point was made that one learns by

one's mistakes. However, it is not a good or conclusive argument to say that, just because something exists, we should not at least consider whether it needs amending.</p> <p>
One thing that a treaty amending the mainstream treaty of Rome does is to give us the opportunity to amend the mainstream treaty if we do not like its provisions. There are at least one or two good reasons for seriously considering whether there should be an article in the treaty that provides for the harmonisation of indirect taxation, for whatever reason.</p> <p>
The market reason is not an especially good one. The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) answered his own point. If there is an internal market and there are distortions in, for example, indirect taxation, there is at least an arguable case for saying that they will right themselves. Otherwise people will find themselves at an unfair advantage or a disadvantage and will set their own taxes in some kind of harmony&#8212;to use the phrase that has emerged during this debate.</p>            </div>

Friend accept that the present harmony of the natural harmonisation would mean the loss of &#163;3,000 million on excise duties, which would have to be made up somewhere else, either through VAT or income tax? That is not a happy thing. A harmonisation of tax on alcohol and cigarettes on some base level would mean that the poor old <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> would lose &#163;3,000 million, which he would have to find from somewhere else, and that somewhere else may be quite nasty.

In considering whether article 99 is good or bad, one should consider whether it is good or bad for a nation state and a Parliament, sovereign still, responsible to its people, to give away a large chunk of its right to determine the balance of indirect to direct taxation.

Anyone who is genuinely looking at Europe's trading future must take into account the concept of comparative advantage. That is what trade is all about. Different countries have sun and water&#8212;and different countries have different Government policies.</p>            </div>

As to even playing fields, a part of comparative advantage is the advantage that some countries have in the way that they are governed and the economic policies that flow from that. One snag in being an Italian citizen is that one does not pay direct taxes.</p>            </div>

Friend says that that is rubbish, but he must accept that Italy's black economy is larger and more thriving than that of many other countries. As people do not pay direct taxes in Italy, it has indirect taxes. If one is a direct taxpayer, that is an advantage&#8212;but it is a disadvantage if one is an indirect taxpayer.</p> <p>
Why should the British, who are rather good at paying their direct taxes, suffer just because the Italians do not pay their taxes? Why must everything be evened out across an even playing field? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith">Adam Smith</a>'s concept of trade was all about comparative advantage. It seems that we are talking about a trading bloc, and comparative advantage is important in that. If the argument is based entirely on even playing fields, as it so often is, it is in many respects specious.</p>            </div>

Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Dykes). I do not think I am, but the Chair may rule differently.</p> <p>
My hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor) makes an important and exacting point. My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East is robust in his views. He is a great personal friend of mine, and one of the people who is honest about his intentions; he is a genuine federalist. Although I cannot really debate the matter with my hon. Friend because of his beliefs, there are others who believe that the Maastricht treaty is innocuous and is not leading in the direction that my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East wants.</p>            </div>

The problem about article 99 and the concept of harmonisation and the interventionist policies that would necessarily go with it is that it has to be seen in the wider context of moves towards central taxation as a matter of principle.</p> <p>
Because I have developed the point in previous debates, will simply reiterate that, with a single currency, because of the need to compensate for the problems that arise between different countries with different wage levels but with similar price structures as a result of that single currency, there must ultimately be single taxation and a single expenditure authority.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>My right hon. Friend is, of course, absolutely right, and if what he has indicated were achieved, it would be helpful from my point of view. I concede that this is part of the existing treaty. The problem is that it is the thin edge of the wedge. The problem concerns the context of the Maastricht treaty. Someone said earlier in the debate that this was all in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_European_Act">Single European Act</a>. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_99">Article 99</a> is not a bad example of the kind of text that might help us if we were to look at it in isolation. The words of the existing treaty are in some cases identical to those of the proposed treaty. But the words have to be looked at in context if the differences in their significance as between treaties are to become apparent.</p> <p>
In this case the context is the concept of a single currency. That is the core of the Maastricht treaty. We have been told that the pillars are there, that we are taking an important step forward in claiming back national sovereignty. But looking at things on an intergovernmental basis is not a great new backward step, as is obvious if one considers the context of the treaty and its new objectives. This was pointed out very well by my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford (Mr. Duncan-Smith).

The new objectives of the Maastricht treaty must be related in the way that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice">European Court of Justice</a> will undoubtedly relate them. Under Roman law&#8212;alien law &#8212;which is what we are going to have, it is the context of words, rather than the pure text, that has to be considered.</p> <p>
This is a learning process, but, in the past, British negotiators made the mistake of looking simply at the text of the main treaty and not considering the context. That was a very serious mistake. In some respects, the new law will supersede our domestic law. The context and objectives will be taken fully into account in a way that does not apply in British law. This is one of the fundamental problems that we face as we approach the treaty. The entire treaty, its context and objectives have to be taken into account. In this case we must consider the question of harmonisation in the context of a single currency, which, in my view, will lead to a single taxation system.</p>            </div>

I would disagree with most of the things that are said by <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members about taxation. I am sure that they would be in favour of greater direct taxation, whereas, on the whole, most Conservative Members would favour greater indirect taxation in some form, although the points made against VAT are good ones. What I suspect is common to hon. Members on both sides who are worried about the treaty is that we believe that the House and our Government should determine these priorities. That is what lies at the root of my concern about the treaty when it is seen in its full context&#8212;and this particular article about harmonisation must be seen in a wider context.</p> <p>
We are moving towards a centralised form of federal taxation. If the single currency is to mean anything, it must


mean a single price system, accompanied, because the economies will not have converged&#8212;we will certainly not find the Greek economy converging with the German economy in time for any of these things to happen&#8212;by unequal wages. There will be, because it is structured into this treaty&#8212;this article is part of the process of centralisation&#8212;an automatic move towards a central taxation and expenditure system. It is my fundamental concern about the treaty. The instruments associated with it are undemocratic. The central instrument associated with it is to be the central bank&#8212;</p>            </div>

He is talking about the resources of the Community. This question was dealt with effectively at the Edinburgh summit and the new budget arrangements now last through almost to the end of this century. That rebuts the point about centralised taxation; it is off the point of this amendment, which is entirely to do with what we have already confirmed in the House in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_European_Act">Single European Act</a>, with the exception that now we are also to discuss with the economic and social council.</p>            </div>

His argument&#8212;which he has just repeated&#8212;it is that we should reject this <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> because it is already in the treaty. I am glad to be able to tell him that I do not accept that point. Just because it is in the existing treaty, that is

no reason for not taking the advice of <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members and others who have made the point during the debate that one should learn by experience and by one's mistakes. Part of the argument for accepting this amendment is precisely that we have been able to learn by our mistakes. You would call me to order for repetition, Mr. Lofthouse, if I went over the arguments with which I supported that point, but my hon. Friend will be able to look at the record tomorrow and see how I developed my argument.</p>            </div>

There have been references to purchase tax. I would argue that it would be better to have a range of purchase tax rates than to have VAT. That is why I voted against VAT. That is why every Labour Member in the House at that time voted against it. So, in this new regime, assuming that we smash the Maastricht treaty, which is what we are here to do today&#8212;it may be that the Chair and others are not in that game, but we are&#8212;</p>            </div>

One of the reasons why the media will be turned on to what he has just said and why everybody will be writing about it tomorrow morning is that what he says in the Chamber matters still. The fact that he believes in purchase tax matters. Through the Executive, our Parliament still largely determines what form of taxation we have. The hon. Member for Bolsover is right to say that article 99 is a part of the process of losing control of our taxation system. Control of that system is a central aspect of a nation's sovereignty. I shall not stray too far, because I see that you are looking restless, Mr. Lofthouse, but in years gone by and on both sides of the Atlantic, taxation was considered to be the principal element of sovereignty to be fought for.</p>            </div>

Friend will agree that in Europe there is already tremendous pressure for the harmonisation of VAT and for us to abolish our zero rate by including items that are currently zero-rated among those covered by this country's standard rate. As an example, the inclusion of domestic heating oil would mean a huge additional impost on thousands of families in this country. It would inevitably increase wage demands and inflation. There is a great difference between various countries&#8212;the need for heating oil in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal is very much less than in north European countries. Such an impost, because of the culture of this country, would be intolerable.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>It could be extremely damaging. My hon. Friend makes by implication the point that I should have made earlier.</p> <p>
In drawing my remarks to a conclusion, I shall address one of the arguments against my proposal. If the measure is seen within the broad context of the whole treaty, especially those parts of it that lead towards a single currency and, thus, in my view, towards a single taxation system, one of the arguments would be that we have opted out of the arrangments that might push us towards a central taxation system.</p> <p>
At least one of my hon. Friends has accused me of having rather sharp views on the British opt-out. I have


said that I do not really believe in it, because I cannot see how in practice one can set up all those institutions, get all that harmonisation going, and then opt out of it. I hope that I did not give the Committee the wrong impression. I cannot foresee any circumstances in which I would argue against maintaining the opt-out&#8212;but the force and weight of all the measures would be compounded one upon another. We are talking about a cumulative process, about adding extra centralisation. I know that my hon. Friends argue against that, but I suspect that we should be ruled out of order if we did so now. Yet the argument whether we are compounding the process of centralisation is crucial. I should dearly like you to allow us to argue it through a little now, Mr. Lofthouse, because the argument is certainly relevant to the subject of harmonisation.</p> <p>
I believe that all this is a process of centralisation. That process is apparently inexorable. If we take the terrible decision to ratify this treaty and then come later to debate an opt-out from it, we will face an enormous weight of argument along the lines that we face now&#8212;article 99 was all arranged in the past; it cannot be changed now. People will say, "Where were you, Spicer?", to which I will reply, "I was here, debating the matter." Nevertheless the force of future arguments will be that that the institutions have already been set up and the dispute is over.</p> <p>
This is why we need to debate these matters now. We should at least be able to argue them through. That is why I agree with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>. We need to revise the treaty so as to accommodate the lessons that we have learnt from passing previous legislation&#8212;</p>            </div>

Friend is developing an argument that should be deployed before a much wider audience than the one we have here tonight. The motivating force behind the European Community is the desire to widen the direct tax base. We have already come under pressure from Europe to do that. Heating oil is currently exempted and zero-rated. Food is another case in point. Most of it is zero-rated in this country. If we succumbed, as I believe that we inevitably would if the treaty were ratified, to putting VAT on food, the public revolt over the community charge would seem like a Sunday afternoon tea party by comparison. It would affect all our culture, customs and traditions, and it would disadvantage our economy. Any Government who were found guilty of imposing it would be kicked out of office at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>            </div>
