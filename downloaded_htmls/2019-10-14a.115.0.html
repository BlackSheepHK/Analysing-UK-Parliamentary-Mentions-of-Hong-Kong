First, however, I stand here this afternoon to right an historic and terrible injustice: no Member from my great county of Derbyshire has moved the Loyal Address for over 100 years. The delay has been long. It last happened in 1903, when it was moved by Colonel Gretton, representing the constituency so ably now served by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24769" title="Our page on Heather Wheeler - 'the Member for South Derbyshire (Mrs Wheeler)'">Mrs Wheeler</a>.</p> <p pid="a7.3/6">I took to reading that speech to get some inspiration for the rather terrifying job I now have. I am afraid to report that it only increased my nervousness at the task ahead. I discovered that before the good colonel even uttered a single syllable, Hansard noted, with that courteous understatement that Hansard is famous for, that he was heard &#8220;with much difficulty&#8221;. What that is an Edwardian euphemism for is lost to time. I will seek to avoid the challenge that faced my county forebear by speaking both loudly and, at least at the start, by avoiding Brexit.</p> <p pid="a7.3/7">Secondly, another worry arose, if not for me, for the right hon. Gentleman the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a>. The subject to which Colonel Gretton turned first was not education, health, welfare or taxes, or even his constituency, but a subject that is returned to time and again in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>: Venezuela. [Laughter.] The colonel was keen to explain that the recent policy successes in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America">South America</a> had been achieved without the destruction of personal property. I wonder if our Venezuelan friends will have the same pre-eminence in 2019 that they did in 1903.</p> <p pid="a7.3/8">Finally, I was struck by the response of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Balfour">Mr Balfour</a>. His initial remarks were not focused on great matters of state. Instead he was keen not to impede the impending dinner hour of the Members present. I hope not to do so today by applying some Derbyshire common sense and knowing when to sit down.</p> <p pid="a7.3/9">I am relatively new to this place, having only been here since the 2017 <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a>. Having just turned 39, I hope that I tend&#8212;just&#8212;towards the more youthful  end of the parliamentary age range. That is true not least&#8212;if he will forgive me&#8212;when I compare myself with my parliamentary neighbour, <a href="/mp/?p=10544" title="Our page on Dennis Skinner - 'the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr Skinner)'">Mr Skinner</a>, who was in customary fine form this morning and who has been providing quips to this House since a decade before I was born. [Laughter.]</p> <p pid="a7.3/10">Having witnessed only one Queen&#8217;s speech, I searched for advice about how to do this, and I discovered that the definition was laid out by my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=11115" title="Our page on Andrew Mitchell - 'the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell)'">Mr Mitchell</a> in a speech in the 1990s. My joy quickly turned to horror when, having read his remarks, I found I had been given a privilege by the Treasury Bench usually accorded to</p> <p class="indent" pid="a7.3/11" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;some genial old codger on the way out&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2019-05-06">6 May</phrase> 1992; Vol. 207, c. 56.]</p> <p pid="a7.3/12">I know that Brexit has aged us all in the last three years, but I did not realise that my right hon. Friends in the Government thought it had affected my youth so badly, nor how keen they were to get rid of me.</p> <p pid="a7.3/13">We meet today in troubled times, at the end of the longest parliamentary Session since the civil war. It is a time that more experienced Members tell us newer recruits is just not normal. Our precious body politic lies bloodied, poisoned by rancour and enmity, and, until the hope of the last few days, paralysed by competing legitimacies. Our politics is fought over, sometimes viciously, by us here in a way that I have never known in my lifetime. I say that as a working-class kid who grew up in the north during the miners&#8217; strike, who is the nephew of someone who worked for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Union_of_Mineworkers">National Union of Mineworkers</a>, and whose grandparents toiled under some of the villages I now have the privilege to represent. So I have some knowledge of challenge and tumult.</p> <p pid="a7.3/14">We are in a hard place, and all of us, whatever Bench or Chair we sit on, are responsible for where we end up. In the last few days, there has at least been hope that this toxic and crippling fog we have created might just be lifting, as the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> sketches an outline of a way forward. I speak as someone who has been robust in my review of previous proposals, but the House must surely see, as I do, that we have debated long enough, this is a moment for decision and we were elected to make decisions. If there is light at the end of the tunnel later this week&#8212;heaven knows, I hope there will be&#8212;we have a fundamental responsibility in this place to try to resolve this most vexed of problems, and allow our despairing and embittered country to move on. For the health of our democracy and to restore faith in this most venerable of institutions, we simply must get Brexit done.</p> <p pid="a7.3/15">I hope that, deep down, this place realises it is time to get back to the other priorities of our country&#8212;if it does not, this shattered Parliament will be given even shorter shrift than the residents of North East Derbyshire have already given it. They speak plainly and honestly in my 41 towns, villages and hamlets. They are good, honest, industrious men and women who are the quiet backbone of our great country. In Dronfield and Killamarsh, they seek only to get up every morning, get a fair crack of the whip and be able to get on. In Eckington and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Cross">Clay Cross</a>, they seek betterment in life for their families and their children, recognising that communities are built from the ground up, not imposed from the top down, and understanding that Governments should do some things well, not lots of things badly.   They want Governments who prioritise technological advancement and innovation in healthcare, to allow people to get better quickly and to live longer; they want people who stand shoulder to shoulder with our brave officers on the frontline, through a police covenant; and they want Governments who make it their mission to deliver fast broadband to all of our nations. That is why there is so much to be welcomed in this Queen&#8217;s Speech and why we must move beyond Brexit.</p> <p pid="a7.3/16">My constituency sits around the towering presence of a church that has been there since the 12th century and can be seen for miles around. It is famous for a spire that twists and bends unconventionally into the sky. I am the son of that crooked spire and am so very proud to represent some of its domain today. The values of those sons and daughters of north Derbyshire are the same as those of other proud working-class northern and midlands towns across the country. They are the values that propelled me here today: hard work; aspiration; a hand up, not a handout; freedom: liberty; society; real opportunity for ourselves and for our communities; and a desire to be set free to allow our talents to let us achieve what we can, and not to be told how to live our lives.</p> <p pid="a7.3/17">Last Friday, I returned to my old school, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary">St Mary</a>&#8217;s in Chesterfield, to talk about the importance of democracy. It reminded me of the first time I came here some years ago, on a sixth-form trip, when we were welcomed by our <a href="/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a> at the time, the much-respected <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Benn">Tony Benn</a>. I come from a very different political tradition from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Benn">Mr Benn</a>, but he is still held in high esteem in my constituency. In the same year as he kindly showed me and my fellow students around these Benches, he stood somewhere in here and asked five questions of politicians, as he did regularly. They are as pertinent today as they were then:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a7.3/18" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;What power have you got? Where did you get it from? In whose interests do you exercise it? To whom are you accountable? And how can we get rid of you?&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2019-03-22">22 March</phrase> 2001; Vol. 365, c. 510.]</p> <p pid="a7.3/19">I hope we remember that in the days ahead.</p> <p pid="a7.3/20">As we turn the page on one of the most tumultuous parliamentary Sessions of our lives and dare to hope of new beginnings in a new one, I close by turning back to the Prime Minister, Mr Balfour, who responded to the last Derbyshire MP to propose a Loyal Address. Mr Balfour was a remarkable man, who contributed much to our civic and political life in this country. He was reputed once to have said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a7.3/21" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Nothing matters very much, and few things matter at all.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a7.3/22">That may or may not be true, but in this most tempestuous of times, I hope and believe that most of us in this place recognise that the coming days do matter, and that our nation is watching, anxious with hope and belief that we can move on. North East Derbyshire wants to move on and return to the priorities of the people so outlined in this programme of government&#8212;I think the country does too.</p>            </div>

Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25685" title="Our page on Lee Rowley - 'the Member for North East Derbyshire (Lee Rowley)'">Lee Rowley</a>, who made an outstanding speech and demonstrated yet again what a champion he is for his constituents.</p> <p pid="a9.0/2">When I was asked to second the Humble Address, I felt honoured, but I also felt some consternation. Of course, it is always an honour to represent my constituents in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>. Although the House may very much tire of my talking about Cornwall, I will never tire of speaking up for the Duchy and its great people. I imagine there are many people watching this debate at home, and I think they might prefer to be casting their eyes over that dark-haired and handsome <a href="/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a> for the 18th century&#8212;of course, I am referring to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Poldark">Ross Poldark</a>, my fictional predecessor who represented Truro. I have to confess that even when I was in the Whips Office, I was not any use with a scythe. As my ancestors were Cornish tin miners, I think of myself more as a Demelza than a Ross, but we can all occasionally indulge in a bit of wishful thinking. I felt a degree of consternation &#8212;probably along with my hon. Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_Derbyshire">North East Derbyshire</a>&#8212;because I was asked to give a speech that I felt was reserved for those people the Whips had found to have reached the high watermark of their career in this place. I do not know about you, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, but I still very much feel like I am 35 and that the best years are ahead of me.</p> <p pid="a9.0/3">It is nearly 10 years since I first spoke in the Chamber, when I described beautiful Cornwall and highlighted my creative, inventive, enterprising and determined constituents. Those qualities are as evident today as they were then. Thanks to the steps taken by Governments since 2010 and the work done with the many can-do people in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, we are making real progress in improving the quality of people&#8217;s lives. Along with the recently announced increased investment in our public services, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> announced today will mean that we will be able to move further and faster in ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to reach their potential&#8212;from improving education opportunities and access to high-quality health and care services, to better paid and high-quality jobs. The increase in the number of detectives who painstakingly research and gather evidence to solve crime in our streets is most welcome. The funding attached is enough for 20,000 officers&#8212;or one <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleen_Rooney">Coleen Rooney</a>.</p> <p pid="a9.0/4">Most important of all is that we will be leaving our natural environment in a better condition than we found it in. Our excellent local enterprise partnership has rightly identified Cornwall&#8217;s abundance of natural resources, which, when harnessed, will make a massive contribution to the Government&#8217;s clean growth strategy. In my <a href="/glossary/?gl=143" title="Maiden speech is the first formal speech made by an MP in the House of..." class="glossary">maiden speech</a>, I singled out the potential for deep geothermal energy as a significant renewable energy technology. I am delighted to report to the House that we now have the hottest, deepest hole in the UK, and the trials to generate electricity are well under way. It has been a long journey and the determination of all involved in the project clearly illustrates the UK&#8217;s global leadership on tackling climate change. We are now working on floating wind in the Celtic sea, which has even greater potential.</p> <p pid="a9.0/5"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> has decarbonised faster than any major economy, reducing our emissions by 38% since 1990. We know that we need to go further and faster, which is why I am proud that it was a Conservative Government who supported the world leading net zero target and who have today set out measures that will enable us to do that. The landmark environment Bill is a huge step in ensuring that we leave the natural environment in a better state than we found it in. The Bill will enable a  comprehensive framework for legally binding targets, including a target for air quality and the establishment of a new office for environmental protection. Together with the threat to our natural environment, climate change is the most serious challenge that we face today. Our response must be comprehensive, with action taken across the whole economy. I am confident that we can do it. Why? Because there is now widespread concern and support for action, and because we have what it takes to rise to the challenge. It is a real opportunity to grow our economy more sustainably, but also an opportunity to grow our economy more successfully.</p> <p pid="a9.0/6">Like Members across this House, I have meetings every week with a wide range of people who are fully invested in wanting us to succeed in meeting our net zero target. If we are to harness that enthusiasm and expertise, it cannot just be about distant international summits with acronyms that few people understand.</p> <p pid="a9.0/7">When the UK hosts the international UN climate summit in Glasgow next year, it must ensure that every sector of society is involved in the conversation. With an issue as big as climate change, we need everyone&#8217;s collective brainpower to find the right solutions, and we must have everyone on board if we are to implement them. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Brexit">Post Brexit</a>, the country needs to unite around a shared national purpose, and I believe that this is it.</p> <p pid="a9.0/8">By enabling comprehensive action on climate change across the whole of society, with everyone involved and no one left behind, we can start rebuilding a truly United Kingdom&#8212;one of which we can all be proud. But that is the thing, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Speaker">Mr Speaker</a>, to have that unity of purpose, we now have to agree on the one thing on which we have not been able to agree&#8212;the one thing that is holding the nation back&#8212;and that is our future relationship with Europe. It has been tough going, and we have debated the subject thoroughly for years, but it is this week&#8212;this week above all others&#8212;when we must redouble our efforts, compromise and find a consensus on our way forward.</p> <p pid="a9.0/9">I have been thinking about what we could do in this place to create the right atmosphere and the right mood&#8212;one that will promote trust, generate harmony and result in consensus and that unity of purpose. I was thinking about what we do when we are under pressure, when we are anxious, when success seems so far away. What do we do in our personal lives with our families, in good times and bad, and in our communities when we get together&#8212;whether in collective acts of worship or when our beloved football or rugby teams are playing? What we all do on those occasions is sing. We sing because it makes us all feel good. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Malone">Gareth Malone</a> has inspired the nation&#8217;s workplaces and has proved that singing together increases feelings of trust and common purpose between people.

The first is the 70th anniversary of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Act_1949">Parliament Act 1949</a>, which asserted the primacy of this House over the then hereditary <a href="/glossary/?gl=191" title="The house of Lords is the upper chamber of the Houses of Parliament.

It is worth remembering in our deliberations this week the primacy of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> over that and over the Executive. The second is the 50th anniversary of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_Act_1969">Representation of the People Act 1969</a>, which I remember very well because it extended the vote to everyone over the age of 18. As we meet today, we should commit to strengthening our democracy and the vital role of this democratic House in holding the Executive to account.</p> <p pid="a12.1/2">By tradition, at the beginning of each parliamentary Session we commemorate the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_the_House">Members of the House</a> we have lost in the past year. Earlier this year we lost our great friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Flynn">Paul Flynn</a>&#8212;a fiercely independent, passionate, very kind and very principled Member of this House. I remember him reading out in this House the names of those who had died in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan&#8212;two wars to which he was opposed. He briefly served in our <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a>, and I think the whole House was enlivened by his performance. He joked at the first meeting of the shadow Cabinet and when he spoke from the Floor of the House that he was part of a job creation scheme for octogenarians. He was there not only because he was an excellent orator, campaigner and Member of the House, but because he was also an excellent representative of the people of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_West">Newport West</a>, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> that he served so well and so passionately for 32 years.</p> <p pid="a12.1/3">Today&#8217;s proposer and seconder of the Loyal Address share a route to <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>; both were local councillors prior to entering the House. I pay tribute to all those who put themselves forward to represent local communities as councillors, because without them our democracy would be worse off. They work hard and for long hours, and are often not particularly well rewarded or appreciated for the work they do. We should recognise that they are part of our democracy.</p> <p pid="a12.1/4">I was a little surprised to see that <a href="/mp/?p=25685" title="Our page on Lee Rowley - 'the hon. Member for North East Derbyshire (Lee Rowley)'">Lee Rowley</a> had been asked by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> to propose the motion today, because I understand they have not always enjoyed the best of relationships. As we know, the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> has earned a reputation for enjoying life to the fullest. I understand that during his time as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Mayor">London Mayor</a> he became incandescent with anger and rage on learning that the hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_Derbyshire">North East Derbyshire</a>&#8212;at that time, a Westminster councillor&#8212;intended to introduce a nightlife tax. Thankfully, the hon. Gentleman  was able to reassure the now Prime Minister that the nightlife tax would apply only to car parking charges and not to other activities&#8212;although, on reflection, he may have missed a great opportunity of earning a great deal of revenue for the people of Westminster.</p> <p pid="a12.1/5">I suspect it is no coincidence that the hon. Member for North East Derbyshire has shown great independence of thought as a politician, as he grew up in Chesterfield during the 1980s&#8212;a cradle of political dissent. Today, the hon. Gentleman is again in danger of finding himself upbraided by the Prime Minister, this time as a member of the &#8220;nose-ringed&#8230;unco-operative crusties&#8221;. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman took his arguments against fracking into the lion&#8217;s den of the 2018 <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> party conference, and predicted that his party&#8217;s support for fracking would see it lose seats&#8212;in North East Derbyshire, I assume. My late, great friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Benn">Tony Benn</a>, who was the Member for Chesterfield, gave one of his last diaries the title, &#8220;Dare to be a Daniel&#8221;. I hope that the hon. Member for North East Derbyshire continues to dare, and that he will also emulate the daredom, the experience and the wit of his constituency neighbour and my great friend, my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10544" title="Our page on Dennis Skinner - 'the Member for Bolsover (Mr Skinner)'">Mr Skinner</a>. [Interruption.] He is my great friend.</p> <p pid="a12.1/6">Researching today&#8217;s seconder, <a href="/mp/?p=24948" title="Our page on Sarah Newton - 'the hon. Member for Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton)'">Sarah Newton</a>, I believe I have uncovered yet another secret Conservative project originating in Merton in the 1980s that led directly to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street">Downing Street</a> three decades later. Chief of the Wimbledon set, as they became known, was <a href="/mp/?p=10426" title="Our page on Theresa May - 'the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)'">Mrs May</a>.

Today, those who were part of the Wimbledon set are described as &#8220;competent and professional&#8221;, which really begs the question, how did <a href="/mp/?p=10920" title="Our page on Chris Grayling - 'the right hon.

[Interruption.] The most expensive <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Secretary">Transport Secretary</a> we have ever had&#8212;don&#8217;t worry about it.</p> <p pid="a12.1/7">The House may not know this, but in 2013 the hon.

I was happy to support her early-day motion to mark the anniversary of the death of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Wilding_Davison">Emily Wilding Davison</a>. It is worth the House hearing some of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDM">EDM</a> 164.

The only legitimate way to sort Brexit now is to let the people decide with the final say. To pass this House, any deal needs to meet the needs of workers and businesses. That means including a new customs union&#8212;a close single market relationship&#8212;and guarantees of workers&#8217; rights, consumer standards and environmental protection; and, if I may say so, guarantees that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday">Good Friday</a> agreement will not be damaged or undermined in any way. A withdrawal agreement was announced, but we do not know yet if the Government have done a deal. What we are sure of is that this House has legislated against crashing out with no deal and that the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> must comply with the law if a deal does not pass this House.</p> <p pid="a14.1/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen">The Queen</a>&#8217;s Speech talked about the opportunities that arise from Brexit, but the Government&#8217;s own figures suggest that a free trade agreement approach would cause a near 7% hit to our economy, while a no-deal crash-out would cause a 10% hit. Those seem like opportunities that we could all live without. For many people, the economy of this country is fundamentally weak. Since 2010, there are more workers in poverty, more children in poverty, more pensioners in poverty, more families without a home to call their own and more people&#8212;fellow citizens&#8212;sleeping rough on our streets. Fewer people can afford their own home, and wages are still lower than they were a decade ago. Productivity is falling, and the economy contracted last month.</p> <p pid="a14.1/4">At the weekend I was in Hastings on the south coast, where last year food banks staffed by volunteers distributed 87,453 meals, and one in seven people in that town live in <a href="/glossary/?gl=273" title="A household is said to be in fuel poverty when its members cannot afford to..." class="glossary">fuel poverty</a>. Are those not shocking figures in this country in the 21st century? There was nothing in the Queen&#8217;s Speech to address our stagnant economy, nothing to address low pay and insecure work, and nothing to reverse the rising levels of child poverty or pensioner poverty.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a16.1/1">I have news for the hon. Lady: it is her Government who ended the nurse bursary system&#8212;simple.</p> <p pid="a16.1/2">Will the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> support Labour&#8217;s plans to provide free prescriptions to people in England, as has been done in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland? Will he also back Labour&#8217;s commitment to legislate for safe staffing levels in all our hospitals?</p> <p pid="a16.1/3">The previous Queen&#8217;s Speech, in 2017, stated:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a16.1/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Government">My Government</a> will reform mental health legislation and ensure that mental health is prioritised in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service_in_England">National Health Service in England</a>.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a16.1/5">Two years on, all we have are the same warm words. The mental health crisis continues to get worse and worse, as many people in great stress are told that there is no therapy available for several months. As a result, terrible things can happen.</p> <p pid="a16.1/6">It is a similar story on social care. The 2017 Queen&#8217;s Speech promised:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a16.1/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;My Ministers will work to improve social care and will bring forward proposals&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, <a href="/glossary/?gl=191" title="The house of Lords is the upper chamber of the Houses of Parliament. It is..." class="glossary">House of Lords</a>, <phrase class="date" code="2019-06-21">21 June</phrase> 2017; Vol. 783, c. 6.]</p> <p pid="a16.1/8">Today we have the same promise after two years of inaction and failure, with 87 people dying every day while waiting for social care that is not provided.</p> <p pid="a16.1/9">This Queen&#8217;s Speech is shockingly weak on education, with no commitment on early years, on colleges or on universities. The money announced for our schools does not restore the funding loss since 2010. It is all very well promising extra police, but the reason why we do not have enough police is that the Government cut 21,000 police jobs and nearly 7,000 police community support officers. If the Conservative party&#8212;the party in government&#8212;wants to talk about providing police with protections, perhaps it can tell the police why it subjected them and millions of other public sector workers to cuts in their pay and pensions, damaging their terms and conditions of employment.</p> <p pid="a16.1/10">I know that this Government do not have a great record of listening to judges, but they are surely aware that judges already have the powers to ensure that the most serious offenders serve more than half their sentences in jail. Our prisons are severely overcrowded. There are 2,500 fewer prison officers in our prisons today than in 2010&#8212;hence many of the problems throughout our prison service. The privatisation of the probation service  was a shambolic and costly failure. I hope that lessons have been learned, and we will examine closely any proposals on rehabilitating offenders. I hope that, alongside the tougher sentencing, the Government will also recognise that too many people are in prison on very short sentences for non-violent and non-sexual offences. Our society, I believe, could be better served by their being subject to community sentencing and restorative justice.</p> <p pid="a16.1/11">What will the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> do to address the appallingly low conviction rate for rape and other serious sexual offences? The dog-whistle rhetoric around foreign offenders is a rather ugly mask for the fact that, by crashing out of the EU, the Government risk losing some of the most effective measures in tackling cross-border crime: the European arrest warrant, participation in Eurojust and access to numerous databases.</p> <p pid="a16.1/12">We will, of course, closely study the detail of the Government&#8217;s proposals on rail reform, but it is no good simply changing the way in which train operating companies carry on extracting profit from our fragmented railway system. Only a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> will cap fares and ensure that the railway is run for the passengers, not for profit. There is nothing in this Queen&#8217;s Speech to reverse the devastating cuts to bus services all over the country. A Labour Government will restore rail and bus services, and the integration of those services.</p> <p pid="a16.1/13">Two years ago, the horror of Grenfell happened. We all remember it very well and we remember the response of the public and in this House. But I have to say that nine out of 10 private blocks of flats with Grenfell-style cladding have still not had it replaced. Not a single private block has been made safe under this Prime Minister. Will he confirm today that he will set a hard deadline for all landlords to replace dangerous cladding, that he will toughen sanctions against block owners that will not do that work, and that he will fund the retrofitting of sprinklers in all high-rise social housing blocks? Will he restore the budget cuts to our fire service, who acted so heroically on that dreadful night of the Grenfell fire?</p> <p pid="a16.1/14">Perhaps the Prime Minister can set out what measures there are to address the Government&#8217;s abject failure on housing. That has led to more people sleeping on our streets, more families in hostels and temporary accommodation, and fewer people able to buy their own homes. Labour will end no-fault evictions. We will tackle the leasehold scandal and kick-start the largest council house building programme for a generation. It will be Labour that will fix the housing crisis in this country.</p> <p pid="a16.1/15">The introduction of pension dashboards is welcome, as is the legislation for CDC&#8212;collective defined contribution&#8212;pension schemes, which I hope will help to resolve the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mail">Royal Mail</a> dispute. Sadly, the proposals do nothing to address the injustice done to women born in the 1950s. That injustice must be put right. Additionally, this Queen&#8217;s Speech does nothing to guarantee the free TV licence for the over-75s.</p> <p pid="a16.1/16">The Government handed our armed forces a pay cut for seven years. Cuts to council budgets in England have made it far harder to deliver the armed forces covenant, leaving our veterans and our personnel and all of their families worse off.</p> <p pid="a16.1/17">We will not allow the Government to stifle democracy by making it harder for people to vote. There was only one instance of voter personation at the last election.  Some 11 million people in this country do not have&#8212;[Interruption.] This is serious. It is about elections and it is about democracy. Some 11 million people in this country do not have a passport or a driving licence. There are huge risks in the legislation being proposed which will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.</p>            </div>

It has benefited our economy immensely, with European Union workers playing a key role in sustaining many of our industries and public services. No responsible Member would vote to rip that up, unless there is a proper plan in place. In the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> of the Windrush scandal, the settled status scheme for European Union citizens risks another round of wrongful denial of rights and shameful deportations. I look forward to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> assuring those European Union citizens, who have made such an enormous contribution to our lives and our society, that they will have a secure future in this country.</p> <p pid="a18.3/2">The Government say that they will be at the forefront of solving the most complex international security issues and global challenges, yet they are playing precisely no role in stopping the horrors unfolding in the Kurdish areas of northern Syria, ending the war and humanitarian crisis in Yemen, or standing up for the rights of the Rohingya, the Uighurs, or the people of Palestine, Ecuador or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>. They are continuing to cosy up to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Donald Trump</a>, and sitting idly by as he wrecks the world&#8217;s efforts to tackle climate change and nuclear proliferation.</p> <p pid="a18.3/3">As <a href="/mp/?p=24910" title="Our page on Caroline Lucas - 'the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas)'">Caroline Lucas</a> said in an <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>, the crisis of our age is the climate emergency as declared by this House in May, but there is no action announced in the Queen&#8217;s Speech. I pay tribute to the climate school strikers and to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_Rebellion">Extinction Rebellion</a>. Sadly, the Government have not listened. The Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> derided them as &#8220;nose-ringed&#8230;crusties&#8221;, although I note that their number included a Conservative former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament">Member of the European Parliament</a>, who I believe is related to the Prime Minister. So many people are concerned about bad air quality, the failure to invest in renewable energy, the pollution of our rivers and seas, and the loss of biodiversity.  Only this Government have the power and resource to tackle the climate emergency if they wanted to, but they are missing with inaction. It is Labour that will bring forward a green new deal to tackle the climate emergency.</p> <p pid="a18.3/4">The legislative programme is a propaganda exercise that the Government cannot disguise. This Government have failed on Brexit for over three years. They are barely beginning to undo the damage of a decade of cuts to our public services. It does nothing for people struggling to make ends meet. It does nothing to make our world a safer place or tackle the climate emergency. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> promised that this Queen&#8217;s Speech would dazzle us. On closer inspection, it is nothing more than fool&#8217;s gold.</p>            </div>

We aim to create a new age of opportunity for the whole country.</p> <p pid="a19.0/2">As we prepare to get Brexit done by <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-31">31 October</phrase>, we are setting out now our vision of an open, global, free-trading United Kingdom: a high-wage, low-tax economy with the highest environmental standards and new protections for animal welfare, the best place to invest, the best place to start a business, and the best place to start a family and send your kids to school. Without being chauvinistic or disrespectful to anywhere else in the world, in important respects this country is the greatest place to live and to be&#8212;the greatest place on earth.</p> <p pid="a19.0/3">Her Majesty&#8217;s Gracious Speech was proposed superbly by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25685" title="Our page on Lee Rowley - 'the Member for North East Derbyshire (Lee Rowley)'">Lee Rowley</a>&#8212;the first Conservative to represent his seat since 1935, when presumably, <a href="/mp/?p=10544" title="Our page on Dennis Skinner - 'the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr Skinner)'">Mr Skinner</a> departed for Bolsover. If hon. Members are wondering whence my hon. Friend derives his passion and his oratorical gifts, it may interest them to know that his aunt was secretary to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Scargill">Arthur Scargill</a>. I doubt that he shares many of the convictions of the former miners&#8217; leader, except one: that we should obey the democratic will of the people and get Brexit done by <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-31">31 October</phrase>. My hon. Friend is also a passionate collector of airline memorabilia. His home is allegedly stocked&#8212;a museum of airline washbags, airline socks and a vast fleet of model planes, including a model <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_Rebellion">Extinction Rebellion</a> protester glued to the roof. All I can say to him is: &#8220;Cabin crew, doors to automatic and cross-check&#8221;, because his career is &#8220;planely&#8221; about to take off, and his speech was in the very finest traditions of the House.</p> <p pid="a19.0/4">The Loyal Address was brilliantly seconded by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24948" title="Our page on Sarah Newton - 'the Member for Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton)'">Sarah Newton</a>, who comes, if I can continue with the aeronautical metaphor, from a very different wing of the party&#8212;the modern <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> party is a vast and capacious low-carbon plane, by the way&#8212;and who has been highly successful as a campaigner for the rights of disabled people.  Though she is known for her calm manner and her dulcet tones, when it comes to defending the interests of her native Cornwall or protecting the pasty against the fiscal depredations of former Chancellors, she can be as fearsome as any Falmouth seagull going for your chips. On the most divisive issue in modern Britain, which plagues us to this day, it is well known that she has come down on one side and will not be budged: it is jam first, not cream, on scones. She is Cornish to her roots and her speech too was in the best traditions of the House.</p> <p pid="a19.0/5">Let me join <a href="/mp/?p=10133" title="Our page on Jeremy Corbyn - 'the right hon.

He was a proud and witty Welshman who earned this obituary from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldie_Lookin_Chain">Goldie Lookin Chain</a>, a south Wales rap ensemble, straight outta Newport. They said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a19.0/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;As an MP he was well respected, since 1987 when first elected.</p> <p class="indent" pid="a19.0/7" pwmotiontext="yes">Across the parties Paul was revered, and it&#8217;s just possible he was born with that beard.</p> <p class="indent" pid="a19.0/8" pwmotiontext="yes">Across the floor, far and wide, respected across the political divide,</p> <p class="indent" pid="a19.0/9" pwmotiontext="yes">Regardless of your own stance, left or right, raise a glass to Paul tonight.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a19.0/10">I have no idea as to the political preferences of the band members 2Hats or Eggsy&#8212;[Interruption.] The hon.

First he was opposed to no deal; now he seems to be opposed to any deal. First he was in favour of delivering Brexit; now he wants a second referendum. First he wanted an election&#8212;actually, he had wanted an election for quite a long time; but now he would much rather not. He resembles a Janus, a pushmi-pullyu facing in both directions at once and unable to decide for either. His policy on cake is neither having it nor eating it. Frankly, I fear for his political health, because we can all see the Soviet-era expulsions that are taking place in his circle, as one by one his lieutenants are purged, as Lenin purged the associates of poor old Trotsky. There is Lenin, the veteran fabricator of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLC">GLC</a> budgets. As the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> tightens his icy grip on the Labour party, the contrast becomes ever starker. Contrary to what the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition">Leader of the Opposition</a> just said, we are putting up wages with the biggest expansion of the living wage ever seen. He would put up taxes. We will control immigration with a points-based system&#8212;</p>            </div>

Friend has anticipated a point that I am about to come to, but let me deal with it out of order, as it were, and say that we will be bringing forward legislation to protect serving and former serving personnel. As he will know, the consultation on that matter has just come to an end.</p> <p pid="a21.7/2">I have drawn several important points of distinction between this Government and the party led by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a>, but, for our present purposes, perhaps the most immediate is that we want to get on and deliver Brexit on <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-31">31 October</phrase> whereas he wants to dither and delay. I cannot in all conscience believe that that is the right way forward for this country.</p> <p pid="a21.7/3">The right hon. Gentleman recently said that he was &#8220;daunted&#8221; by the prospect that he might actually become <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>. Well, I have to say that he is not alone in that fear&#8212;so are most <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members, judging  by their actions, most of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>, and, indeed, most of the country. I can give him the reassurance &#8212;the consolation&#8212;that I intend to do everything I can to prevent that from happening.</p> <p pid="a21.7/4">I hope very much that, in spite of some of our differences, the right hon. Gentleman will support at least some of the measures in the Gracious Speech. At the heart of the speech is an ambitious programme to unite our country with energy and with optimism, but also with the basic common sense of one nation Conservativism. Contrary to some of the gloomier things that we heard just now, we have unemployment at its lowest level since 1974, we have inward investment at record highs, we have 700,000 fewer children in workless households than there were in 2010, and we are leading the world in so many sectors of 21st-century business and technology. It is because of that economic success, that free market success&#8212;and I see the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> recoil at the notion of a free market success like a Transylvanian in the sunlight&#8212;that we will look after those who look after us and keep us safe. That is how we will spend another &#163;2.2 billion on the armed services, which brings me to the point raised by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24907" title="Our page on Bob Stewart - 'the Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)'">Bob Stewart</a>&#8212;and yes, as I said, we will bring forward legislation to protect our serving men and women.</p> <p pid="a21.7/5">I should be very clear about this. The Government understand that no one can escape justice for a crime that they have committed, but we also understand that there should be no unfair prosecution when no new evidence has been produced; and yes, in the same spirit we will protect our brave police&#8212;who run towards danger to keep us safe&#8212;by putting the police covenant into law and by giving them the political support that they need in order to do their job, even if that means difficult and intrusive procedures like stop and search, because those procedures save lives. As we back our police and insist on serious sentencing for serious crimes&#8212;and I think it was the Labour party that instituted automatic early release&#8212;this Government, this one nation Government, also insist&#8212;</p>            </div>

That is why today we announced a new programme to purge online harms from the internet and to invest massively in youth clubs. We vow, as one nation <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a>, never to abandon anyone&#8212;never to write off any young person because they have been in prison, but to help them into work, and, by investing in prisons, as we are, to prevent them from becoming academies of crime.</p> <p pid="a23.0/3">When we tackle crime as one nation Conservatives, and when we tackle the problems of mental ill health, we are doing something for the social justice of the country, because we all know that it is the poorest and the neediest who are disproportionately the victims of crime, and we know that it is the poorest who are most likely to suffer from mental ill health. It is our job, as a campaigning Government, to level up investment across the nation, and I am proud that we are now seeing the biggest programme of investment in the NHS for a generation. In 10 years&#8217; time, as a result of decisions being taken now, there will be 40 new hospitals. We have fantastic NHS staff&#8212;the best in the world&#8212;and it is time to give them the funding and facilities they deserve.</p> <p pid="a23.0/4"><a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members have shouted about education. I am proud we are levelling up with a &#163;14 billion programme of investment in our primary and secondary schools, and I hope they will support that, because we believe that is the best way to create opportunity and spread it more fairly and uniformly across the country, to give every child a superb education.</p>            </div>

Of course, that is not the only act of wanton expropriation&#8212;theft by the public sector of the private sector&#8212;that is envisaged, because Labour wants a massive &#163;196 billion programme of nationalisation. That is the destruction that it would wreak on the UK economy.</p> <p pid="a25.7/2">By contrast, we want to boost the productivity of the whole UK with massive investment. We will begin <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Powerhouse_Rail">Northern Powerhouse Rail</a>, we will banish the rattling old Pacer trains, and we will invest in roads across the country and fleets of clean green buses. We understand that that is the way to create the platform for economic growth. If we have great infrastructure, great transport connectivity, and gigabit broadband, we have the environment in which business can flourish. We need business to flourish, do we not? Labour does not like business, but we need  business to flourish not just for the tax yield, but because so many of the solutions to our problems, not least the environmental problems, are provided by the free market and by capitalism.</p> <p pid="a25.7/3">If we look at the battery technology, in which this country now leads the world, or the designs for wind turbines or solar panels, in which this country also leads the world, we see that it is not the Government who make that stuff. Yes, of course, the Government must lead and create the right fiscal and regulatory frameworks, but the Conservative vision is of a nation full of innovators, entrepreneurs and start-ups. That is not only how the green economy will take this country forward, but how we will become carbon neutral by 2050. That point is understood by proud free market <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a>, including, as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a> was kind enough to point out earlier, some of my relatives&#8212;my crustier relatives, I should say&#8212;who joined the protests in the past few days but who understand the vital importance of free market economics for delivering the solutions we need.</p> <p pid="a25.7/4">What would Labour do, by contrast? Labour avowedly wishes to destroy capitalism. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leader">The Leader</a> of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> wants to foment the overthrow of capitalism. Not just that, he wants to whack up taxes on virtually everything, from income tax to pension tax to inheritance tax.

We have entered very dark days. In just 17 days, the UK is set to leave the European Union. I wish to take some time to reflect, with the House, on why this Government&#8217;s actions are leading to such a tragedy&#8212;and, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, I do not use my words lightly. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_the_European_Union">Leaving the European Union</a> is a tragedy. At the inception of the European Community, it was stated:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a30.0/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;The contribution which an organised and living Europe can bring to civilisation is indispensable to the maintenance of peaceful relations.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a30.0/5">Perhaps the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> might show some respect to the debate, rather than sitting and laughing about those who established the European Community.</p> <p pid="a30.0/6"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_European_Community">The European Community</a> was born in the aftermath of the second world war, after two devastating world wars that brought death, destruction and misery. The European Union is the greatest example of political co-operation and peace, leaving behind the scars of war and the pain of loss and instead choosing to take the hand of friendship across the continent. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Kingdom">The United Kingdom</a> joined with European partners to say that never&#8212;not ever again&#8212;would we compromise peace and stability, and that the European Union would work as a beacon of hope and the guiding light for continued peace, to avoid conflict and the loss of more lives. That is the European Union that my colleagues on the SNP Benches are so proud of.</p> <p pid="a30.0/7">For decades, the United Kingdom has played its role as an equal partner with member states across Europe in the pursuit of inclusion, tolerance, solidarity, freedom and peace. Through the European Union, we have prioritised human dignity, worked together to deliver equality, protected human rights, and preserved the importance of the rule of law and democracy.</p>            </div>

I fear that the past few years have numbed many of us to the looming disaster of a no-deal Brexit and to the real dangers of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_Leave">Vote Leave</a> occupants of No. 10.

We know that, if Scotland is taken out of the European Union against its will, it will cost us up to 100,000 jobs. We also know, because the Government have told us through the Yellowhammer document, that there is a threat to the supply of food and medicines. And now the chief medical officer for England is telling us that there is a threat to lives. At the end of the day, it is the Government who are responsible for this situation and it is the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> who has it within his gift to recognise what a calamity a no-deal Brexit would be.</p> <p pid="a32.3/3">The Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> could stand up in this House today and say that he will respect the rule of law and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benn_Act">Benn Act</a>, and that under no circumstances will we leave the European Union on a no-deal basis at the end of October. To do so would be an act of dignity and an act that respects the rule of law. I will happily give the Prime Minister the opportunity, if he so chooses, to rise now and tell the House that he will respect the law and that he is never, ever above the law. Well, there we are.  There is the answer that the House needs. [Interruption.] <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> might be tying his laces, but he is tying the Conservative party in knots.</p> <p pid="a32.3/4">It is worth noting that 10 of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> introduced by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> during the 2017-19 Session did not complete their passage through Parliament despite the length of the Session, emphasising the chaos at the heart of this Government.

It is blatant, egotistical electioneering&#8212;another toxic <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> agenda, presenting wish lists for a Prime Minister who carries no <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament.

This Government&#8217;s top priority is to leave the&#8212;[Interruption.] You know, it gets a bit rich for someone who is behaving as if he is a barrack-room lawyer to shout out repeatedly. I tell you what&#8212;I look forward to the people of Stirling being able to give their judgment on the behaviour of the hon. Gentleman. That the Government&#8217;s top priority is to leave the European Union shows contempt for the majority view of Scotland that we should remain in the European Union. It is about time that those who are temporarily here from Scottish seats representing the Tories recognised that they should be standing up for the people of Scotland, who want to stay in the European Union, not stabbing them in the back.</p> <p pid="a32.3/6">These legislative proposals will be devastating for Scotland. Despite the rouge and the fanfare around today, the Prime Minister is not really interested in delivering a new legislative programme; he is only interested in showcasing his party&#8217;s manifesto&#8212;and what a regressive manifesto it is. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen">The Queen</a>&#8217;s Speech is a missed opportunity to address years of austerity and punishing cuts in social security support. We call it social security, by the way&#8212;you lot call it welfare, and that is the difference. The Queen&#8217;s Speech completely failed to address the social security disaster the Tories have overseen since 2010. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scottish_National">The Scottish National</a> party is clear that universal credit should be radically reformed, and that the disgraceful&#8212;absolutely disgraceful&#8212;two-child cap on child tax credits, along with the appalling rape <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a>, must be scrapped immediately. It is astonishing that this Government continue to pursue a policy of inflicting hardship and economic harm on people across the United Kingdom.</p> <p pid="a32.3/7">The sheer hypocrisy of saying that this Queen&#8217;s Speech is heavy on law and order, coming from a Prime Minister who is prepared to break the law: you really couldn&#8217;t make it up. The Prime Minister was found by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court">Supreme Court</a> to have given unlawful advice to the Queen. Then he told the Commons he would not abide by the Benn Act. However, he then gave a sworn promise to the Scottish courts that he would obey the law and issue a letter for extension if no deal is agreed by <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-19">19 October</phrase>. The Prime Minister must deliver that letter but, if not, I give him this promise: he will find himself back in the courts next week and answerable to them.</p> <p pid="a32.3/8">On Thursday <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-03">3 October</phrase>, the Prime Minister told the Commons that his proposals would not create physical infrastructure on the Irish border, which the Taoiseach then called out, stating simply that United Kingdom proposals would mean infrastructure on the border.  Many across the UK will find it hard to stomach a Prime Minister talking about law and order when he himself shows the rule of law absolutely no respect.</p>            </div>

We should be discussing Nazanin. We are glad that Nazanin&#8217;s daughter has come home, but where is the Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>? There is no question but that our voice will be diminished internationally by the fact that we will not be around the table with our European partners.</p> <p pid="a36.1/2">I have taken a number of interventions and I must move on. Nothing in the Government&#8217;s speech is designed to enhance the rights of Scotland, our Parliament or the voices of the Scottish people. Most notable is the fact that this Government plan to reintroduce the Agriculture Bill and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisheries_Bill">Fisheries Bill</a>, showing contempt for our devolution settlement and seeking to sideline and silence the voices of Scotland. Under the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>&#8217;s predecessor, powers over fisheries and agriculture were removed from Scotland without the consent of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a>&#8212;powers that the Scottish people had voted for back in our devolution referendum in 1997. They were taken back to Westminster without the consent of the people of Scotland. I want firmly to put on the record that the Scottish National party, while here in Westminster and in Scotland, will do all that we can to resist the downgrading and dismissal of our devolved rights and powers. When Westminster talks of taking back control of fishing and agriculture, it means taking back control not from the EU but from Scotland.</p> <p pid="a36.1/3">The day is coming, and coming fast, when the people of Scotland will have their say on Brexit Britain and on whether they wish to be an independent country in Europe. Let me remind the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, who is not <a href="/glossary/?gl=145" title="Of a male MP, sitting on his regular seat in the House.

That is not only morally deplorable, but economically nonsensical. In Scotland, our economy relies on immigration to support key public services&#8212;not least our health service. EU citizens from outwith the UK living in Scotland make up 3.9% of our population and 5% of our workforce. They enrich our culture, strengthen our society and boost our economy.</p> <p pid="a36.1/7"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_the_EU">Leaving the EU</a> and ending freedom of movement could cost Scotland up to &#163;2 billion in lost tax revenues. Restricting the rights and freedoms of citizens to come to Scotland will risk the delivery of key public services. But what do we expect from the Tories? Closing up borders is driven not by fact or reason, but by an  ideological, fundamental position from the governing party: that immigration is bad. We have recently seen that fundamentalism in practice, as the Government refused automatically to guarantee permanent residence to all EU nationals in the UK, along with their families. The Government are risking leading us into another Windrush scandal, making life impossible for thousands of EU nationals. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> should be working to keep citizens here and enable a fairer immigration system to deal with sectoral needs across Scotland and the UK, rather than focusing on forcing people to leave their homes here. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> need to stop playing with people&#8217;s lives and drop the hostile environment once and for all.</p>            </div>

The fact that many of these women are suffering is absolutely disgraceful, and they have had nothing but contempt from this Government.</p>            </div>

Although the SNP welcomes progress on bringing forward legislation on the pensions dashboard, the Bill falls short in a number of areas. We have discussed the 1950s women: the Government have a responsibility to address the hardship visited on hundreds of thousands of those women. It must be addressed in this legislation. It simply cannot go on any longer.</p> <p pid="a37.5/3">Moreover, the Scottish National party has consistently called for the establishment of an independent pensions and savings commission to deal with policy gaps in delivering dignity in retirement. If the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and his Government are really interested in delivering on preparation for later life, they need to get real. Not everyone has a <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> trust fund to fall back on. We need robust and responsive policy to deal with the crisis in pensions saving that we simply cannot wait for. I therefore plead with the Government: do not mess this up; establish the commission and use the opportunity to deliver a pensions Bill that actually delivers fairness for older people, rather than uncertainty, complexity and hardship.</p> <p pid="a37.5/4">The Government have said that as part of their efforts they will bring forward a new environment Bill to set legally binding targets to reduce the use of plastics, restore biodiversity, improve water quality and cut air pollution. We on the SNP Benches say about time. The Government might at last have woken up to the reality of the climate crisis, but the devil will be in the detail. Already, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Government">United Kingdom Government</a> are lagging behind the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government">Scottish Government</a> in their commitment to ending the climate crisis. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_SNP">The SNP</a> Scottish Government already have more robust targets in place, so I say to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> that if they are ready to face the reality that our world demands action now, then they should follow the lead of the SNP Scottish Government.</p> <p pid="a37.5/5">Members across the House know that the single market has been achieved by removing barriers to trade and having a single set of trade rules across all member states.</p>            </div>

A <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> trade Bill will end all the economic progress that has been made.</p> <p pid="a38.1/3">Furthermore, not unexpectedly, the Government have announced a Bill on the withdrawal agreement, an agreement this Government have yet to reach with the European Union&#8212;or indeed with this House. Let us call it a fantasy Bill. Yet media reports suggest that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> is looking possibly to legislate for the agreement on <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-19">19 October</phrase>.

This is not the beginning of a new Parliament; it is the end. We in the SNP are crystal clear that we want it to end on our terms, not on the Prime Minister&#8217;s. Deal or no deal, the Prime Minister is driving Scotland and the UK into economic catastrophe. His proposals do not keep Scotland in the single market and the customs union, and that will cripple our economy, risking jobs, livelihoods and delivering a race to the bottom on fundamental rights. These are not acceptable to the SNP; nor should they be acceptable to this House.</p> <p pid="a38.1/5">There is a piece of legislation that should focus the minds of all Members today: the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benn_Act">Benn Act</a>. In just five days, the Benn Act legally requires the Prime Minister to ask for an extension. His public utterances suggest that that will not happen. We all know that we cannot trust this Prime Minister to act in accordance with the law. We cannot even trust him to turn up to Parliament. I have to say that I am sceptical about the possibility of compromise. What exactly is the Prime Minister compromising and who is he compromising with? Internally, the Prime Minister is seeking to play a crude numbers game, hoping that a number of Labour Back Benchers come to his rescue for any shoddy deal that he might be able to force through at the final hour.</p> <p pid="a38.1/6">I want to make the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> of the Scottish National party clear for the House, and I hope that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a> and the leader of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> listen carefully: only by taking control of the House this week can we bring down and end the days of this Government. That is the only way that we can ensure that we can secure an extension and make sure that no deal cannot become a reality. We cannot wait and trust the Prime Minister and his cronies in No. 10. Any Member in this House who caves in on bended knee to a deal cooked up by the Prime Minister is trying to escape the inescapable reality that any Brexit will destroy opportunities and the totality of relationships across these islands as we know them. We must stop this Government riding roughshod over the rights and freedoms of all our citizens. We cannot allow a dangerous Prime Minister to remain in office. We cannot allow the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_Leave">Vote Leave</a> campaign to suffocate Parliament into submission. We must resist.</p> <p pid="a38.1/7">If Opposition parties come together, we can take no deal off the table and resolve the deadlock once and for all by holding a <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a> to clear the decks. We must put our trust in the people. We must trust that after years of uncertainty, chaos and instability, the public want something better than this Tory Government. That is our job. That is the job of any Opposition&#8212;to oppose the Government&#8212;and to offer a better way.</p> <p pid="a38.1/8"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_SNP">The SNP</a> will not play into the Prime Minister&#8217;s hands and partake in his charade. We will vote down this Queen&#8217;s Speech. We are not in the business of backing Tory manifesto pledges; nor should others be on these Benches.</p>            </div>

I work closely with clinical commissioning groups and other partners in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> to ensure that we are getting the right mental health support to those who need it most.</p> <p pid="a41.1/2">Unfortunately, there are some real gaps in mental health provision. For example, children under 11 in my area get some really good support, but there is a gap in the support for those aged between 11 and 18, which can be an acute time. Nor do we necessarily have the right mental health support for men who are suffering from poor mental health. We certainly do not have the right level of trained support for those who have been in the armed forces and have a different type of mental health condition that requires specialist care. It is incumbent on all of us to look at the detail of the mental health proposals in the Queen&#8217;s Speech and, if required, work cross-party to ensure that we have a significant and good piece of legislation.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a41.3/1">I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. One of the issues that we have is making sure that people do not slip under the radar. Now that we are talking more about mental health than ever before, I hope that we will have other ways of capturing those people and getting them into the support systems. As I have said, one concern I have is that those in the system who have a particularly severe mental health condition and have spent some time in a residential unit are discharged without the right care plan or home visits. That is not fair on the person suffering from poor mental health or on their families and loved ones who are trying to support them.</p> <p pid="a41.3/2">Another Bill in the Queen&#8217;s Speech that I very much support&#8212;but again I look forward to seeing the detail&#8212;is the new offences Bill. It is right that we increase the prison sentences for those found guilty of serious violent and sexual offences, but I hope it will also include reforms relating to the misuse of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_Offences_Act_2003">Sexual Offences Act 2003</a>, bringing sports coaches in line with the rules relating to teachers, and will finally increase the sentences for those who cause death by dangerous driving. I have been lobbying for an increase, having had a desperately sad case&#8212;unfortunately not a unique one&#8212;raised with me by local residents who tragically lost their son. We made a commitment in that regard in 2017, but as yet it has not had parliamentary time. I hope that we can now do that. I can only imagine how difficult it must be to deal with the loss of a loved one in such horrendous circumstances. Knowing that justice has been served must be an important part of coming to terms with that loss, and after such a welcome announcement two years ago and the subsequent delay, I very much hope that the Government can finally present the legislation to Parliament as soon as possible. I am sure that it will have broad support across the House.</p> <p pid="a41.3/3">Those measures could easily have been set alongside others relating to, for example, road safety, and I should have liked to see more work in that area of domestic policy. After a constituent&#8217;s partner was killed while recovering another vehicle from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M25">M25</a>, I, along with my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=11626" title="Our page on Mike Penning - 'the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Sir Mike Penning)'">Sir Mike Penning</a>, have been campaigning for greater protections for people who work to rescue those who have broken down on our road network. They include minor changes in traffic regulations, such as allowing recovery vehicles to go through red lights rather than just amber, but they also include a full-scale review of our smart motorway network.</p> <p pid="a41.3/4">I have actively campaigned against the roll-out of a smart motorway on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M20">M20</a>, because I am not convinced of its safety. I have seen and heard the statistics from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highways_England">Highways England</a>, but I share the view of the Birmingham Solihull coroner&#8212;who was presiding over the inquest into the sad death of an eight-year-old boy killed in an incident on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M6">M6</a>&#8212;that there needs to be greater clarity about the safety of the smart motorway network, including a vastly improved system to recognise stranded vehicles. I feel deeply uncomfortable with the concept of smart motorways, as they effectively strip a driver of the option to pull over. Given the higher proportion of heavier vehicles on motorways, even a collision at a slower speed between a large vehicle and a stranded smaller vehicle can have fatal consequences. The announcement of a review in the Queen&#8217;s Speech would have been greatly welcomed by drivers, recovery workers and, of course, the families of victims, and I hope that it will be considered as part of a future legislative programme.</p> <p pid="a41.3/5">However, the Bill to replace the rail franchising system is very welcome. Long-suffering commuters in Kent have been left in limbo in respect of the future of the Southeastern franchise, as the competition was delayed and delayed again by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Transport">Department for Transport</a>, and was eventually cancelled altogether in August this year. It does not seem all that long ago that the franchise timetable was torn up following the Brown review in 2013, which resulted in a 50-month extension of the current franchise. Ultimately, it is the passenger who loses out   from all the uncertainty created by a chaotic franchising system. Kent <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a> have lobbied hard for improvements in the service, and welcome much of what was included in the new franchise proposals&#8212;including greater capacity&#8212;but given that passengers face ever-increasing rail fares, it is time that those improvements were actually delivered.</p> <p pid="a41.3/6">Let me raise a specific matter related to my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>. Since becoming an MP in 2010 I have lobbied, along with colleagues in west Kent, for improved services to the City on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidstone_East">Maidstone East</a> line. They were due to be introduced in December this year, with a new Thameslink service, and we wrote to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> in May and again in September asking for assurances that they would be delivered. It was therefore desperately disappointing to be told that the roll-out would not take place in December as planned, and, incredibly, to be given no concrete assurances about when it would happen. While that is bitterly disappointing for passengers, it is, unfortunately, entirely in keeping with the complete shambles of our rail franchising system. Anything that will create more transparency and, critically, accountability, including stricter penalties, is to be welcomed. It is about time we had a rail franchising system that worked for the passenger and not the rail industry.</p> <p pid="a41.3/7">However, rail is just one part of our creaking infrastructure. One area of domestic policy on which I would have liked to see legislation relates to roads. I shall be lobbying the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> hard for more funding for Kent roads, including major investment in junction 3 on the M2 and junctions 5 and 6 on the M20. With the prospect of the lower Thames crossing coming on stream, it is essential that we invest now to minimise the negative impact of increased traffic going through my constituency and, indeed, the county as a whole.</p> <p pid="a41.3/8">It is important for us not to forget that there is a world beyond Brexit. I welcome our new domestic agenda, and I hope that it is passed next week so we can get on with delivering on our pledges to improve the lives of our constituents.</p>            </div>

Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">division</a>&#8212;although perhaps the next time the Prime Minister needs someone to do a leak inquiry there is an obvious candidate.</p> <p pid="a43.0/6">It is perhaps a sign of our political times that the Humble Address was proposed by a leaver who has three times voted with me against a Brexit deal and seconded by a remainer who has three times voted for a deal to leave the European Union.</p> <p pid="a43.0/7">On these occasions it is of course traditional to try to lighten the mood with the odd joke, and I see that even the Queen today managed to include something to make us all laugh when she said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a43.0/8" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;The Government&#8217;s new economic plan will be underpinned by a responsible fiscal strategy&#8221;,</p> <p pid="a43.0/9">because this Queen&#8217;s Speech is predicated on the UK leaving the European Union in just over two weeks and analysis after analysis shows that that will leave a massive hole in the public finances.</p> <p pid="a43.0/10">Much of the last three years has felt a little bit like groundhog day for many of us, but there was something about the last week that has felt particularly familiar to me, and then it dawned on me: we have all been sat in meetings where a woman puts forward an idea and it gets shouted down only a little later for a man to suggest virtually the same thing and pretend it was his great idea all along. But the Liberal Democrats are crystal clear: whether it is a hard or soft Brexit, whether it comes with a red rosette or a blue rosette, whether it is proposed by the former Prime Minister, the current Prime Minister or the Leader of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a>, there is no form of Brexit that will be good for our country. And the Liberal Democrats will continue to fight to stop Brexit: to secure a people&#8217;s vote with the option to remain in the European Union, to give the public the final say on the Brexit deal, because there is no deal that will ever be as good as the one we currently have as members of the European Union.</p> <p pid="a43.0/11">There was nothing in this Queen&#8217;s Speech that will bring comfort to the factory worker set to lose their job or to the many thousands who already have; nothing to bring comfort to families when they are having to pay more and more to put food on the table; nothing to bring comfort to our young people who are being stripped of the right to live, work and study in 27 other countries; nothing to bring comfort to our NHS on the cusp of yet another winter crisis and having lost more  than 5,000 EU nurses in the past two years; and nothing to bring comfort to the cancer patients who fear delays to drugs will mean delays to treatments and risks to their own health.</p> <p pid="a43.0/12">Nothing in this Queen&#8217;s Speech will give the 3 million European citizens any comfort. Bina is with us today. She is a Dutch national who moved here in 1999. After the birth of her second daughter she decided to become self-employed, but despite paying her taxes just as she should, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> asked for proof after proof before finally granting her settled status after weeks of anxiety and uncertainty and weeks of being treated like a second-class citizen in the place she calls home.</p> <p pid="a43.0/13">Jennifer is also with us today. Her daughter, who is 38 years old, was born in Strasbourg and is severely disabled. In 1986, Jennifer moved her family to the UK, where Marie could get better care and education. Marie has settled status now, but only because her mother was there to help and to ensure that her daughter&#8217;s rights were protected. There are so many other vulnerable EU citizens in our country who cannot rely on a family member or friend to help them through the complicated application process.</p> <p pid="a43.0/14">Last but not least, my constituent Kristin has travelled down with her mother to be with us today, too. Margot moved to the UK 45 years ago from Norway. Two years later, she married Geoff in Liverpool and then Kristin was born. After raising her family, Margot went back to work, paying her taxes every step of the way. As required, Margot applied for settled status, but she struggled to get her application approved. After 45 years of contributing to our society and our economy, the Government treated her like a bureaucratic problem, causing unnecessary anxiety and fear to an elderly couple trying to enjoy their retirement years. Their family are fearful that they will be torn apart.</p>            </div>

I cannot wait to take to the country the positive alternative vision that people deserve&#8212;a vision of a country where, if someone works hard and plays by the rules, they are rewarded with a decent home and enough money to get by and live with dignity, where every child and young person is nurtured and supported to become whatever they want to be, no matter who their parents are, how much money they have or the colour of their skin, and where the most vulnerable can always get the help they need with no judgment or sanction.</p> <p pid="a45.3/4">We know that our country is better than what this Government want it to be. We can be open, generous and collaborative. Our politics can be one of hope and inclusion, firmly set on the better future that we want to create, but this Government want to turn us into an insular, closed, selfish country, trading in fear and <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing.

I worked closely with him during the coalition. He was a tremendous force for good in the international development world as well as being a great parliamentarian with a hugely distinguished career in politics behind him. I can honestly say that we miss him very much indeed in the international development firmament, so it was good that the hon. Lady chose to say what she did.</p> <p pid="a46.0/3">I also congratulate the mover and the seconder of the Loyal Address today, a task which I undertook 27 years ago, although it feels like only yesterday. I can still  remember the fear and trepidation that attended me as I sat where my hon.

I have the privilege of being the secretary of the one nation group of Conservative parliamentarians and, away from the sound and fury of politics in the run-up to the approaching <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a>, there is much in the speech that can be welcomed. My hon.

The hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Dunbartonshire">East Dunbartonshire</a> said much about Europe that is of concern to all of us. However, she was, in a way, talking about a world before the referendum. Once the referendum had taken place, these arguments were put to bed. In my view, we are all committed to implementing the referendum result and I speak as someone who voted to remain and whose constituents declined to support that&#8212;but only just. I think that the sooner we are able to implement the result of the referendum, the better.</p>            </div>

Lady has something of a brass neck by intervening with that. Most Conservative Members, most of the time, voted in favour of a deal and it is the party opposite that has not voted in favour of a deal. I respect the result of the referendum and I voted for the deal on the past two occasions it came before the House, believing that at that point there was too little room for manoeuvre and that it was in the best interests of those I represent in the royal town of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_Coldfield">Sutton Coldfield</a> to vote for it. So I can see no reason not to support the deal I expect my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> to put before the House shortly. The message I get, particularly outside the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M25">M25</a> beltway, is that people want this done. They want to move on. When the House meets in extraordinary circumstances next Saturday, they want a deal to be secured and for us to move on to the next phase. It will only be the next phase, of course, but it will be psychologically important to the markets.</p>            </div>

In my judgment, the best interests of my constituents are represented by drawing a line and moving on. There are tremendously important negotiations to come, of course, but once we have left the European Union, as we are bound to do following the referendum, we can start to repair two key things that need so much to be repaired. The first is the deep, deep divisions that run throughout our society, throughout all our constituencies and throughout the four kingdoms of the United Kingdom. A second referendum, which will clearly be very much in contention over the next few days, is a ghastly prospect, particularly as it would put back yet further the important and necessary act of healing the terrible divisions that disfigure our country.</p>            </div>

The people could then decide, once and for all, whether this is what they want. Is it more money, more control and more jobs? No. People do not want it. Let us get it over, and let us have that vote.

I think he is arguing for a second referendum&#8212;a confirmatory vote. I cannot think of anything more likely to exacerbate and perpetuate these deep, deep divisions that disfigure our country than going on, month after month, for a second referendum. It is now for the House to decide whether we can secure a deal, and I very much hope the House will decide that on Saturday.</p> <p pid="a48.2/2">The second thing, and it bears upon the Gracious Speech, is that a resolution to Brexit at the weekend will allow Britain to re-engage internationally. As the House will be aware, our reputation has plummeted over the past three years. We have been absent from parade on a number of big issues where Britain had previously shown great leadership, such as migration, climate change, protectionism, terrorism and the desperate threats that the Kurds face today. Britain&#8217;s voice needs to be heard trenchantly on these issues and, over the past three years, Brexit has prevented that from happening.</p> <p pid="a48.2/3">Climate change, for example, was mentioned in the Queen&#8217;s Speech. I have talked to some of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_Rebellion">Extinction Rebellion</a> people who blockaded the streets around Westminster over the last week or so. It is easy to mock these people, but there is something rather noble about the cause they espouse. Talking to some of them while negotiating my way through <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_Square">Trafalgar Square</a> on my bicycle has been interesting and constructive, but the problem is that, in attacking this Government, they are attacking the wrong target.</p> <p pid="a48.2/4">Britain has been a leader in tackling climate change at the major international forums of the UN and elsewhere. I pay particular tribute to important work by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Turner">Lord Turner</a> and his colleagues on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_Climate_Change">Committee on Climate Change</a>. Britain has put its money where its mouth is in tackling climate change internationally, as well as domestically. Starting with the coalition, when I had  some responsibility for these matters, we allocated some &#163;7 billion for the international climate fund. For 2016-2021 we allocated &#163;5.8 billion, from our hard-pressed taxpayers, for adaptation and mitigation of climate change. As the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> said, we are projected to spend &#163;11.6 billion between 2021 and 2026. In addition, we are streets ahead of some of our European friends and neighbours in developing the technology, and here I highlight the Ayrton fund, which has allocated &#163;1 billion for innovative technology. Britain has standards and an approach to climate change, both in adaptation and mitigation, that have been enormously effective. It is also worth bearing in mind that, this year, for the first time since the industrial revolution, we will consume more energy from renewables and nuclear power than from coal and gas.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a49.1/1">The argument the hon. Lady puts is the one that led me to vote to remain. I did not feel that the architecture of the EU was enormously compelling, but I did think that most of the problems, some of which I listed, were best handled by a more international approach. That is something where we are on the back foot. Nevertheless, it would be wrong not to conclude that, even outside the EU, working closely with our allies and partners in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a>, the United Nations, Europe and the Commonwealth, we can still have an immense footprint in tackling these important issues.</p> <p pid="a49.1/2">I wish to mention one way in which, under climate change funding, we can do more of this. We have seen Britain leading in the vital, world-changing area of educating girls. That was certainly done in the Blair and Brown years, and it was given a strong boost during the coalition years through the girls education challenge fund, which was designed to get 1 million girls into school in areas where they have been denied any form of education. Of course the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, both in his current role and as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>, has made a staunch stand in favour of that.</p> <p pid="a49.1/3">I want to see, as a result of the Queen&#8217;s Speech and of policy development, Britain doing much more to clean up the oceans of the planet. That is a good use of the development budget; millions of very poor people earn their living from the seas. Plastic has now reached almost the remotest places on earth. It has been found 11 km deep in the ocean and even on the island of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Helena">St Helena</a>, which is thousands of miles from the nearest landform and where, incidentally, the airport is proving to be such a success. By 2050, there will be more plastic than fish in the oceans of our planet. The Government&#8217;s policy domestically has been very successful in terms of curtailing the use of plastic bags and microbeads, and from April next year we will ban plastic straws. The Government have also been very successful in using the market to achieve these desirable results wherever they can. This is an area where British leadership could have  a big impact. So I urge the Government to put not only the money from the international development budget&#8212;or a proportion of it&#8212;but the considerable intellectual weight of British thinking and activity in the international forums behind that initiative.</p> <p pid="a49.1/4">The next point I wish to make about the Queen&#8217;s Speech certainly complements a one nation Queen&#8217;s Speech and, I hope, a one nation Budget in due course. I wish to stand up for capitalism and free markets, which are under great pressure, not least from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a>, as was said earlier. We need to do more to stand up for capitalism and free markets and to explain why free enterprise has been such a powerful engine of advancement and social elevation, particularly for those who are among the least well off. It has always been the case that Governments have hedged around the free market system with rules, taxes and <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> to stem excesses and excessive greed.</p> <p pid="a49.1/5">We recently watched the sad demise of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cook">Thomas Cook</a>&#8212;now mercifully in the hands of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hays_Travel">Hays Travel</a>&#8212;with a consequent loss of livelihoods and jobs and the inconvenience caused to hundreds of thousands of people who were coming back from their holiday. Is it right in Britain today that the chief executive officer of that company has been paid &#163;8.3 million since 2014, with a &#163;2.9 million bonus in 2015? The two chief financial officers have been paid &#163;7 million since 2014, and the non-executive directors have been paid &#163;4 million, including &#163;1.6 million for the non-executive chairman. Effectively, these were the directors of the UK&#8217;s oldest travel agency, and they appear to have presided over the destruction of the business while awarding themselves collectively &#163;47 million in pay and bonuses in the past 10 years. I submit that that brings the free enterprise system and the laws that this House should make into disrepute.</p> <p pid="a49.1/6">Sixty-one <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE">FTSE</a> 100 companies do not pay the living wage to their employees. The living wage was championed effectively by the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> when he was Mayor of London and by the former <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Osborne">George Osborne</a>. For those 61 companies, the average chief executive pay is just under &#163;4 million per year. The arguments for capitalism and free enterprise are under attack, as we shall see in the forthcoming <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a>. They need to be explained, defended and propagated. One of the ways in which we do that is by demonstrating fairness in the way that the system works.</p> <p pid="a49.1/7">Let me conclude on another point relating to one nation fairness. It has to do with homelessness. Led by our West Midlands Mayor, Andy Street, we are doing our best to eradicate this problem. Last Friday, our mayor was at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa">Aston Villa</a> with 130 people who slept out voluntarily to raise money to help to tackle the curse of rough sleeping. Throughout the west midlands, good progress has been made in offering rough sleepers accommodation: via Housing First we have got 94 people into accommodation&#8212;far more than the other two pilot areas have achieved. Housing First also provides the support that individuals need, including drug and alcohol programmes and mental health support. We all understand and know of the complexities involved. Progress is being made, but it is not just about money. The Government have been pretty generous, with &#163;100 million going towards the rough sleeping strategy. In <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_Coldfield">Sutton Coldfield</a>, we currently have four rough sleepers. We have two extremely well-run food banks that operate and help in a wider area than just the royal town. One man has been sleeping rough in our park for more than 20 years.</p> <p pid="a49.1/8">The reason I mention that is that I do not think any of us can sleep easy knowing about the extent of rough sleeping throughout Britain and in our cities. In November 2018, the count of rough sleepers in Birmingham stood at 91. That was an increase from the previous year and a big increase indeed since 2010. The number of new homeless is showing no signs of slowing. It is a complex and difficult problem and it is not just about finance and funding, but I hope that this good, one nation Queen&#8217;s Speech, which I strongly support, will not neglect this vulnerable cohort in our communities and will regard reversing this most unfortunate trend as a very high priority indeed.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a51.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <a href="/mp/?p=11115" title="Our page on Andrew Mitchell - 'the right hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell)'">Mr Mitchell</a>. I was in the Chamber 27 years ago when he seconded the Loyal Address&#8212;it was my first ever Gracious Speech. It is a tribute to him that, 27 years later, he is still quoted by those who ably proposed and seconded the Loyal Address today. I congratulate him on the longevity of that speech in 1992.</p> <p pid="a51.0/2">This Queen&#8217;s Speech is dominated by Brexit, but it also contains policy announcements on justice and policing. It also has some measures that even I, as a Labour Member, will welcome in due course, such as those on trophy hunting and on the restoration, potentially, of the devolved Government in Northern Ireland. It also, in my view, requires some additions, which I shall touch on briefly in a moment. It reminds me that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> appears to be running against what his own Government did over the previous 10 years, with his emphasis on increasing policing, increasing investment in education and increasing investment in health. The proof of that pudding will be very much in the eating, because what is on offer is really a counter-balance to the austerity that the Conservative Government have forced through&#8212;dare I say it with the help, in their first five years, from members of parties who now sit on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Benches.</p> <p pid="a51.0/3">None the less, the Queen&#8217;s Speech is dominated by Brexit, which is the Government&#8217;s first priority. The opening line of the Gracious Speech is that the Government&#8217;s priority has always been to secure the United Kingdom&#8217;s departure from the European Union on <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-31">31 October</phrase>. You will know, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, that the terms of that departure will potentially be set this week on 17 and <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-18">18 October</phrase> at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council">European Council</a>. Government Members have said that we on the Opposition Benches should vote for a deal. I confess that, as of today, which is five days before we are expected to vote on a deal in a Saturday sitting, we have no clear idea of what that deal will be. We have no clear idea of what the terms of that deal could be, what the boundaries of that deal could be, and what impact that deal could have on my constituents who make cars, who make planes, who make paper, who export sheep products, who provide tourism and who require safety and security through policing and through support of international agreements on security.</p> <p pid="a51.0/4">I say to those sitting on the Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> that, first and foremost, I voted to trigger article 50. I stood on a manifesto that said that we would respect the referendum, but in the 2017 <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a>, which was  called not by me, but by <a href="/mp/?p=10426" title="Our page on Theresa May - 'the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)'">Mrs May</a>, who wanted a mandate to force through her form of Brexit, I made commitments to things which I still do not know will be in the agreement that comes before us on Saturday. I stood on a manifesto that was against no deal, and I have voted against that. I stood on a manifesto, which, in my terms as a representative in Wales, was for a customs union and for a single market. I do not yet know what the outcome of those discussions are.</p> <p pid="a51.0/5">I cannot say whether I will vote for the deal on Saturday, because we do not know what it is. I have to ask whether it is going to be better, because the Ministers in the Gracious Speech today have said that they will implement new regimes for fisheries, for agriculture, for trade and for opportunities arising from the European Union once we have left. Again, I do not know what those opportunities will be, but I have seen some adverts on the television this week that tell me that, on <phrase class="date" code="2019-11-01">1 November</phrase>, if we go ahead with any form of deal&#8212;or no deal&#8212;that the Government are proposing, I will have to check whether my healthcare is still valid in Europe; check whether and how I can send goods to Europe from businesses in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>; check my insurance on travel, because it will not be valid in the great new world that we face; and check whether I can still drive in the European Union after <phrase class="date" code="2019-11-01">1 November</phrase>.</p> <p pid="a51.0/6">I still do not know about any of those things or whether we will have something positive or negative at the end of this week. None of that was on the bus when it came driving through the United Kingdom on <phrase class="date" code="2019-06-23">23 June</phrase> 2016. We still have no details in the document that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Lancaster">Duchy of Lancaster</a> produced last week on what will happen to the European arrest warrant, what will happen to European policing co-operation, and what will happen to the second generation <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Information_System">Schengen Information System</a>, under which we exchange information about paedophiles, criminal gangs, and drug abusers. As a former Policing <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and a former Justice Minister, I cannot vote for anything when I do not yet know whether we have police co-operation and international co-operation on preventing drug trafficking, child pornography and child abuse. I do not know whether we have that yet, and I hope that during the course of this debate we can get some clarity on that so that we know what we might be asked to vote for on Saturday.</p> <p pid="a51.0/7">It also strikes me that the farmers in my constituency who currently export sheep to Europe do not yet know whether they will face a 40% tariff. Vehicle manufacturers at Toyota and Vauxhall at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellesmere_Port">Ellesmere Port</a>&#8212;employing thousands of people in my constituency&#8212;do not yet know what the tariff regime will be or what form it will take, and neither do the aircraft manufacturers at Airbus. There should therefore be a real sense of urgency on the Government&#8217;s part to pull together what we might be voting on. I have already voted for some forms of the deal that the Government have brought forward; I have also voted against some forms of the deal. But right now we have no clarity on what the deal presented to us on Saturday might be.</p> <p pid="a51.0/8">It strikes me that the only way in which we are ultimately going to be able to bring this together is to settle on a deal&#8212;whatever it might be&#8212;and then to put that deal back to the people so that they can decide through a confirmatory vote whether to support whatever deal comes before Parliament. As I have done in the past,  I will support a confirmatory vote in due course. I hope we can find a way to bring a deal back so that people can see what Brexit means, because even now&#8212;four days from a vote&#8212;we do not yet know what it means in practice.</p> <p pid="a51.0/9"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen">The Queen</a>&#8217;s Speech is not all about Brexit. There are some measures regarding violent offenders. The question for me is: what has happened to the excellent work that was being done by the former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Secretary">Justice Secretary</a>, <a href="/mp/?p=11633" title="Our page on David Gauke - 'the right hon. Member for South West Hertfordshire (Mr Gauke)'">Mr Gauke</a>, who was talking about trying to abolish sentences of six months or less because they can cause people to struggle? Many people need clarity about how the Government are approaching the question of sentencing, because the Queen&#8217;s Speech seems to include sentence inflation for serious offences, which we can debate and discuss in due course, but we have no statement about what is going to happen to people who are being imprisoned for less than six months on a regular basis. In such situations, there is no opportunity to intervene in offenders&#8217; behaviour or to turn their lives around, and we do not have the potential to make an impact on them through the prison system.</p> <p pid="a51.0/10">I would like to look in more detail at&#8212;but will probably welcome&#8212;the police covenant proposal that is included in the Gracious Speech. I met representatives of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Federation">Police Federation</a> at the Labour party conference in Brighton this year, and they were very keen on the police covenant. We want that to happen and I can give Ministers cross-party support on that measure. We can also give Ministers cross-party support on replacing lost police officer numbers. The key test of that pledge is whether and how those police officers are going to be recruited, and over what period. There are questions to be answered such as how many police officers we are losing and how many we need to recruit to replace the 21,000 officers removed by this Government since I was the Policing Minister exactly 10 years ago, when there were lower levels of crime, including violent crime, more police officers, more security and more resolution of community issues than now. Over this 10-year period, violent crime has risen and crime has been more damaging. The sudden realisation that those police officers are needed is welcome, but we need to see how the plan will be delivered.</p> <p pid="a51.0/11">I welcome Helen&#8217;s law, which will mean that murderers who have been concealing the location of their victim&#8217;s body will not be allowed to leave prison until they reveal that location. That is fair and proper, and I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25423" title="Our page on Conor McGinn - 'the Member for St Helens North (Conor McGinn)'">Conor McGinn</a> for driving that measure forward.</p> <p pid="a51.0/12">I welcome the measures on trophy hunting. Again, we want to look at the details, but it is appalling that people can go on holiday to shoot tigers, leopards, lions, giraffes and a whole range of other animals, with no impunity. Stopping the import of materials resulting from trophy hunting is a very welcome proposal. I want to look at the details to see how UK citizens who are taking part in trophy hunting will be restricted in bringing back trophy-hunted animal parts to the United Kingdom.</p> <p pid="a51.0/13">I welcome the potential restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland, which is also key to the whole settlement of the Brexit issue. The helpful explanatory notes to the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill, which we need to return to in due course, state that we are going to:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a51.0/14" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Clarify the immigration status of Irish citizens once the free movement migration framework is repealed. This means Irish citizens will generally not require leave to enter or remain in the UK.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a51.0/15">I question what the word &#8220;generally&#8221; means, because the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday">Good Friday</a> agreement, and the work I did as a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Minister">Northern Ireland Minister</a>, meant that people can identify as British or Irish, feel comfortable in that, and move around the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_and_Ireland">United Kingdom and Ireland</a> based on their identification. I worry about what &#8220;generally&#8221; actually means in practice.</p> <p pid="a51.0/16">I welcome the potential of some of the issues in the national infrastructure plan. We have a north Wales growth deal, as the Minister will know from when he briefly but successfully navigated his role in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales_Office">Wales Office</a> until he moved to his new position. I am sure he misses the Wales Office tremendously. I hope that he will be able to secure the north Wales growth deal as part of the national infrastructure plan as a matter of some urgency.</p> <p pid="a51.0/17">I want to finish on two issues that I had wanted to be included in the Gracious Speech. With regard to the forthcoming violent crime reduction Bill, the Minister and the House will know that there is severe concern about attacks on shop workers in their place of work. About 115 shop workers per day are attacked in the course of preventing shoplifting and upholding legislation on alcohol, tobacco and solvent sales&#8212;and now on knife and acid sales. Those shop workers are upholding the <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> that we have passed in this House, and yet they have limited protection from this House accordingly. I am pleased that my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10594" title="Our page on Gareth Thomas - 'the Member for Harrow West (Gareth Thomas)'">Gareth Thomas</a> is here because, as a member of the Co-operative party, I know that it has pushed very hard for action on support for shop staff, as has my own <a href="/glossary/?gl=226" title="A group of workers who have united to promote their common interests." class="glossary">trade union</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USDAW">USDAW</a>. We secured from the Government a consultation that has been ongoing and is now closed. When the Under-<a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Department">Home Department</a>, <a href="/mp/?p=25424" title="Our page on Victoria Atkins - 'the hon. Member for Louth and Horncastle (Victoria Atkins)'">Victoria Atkins</a>, had responsibility for the issue of attacks on shop staff, she undertook to report back on the consultation by the end of November. I hope that the current Policing Minister will do so and that there will be outcomes from it that give protection to shop staff in their daily lives.</p> <p pid="a51.0/18">I hope that when the violent crime Bill is brought before the House, there will be an opportunity for action to be taken on protecting shop staff by giving greater support to measures that will discourage violence against them and ensuring that they live free from fear about their daily workplace. It is very important that we do that. There is certainly cross-party support in this House, but also from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Retail_Consortium">British Retail Consortium</a>, the National Federation of Retail Newsagents, USDAW, the Co-operative Group, and small supermarkets and stores right across the board. Nobody apart from the current Government has resisted the potential for action on this. I hope that the consultation that the Government have undertaken will prove fruitful, but I want to see it come back before Christmas, as promised.</p> <p pid="a51.0/19">My final point is about air weapons safety, on which I know there is a range of views in the House. In December 2017, the Government launched a review on the use and control of air weapons. I have an interest in that, because constituents of mine have been killed accidentally by the use of an air weapon when a lockable <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">cabinet</a> or a safety lock would have made a real difference to the safety of that weapon. That is one of the facets of the consultation. The consultation commenced on   <phrase class="date" code="2019-12-12">12 December</phrase> 2017. It closed on <phrase class="date" code="2019-02-06">6 February</phrase> 2018. It is now <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-14">14 October</phrase> 2019, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> has still not responded to the consultation on air weapons safety. My plea to Ministers is to conclude that consultation. I do not mind what Ministers say on that, but there is an opportunity to conclude the consultation. Constituents of mine have invested time and energy in putting points to the consultation, which is about the loss of their loved ones, to find that no response has been given to date. I want the Government to produce the consultation response. If they want to introduce measures on producing better airgun safety, such as requiring that airguns are kept in lockable cabinets, that could be done in the serious violence Bill. It could be done as part of the Home Office Christmas tree Bill, which we know will be in any Session, subject to any general election that occurs. My plea is for clarity on the outcome of the consultation, so that it can form part of legislation.</p> <p pid="a51.0/20">In conclusion, can the Minister give us some idea of what is happening on Saturday, and can he give us some idea of what is happening with the consultations on shop staff attacks and on airguns? Let us work together on areas where we have co-operation, including trophy hunting and infrastructure plans. Let us fight at some point the battle about the wider political discussion that the right hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_Coldfield">Sutton Coldfield</a> touched on, about capitalism versus Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> in an active, positive society. I believe that Government intervention and government is a force for good. It has given me the health service and health in life. It has given me education in life. It has given my family security of housing in life. It has given opportunities to millions of people across this country. An active Government who take a role in the future is what I seek in a future <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a>, whenever the election comes.</p>            </div>

Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)'">Jo Swinson</a>, the leader of the Liberal Democrat party, talked about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy_Ashdown">Paddy Ashdown</a>, our former colleague. He was one of the people who, in part, worked for my father in Geneva in the 1970s, and he is an example of why it is wrong to say that people who come into Parliament cannot do anything else.</p> <p pid="a55.0/2">There are many people who did many things before they came into Parliament, whether with domestic responsibilities or in professional or voluntary work, and there are many who do the same thing again when they leave. We ought to look on our debates in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> as a way of recruiting many others to stand for election and make contributions here.</p> <p pid="a55.0/3">Our contributions in this place are often about justice as much as law, and those two come together in the Queen&#8217;s Speech in leasehold reform. The Government have said that they want to enshrine it in law that ground rents should be zero and that houses should not be sold unnecessarily as leasehold. That is a start, but a great deal more needs to be done.</p> <p pid="a55.0/4">Leasehold reform was accepted as a key element in the findings of the Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> &#8220;Fixing our broken housing market&#8221;. That <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper">White Paper</a> produced a number of consultations, all of which accept the urgent  need for reform. We have been seeing leaseholders abused over the last 10 to 20 years, partly by mistake, partly by crooks and&#8212; too often, in the last 10 years&#8212;by ordinary commercial organisations that realise they can stuff their own pockets and those of their shareholders by exploiting the weakness of individuals, whether under Help to Buy or in other ways. I am grateful for the commitments made by Government on that.</p> <p pid="a55.0/5">The Government have accepted <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Best">Lord Best</a>&#8217;s report recommending statutory regulation of managing agents. They have asked and funded the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Commission">Law Commission</a> to undertake a major review of leasehold and commonhold law. The Government have tasked officials in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Housing,_Communities_and_Local_Government">Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government</a> with supervising that work and asked them to carry out their own work on leasehold reform. Earlier this year, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing,_Communities_and_Local_Government_Committee">Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee</a>, led by <a href="/mp/?p=10045" title="Our page on Clive Betts - 'the hon. Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts)'">Mr Betts</a>, produced an amazing report&#8212;as I have said before, it is one of the best <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> reports I have read in my time here&#8212;urging the Government to do even more.</p> <p pid="a55.0/6">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_and_Markets_Authority">Competition and Markets Authority</a> is, with a bit of encouragement, currently considering a potential investigation of major mis-selling activities by developers. I ask the Government to assure us that the reforms that have been considered over a number of years will now come forward. We have the chance to make big progress. It is in a bipartisan area, and it will make a difference to many of the people who live in the 5 million to 6 million leasehold homes&#8212;that might be 10 million people, which is a very high proportion of our electorate, to whom we are responsible.</p> <p pid="a55.0/7">I declare, as a matter of form, that I am a leaseholder in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>. We and five others bought the freehold. We had a good freeholder and a good managing agent. Separately, in about three years&#8217; time, I expect to buy a leasehold flat somewhere near here. I say that to avoid people thinking that I am serving my own interest.</p> <p pid="a55.0/8">I want to turn to two other issues, both relating to justice. The first is the case of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna_Maharaj">Krishna Maharaj</a>, who is in his 80s and who was convicted more than 20 years ago of two murders in Florida that he did not commit. I will then turn to the case of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurpal_Virdi">Gurpal Virdi</a>, a Sikh former Metropolitan police sergeant who is still seeking justice for the way in which he was treated and prosecuted&#8212;unsuccessfully, obviously&#8212;for indecent assault.</p> <p pid="a55.0/9">Before that, I do not think one should totally ignore the contribution of the leader of the Scottish National party, <a href="/mp/?p=25361" title="Our page on Ian Blackford - 'the right hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Ian Blackford)'">Ian Blackford</a>, who keeps saying interesting things, often very loudly, and then drops his voice and says we should all be very calm in this place. I say calmly to the SNP that, if we are talking about elections, let us remember what happened in the 2017 election compared with that in 2015. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scottish_National">The Scottish National</a> party&#8217;s share of the vote went down from 50% to about 37%, while the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a>&#8217; national share went up from about 37% to about 42%. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_SNP">The SNP</a> always floats the idea that it has a <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a>, but that did not happen last time and I hope it does not happen next time.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a57.1/1">I could have said that as well, and as gently too, but it is also worth remembering that having a greater number of seats does not mean that those Members speak for all the people in Scotland. I think they will accept that getting 37% means that other parties got 63%, and they deserve to talk, if not shout, as much as the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s party.</p> <p pid="a57.1/2">I first met <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna_Maharaj">Krishna Maharaj</a> in a Florida jail 22 years ago. It was two days after the funeral of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Diana">Princess Diana</a>, which is why I remember the date. He was said to have killed two people. There was no evidence that he had done so. The investigation was clearly wrong, and the work of Benedict Kuehne and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Stafford_Smith">Clive Stafford Smith</a> of Reprieve has now proved that beyond reasonable doubt.</p> <p pid="a57.1/3">In fact, a magistrate in Florida has concluded that there is an at least 87% chance that the conviction was totally wrong; 87% is seven out of eight, meaning that there is only a one in eight chance that the prosecution was justified. Clive Stafford Smith has done really well. For those who want to look it up, I refer them&#8212;I am afraid that this is a bit detailed&#8212;to case No. 17-21965-<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIV">CIV</a>-Martinez/Otazo-Reyes of the United States district court of the southern district of Florida. The petitioner was Krishna Maharaj and the responder was Mark S. Inch, secretary of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Department_of_Corrections">Florida Department of Corrections</a>. It was submitted by Benedict Kuehne and Clive Stafford Smith, and delivered on <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-07">7 October</phrase> 2019.</p> <p pid="a57.1/4">On behalf of someone who is in 80s and has been in jail unnecessarily and wrongly for more than 20 years, I ask the Florida state to stop going for delay after delay. For someone of that age who has suffered an obvious injustice, the case should be reheard as soon as possible, and Krishna Maharaj should be released. He is British. He is from Trinidad. The whole saga is in Clive Stafford Smith&#8217;s book. Following the magistrate&#8217;s decision, I ask our American friends to ensure that the Florida authorities re-examine the case in court and then this injustice can be ended.</p> <p pid="a57.1/5">Krishna Maharaj&#8217;s case reminds me of the days when I used to talk more often on such subjects. About seven times a year we would discover that people had been convicted in this country of murders that they either could not have committed or where the conviction was not safe. Some of those cases involved <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRA">IRA</a> attacks. Sometimes the authorities go too far.</p> <p pid="a57.1/6">I strongly support criminal justice reform and the need to ensure that the police can do their job more easily, more effectively and more openly. I pay tribute to the Metropolitan police and to members of the police services of other parts of the country who have come together in the past week or so to deal with the street campers and protestors in London.</p> <p pid="a57.1/7">I was surprised to discover that the so-called <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_Rebellion">Extinction Rebellion</a> had so much money that it could provide up to &#163;400 a week in expenses to people who are ruining the lives of others trying to get to work in the capital city and earning less than &#163;400 a week.</p> <p pid="a57.1/8">Given the selfishness and, if I may say so, foolishness of those who think it is a good game to take a holiday or receive expenses to come down to London and spread  around lots of nylon and plastic tents, most of which seem to get abandoned as though it is the Glastonbury festival, I think they ought to look themselves in the mirror and ask, &#8220;Are we doing the right thing in the right way?&#8221; I would argue that they are not. When I asked a number of them one evening, &#8220;Which <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20">G20</a> country has done more than this country?&#8221; none of them volunteered the name of another major country.</p> <p pid="a57.1/9">I will give the police all the support I can as they work with councils and schools to eradicate the rash of adolescent violence in some of our seaside towns. Young people should be involved in worthwhile activities. They should not be going around in gangs. When they start going astray, they ought to be caught and redirected to ways in which they can actually make something of their lives. Just because someone&#8217;s family has a bad past is not an excuse for them to have a bad future. We need to turn people&#8217;s lives around, and that is what I think justice should be.</p> <p pid="a57.1/10"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurpal_Virdi">Gurpal Virdi</a> has been a friend of mine for about 30 years. I will not go through his previous experiences, but he is one of the very few minority ethnic officers who has actually got through to full retirement with the Metropolitan police. He was once fired for allegedly sending himself a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Front">National Front</a> leaflet saying that black and Asian people were not wanted in the police. That got resolved in his favour. I was there when <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Hogan-Howe">Bernard Hogan-Howe</a> presented him with an award for exemplary conduct.</p> <p pid="a57.1/11">Following an attack similar to that on my constituent Stephen Lawrence, Gurpal Virdi left his police station in Ealing, found two of the attackers and the attack weapon, and went to see the family to give them information and comfort. After he retired, he did various things voluntarily and for money. Importantly, he stood as a Labour candidate and was mentored by the present Mayor of London, whom I suggest should get in touch with him to give him the support he should have given him all the way through.</p> <p pid="a57.1/12">Gurpal Virdi was told that he was being charged with indecent assault, with an extendable truncheon, on someone under the age of 16. The police investigation was not done by the historical sexual offences group; it was passed to the directorate of professional standards, which had been at fault in some of his other disputes with the police.</p> <p pid="a57.1/13">The one thing it knew all the way along was that extendable truncheons, which the complainant was certain had been shoved up his bottom, were not made available until 10 years later. The police statements from others then serving in Battersea said that they had not seen one until 1997, and the alleged offence took place in 1986.</p> <p pid="a57.1/14">Every single statement of so-called fact by the complainant was contradicted by the only serious witness put forward by the police. The fact that the event did not happen, that the witness was not there and that Gurpal Virdi was not involved can be viewed as side issues, because the statements made by the so-called witness contradicted what the so-called complainant said in his so-called claim.</p> <p pid="a57.1/15">It was also known that Gurpal Virdi had arrested this complainant five months later in the company of another named officer. The only known records were the identity of the officer in charge who had arrested the complainant in November 1986; that Gurpal Virdi and another officer  had arrested him in March the following year when there was a warrant out for him; and that the police knew that Gurpal Virdi had taken the complainant&#8217;s fingerprints in March 1987. That was not disclosed on time to the defence. The officer who was with Gurpal Virdi in March &#8217;87 was not interviewed. The police officer who was in charge in November &#8217;86 did not put a statement to court; we heard later that he had said that he could not remember anything about the incident, which had probably been only a simple arrest, as used to happen. When Gurpal Virdi asked the then <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Police_Complaints_Commission">Independent Police Complaints Commission</a> to look into the matter, it was passed on to the Metropolitan police, who passed it to the department of professional standards&#8212;the investigator into whose conduct the Met was supposed to be looking. The department said that it had done everything right. I say that it did everything wrong, and I ask the new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Office_for_Police_Conduct">Independent Office for Police Conduct</a>, if it has the powers, to form its own investigation. I ask the inspectorate of police to do that, too.</p> <p pid="a57.1/16">I conclude by saying this. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Midland">Operation Midland</a>, into what &#8220;Nick&#8221;&#8212;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Beech">Carl Beech</a>&#8212;said, is going to be reviewing a number of things. I ask for two things. One is that Ministers and the Metropolitan police consider getting someone such as Sir Richard Henriques to give a week to looking at the Virdi case&#8212;it would not take more than that.</p> <p pid="a57.1/17">I then ask the review of Operation Midland to look into Operation Gianna and ask especially how the gold group, the supervising group in the Metropolitan police&#8212;I think it went from the deputy commissioner all the way down&#8212;managed to overlook every single bit of evidence showing that Gurpal Virdi was innocent. He should not have been charged. There should have been a proper investigation, and he should have been exonerated.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a59.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <a href="/mp/?p=10057" title="Our page on Peter Bottomley - 'the hon. Member for Worthing West (Sir Peter Bottomley)'">Sir Peter Bottomley</a>. Let me be the latest Member to congratulate him on his long-running leadership of the campaign for leasehold reform; I am thinking of my constituents who have had to suffer from the mismanagement of their leasehold arrangements by Redrow and Persimmon. The hon. Gentleman&#8217;s case for more substantive leasehold reform is well made, and I hope that there will be urgent action on that. As a Member of the Co-operative party as well as the Labour party, I have always supported the principle of commonhold. However, I recognise that we have much to do to establish commonhold as the norm in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales">England and Wales</a>. I hope that reforms will allow that to happen.</p> <p pid="a59.0/2">I want to concentrate my remarks on the state of our public services and on Brexit. As a proud Co-op MP, I am disappointed, but not entirely surprised, to see once again nothing in a Queen&#8217;s Speech about how the Government might want to help the co-operative movement expand. There is nothing to help energy co-operatives expand to grow the usage of renewable energy still further, which is essential if we are to get our emissions down quicker. There is nothing to help housing co-operatives expand to tackle the housing crisis, particularly, but not exclusively, in London. There is nothing to help co-operative schools either.</p> <p pid="a59.0/3">I share the disappointment of the co-op movement that there is no commitment in the Queen&#8217;s Speech to bring forward as a matter of urgency legislation to reform the rules on credit unions. The Government know that there is a growing consensus within the credit union movement on what needs to happen to release credit unions from some of the red tape that holds back their expansion, yet there is no commitment to legislate on that. Some of the legislation that governs other forms of co-operatives dates from the Victorian era and needs to be modernised. Work by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Commission">Law Commission</a> and a commitment to legislate for reform would have been timely.</p> <p pid="a59.0/4">It is the biggest co-op businesses that struggle on occasion to get access to the level of capital that they need to expand, and that is where there is the most urgent need for Government legislation. Withdrawable shares could help the biggest co-ops, such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-op_Group">Co-op Group</a>, to expand and go to the capital markets without their co-operative status being threatened. Such legislation has been successfully introduced in Australia, and I hope that the Treasury will move forward on this issue in the next 12 months.</p> <p pid="a59.0/5">As my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10259" title="Our page on David Hanson - 'the Member for Delyn (David Hanson)'">David Hanson</a> set out, the Co-operative party has long supported action to reduce violence against shop workers; his leadership of the effort to get the Government to legislate has been notable. I add my voice to his in hoping that we will see significant Government movement on that very soon.</p> <p pid="a59.0/6">It feels as if there is nothing in this programme suggesting that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Secretary">Health Secretary</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Secretary">Education Secretary</a> or the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a> truly have a plan to tackle the crisis in our public services. The crisis in the national health service and social care facing my constituents is the most urgent issue that I want to address. The three major hospitals serving my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> are all either directly in crisis or clearly exhibiting signs of the huge pressures that they are under. Alternatives to acute care in my constituency and the neighbouring ones are being closed. Three walk-in centres have either closed or are being closed. Primary care in my constituency is under growing strain. GP surgeries report increasing difficulties in recruiting staff, and the users of those surgeries report increasing difficulty in getting appointments. The clinical commissioning group and the trust are millions of pounds in the red and have often been in the red in the past. Nothing suggests that the deficits that they have at the moment are likely to get significantly better in the coming years.</p> <p pid="a59.0/7">I turn to something that many on these&#8212;and, I suspect, the Government&#8212;Benches will recognise. Years ago our local council had to give up providing social care to all but the most chronically in need. It is fair to say that they are struggling even to do that successfully, given the shortage of funding in local government. In May, an independent inquiry by clinical experts ruled that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Vernon_Hospital">Mount Vernon Hospital</a>, one of the three that serves my constituency, can no longer operate safely&#8212;that it is unviable and cannot maintain the safety of its patients. It is a 117-year-old cancer hospital. It is so dilapidated and short of doctors and nurses that it cannot provide modern cancer care or even basic elements of treatment, such as consultants undertaking daily ward rounds, new inpatients being reviewed within 14 hours of arrival, or rapid access to diagnostic testing and results.</p> <p pid="a59.0/8">It is the first time in the history of the national health service that a major facility, specialising in this country&#8217;s biggest disease&#8212;cancer&#8212;now poses a direct risk to patients and has been declared unfit for purpose. It was therefore astonishing that when the Health Secretary recently announced funding for building six hospitals and for work on a bunch of other hospitals, Mount Vernon Hospital was not included in the mix. I hope that we will shortly hear some sense of a plan for investment in Mount Vernon Hospital to keep the hugely valued cancer facilities there, which until now have been hugely successful. There is a huge affinity with the hospital and its staff, and it urgently needs the Government to show it a little care and attention.</p> <p pid="a59.0/9"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Middlesex_Hospital">Central Middlesex Hospital</a> serves my constituents in part and it also needs a little love and attention from the Government. Only 10 years ago, after considerable investment, it was being marked out as the future for the NHS&#8212;a hospital able to get people in and out very quickly. Ten years on, its accident and emergency department has closed&#8212;permanently, some five years ago&#8212;and now its urgent treatment centre has closed at nights. Many in its vicinity worry about what is coming next.</p> <p pid="a59.0/10">The major acute hospital serving my constituency is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwick_Park_Hospital">Northwick Park Hospital</a>, which is under huge pressure. Northwick Park hospital last met the four-hour accident and emergency target&#8212;95% of attendance lasting no longer than four hours&#8212;over five years ago, in August 2014. For the first half of this year, from April to September, demand for A&amp;E services was up again, by 4%, which is vastly higher than the average of 0.2% across the rest of London. Occupancy rates for bed usage across the trust are above the national average. Staff vacancy rates appear to be significantly above the national average too, at almost 20% for medical staff and over 13% for nursing staff. Porters, cleaners and caterers, who do such essential jobs, are being paid less than the London living wage, while the chief executive of company they work for, Medirest, has a salary of over &#163;1 million. It is hardly surprising that the staff should be contemplating industrial action.</p> <p pid="a59.0/11">It is, however, the scale of backlog maintenance at Northwick Park that particularly bears highlighting. According to its risk register, over &#163;38 million is needed to tackle the high and significant risks that have been identified around the Northwick Park estate.</p> <p pid="a59.0/12">Some seven years ago, Ministers and Conservative <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a> decided to use north-west London as a health experiment and brought forward a document, &#8220;Shaping a Healthier Future&#8221;. Over six years, it set out to close a number of A&amp;E departments and spent over &#163;75 million on consultants. This was going to be the way in which other services, including those that serve my constituency such as Northwick Park, were going to see additional investment. No additional investment has been forthcoming. After huge campaigns, two of the four A&amp;E departments that Ministers wanted to shut, Ealing and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charing_Cross">Charing Cross</a>, have been saved. However, Hammersmith and, as I alluded to earlier, Central Middlesex, have closed. It is difficult to see what has been achieved to make things better for my constituents directly, other than increasing demand on our acute hospital.</p> <p pid="a59.0/13">To be fair, some of the original analysis in the &#8220;Shaping a Healthier Future&#8221; programme was prescient, even if the resulting strategy was deeply flawed. We have a  significantly growing population. There are huge health inequalities in our area. We have an ageing population and modern lifestyles are exacerbating some of the care needs that my constituents face. &#8220;Shaping a Healthier Future&#8221; did set out a need for significant new investment and a bid for over &#163;500 million was submitted to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_and_Social_Care">Department of Health and Social Care</a> and the Treasury last year. Included in that were efforts to tackle the maintenance backlog across all the hospitals in north-west London, including Northwick Park, which serves my constituency. That bid was rejected last summer and, so far, nothing has been brought forward in terms of significant new moneys to tackle the issues that &#8220;Shaping a Healthier Future&#8221; originally identified.</p> <p pid="a59.0/14">Seven years ago, the authors of that document were a little prescient in that they wrote:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a59.0/15" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Unless things change, we predict that most hospitals in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NW">NW</a> London will end up in financial difficulties.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a59.0/16">That has certainly been proved right for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_and_Harrow">Brent and Harrow</a>. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_North_West_University_Healthcare_NHS_Trust">London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust</a>, which runs Central Middlesex and Northwick Park hospitals, is over &#163;30 million in the red. Harrow clinical commissioning group, which serves my constituents, is over &#163;40 million in deficit. It has been in deficit since it was first set up and no one expects that to change anytime soon unless there were to be, as there should be, a significant increase in funding for the NHS. What is even more worrying is that London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust, to try to reduce the scale of its deficit, had to sell off land owned by the NHS.</p> <p pid="a59.0/17">The particular issue that my constituents have noticed in the crisis in NHS care is the closure of walk-in centres. In November last year, Alexandra Avenue walk-in centre closed. It had been open from 8 am to 8 pm, 365 days a year, allowing people in my constituency to walk in off the streets and see a nurse or a doctor usually within 15 or 20 minutes. Belmont walk-in centre, which serves the constituency of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_East">Harrow East</a> primarily as well as some of my constituents in Wealdstone, is set to close at the beginning of next month. The Pinn medical centre, which serves the northern part of my constituency but is located in Pinner, Ruislip and Northwood, is being earmarked for closure, too. There is a funding crisis in the NHS and it needs to be sorted as a matter of urgency, in particular in my constituency.</p> <p pid="a59.0/18">It is now seven years since we had a police force in Harrow that was recognisably up to the task of tackling violent crime and antisocial behaviour. Then, we had a sergeant, two constables and three police community support officers in every ward of my constituency. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mayor_of_London">The Mayor of London</a> has done what he can do to make sure there are dedicated police constables and a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCSO">PCSO</a> in each ward, but &#163;1 million extra a year needs to go into the Metropolitan police budget if we are to be able to return to having dedicated neighbourhood, ward-based teams with sufficient officers to tackle crime.</p> <p pid="a59.0/19">I echo the concerns of other <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members about our future relationship with the European Union, which is the big issue dominating the Queen&#8217;s Speech. I am a pragmatic pro-European. As a <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> who went to Brussels on what sometimes felt like more than a regular basis, it was not always easy to feel passionate about the European Union. One saw it up close, warts and all. However, when one stands back from those occasional frustrations, the case for staying in the European  Union remains compelling: our economy is stronger, our security is enhanced and our influence on the world stage is much greater.</p> <p pid="a59.0/20">Following the referendum result, I voted to respect that result by triggering article 50 to allow formal negotiations to begin. However, every Brexit scenario advanced by the Conservative party suggests that our economy would be significantly poorer and our influence on the global stage much more limited. My right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn rightly alluded to the fact that until our future relationship with the European Union is resolved crucial elements of the security of our country remain very substantially at risk. To his list, I would add the issue of people smuggling. We have to co-operate across the European Union to tackle the gangs who try to transport people illegally into our country.</p> <p pid="a59.0/21">A no-deal Brexit is without question the worst of all the Brexit scenarios that have been advocated. One heard last week the statement by the president of Nissan that there may well not be a future for Nissan in the UK under a no-deal Brexit scenario. Manufacturers giving evidence to the International Trade Committee, on which I have the privilege to sit, set out the huge damage to the steel sector a no-deal Brexit would deliver. There is, perhaps, a compromise to be had. It requires the current occupant of No. 10 to be a little bolder in taking on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Research_Group">European Research Group</a> on his own Back Benches and to agree that any deal he negotiates must be put back to the British people. Then and only then should we have the election that I suspect we all want, on both sides of the House.</p> <p pid="a59.0/22">I agree with my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a> that this is an odd time to be having a Queen&#8217;s Speech. It does not answer any of the significant challenges facing our country and I look forward to opposing it next week.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a64.1/1">That was a faux pas on my part, but I think we got on pretty well. We share similar levels of stress and we just want the thing to be over.</p> <p pid="a64.1/2">I voted initially for us not to join the European Union. I voted for us to leave the European Union when we had the referendum, never thinking for a moment that we would have another referendum, and I was absolutely shocked at the result. No Liberal Democrat Members are in the Chamber at the moment, but I pay tribute to them because their view has been consistent. However, I do not see anything liberal or democratic about their policy.</p> <p pid="a64.1/3">I had the privilege of helping to chair the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill Committee. There was a first-class debate in the Chamber from Members on both sides of the House. Reflecting on that debate now, I simply do not understand why, when it came to the vote to trigger article 50, such a huge number of Members voted for that process. If we had not triggered the process, we would not be where we are now. Anyway, I hope that a miracle happens, Brexit is fixed and we leave the European Union on <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-31">31 October</phrase>.</p> <p pid="a64.1/4">The reason I like to speak on this particular day is that we can speak about anything, as a number of colleagues have demonstrated, but bizarrely, I will keep my remarks close to the Gracious Speech. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a> made an interesting speech, but I did not feel an atmosphere of good will. He seemed reluctant to say that he would support any of the measures. Surely in a broken Parliament, there are at least half a dozen measures that, cross-party, we could support. He said one particular thing that I agree with and I will come to that later.</p> <p pid="a64.1/5">The last Session was, of course, the longest parliamentary Session since the civil war. I attend business questions every Thursday. <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members said, &#8220;When are we going to get the Queen&#8217;s Speech?&#8221; Well, we have it, so it should be celebrated that we have a new Session. The point I am particularly interested in is the wonderful line about measures to be announced. Besides the 22 measures, there will be many more. As far as Brexit is concerned, I have given my view already. Even if I had a different view, I would follow what my constituents voted for in the referendum: 58% voted to leave and 42% voted to remain.</p> <p pid="a64.1/6">In terms of cross-party support, I would have thought that the Opposition could support the animal welfare measures. We recently had a debate about the Animal Welfare (Sentencing) Bill. It fell at <a href="/glossary/?gl=231" title="Prorogation takes the form of an announcement on behalf of the Queen by the..." class="glossary">Prorogation</a>, but it can be carried over, and everyone should be pleased that &#8220;dumb animals&#8221; will have protection if the legislation is carried. We will ban the imports of trophy-hunted animals and all the other barbaric practices whereby going on safari is advertised and when people get there, the animals are all caged up. How people can celebrate  standing on such a beautiful thing as an elephant or a rhinoceros, I do not understand, so the House should support those measures.</p> <p pid="a64.1/7">Over the years, we have spoken about <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> to recognise the sentience of animals. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> has been a global leader in this area for as long as I can remember, and I pay tribute to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Animal_Welfare_Foundation">Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation</a>, of which I am a patron. I am very glad that the Queen&#8217;s Speech suggests that we will do something about that issue.</p> <p pid="a64.1/8">I know that no <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> sums up this debate on the first day but, if we ever get to day six, I would like an answer to the question about pet passports. In terms of when we negotiate the withdrawal Bill, a number of my constituents have asked whether we are going to continue with the reciprocal arrangements, so that those remain in place for them when they take their dogs or cats abroad.</p> <p pid="a64.1/9">There is another point that the House should surely agree on. Only last week, we had a wonderful debate about the Domestic Abuse Bill, when the House was at its very best and we heard a number of splendid speeches. I am absolutely delighted that that Bill has been carried over. If we really are going to vote down the Queen&#8217;s Speech, it would be a great shame if that Bill is lost.</p> <p pid="a64.1/10">I was on the Health Committee for 10 years. You reach a point where you just go round and round in circles in the inquiries that are held, but I was really pleased that we announced in the Queen&#8217;s Speech that we would have an integrated care Bill. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_NHS">Our NHS</a> is a huge organisation. The treatment that we get from general practitioners, hospitals, pharmacists and other services is absolutely essential, but it is important that we have joined-up healthcare. I hope that that is what the Bill will mean, and it is certainly something that the Conservative party has been promising ever since we formed the coalition Government in 2010.</p> <p pid="a64.1/11">The morale of our staff who work in the NHS is very important. I am very glad that they have been given a reasonable pay rise. I visited my local hospital recently. Every single ward does a splendid job. I suppose that this will go down like a lead balloon, but I am going to pick out the Elizabeth Loury ward, which deals with particularly ill patients. I thought that the staff were absolutely amazing and when I went to congratulate them, a patient who was hooked up to all sorts of machines heard what I was saying and forced their way out to say, &#8220;I want to agree with you: they are doing an absolutely wonderful job.&#8221; I would have thought that all <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a> would agree that we should praise the work that they do. All this talk about the privatisation of the health service is absolute rubbish, as far as I am concerned.</p> <p pid="a64.1/12">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Nursing">Royal College of Nursing</a>&#8217;s staffing for safe and effective care campaign was brought to my attention at the recent Conservative party conference, and I am glad that the Queen&#8217;s Speech included matters relating to support for the NHS workforce, which the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCN">RCN</a> believes should be at the heart of Government policy.</p> <p pid="a64.1/13">Earlier this month we had another really good debate on women&#8217;s mental health, led by <a href="/mp/?p=25648" title="Our page on Wera Hobhouse - 'the hon. Member for Bath (Wera Hobhouse)'">Wera Hobhouse</a>, who is no longer <a href="/glossary/?gl=144" title="Of a female MP, sitting on her regular seat in the House. For males, &quot;in..." class="glossary">in her place</a>, with first-class contributions from colleagues. I think it was <a href="/mp/?p=24924" title="Our page on Luciana Berger - 'the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Luciana Berger)'">Luciana Berger</a>&#8212;she has recently joined the Liberal  Democrats&#8212;who said that we need more money for mental health services. We would all say amen to that, but it is a question of balance. In that debate, I spoke about two inspiring local women, Kelly Swain and Carla Cressy. Both those ladies run charities in my local area, and I know that access to Government funding would represent a significant boost to their organisations. I hope that we will look at how clinical commissioning groups and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_and_Social_Care">Department of Health and Social Care</a> can work together to ensure that money goes to small charities.</p> <p pid="a64.1/14">I said I agreed with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition">Leader of the Opposition</a> on one point, and that was Grenfell. We all remember waking up after the election and seeing the terrible scenes. <a href="/mp/?p=25706" title="Our page on Emma Dent Coad - 'The hon. Member for Kensington (Emma Dent Coad)'">Emma Dent Coad</a>, who was newly elected, made a fantastic speech, and we have had some very good debates. I am the chairman of the all-party parliamentary fire safety and rescue group, and I absolutely agree with the Leader of the Opposition that we should fit sprinklers retrospectively in high-rise buildings. No new school should be built without sprinklers being fitted, and I agreed with his point about new building safety standards. Following Dame Judith Hackitt&#8217;s review, it is important that the House gets behind the legislation, about which I hope to hear more detail.</p> <p pid="a64.1/15">At the recent Conservative party conference, I met the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Heart_Foundation">British Heart Foundation</a>, and the statistics it gave us on UK air pollution were truly shocking. From the reports that I have read, the environment Bill about which we have heard today will address not only poor air quality but the protection of landscapes and habitats. I am glad that my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=11500" title="Our page on Theresa Villiers - 'the Member for Chipping Barnet (Theresa Villiers)'">Theresa Villiers</a> is the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. We all know that to deliver a clean environment we must promote electric cars. I am surrounded on these Benches by experts in the technology of electric cars. I am no expert, but I now understand much more about hybrid cars than I did. At the conference, I met representatives of the industry who mentioned serious concerns about the lack of charging points available across the country, with just one charging point in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, and a total of five in the whole of Southend. It is essential that the infrastructure legislation that will be introduced improves that.</p> <p pid="a64.1/16">My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10057" title="Our page on Peter Bottomley - 'the Member for Worthing West (Sir Peter Bottomley)'">Sir Peter Bottomley</a> mentioned <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_Rebellion">Extinction Rebellion</a>. I do not want to be a hypocrite about this. I collected my tree, as did a huge number of colleagues. I got a beech tree, which will be used for hedging. Umpteen people locally would like more trees. I promised the chap who gave me the tree that I would mention his opinion that, while what the Government are doing at the moment with tree-planting programmes is good, we need to plant billions of trees. Quite where billions of trees could be put, I do not know. All I would say is that in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southend_West">Southend West</a> we have an active tree-planting campaign, and I am sure there is plenty of space in Scotland to plant even more trees.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a67.0/1">I eat my words. If my hon. Friend has room for 70,000 trees in Chelmsford, perhaps we have a bit more room in Southend, although we are a bit restricted by the Thames estuary. I will look at that with the local authority. Even though the protests were controversial, I thought the tree planting thing was worth while.</p> <p pid="a67.0/2">I recently had a meeting with the excellent new Exchequer Secretary about the cost of vehicle excise duty, and I was joined by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Caravan_Council">National Caravan Council</a> and the Caravan and Motorhome Club. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Members">All Members</a> have caravan and motorhome owners in their constituencies. Recent changes have meant a 705% increase in vehicle excise duty on those vehicles, which I think is totally unfair. It is meant as an incentive for owners to buy alternative products, but they are not available at the moment. Many of the owners are of modest means. They have saved diligently to enjoy their retirement and they cannot afford an extra &#163;2,000. I am delighted that we will have a Budget on <phrase class="date" code="2019-11-06">6 November</phrase> and I hope that we can do the trick there.</p> <p pid="a67.0/3">I am glad about the announcements on law and order in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracious_Address">Gracious Address</a>. I have always thought that the number of people in prison should not be a badge of honour. The fewer people in prison the better, and the present situation just shows that prison does not work. Prison should be for the most violent offenders, and I hope that we can get the balance right.</p> <p pid="a67.0/4">On the subject of law and order, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Proctor">Harvey Proctor</a> was my predecessor in Basildon and a near neighbour. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Heath">Ted Heath</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Brittan">Leon Brittan</a> were also colleagues, and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Bramall">Lord Bramall</a> was a Member in the Lords. I know Harvey Proctor very well, and his life has been destroyed and broken. He has lost everything. When he had to leave Parliament, he only survived because half a dozen colleagues had a whip-round and set him up in a shirt shop. What has been done to his life is a disgrace. I hope that he gets compensation as quickly as possible and that the conduct of that case is carefully considered.</p> <p pid="a67.0/5">I am pleased about education: with our excellent <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for School Standards, the minimum level of funding per pupil for secondary schools is up to &#163;5,000 and &#163;4,000 for primary schools. I was lobbied by the musicians&#8217; passport campaign, and I ask the Government to agree to introduce touring visas for musicians and other creatives. A constituent raised with me the issue of blue badges, and whether they will be reciprocal when we leave the European Union.</p> <p pid="a67.0/6">If I was disappointed by any element of the Queen&#8217;s Speech, it was the lack of a sentence about Southend becoming a city. There was a big moment for me on <phrase class="date" code="2019-07-25">25 July</phrase>, because the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> said at the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> that Southend could become a city. I will hold him to that. I have already had a letter from a Minister saying that we need some sort of royal event to hold a city contest. Well, the Duke of Edinburgh is coming up to 100, so we could make that the reason, and the Queen will soon be the longest reigning monarch anywhere in the world. It was a splendid Queen&#8217;s Speech, and I am just so glad that Southend will become a city next year on the centenary of our mayoralty.</p>            </div>

It was nothing more than an expensive distraction from the shambles that is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson">Boris Johnson</a>&#8217;s premiership. While I am more than happy to pay tribute to the hon.

Perhaps a more apt choice of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a> lyric than &#8220;Don&#8217;t stop thinking about tomorrow&#8221; would have been &#8220;Chain, keep us together&#8221;, because that is what they are hoping for. The fact is that, despite the pomp and ceremony, none of the announced <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> will be implemented before a <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a>, and I think that the Government know that.</p> <p pid="a68.0/3"><a href="/mp/?p=10133" title="Our page on Jeremy Corbyn - 'The right hon.

We have been espousing those policies for the best part of five years, and it is good that he has finally caught up with our programme. It was good of the SNP to help him out by writing his manifesto; I know that he needs a bit of inspiration.</p> <p pid="a68.0/4">Sadly, the Queen&#8217;s Speech cannot be delivered by this Government. In their current form, they would be lucky to do so. <a href="/mp/?p=10009" title="Our page on Sir David Amess - 'The hon. Member for Southend West (Sir David Amess)'">Sir David Amess</a> said that he was praying for miracles. Let me say with the greatest respect: the Government need a miracle to get this Queen&#8217;s Speech passed.</p> <p pid="a68.0/5">Not only did the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> lie to the Queen about <a href="/glossary/?gl=231" title="Prorogation takes the form of an announcement on behalf of the Queen by the..." class="glossary">Prorogation</a>, but he has now brought her to <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> to launch his election campaign. If we hear the words &#8220;Get Brexit done&#8221; one more time&#8212;perhaps someone will tell me, and the rest of the UK, exactly what that means. In fact, it is meaningless, and it detracts from the real problems that we face across the UK, and with which the Government have to deal. We have heard vague promises of hospitals, police on the streets and better education. We in Scotland know exactly how to deliver an education system, a police system and a justice system, because we in Scotland have been doing that successfully. In the crisis that is Westminster, it is the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNP_Government">SNP Government</a> who are delivering for  Scotland.</p> <p pid="a68.0/6">Ironically, the Government appear to be putting law and order front and centre of their ambition to return to power. That would surprise most people, given that the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> was recently found to have broken the law by the highest court in the land, and consistently says that he will do the same again at the end of the month. We have a Parliament in turmoil, a Government without a mandate and a Prime Minister with no power, yet we find ourselves in the House delivering the election manifesto of the Conservative party through the vehicle of the Queen&#8217;s Speech.</p> <p pid="a68.0/7">The Government are cutting taxes for the rich while cutting services for the rest of us. Rather than using the Queen&#8217;s Speech to address the glaring inequalities across the country, the Prime Minister used it to announce a crackdown on our European neighbours entering the country, a move that would be devastating for my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> and for Scotland. In Scotland we have a problem with emigration, not immigration, and this proposal proves how out of touch the Government are with the wishes of the people of Scotland. It does not need to be said again, but I will say it again none the less: Scotland voted to remain in the EU, and the Government have shown a flagrant disregard for the will of the Scottish people. [Interruption.] I am happy to take an <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>, if <a href="/mp/?p=25387" title="Our page on Tom Pursglove - 'the hon.

They enrich our culture, strengthen our society and boost our economy. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_the_EU">Leaving the EU</a> and ending freedom of movement could cost Scotland up to &#163;2 billion in tax revenues. I would like to understand how MPs who also represent Scotland on this side of the House intend to answer to their constituents when the <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a> comes. For Scotland that is not a price worth paying, and Scotland is not willing to pay it.</p> <p pid="a69.1/2">In my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, thousands of EU nationals are anxious about their future. I recently held a surgery specifically for those who are concerned about their future in the UK post Brexit, and the response was heartbreaking. Women in their 80s are planning to leave the place they have called home, families fear that they will have to return to a place that their kids will not recognise because they have never lived there, and young people are angry about the fact that their opportunities are being removed by this Government. Their anxiety was not relieved when the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Security threatened EU nationals with deportation from the UK if they did not apply for settled status. We all know that the Government&#8217;s response has been woeful.</p> <p pid="a69.1/3">Europeans who work in our health service, support local businesses and help to grow our economy now face the full force of the Tories&#8217; hostile environment. As if it were not bad enough to be happy to target anyone who does not look like a British citizen, they now want to target EU nationals who contribute to healthcare, contribute to the economy and contribute to Scotland. They are happy to tell us that those people must apply for settled status in a home in which they have lived for most, if not the entirety, of their adult lives.</p> <p pid="a69.1/4">I cannot support a Queen&#8217;s Speech that is inward-looking and ignores the problems that my constituents face. Rather than focusing on blocking EU nationals entering the UK, the Government could have used today&#8217;s events to announce a halt to universal credit, a failed policy that has been wreaking havoc in my constituency, causing people to turn to foodbanks and crisis grants just to feed themselves. That is this Government&#8217;s record. That is the record that we are not hearing about from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, but that is the record that the Government will face at the ballot box: a policy that is leaving local  authorities out of pocket by millions of pounds, and picking up the pieces for a private sector that is increasingly reluctant to accept universal credit claimants.</p> <p pid="a69.1/5"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> could also have announced compensation for the 1950s women whose pensions were removed from them with no consultation, or he could have called an end to the benefits freeze&#8212;another policy that has been in our manifesto for quite some time. Instead, in a room full of lords and ladies, the Queen, sitting on a golden throne, read a party political broadcast written by an unelected Prime Minister with no working <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a>, announcing the continuation of punitive policies that have harmed the most vulnerable in society.</p> <p pid="a69.1/6">Today has proved again how out of touch <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> is. Scotland deserves the choice of a better future than the one that is being imposed upon it. It is clearer than ever that the only way to protect Scotland&#8217;s interests properly is for it to become an independent country.</p>            </div>

I speak as a just-remainer who represents a midlands <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> that voted 60/40 out. I believe I have a moral duty to get my constituents out of Europe, and that the authority of the electorate&#8212;we delegated power to the electorate&#8212;supersedes anything passed by this House. It may be a legal nicety that the referendum was not legally binding, but woe betide this House if it ignores the will of the people.</p> <p pid="a70.0/7">We need a bit of luck in politics, and I cannot believe my luck seeing the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of State for Health my hon.&#8212;or probably right hon.&#8212;Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24873" title="Our page on Caroline Dinenage - 'the Member for Gosport (Caroline Dinenage)'">Caroline Dinenage</a> sitting on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>, because I am intending to talk about health. Of course, one of the problems with the Queen&#8217;s Speech is that if we try to talk about the subject we wish to talk about someone like you, Madam Deputy <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, gets up and says &#8220;We have to restrict the debate to four&#8221;&#8212;or three or two&#8212;&#8220;minutes,&#8221; so we end up with no debate at all.  As my perspicacious hon. Friend the Member for Southend West knows and pointed out, one of the joys of being lucky enough to be called on the first day, however, is that we might get a chance to make a longer speech, so I am particularly grateful to be called, and I want to talk about the health measures in the Queen&#8217;s Speech and, if I have time, say a word about the environment.</p> <p pid="a70.0/8">I absolutely welcome the 40 new hospitals that my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has committed to, and I am particularly excited because Leicester, with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Infirmary">Royal Infirmary</a>, the General and Glenfield, is going to be part of that massive hospital upgrade programme. I would like to think that when my right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Secretary">Health Secretary</a> came to Hinckley and saw what we were doing there&#8212;he visited an integrated healthcare clinic, where he saw chiropractors and massage therapists working together, apart from the main hospital&#8212;that might have influenced his decision.</p> <p pid="a70.0/9">Madam Deputy Speaker, it will be no secret to you and possibly the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_State">Minister of State</a> that I have argued pretty much all my parliamentary career for integrated healthcare. I note that an integrated healthcare Bill was referred to in the Queen&#8217;s Speech, but I do not think it is quite the integration that I have been looking for, which is a wider range of treatments available on the NHS. I will go further today, in what might be my last speech&#8212;it will certainly be my last contribution to a Queen&#8217;s Speech debate&#8212;in what has so far been a 32-year career as I am standing down and say that, despite my support for these 40 hospitals, I think we need a new health paradigm. If we look around at what is happening outside&#8212;the Attenborough effect, worries about plastics and the Antarctic, not to mention activities recently&#8212;we can see that what we really need now is a sustainable healthcare policy.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a71.1/1">I am glad, and I wasn&#8217;t expecting that; Madam <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>, I hope you will waive the rule that says electronic devices are not allowed to be used in support of a cause.</p> <p pid="a71.1/2">We really need a new paradigm. We need a new health paradigm and that paradigm must look at the carbon footprint of drugs among other things, and it must look at how we are deploying resources in the health service. I have to say to my hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> that there is a reluctance on the part of the medical establishment to share any space or any resources with anything it does not control itself. I cite in evidence the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopaths_Act_1993">Osteopaths Act 1993</a> and the Chiropractors Act 1994. I sat on both those <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a>; they were private Members&#8217; Bills and they became <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Parliament">Acts of Parliament</a>. We were told beforehand, &#8220;The osteopaths and chiropractors do not have proper regulations so how can we bring them into the health service?&#8221; Well, they have now got proper regulation; they are regulated by Acts of Parliament, but where in the country do we find them working with orthopaedic surgeons? The osteopaths and the chiropractors have a carbon zero footprint&#8212;and the western acupuncturists for that matter have a carbon zero footprint&#8212;and they can help these practitioners in our hospitals. I would  like to see a small percentage of the money going to these new hospitals put towards a broader base of treatment.</p> <p pid="a71.1/3">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Standards_Authority">Professional Standards Authority</a> was set up by the Government to regulate, with oversight, a whole range of professions from sports therapists to all sorts of other therapists. I have argued so many times that the Government should respect the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSA">PSA</a>&#8217;s own request that it be taken seriously and can refer cases that it sees to doctors. It is almost as if it does not exist. The Government speak with forked tongue on this, and I am really concerned about it, so I ask my hon. Friend&#8212;who perhaps will be winding up the debate&#8212;if she will look at that.</p> <p pid="a71.1/4">One third of the world&#8217;s population already has sustainable healthcare so this is hardly a novel approach. China, which has a population of 1.4 billion, has its traditional 4,000-year-old herbal medicine system and acupuncture, and India has a sustainable health ministry and a 4,000-year-old medical system plus the world&#8217;s greatest usage of homeopathy.</p> <p pid="a71.1/5">I have just been to India for a week at the request of its Government; I was invited by the Government to see what was going on. I went because on <phrase class="date" code="2019-01-17">17 January</phrase> I had a chance to ask a question of a man I respect, Sir Andrew Dillon, who is the chairman of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Health_and_Care_Excellence">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</a>. I said to him, &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand why you and your committee are dithering over whether acupuncture works for lower back pain&#8212;it has been on and off. Have any of your team been to China or India where the critical mass is, to see what is going on?&#8221; and he said, &#8220;No, we haven&#8217;t; we haven&#8217;t got the money.&#8221; In fairness to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NICE">NICE</a>, its budget has been cut by 30%.</p> <p pid="a71.1/6">I do not pretend to be an academic&#8212;I am a politician&#8212;but I did do research at Oxford under Professor Sammy Finer of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Souls">All Souls</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillian_Peele">Gillian Peele</a> at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Margaret_Hall">Lady Margaret Hall</a> for a research degree in the &#8217;80s, and they always said to me, &#8220;If you&#8217;re doing research, go to the biggest base of information you can find.&#8221; Yet NICE has been making decisions on tiny numbers of people&#8212;a few homeopaths in Liverpool, a couple of different groups of herbalists and acupuncturists. Why on earth are we not looking at the two biggest countries in the world that use these systems?</p> <p pid="a71.1/7">As I have said, I have been to India for a week as the guest of the Government. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> knows all about this as I have talked to him about it; I was their guest and I shall declare it in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests, but I paid for the flights. The AYUSH Ministry&#8212;Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga &amp; Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa and Homoeopathy&#8212;covers a range of disciplines, but I want to dispose first of one component, and that is homeopathy. I want to dispose of this to give some idea of the scale of the operation. Here in the UK, the tiny group of homoeopaths has been under constant pressure in recent years from so-called sceptics saying that there is no evidence. When I was in Delhi, I met Dr Raj Manchanda who runs the Government services in Delhi. Delhi has 6,000 homeopathic clinics, with 15,000 registered homeopathic practitioners, of whom 80% are doctors who have had five years&#8217; training. They practise in almost every street. I also went to the homeopathic institute and teaching hospital in Calcutta. On a 14-acre site, I found three different lines of patients waiting in areas the size of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Palace_Yard">New Palace Yard</a>.  The hospital was treating some 2,000 patients a day, off season, and 3,400 in the hot season, with 100 doctors and postgrads on duty at any one time.</p> <p pid="a71.1/8">This is the evidence we could look at. How can we possibly accept that there is no evidence when in the whole of India homeopathy&#8212;which was exported from London to India during the British time and caught on&#8212;has 300,000 practitioners, 250,000 of whom are doctors, treating an average 20,000 patients a day? I will leave that now. I know that not everybody wants to hear me going on about homeopathy&#8212;[Interruption.] Well, doesn&#8217;t it make it look ridiculous? There are a quarter of a million homeopathic doctors there, yet somebody here who is not very well qualified is saying that there is no evidence. I really think we should look at this. A lot of Indian homeopaths come back to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_London_Hospital_for_Integrated_Medicine">Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine</a> to do research degrees, and they regard it as the ultimate to come back here and do that work.</p> <p pid="a71.1/9">I was honoured to have a meeting with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shripad_Naik">Shripad Naik</a>, who is the Minister in charge at AYUSH. He is actually the equivalent of a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a>. Here, the Secretary of State here has responsibility for 66 million people; Shripad has responsibility for 1,300 million, which is 1.3 billion. I think I have got that right; I never was a mathematician. I spoke to our Secretary of State about this, and he would be happy to receive an invitation from Minister Naik to visit India and look at these medical systems&#8212;I went round 12 hospitals&#8212;and also to establish a working group on traditional medicine such as the one India has with Germany. I would say to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_State">Minister of State</a>, before she gets distracted, that Minister Naik is in the process of opening 5,000 integrated health clinics with allopathic medicine, complementary medicine, the Ayurveda medical system of India and homeopathy. AYUSH, with its medical system including naturopathy, yoga and homeopathy, has 700,000 practitioners, 700 teaching institutions and 200 postgraduate institutions, with an annual intake of 46,000 for its degree courses and 6,000 for its postgrad course. It runs 3,000 Government hospitals that are integrated healthcare hospitals, and it has 28,000 dispensaries. It has 9,000 Government manufacturing units and there are six AYUSH practitioners per 10,000 population.</p> <p pid="a71.1/10">That is a massive operation, and I suggest that my hon. Friend the Minister really needs to look at this, because it offers us a chance to have a much better regulatory regime in this country. I do not think that our complementary and integrated healthcare regime is thorough enough, in the sense that it is scrappy and fragmented; I know that from working in this field. The AYUSH Ministry was set up by <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> Modi in 2014 as an independent ministry&#8212;I remind colleagues that he has just been re-elected for another five-year term&#8212;and he has doubled the AYUSH budget twice. It has gone up four times in five years because AYUSH is so effective at treating people. It is extraordinary. It controls research, through central regulatory bodies and research councils. It controls 11 national educational institutes and it controls drug quality care regulation with two central pharmacopeia laboratories and a national medicinal plant board.</p> <p pid="a71.1/11">Looking around at the landscape outside the House now and at the general attitude that has got very intense&#8212;including people&#8217;s anger about plastics&#8212;I believe that it is only a matter of time before a tsunami of anger comes  round the corner because people here are not allowed these services across the health service. I really encourage my hon. Friend to look at this, because they provide solutions where antibiotics are failing, and they provide solutions to opiate addiction. The three main services that AYUSH offers are: Ayurveda; yoga and naturopathy; and homeopathy.</p> <p pid="a71.1/12">Madam Deputy <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, you are smiling at me and I really appreciate that. I do not think you are standing to be the next Speaker&#8212;[Interruption.] You might be; perhaps you are, so you could be smiling for two reasons. Certainly, one of your reasons is to try to get me to sit down, so I will finish on this.</p> <p pid="a71.1/13">In 2013, I was acting Chairman of the Health Committee for a short period of time in the interregnum between our other hon. Friends who were Chairs, and I put out the report&#8212;HC401&#8212;entitled &#8220;Managing the care of people with long&#8211;term conditions&#8221;. It contains evidence from the late great <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Fisher">Peter Fisher</a>, the Queen&#8217;s homeopath, and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lewith">George Lewith</a>, who ran a department at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southampton">University of Southampton</a>. What I found, going round 12 institutions and research laboratories in India, was that homeopathy was used frequently for long-term conditions with multiple problems because it can find the root of the problem, and I just ask my hon. Friend to look carefully at that and perhaps visit the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine, which is world famous.</p> <p pid="a71.1/14">I hope that I may get called to speak again one day, Madam Deputy Speaker, but with that, I will sit down.</p>            </div>

They set out their concerns and the issues they wanted me to raise, and today&#8217;s debate provides a first opportunity to put some of those on the record.</p> <p pid="a74.0/3">Inevitably, Brexit dominated, and in the survey that formed part of the consultation, 71% of people said they wanted a further public vote; only 18% were against the idea; 77% said that they would vote to remain; 15% said they would support leaving with a close relationship; and only 8% wanted to leave without any agreement. That was reflected in the meetings, too, and it was reflected even more strongly among young people. The Government need to recognise that if they lead this country to a damaging Brexit on a false prospectus, there is a rising generation who will never forgive them.</p> <p pid="a74.0/4">For that young generation&#8212;and, indeed, more widely across all age groups&#8212;there was a real concern to see stronger action to address the climate emergency, on which they felt they had been failed over the past nine years and about which they will see little comfort in today&#8217;s Gracious Speech. I was interested to hear the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>&#8217;s comment that we lead the world on addressing carbon emissions, and that comment has been echoed by a number of Members during the debate.  I have taken the opportunity&#8212;on the odd occasion when I was not paying attention&#8212;to google every survey I could find, and none of them indicates that Britain is leading the world on this. Other countries&#8212;Sweden, Morocco and many others&#8212;are playing a leading role, and there is much more that we can do. We also have a responsibility to do much more, given our historical contribution.</p> <p pid="a74.0/5">A wide range of different issues were raised across the meetings and events that I organised, but there was a common theme. I heard how difficult it is for carers to access the necessary respite, without which their lives are challenging. There was frustration that the Government have failed to meet their post-2017 promise to bring forward proposals to tackle the crisis in adult social care and, indeed, to meet the needs of young carers. Domiciliary care workers told me about how their capacity to care had been eroded by 15-minute appointments, poor support, poor training and inadequate supervision. During the consultation I was conducting, one local residential home announced its closure due to inadequate funding, and we all know that many more across the country will follow that path. There was a real sense that we need a complete paradigm shift on how we meet the challenges of an ageing population and how we provide the resources to support that change.</p>            </div>

Friend, and I shall return to that point later in my comments.</p> <p pid="a75.1/2">On health, I was told about the difficulties in securing timely appointments with GPs, sometimes acute difficulties with waiting times in A&amp;E, and difficulties in accessing other services. Young people told me about the pressures that are contributing to the rise in mental health problems, on which the system is failing them badly. Schools told me that they were dipping into teaching budgets to provide support for students in mental health crises. Teaching budgets are there for teaching, but that money has been diverted to cover the crisis in young people&#8217;s mental health. We need even more support and substantial investment in child and adolescent mental health services. Young people told me that waiting times of 25 weeks between first diagnosis and a referral to the first opportunity for help are the norm, not the exception, but early <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> is critical to tackling mental health crises.</p> <p pid="a75.1/3">Parents of children with special educational needs and disabilities told me heartbreaking stories of their struggle to get education, health and care plans that met their children&#8217;s needs. Parents also talked about the challenges that schools face in delivering the plans once they are in place because of the lack of resources. We know that our schools have been hit by an 8% real-terms budget cut, but the particular failure to address special educational needs and disability funding is causing an enormous crisis.</p> <p pid="a75.1/4">Young people were increasingly worried about crime, talking about knife crime in particular. They made the case for the out-of-school activities that used to be common before the cuts, which have had a disproportionate impact on our local authorities and have led to a collapse in youth services. In other meetings, people highlighted how we miss <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sure_Start">Sure Start</a> and the difference that the centres made in supporting families during the crucial early years. They talked about how school exclusions, driven by the lack of resources to support the most difficult children, are feeding gangs with recruits and sucking young people into knife crime.</p> <p pid="a75.1/5">A big worry across all ages and among all parts of the community was the rise in homelessness, rough sleeping and street begging. At a meeting on housing, we talked about the rising number of people in temporary accommodation without a permanent home of their own, the rise in sofa surfing, and the increasing dependency on friends and relatives for accommodation. People were clear that the only solution is a concerted programme of building affordable social housing. The problem of rough sleeping and street begging is clearly more complex, and we talked about mental health and alcohol and drug dependency problems that need intensive interventions to support people into getting off the streets and rebuilding their lives. There was a huge willingness from people in statutory services and the voluntary sector to resolve such problems, but there was also a real sense that the problems had risen over the past nine years as a consequence of the cuts that had affected statutory services&#8217; ability to support and work with the voluntary sector in a way that has a real impact.</p> <p pid="a75.1/6">Those are all different issues, but there is a common theme. Nine years of cuts have sapped the capacity of our public services and much of the voluntary sector to meet the needs of those who need them most. Austerity has corroded the quality of too many lives, but it did not have to be like that. Such decisions were not forced by necessity, but by political choice, and those choices need to change. The Gracious Speech offers a few convenient headlines, but there is no real recognition of the scale of the change that we need: the fundamental new direction for our country that my constituents spoke about and which this Government clearly cannot provide.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a77.1/1">My right hon. Friend gives us a teaser of what we can expect her to speak about, which I am very much looking forward to, and I am pleased that she would like to see investment at Boscombe station&#8212;[Laughter.] I will now move on from that sensitive but important subject.</p> <p pid="a77.1/2">On a more serious note, I make no apology for focusing on international security given our ever greater reliance on the economy, access to global markets, trading alliances and, of course, international peace and security, including the links with our own security environment. The first line of the security and defence review talks about the symbiotic relationship between national security and economic security&#8212;we cannot have one without the other&#8212;so I welcomed the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>&#8217;s illustrating a desire to continue to play a role in global affairs and to champion global free trade. I certainly welcome the renewed commitment to spending 2% of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a> on defence, but I want to make it clear that I do not believe that is enough.</p> <p pid="a77.1/3">The challenges we face are growing and the threats are accumulating. While we can manage and contain the threats today, we face an increasingly dangerous and complex world. We often speak about the erosion of the rules-based order; just look at what happened last week when we saw Turkey breach international law with its military incursion into northern Syria. Let us be honest: a busy, distracted and disunited world is essentially looking the other way. Given the increasingly volatile and changing times, it is a sad testament to the failing international cohesion that once saw the west stand with resolve to defend international norms and values.</p> <p pid="a77.1/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_US">The US</a> is our closest and most critical ally, but we must be strong enough to call it out when errors are made. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Trump">President Trump</a>&#8217;s decision to withdraw troops has triggered a humanitarian crisis and has undone much of the good work to bring stability to the region. The defeat of Daesh has been set back. We have unleashed a chain reaction of events that is seeing instability and humanitarian crisis unfold.</p> <p pid="a77.1/5">What message does this send to our competitors and adversaries around the world? Again, I cite the example of China. Twenty years ago, China&#8217;s military spending was on a par with ours; today, its defence budget is $250 billion. In our lifetimes, China will spend more on military than the United States does, and it will become bigger economically than the United States. China is watching what is happening. We must see what is happening  in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China">South China</a> sea&#8212;China is able to dominate in that arena&#8212;and stand together to support the international rules-based order.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a78.3/1">That is for another day and another debate, but my hon. Friend is absolutely right. China dominates on a scale that we simply cannot comprehend over here. Its technological capabilities and its investment in quantum computing, and so on, mean it already owns 40% of the world&#8217;s data, and it is moving further afield. Once a country moves into the Chinese way of thinking&#8212;Huawei, and so on&#8212;it is very difficult to get out.</p> <p pid="a78.3/2">It is only a matter of time before countries that are already financially compelled or obliged to support Chinese methods and systems will have to move over to China&#8217;s global positioning system, and so on. Then they will have to move over to the Chinese reserve currency, instead of the dollar. We will potentially see the world split into two huge domains unless we check it, but that is for another debate.</p> <p pid="a78.3/3">Back to Turkey and Syria, I make it clear that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Democratic_Forces">Syrian Democratic Forces</a> were our allies. They were our boots on the ground, and now we see them pivoting towards the Assad regime&#8212;a regime against which we rightly launched weapons strikes because it was using chemical weapons and barrel bombs against its own people.</p> <p pid="a78.3/4">This has been a disastrous week for international foreign policy. We are losing any leverage in pursuing a peaceful outcome in Syria, so I cannot stress enough the implications of Turkey&#8217;s incursion. I simply ask the Government to lead calls for Turkey to withdraw, and I call on them to impose an arms embargo until that happens. Let us lead Europe. Let us stand up and bring America with us, if it will not lead on this front.</p> <p pid="a78.3/5">We cannot complain about the erosion of the international rules-based order if we are not willing to defend it. Ironically, as the west becomes more risk averse, the world is becoming more unstable, giving space for our competitors to avoid effective scrutiny and to advance their own interests illicitly beneath the threshold of any international response. Simply put, the old <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods">Bretton Woods</a> organisations that stood us well after the second world war are now out of date, and they are being rejected by newer nations, too. We need to step up to the plate, recognise what is actually happening and lead on updating the standards and norms by which we expect nations to abide.</p> <p pid="a78.3/6">I make it clear that the threat picture has also changed, as illustrated by the rise of non-state actors such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State">Islamic State</a>. Their ability to recruit and finance themselves through the internet, and so on, will not go away. We need to recognise that we had no viable plan for the aftermath of the combat phase in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_and_Syria">Iraq and Syria</a>. Thousands of hard-line jihadi fighters, who for months sat behind barbed wire guarded by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDF">SDF</a>, are now able to escape and our counter-Daesh partners are being attacked by a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> ally.</p> <p pid="a78.3/7">It is not enough for Britain to deny dual-national fighters any right to return to the UK, while expecting the SDF to process them and their families. We are now seeing orphans caught up in this with nowhere to go. If the United States, to give it its due, can take back youngsters and orphans who are caught up in the mess over there, so can we. Let us get on the front foot and lead by example. Let us show other nations around the world what we can do.</p> <p pid="a78.3/8">I encourage the Government to show much needed international leadership and help to update international protocols so that all countries can take responsibility for their own nationals and dual nationals, rather than abandoning them to fate, with the very real prospect of allowing them to regroup to fight another day. This is about national security. Please do not say I am making Britain less safe. This is at the forefront of my mind, not just from a personal perspective but because of my interest in Britain&#8217;s national security. We need to sort out this problem. It is not an unconditional surrender, as we saw in the past; it is a new phenomenon that we need to get our heads around.</p> <p pid="a78.3/9">Changing technologies are another critical aspect of the Bill that is affecting the threat picture. Over the next decade, technology will advance to dominate our lives, with machines talking directly to machines, smart city infrastructure, artificial intelligence and automation. Our reliance on the infrastructure supporting this new technological world is critical, so I am pleased that we are investing in this area and that we have leading businesses capable of doing so.</p> <p pid="a78.3/10">Our ever greater reliance on technology comes with a risk. Cyber and space capabilities are so integral to civilian, commercial and military applications that a total or even partial loss of their use would have an instant and dramatic impact on our lives. Our ability to communicate, share information, conduct transactions, use the internet, fly planes or predict the weather would all be severely affected.</p> <p pid="a78.3/11">I welcome the 2% commitment, but it will soon be inadequate to meet the wide spectrum of threats that we face, especially our technological vulnerability. Data is now taking over terrain as the arena of choice to disrupt an enemy. Why resort to conventional attacks when greater devastation can be caused to an economy or an electoral outcome simply with a laptop?</p> <p pid="a78.3/12">We are now also seeing the weaponisation of space. In military terms, space has become the ultimate high ground. We require a space command, so we need to follow the United States and France. We saw the evolution of the Air Force 100 years ago and we now need to do the same for space, because both Russia and China have reorganised their military structures to include space as a fighting domain. We need to recognise the changing parameters of conflict and adapt in that area, too.</p> <p pid="a78.3/13">We also need to invest in our conventional forces. On a day when we have seen the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-35">F-35</a> land on the aircraft carrier, we can be very proud. In the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War">Gulf War</a> we had 36 fast-jet squadrons, but today we have just six. Our main battle tank is now over 25 years old and is in dire need of an upgrade. Our Navy is getting smaller and smaller, and China is increasing its navy by the size of  our Navy every single year. If we want to protect our trading routes after Brexit, we need a surface fleet that is able to do that.</p> <p pid="a78.3/14">Listening to this debate, I feel that colleagues, in some cases, are not even aware of what is actually happening this week. There is a small possibility that we will strike a deal&#8212;not a no deal, as SNP Members spent their entire time talking about&#8212;but I stress this is part I. This is getting us to the transition. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_II">Part II</a> is the relationship beyond that.</p> <p pid="a78.3/15">I am pleased that last week we saw some consensus, a sense of compromise, with people being willing to step forward from their original anchored positions to say, &#8220;This has gone on long enough. Let&#8217;s move forward.&#8221; I wish more colleagues were able to think that way, rather than going back to their original position and saying, &#8220;I am not willing to discuss this.&#8221;</p>            </div>

I do apologise.</p> <p pid="a80.1/2">The nation has now watched this debate continue for three years, and there is now talk of dragging it beyond <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-31">31 October</phrase>. I have made my views on a no deal absolutely clear. I do not want a no deal, but the SNP Members spent their entire time saying that it is our objective. It is not my objective. I want to get this across the line, and it can happen. The planets are aligning, and we are hearing voices from the EU saying that it is possible. Technical talks are taking place, so let us wish them the best at the EU summit. Let us come back on Saturday and get this deal done.</p> <p pid="a80.1/3">We have to conclude that Brexit has damaged the reputation of this Parliament and has not been good for the country, the Government or the Conservative party. I am pleased to hear the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> speak about the importance of one nation, because the complexion of my party has been challenged a bit during this difficult period. I am a Conservative. I believe in fiscal responsibility. I believe that a right-of-centre Government are good for Britain in their approach, being progressive, modernist and willing to speak for and represent the entire country. We cannot do that if my party moves to the right, and becomes smaller and more condensed. We can do it if we remain that broad church, and I am pleased to see the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> articulate that very message.</p> <p pid="a80.1/4">We should also remind ourselves that we are good at things in this country and we have much to be proud of. We lead in oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, creative industries, life sciences, aerospace and financial services. Those are things we do well. Not only that, but this is a great place to invest: we are a champion of free trade; we have a legal and justice system that people can rely on; we have low corporation tax; and we have stable governance. We should be proud of who we are, but perhaps in all this debate we have lost sight of that.</p> <p pid="a80.1/5">If global Britain is to mean anything, let us step forward with international reach and resolve, to confirm and update the respected standards for the rule of law. We must start with a sober view of those <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods">Bretton Woods</a> organisations, recognising that the world is changing from a technological perspective and that this is a crucial week. This is the biggest week for me as a parliamentarian and it is arguably our biggest week for a generation. It is  up to us in this House to take a binary decision: do we want Brexit to continue and pursue our own pure form, or do we call an end to this, support this deal and allow the nation to move forward?</p>            </div>

Clearly, we have a bit of a disagreement about Brexit. If we have spoken on these Benches about the risk of a no deal, it is because that risk remains very real. Many people might say it remains an extreme possibility. It is one that the Government seem willing to contemplate, despite the fact that, if there is a <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament.

We have all celebrated our 39th birthdays; indeed she and I share a birthday, so we will look forward to celebrating that next year. Who knows what situation we will be in. <a href="/mp/?p=10057" title="Our page on Peter Bottomley - 'The hon. Member for Worthing West (Sir Peter Bottomley)'">Sir Peter Bottomley</a> noted that the temperature goes up and down, but we have a role to fulfil, which SNP Members take seriously, as the third party in this House and as the largest party in Scotland. We have never claimed to speak for all of Scotland, although I would draw the House&#8217;s attention to the remarks made by our former leader, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Robertson">Angus Robertson</a>, in his first speech after the 2015 election, when he recognised that we won considerably more seats than was proportionate to our vote and that we did have a responsibility to be aware of the broad range of political opinion that exists in Scotland. But there is consensus in Scotland, and every <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> in Scotland voted to remain in the EU. We will not shy away from speaking up for that point of view.</p> <p pid="a81.0/3">This Queen&#8217;s Speech is also slightly unusual because this debate is taking place while the SNP annual conference is going on in Aberdeen. No matter how many representations my predecessor and I make through the usual channels about according our party the same respect as all the other parties get in terms of a conference recess; or about how the parties should work to obliviate the need for a conference recess, here we are nevertheless. But it is political party conferences that are the place to lay out manifestos and make broad political declarations and plays to attract voters, not the ceremonial opening and the state occasion of the Queen&#8217;s Speech. However, that is what today&#8217;s Queen&#8217;s Speech has had: all the hallmarks of a political manifesto targeted at the perceived priorities of a narrow range of voters in particular parts of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales">England and Wales</a>.</p> <p pid="a81.0/4">As far as I can see, at least a third of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> will be subject to the English votes for English <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> process, in whole or in part. Those are all in areas where the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNP_Government">SNP Government</a> have already shown themselves to be much more progressive and have a considerably more enlightened vision. We are not cracking down just to be seen to be  tough on crime; we are working towards the rehabilitation of offenders, recognising the difficulties that can be caused by short sentences and finding different ways to bring people who have fallen foul of the law and fallen into criminality back into the fold of society. We are sent here to speak for Scotland and then the rules of this House continue to exclude us, through that EVEL process.</p> <p pid="a81.0/5"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bills">The Bills</a> that will apply in Scotland already seem to be a source of concern; even since the Queen&#8217;s Speech was delivered my inbox has filled up with dozens of emails with concerns about the proposals for voter identification. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_SNP">The SNP</a> wants to expand the franchise and make it easier for more people to vote, starting with 16 and 17-year-olds, and extending the franchise for elections to <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> to include our friends and neighbours who are European nationals, but it seems as though this Government&#8217;s proposals want to narrow the opportunity for people to take part in our democratic processes. That is equally true of the immigration Bill and the end to freedom of movement, which, as all SNP colleagues who have spoken have said, will be a social, economic and cultural disaster for this country.</p> <p pid="a81.0/6">This theme of narrowing, isolation and an insular approach comes with Brexit, and the notion of global Britain that the right hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bournemouth_East">Bournemouth East</a> spoke of is just increasingly a joke. I was recently in Malawi, where I went to visit the high commission, which had a pop-up banner saying, &#8220;Apply, come to Britain. Britain is great. Come and take part in our Chevening scholarship.&#8221; The night before, I had met stakeholders who could not get a visa for love nor money for their Chevening scholarships. So the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing, and Brexit is the exact opposite of the vision of a global Britain. Much of the legislation that has been outlined today is going to have to help to try to clean up the mess that Brexit could leave behind.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a82.1/1">As my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25361" title="Our page on Ian Blackford - 'the Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Ian Blackford)'">Ian Blackford</a> pointed out, the EU has secured peace on the continent of Europe throughout the history of its existence. Of course what we want to do as an independent country is join the family of nations. The way to know that a country is independent in the modern world is if it is part of organisations such as the EU, the UN and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organisation">World Trade Organisation</a>, all of which are partnerships of equals, where the different member states, through the mechanisms that exist, can have their voices heard. I have just said that Scottish Members, including the hon. Gentleman, will be actively excluded from at least a third of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> outlined today because of the EVEL process. So I do not think the point he is trying to make stands up well.</p> <p pid="a82.1/2">It is becoming abundantly clear that there is no good outcome to Brexit&#8212;there is no good way of leaving the EU. If there was a better deal than membership of the EU, all the other members would want that deal and the EU would not exist. It stands to reason that the best possible deal we can have is the one we already have, which is membership.</p> <p pid="a82.1/3">The global challenges, which have been outlined in the Queen&#8217;s Speech and the speeches we have heard today, of poverty, the climate emergency, people trafficking, animal welfare and online harm all require a global response, with countries working in co-operation with each other. This Government are determined to pull the UK out of one of the most important mechanisms for delivering that. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen">The Queen</a>&#8217;s Speech, in effect, recognises that, because it has to put in lots of different frameworks and structures to deliver on those issues, when we already have one that is working exceptionally well. That shows, as I said to the hon. Gentleman, the importance of Scotland&#8217;s alternative: our opportunity to genuinely share sovereignty in a partnership of equals. In the EU, legislation comes forward through the Parliament, the Council and the Commission, where the different member states are represented on a fair and proportionate basis, and their voices are heard appropriately. That is the point of independence. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_SNP">The SNP</a>&#8217;s vision is internationalist: it is about Scotland rejoining and taking its place on the global stage. That is the vision that is being articulated at our conference this week.</p> <p pid="a82.1/4">Sadly, this SNP conference is the first I have missed in around 15 years, and I think only the second one I have missed since I left university. That is partly because of my duties in the House and partly because, as <a href="/mp/?p=10009" title="Our page on Sir David Amess - 'the hon. Member for Southend West (Sir David Amess)'">Sir David Amess</a> said, I had the immense privilege of being the only parliamentarian from Scotland to be part of the delegation for the canonisation of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Newman">John Henry Newman</a> in Rome yesterday. There are undoubtedly lessons from that. I think we were praying for many different things&#8212;the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s recollection is perhaps not quite the same as mine&#8212;but that was an opportunity for ecumenism, in respect of both theological and political experience, which was quite useful given the week that we are going into.</p> <p pid="a82.1/5">I hope and expect that by the time of the SNP conference next year&#8212;perhaps not by the time of the next Queen&#8217;s Speech, because that could be sooner than we would have expected&#8212;several Members, including myself, will have celebrated our 40th birthdays. I expect we will have had another Queen&#8217;s Speech, and I hope that the SNP will have been returned in even greater numbers, solidifying the mandate that we have to give the people of Scotland a fair say and a choice in their future. I hope we will be taking our country closer than ever before to the independence that we so badly need, so that we can continue to work as if we live in the early days of a better nation.</p>            </div>

I hope that that body will enable people to gain justice if there have been failures in our medical system, and also that we will learn from those mistakes&#8212;that is so important.</p> <p pid="a83.0/4">I hope we can strengthen the NHS in respect of how we make services available to people with autism. I would particularly like to see mandatory training introduced for all health and care staff, as recommended in the 10-year review of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Act_2009">Autism Act 2009</a> produced on a cross-party basis by the all-party group on autism.

We need to protect and restore habitats so that biodiversity is maintained.</p> <p pid="a83.0/6">I am now going to turn into my grandmother, because I have to tell the House, &#8220;I told you so.&#8221; In drawing up this speech, I looked at my <a href="/glossary/?gl=143" title="Maiden speech is the first formal speech made by an MP in the House of..." class="glossary">maiden speech</a> from back in 1992, in which I said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a83.0/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;The Government must encourage United Kingdom industry to seize the chance of a more efficient use of energy, better emission controls, and a whole raft of subjects connected with using more environmentally friendly technologies. Not only is that an essential component of a modern environmental protection plan, but commercial gain could be made from it for small and large companies.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2019-06-25">25 June</phrase> 1992; Vol. 210, c. 438.]</p> <p pid="a83.0/8">Indeed, a large part of my maiden speech was about the environment and the Rio conference, which of course followed on from Helsinki and really kick-started the concentration of efforts on climate change.</p> <p pid="a83.0/9">In that context, I hope that the excellent Glover landscape review, which has recommended that the Chilterns area of outstanding natural beauty become a national park, will be progressed without delay. In fact, I was the first person to suggest that option, to add a layer of protection to the threatened and fragile landscape in the Chilterns. I wrote around to all colleagues whose constituencies impinge upon the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AONB">AONB</a>, and to local authorities, and received a mainly positive response. The development that is proposed in Buckinghamshire and London will overwhelm this precious part of our environment and, I fear, will destroy forever the rare  chalk streams that runs through our hills, unless we can provide an oasis of protected landscape. I again turn into my grandmother, because back at the time of my maiden speech I was in talks with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rivers_Authority">National Rivers Authority</a> about protecting the chalk streams and the fact that they had dried up. That resulted in bed-lining trials. I am very worried that all these years later we are still talking about their protection and their potential total annihilation.</p> <p pid="a83.0/10">Of course, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HS2">HS2</a> is also currently destroying our environment. I think everybody in the Chamber knew I would get around to this sooner or later&#8212;there is no surprise among those on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>. I really do welcome the Oakervee review, but I despair of the rationale, the exorbitant and profligate cost, the poor governance and the disastrous management of the project.</p> <p pid="a83.0/11">First, and immediately, I ask the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Transport to stop the roadworks due to begin tomorrow in Missenden. They are going to cause untold upset to my local community and its residents and businesses. I was talking to people in the village on Saturday, and the feeling is so strong that I wish the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> could go there himself and at least stop the works until the review reports. What is the point in causing disruption for a matter of a few weeks? A few weeks would make all the difference to that community. If phase 1 is cancelled, we would not have to face the disruption that is going to start from tomorrow and continue until the end of the review. Even now, after 10 years of poor communication and the disdain shown by HS2 Ltd towards my local community, I really do have to ask whose bright idea it was to cause this huge disruption in my locality in what is effectively starting to be the run-up to Christmas, which should be good for all the shops and businesses in Missenden. If access becomes difficult, it will affect their profitability. I encourage everybody in the House to come to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Missenden">Great Missenden</a>&#8212;it is easily reached on the train&#8212;and to spend their pounds in the shops there. They will need the House&#8217;s help if HS2 goes ahead.</p> <p pid="a83.0/12">This weekend, there were reports about the treatment of whistleblowers, who were allegedly exhorted to destroy material that may compromise HS2. The statement from HS2 Ltd that it would not release documents requested by a Dr Thornton&#8212;I believe&#8212;because if they came into the public domain they could be used by critics successfully to lobby for the cancellation of the project, is an appalling turn of events.</p>            </div>

Friend&#8217;s constituent. Quite simply, the lessons have not been learned from the early days of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HS2">HS2</a>, when my constituents, as I said earlier in my speech, were treated with disdain. All sorts of things took place, which in a democracy&#8212;in our modern democracy&#8212;should not have happened. I hope that my hon. Friend&#8217;s constituent gets redress, and I advise him never to give up. I am not giving up after 10 years, and I am still hopeful that there could be a cancellation in the offing.</p> <p pid="a86.1/2">Cancelling HS2 will not harm the country. The money could be spent on the nation&#8217;s digital, transport and energy infrastructure, as set out in the Queen&#8217;s Speech today. I really welcome the intention to produce a comprehensive national infrastructure strategy; it is something that I have consistently called for. We need to revolutionise the infrastructure of this country by providing better transport links, particularly in the north of England. We want better bus services, an electric charging network, high-speed broadband, 5G and more reliable commuter services. We can spend taxpayers&#8217; money so much better than on HS2, particularly phase 1. Now we hear that HS2 might stop at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Oak_Common">Old Oak Common</a>. If that happens, the business case goes right out the window. I think that that is enough on HS2 now.</p> <p pid="a86.1/3">Let me move briefly on to the proposed election Bill. When the Government consider election reform, I ask them to think very carefully. I am already getting a lot of emails from constituents who are worried that the legislation will contain photographic identification for voting. I have the pleasure of sitting on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=207" title="An international organisation of member states (45 at the time of writing)..." class="glossary">Council of Europe</a>. I recently led the monitoring team for the elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where I bumped into my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24907" title="Our page on Bob Stewart - 'the Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)'">Bob Stewart</a>, and where they produce photo <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID">ID</a> as a matter of course. People cannot vote until they produce their ID, but these are countries where national ID cards are a matter of course. We do not have a national ID card here. I am very worried about the most vulnerable in our society, so I encourage the Government to think hard about that provision and perhaps turn their mind to looking at the rules around referendums and the changes that were recommended by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Unit">Constitution Unit</a>&#8217;s commission, on which I had the privilege to sit with <a href="/mp/?p=10243" title="Our page on Dominic Grieve - 'the right hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr Grieve)'">Mr Grieve</a>, who has just come into the Chamber. Updating our rules in the light of developments, particularly with social media and artificial intelligence, is of critical importance if we wish to retain confidence in our systems and keep them ahead of the technology challenges that threaten to derail them.</p>            </div>

In Northern Ireland, we brought in photographic identification for voting. The purpose was simple: to stop fraud. We had many examples of fraud across Northern Ireland. In every part of life today, people really need <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID">ID</a>&#8212;if they want to open a bank account and so on. We need ID for everything. We have an ID system in Northern Ireland. People just need to apply for it, get their photograph done and they get a card. It is really simple and people want to do it. Perhaps she could follow that example.</p>            </div>

We need to halt this tide of knife crime and the scourge of county lines, both of which have affected my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, and we must give our police forces the resources to provide the safety and security that our citizens need to lead peaceful and successful lives.</p> <p pid="a87.11/3">I should like to finish by mentioning one provision that has delighted me&#8212;I am delighted that it has come to prominence&#8212;and that is the ambitious national space plan. My husband, Jack Leeming, during his lifelong career as a civil servant, was finally appointed director general of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_National_Space_Centre">British National Space Centre</a>, then attached to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Trade_and_Industry">Department for Trade and Industry</a>. He had a vision for the role of space in telecommunications, earth observation and remote sensing and was a huge supporter of our space industries and scientific endeavours. He was passionate about the possibilities of space, and my only sadness is that he died earlier this year and did not live to see a Conservative <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> appreciating the opportunities that this sector affords.</p> <p pid="a87.11/4">This Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> now has many, many challenges. There is no doubt that there is an overwhelming desire to get Brexit done and to reduce the bandwidth that is occupying Government, which, in turn, is impeding the progress that we can make on things that matter to people and have now been covered in the Gracious Speech&#8212;health, education, local government and new opportunities for our service and manufacturing industries. I hope that by the end of the week we will have not just a pathway to delivering our exit from the EU, but a firm grip on the destination.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a88.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <a href="/mp/?p=10228" title="Our page on Dame Cheryl Gillan - 'the right hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Dame Cheryl Gillan)'">Dame Cheryl Gillan</a>. I very much sympathise with her points about identity cards, given that, we are told, about 11 million people may not have passports or driving licences. It is important that these people can participate in democracy.</p> <p pid="a88.0/2">I sympathise with many of the points the right hon. Lady makes about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HS2">HS2</a>. From a Swansea perspective, it takes three hours by train to get from London, two hours to get to Manchester&#8212;it will be one hour after HS2&#8212;and four hours to Edinburgh. Why do people have to travel more frequently and further when we have the internet? Why do we not spend some money on building regional economies?</p> <p pid="a88.0/3">At one point, I was leader of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croydon_Council">Croydon Council</a> and pioneered a 26 km long tramlink, linking Beckenham, Croydon and Wimbledon. It cost &#163;200 million, half of which was paid by the private sector. For HS2&#8217;s &#163;80 billion, we could do 800 of those schemes, clustering regional economies. I have to ask whether, strategically, it is a good idea to enable people to live further and further from London, so that they can go back and forth to work. In our infrastructure review, we should look at the matter across the piece.</p> <p pid="a88.0/4">I will briefly mention, as other Members have, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Flynn">Paul Flynn</a>, who was a good friend and a great man. He was a man of great warmth, integrity, humour and distinction, and he is a sad loss for the House and particularly for colleagues across Wales.</p> <p pid="a88.0/5"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen">The Queen</a> started her speech today as all good speeches really start&#8212;with a joke: &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Government">My Government</a>&#8217;s priority is to leave the EU by <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-31">31 October</phrase> 2019&#8221;, but it does not look at all likely that that is going to happen. It is an interesting contrast to her opening words in the 2017 Queen&#8217;s Speech, when she said that the priority was</p> <p class="indent" pid="a88.0/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;to secure the best possible deal as the country leaves the European Union&#8230;working with&#8230;the devolved Administrations, business and others to build&#8230;consensus&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, <a href="/glossary/?gl=191" title="The house of Lords is the upper chamber of the Houses of Parliament. It is..." class="glossary">House of Lords</a>, <phrase class="date" code="2019-06-21">21 June</phrase> 2017; Vol. 783, c. 5.]</p> <p pid="a88.0/7">That idea has been swept away and we are now rushing towards this deadline&#8212;to get Brexit done, do or die. But in our hearts we all know that we cannot just get Brexit done. It will be a series of painful negotiations with deals down the way.</p> <p pid="a88.0/8">The next part of the Queen&#8217;s Speech was on the commitment to financial stability, so it is a strange irony that many of the hedge funds that supported the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>&#8217;s leadership have been betting on no deal.</p> <p pid="a88.0/9">The next part of the speech was on fiscal responsibility. Government debt is now 90% of the size of the economy. When Labour left government, it was half that figure. After years of austerity crushing the poorest, we are now being told that there is loads of money in the magic money tree for the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> to spend on all sorts of things. The fact is that the current Government have failed to grow the economy. To be fair, that is largely due to Brexit and the waiting period. However, it is not just the uncertainty of Brexit that is contributing to this economic situation; it is also the reality of Brexit, which will shrink our economy by a further 10%.</p> <p pid="a88.0/10">The expression &#8220;get Brexit done&#8221; is very appealing to people because they are sick and tired of talking about Brexit. They want to &#8220;get Brexit over with&#8221;&#8212;so do I, but my contention is that people have now seen what Brexit is likely to be like and they want to have a final say. People who voted leave in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> said that they voted for more money, more control and more jobs, but they are now seeing that they will have less money, whether that is through the divorce bill or the shrinking economy. There will also be fewer jobs, whether that is through car companies pulling out of Bridgend, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Steel">Tata Steel</a> making cuts because of Brexit or Airbus pulling out of the area. There will be less control; people cannot control the <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> in Europe that will ultimately affect us, and they want to have a final say.</p> <p pid="a88.0/11"><a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> who have traditionally been in favour of the Union and business are basically turning their back on these things. It is all very well the Prime Minister talking about how he values the Union, but if Brexit happens and Scotland pulls out of the UK and becomes part of the EU, much of the industry in England will move to Scotland. We are talking about a divided kingdom, not the United Kingdom, and people should wake up to that. The Government pretend that democracy consists of listening to the result of a referendum some three years ago&#8212;since when we have had a <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a>&#8212;with a result that was based on false promises and which is seen to be false. People should have another vote&#8212;a vote on the deal in front of them. There is this  crazy notion that some deal that no one has seen should be rushed through the House on Saturday just because the Prime Minister said that we would leave the European Union on <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-31">31 October</phrase> &#8220;do or die&#8221;. That is frankly absurd.</p> <p pid="a88.0/12">Let me turn to what was good in the Queen&#8217;s Speech. I welcome the focus on mental health because I have my own Counsellors and Psychotherapists (Regulation) Bill. You may know, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>, that the current situation is that you or I could set up as psychotherapists tomorrow, without any training and without practising any evidence-based treatment. The problem is that many people have been abused as a result of this situation. Many individuals with mental health problems go to people who call themselves psychotherapists because it sounds like a professional qualification is needed to be a psychotherapist, but these individuals are basically abused&#8212;for example, in conversion therapy or when war veterans are asked to relive their trauma, making their problems worse. This needs to be embraced in the mental health Bill.</p> <p pid="a88.0/13">Primarily, I want to focus&#8212;albeit briefly&#8212;on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Bill">Environment Bill</a> and on clean air. I have the privilege of chairing the all-party parliamentary group on air pollution. Hon. Members may know that 64,000 people die prematurely every year as a result of air pollution, and that 2.6 million children go to schools polluted with toxic air. That is simply not acceptable. Air pollution affects people&#8217;s mental health, contributing to depression, anxiety and psychosis, and giving rise to dementia. It also affects physical health, giving rise to heart attacks, lung problems, strokes and so on. This has to be sorted out. It is good that it has been mentioned in the Queen&#8217;s Speech, but of course the devil is in the detail.</p> <p pid="a88.0/14">What we need in the Environment Bill are specific targets and timetables that include enforcement action. I am particularly talking about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM_2">PM 2</a>.5 particulates, which are small enough to penetrate women&#8217;s wombs and to affect the babies they are carrying. PM 2.5 levels should be at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organisation">World Health Organisation</a> standard by 2030. The only way to do that is to outline a trajectory to get to the required level of 10 micrograms per cubic metre; we could bring our current levels down to 20 micrograms by 2020, to 15 micrograms by 2025 and to 10 micrograms by 2030. That would require a ban on new fossil-fuelled cars&#8212;diesel or petrol&#8212;by 2030, instead of by 2042. This is not a new idea. Other places are doing it: Paris is doing it; Rome is doing it; Denmark is doing it; Sweden is doing it; Ireland is doing it. We can do it if we are serious. We can also create the conditions that help to spark new, modern cars, and provide the incentives and direction to have a modern public transport system.</p> <p pid="a88.0/15">I published my own Clean Air Bill a week ago, which also requires a fiscal strategy to support incentives and move people towards a sustainable transport future. It requires local parents and local people generally to be given information on the pollution levels at their child&#8217;s school, so that they can demand action. The Bill would also require the Environment Bill to include indoor air, which the previous iteration did not. Everybody here spends about 90% of our time indoors. How is it that we can have an Environment Bill that is only for outdoor air and is intended to focus on air pollution, given that these days people unfortunately encounter all sorts of toxins in their own homes&#8212;from chemicals in furniture, cleaning products, sprays, candles, you name it? These things  actually have a cocktail impact with outdoor air pollution, causing respiratory and inflammatory problems. Indoor air provisions need to be properly integrated in the Bill so that we can all be protected.</p> <p pid="a88.0/16">I also have a Plastics Bill&#8212;I am <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bill">Buffalo Bill</a>, me!&#8212;which provides that we should have clear aggregate targets for the amount of plastics we are allowed to have, as we do for the Climate Change Act for carbon. It also suggests a fiscal strategy, including the taxation of virgin plastic. Quite simply, plastic is too inexpensive. If it cost more to buy a plastic bottle than to get a reusable one, people would obviously not buy plastic ones.</p> <p pid="a88.0/17">On climate change itself, it is imperative that we move against fracking. The reality is that any extraction that emits more than 2% methane is worse than coal. Methane is about 85 times worse than carbon dioxide for global warming, and satellite imagery tells us that fracking generates 5% of fugitive emissions and leakages, making it nearly twice as bad as coal. It is just not a sustainable way forward. Some 80% of available fossil fuels cannot be exploited if we are to avoid irreversible climate change.</p> <p pid="a88.0/18">We now know that we are going to hit the 1.5&#176; C change not by 2040, but by 2030. That means that the zero carbon by 2050 target is already out of date. It is no good saying, &#8220;Oh well, we have done a really great job in Britain&#8221;, because the reason we have got our carbon emissions down so quickly in recent times is that we have closed the coalmines and exported our industry. We need to stop fracking. We need to come forward with a sustainable transport system. We need to have onshore wind. We need <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea_Bay">Swansea Bay</a> lagoon, in terms of wave power, and other lagoons, and we need to harness the sun&#8217;s energy as well.</p> <p pid="a88.0/19"><a href="/mp/?p=11437" title="Our page on Tobias Ellwood - 'The right hon. Member for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood)'">Mr Ellwood</a>, who sadly is not now <a href="/glossary/?gl=145" title="Of a male MP, sitting on his regular seat in the House. For females, &quot;in..." class="glossary">in his place</a>, talked about the importance, in a global environment, of holding our own in terms of cyber-attacks, the critical mass of our military, space and so on. All those arguments lent themselves to the need to act collectively within Europe to sustain our common values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. It is critically important for our influence, self-interest, security and prosperity, and for being unified, that we remain in the EU. It is incumbent on us to give the final say to the people of Britain: do they want this deal or do they want to stay with the deal they already have? We already know that they prefer to stay where they are, and the growing numbers of young people coming through feel that as well. We should be duty bound to give the deal back to the people for the final say.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a91.0/1">It is a pleasure to be called on the first day of this debate on the Loyal Address. In fact, never in the modern history of this Parliament has an intake of MPs had to wait so long between their first and second Gracious Speeches as those of us who were elected in 2017. It is fully 846 days since Her Majesty last addressed Parliament in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>, and 841 days since I spoke in that debate, delivering what was my <a href="/glossary/?gl=143" title="Maiden speech is the first formal speech made by an MP in the House of..." class="glossary">maiden speech</a>. That in itself is hard to believe, for in the interim, while so much has changed, so much, sadly, has remained the same.  On that stupefyingly hot June evening, after I had bored those unfortunate enough to be in the Chamber with my tour around Deeside, Donside, the Geerie, the Mearns and North Kincardine, I raised concerns that businesses and people in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Aberdeenshire_and_Kincardine">West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine</a>, and indeed around Scotland, needed certainty and stability in our country and in our economy. I concluded that evening by making this plea:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a91.0/2" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;What...this country&#8221; does</p> <p class="indent" pid="a91.0/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;not need is further uncertainty in the shape of another referendum on Europe or another <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a>, and they certainly do not need another referendum on Scottish independence.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2019-06-26">26 June</phrase> 2017; Vol. 626, c. 403.]</p> <p pid="a91.0/5">As I said, so much has changed, and yet, sadly, so much remains the same. For what have we heard from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> so far today? Sadly, it was almost exactly the same as we heard two and half years ago. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_SNP">The SNP</a> is obsessed as ever with referendums&#8212;so obsessed, in fact, that it is currently taking a referendums Bill through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a> to</p> <p class="indent" pid="a91.0/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;provide a legal framework for the holding of referendums on any matters within Scotland&#8217;s control.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a91.0/7">That is all well and good, except that the trouble is that the SNP has not yet worked out that the essential element for any referendum to have meaning is that the interested parties accept the result&#8212;it is not very hard. So here is a novel idea: how about, before inflicting further <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">division</a> and uncertainty on the people and businesses of Scotland, the SNP accepts the result of the two referendums held within the past five years and works with us to make membership of the United Kingdom, outside the EU, work for Scotland? Until that day, the SNP can never claim to be working in Scotland&#8217;s national interest, only for its own narrow political interests, and it can never claim to offer the certainty and stability being cried out for by businesses and people all across this country.</p> <p pid="a91.0/8">Then there is Labour, which, in the time it has taken the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> to negotiate two deals between this country and the European Union, has not even concluded negotiations within its own party, or even among its own Front Benchers. What is it this week? Is it a referendum and then an election or an election and then a referendum? Is it remain, is it leave, or is it a deal? Labour&#8212;a party with more plot twists than an episode of &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Housewives_of_Cheshire">The Real Housewives of Cheshire</a>&#8221;, except that it does not take a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagatha_Christie">Wagatha Christie</a> to work out who is stabbing who in the back in this augmented reality. As for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>, they have nothing to offer other than ripping up the result of a referendum that they were one of the first parties to call for.</p> <p pid="a91.0/9">As the late <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_MacLeod">Iain MacLeod</a> so memorably put it, the socialists can scheme their schemes and the liberals can dream their dreams, but we at least have work to do. So while the other parties in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> have spent two years obsessed with plots, schemes and ways of trying to bring this Government down and deny the will of the British people, we did get to work. First under the leadership of my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10426" title="Our page on Theresa May - 'the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)'">Mrs May</a> and now under the current <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, this party and this Government have been delivering for all the peoples of our United Kingdom, including&#8212;and, I would say, especially&#8212;for Scotland. This Conservative Government have delivered over &#163;900 million extra funding for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government">Scottish Government</a>, meaning that the  Scottish Government&#8217;s budget will have increased in real terms to &#163;32 billion by 2020. We have delivered city and regional growth deals across the country. We have frozen spirits duty, supporting our vital Scotch whisky industry. We have had <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAT">VAT</a> lifted from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Scotland">Police Scotland</a> and the Scottish fire and rescue service.</p> <p pid="a91.0/10">We have continued to support our oil and gas sector, to the tune of &#163;2.3 billion, maintaining our globally competitive position and making the North sea basin the most attractive basin in the world in which to invest, while introducing the transferable tax history mechanism. We have recently righted the wrong&#8212;and I admit that it was wrong&#8212;of convergence uplift money not getting to Scotland&#8217;s farmers by delivering not just &#163;160 million to them but an additional &#163;51 million to ensure a fair funding settlement for the agriculture industry across our United Kingdom. Unemployment is at its lowest level in half a century and youth unemployment is at its lowest level ever. We have taken millions of the lowest paid out of tax altogether, cut tax for millions of others, and ensured that military personnel will not be punished financially solely for being based in Scotland, combating at least in part the regressive and failing policy of taxing middle-income earners more for doing the same job north of the border than they would be in any other part of our United Kingdom. In doing this, we are also the first major economy to commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, cementing our place as a global leader in the fight against climate change.</p>            </div>

What is happening in this House is that those of us who are <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_MPs">Scottish MPs</a> are actively excluded from decision making processes.

Friend will be amazed to hear that I agree 100% with what he says.</p> <p pid="a94.1/2">Today, in this bold, ambitious and positive one nation Queen&#8217;s Speech, we, this Government, outlined how we will be investing in our NHS, investing in culture, investing in schools and investing in our police&#8212;all of which, of course, means extra funding for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government">Scottish Government</a> to spend on priorities north of the border, benefiting constituents in my part of the world. These are the actions of a bold Conservative Government governing for all and delivering for the peoples of our whole nation&#8212;our one nation. The term, &#8220;one nation&#8221;, is bandied about quite liberally these days. You will know, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>, that it comes first from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a> in his novel, &#8220;Sybil&#8221;, which I remember struggling through at university. Through the young Chartist, Morley, he first spoke about how in this country there existed:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a94.1/3" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Two nations; <br><strong>between</strong> whom there is no intercourse and no sympathy; <br><strong>who</strong> are as ignorant of each other&#8217;s habits, thoughts, and feelings, as if they were dwellers in different zones, or inhabitants of different planets&#8221;.</p> <p pid="a94.1/4">He was talking about the gap between the rich and poor of mid-<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Britain">Victorian Britain</a>, but it is a sad fact that Britain today seems at times like a country as divided as anything that Disraeli may have imagined&#8212;between remainer and Brexiteer, dealer and no-dealer. Although they are all of our one United Kingdom, it seems at times we have before us two nations between which, again, there is no intercourse or sympathy. I know that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of Members across the House are as concerned about this situation as I am&#8212;a situation where Members who simply hold differing opinions can be called traitors, and where simply because a person seeks a different outcome, they can be classed as an enemy.</p> <p pid="a94.1/5">There is only one way to bring this country back together and to end this interminable and angry debate which is doing such damage to the body politic and to public debate in this country, and that is to deliver on the will of the British people, as expressed in the referendum in 2016&#8212;not at any cost, but to support a deal and support this Government, to leave the European Union on good terms. That surely must be the resolution of this House. There is simply no other credible option. Only then can we reunite this country, move on and get on with delivering this bold, ambitious and truly one nation agenda, which I for one look forward to arguing for and implementing.</p>            </div>

Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25746" title="Our page on Ruth Jones - 'the Member for Newport West (Ruth Jones)'">Ruth Jones</a>, I know that Paul is in our thoughts, and it was lovely to hear those tributes.</p> <p pid="a94.2/2">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> quoted Newport&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldie_Lookin_Chain">Goldie Lookin Chain</a> earlier, which was one of the stranger moments in my time here&#8212;and I say that having been an <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Whip for the last couple of years.

My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10259" title="Our page on David Hanson - 'the Member for Delyn (David Hanson)'">David Hanson</a>, who made an excellent contribution, was right to say that we just do not know what on Saturday we will be voting on, and I say that on behalf of the steelworkers, the Airbus workers, the food producers and more in my constituency. But I cannot let today go by without mentioning a number of issues that are important to my constituents. There is much to say, but I will include the lack of a credible green deal to tackle the climate emergency; an economy that does not work for many in our country, with more children, families and pensioners living in poverty; and the lack of action for the 1950s-born women hit by pension changes, many of whom are in real poverty in my constituency.</p> <p pid="a94.2/4">I also want to focus on the Government&#8217;s lack of measures to support the manufacturing sector and the fact that there was nothing of note to say on steel. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> spoke today of a &#8220;new age of opportunity&#8221;, and he has spoken previously about his vision for the UK to become the home of electric vehicles. As laudable as those warm words are, it is crucial that the Government act on that if we are to truly make the UK the home of electric vehicles. That should include a proper commitment to build a UK supply chain for electric cars.</p> <p pid="a94.2/5">That action needs to be fast, because on <phrase class="date" code="2019-09-02">2 September</phrase> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Steel">Tata Steel</a> said that it would close Cogent Power&#8217;s Orb works in my constituency on <phrase class="date" code="2019-12-20">20 December</phrase>. The works is part of the fabric of Newport and its history, having been there since 1898, and it employs 380 people on site. But this is not about the past; it is about the future. This is the only plant in the UK producing electrical steel. With investment, it could make electrical steel for electric vehicles, allowing the UK to have an end-to-end supply chain. If we lose this plant, we will lose that chance and have to import the steel for electric motors.</p>            </div>

He is right, and it is a point I will come on to make. These are speciality steels, and we cannot afford to lose the capacity to make them.</p> <p pid="a95.1/2">There is a plan to save the plant. Community union and its consultants, Syndex, are calling for Tata to reinvest money from the sale of Cogent Power Inc in Canada into the Orb and for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> to help by investing &#163;30 million. That would be just a small proportion of the total the Government have awarded <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_Land_Rover">Jaguar Land Rover</a>, which is owned by Tata, which has secured a &#163;500 million loan guarantee to help the company sell electric vehicles.</p> <p pid="a95.1/3">We need concerted investment in the electric vehicle supply chain. Orb can be a vital cog in the wheel. It can be part of the infrastructure strategy that the Government alluded to in the Queen&#8217;s Speech. If we did that, we could save the only electrical steel plant in the UK, which could and should have a bright future as demand for electric vehicles is only set to grow. Labour has said that we will accelerate the electric vehicle revolution with 2.5 million interest-free loans for the purchase of electric vehicles, a new requirement for the Government car fleet to be 100% electric by 2025 and action on the private fleet.</p>            </div>

Gentleman for that <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>. Electrical steel can also be part of electric charging points, so it all goes together.</p> <p pid="a96.1/2">The Labour party is determined to ensure that the right conditions are in place for this revolution, and the Government should be too. If the Orb works is not kept open, the potential to build a supply chain will be squandered, and it is not an overstatement to say that the UK could lose its capacity to be a global leader in electric car manufacturing.</p> <p pid="a96.1/3">Developing a supply chain will be hugely important for the national balance of trade too. Across the UK, there are 10,000 workers making internal combustion engines, and the Community union has emphasised that a failure to develop the supply chain will result in a loss in the export value of those engines, which will be replaced by the import cost of electric motors. Where is the vision from this Government? If they are serious about making the UK the home of electric vehicles, they will work with Tata to step in and save this plant.</p> <p pid="a96.1/4">What is there in this Queen&#8217;s Speech to help the wider steel industry? There is no action. Where is the sector deal? Where is the support on energy prices? Where is the concrete action on procurement? The Steel Council has not even met since June 2018, and we need it to now. I would like to thank the hundreds of people who marched this weekend to save Orb steel, including many of my hon. Friends, and I hope that the show of support was noted by Ministers. Can the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> here today relay to the Steel Minister that he needs to be proactive and promise to engage with Community, Syndex and Tata to secure this plant&#8217;s future?</p> <p pid="a96.1/5">While there are promises in the Queen&#8217;s Speech to increase police funding and some powers, it is the Conservative party that has been soft on crime by relentlessly cutting funding for police and the criminal  justice system. Since the start of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a>&#8217;s austerity programme in 2010-11, the Gwent police budget has been reduced by 40% in real terms. As the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10001" title="Our page on Diane Abbott - 'the Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)'">Ms Abbott</a>, said,</p> <p class="indent" pid="a96.1/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;cuts have consequences, and now the Tories are trying to pretend the consequences have nothing to do with them.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a96.1/7">The police and crime commissioner for Gwent has confirmed that they are still waiting for clarity on funding. He said that while it appears that the first year will be funded by central Government, there are still concerns about the Government expecting them to raise more through the precept, which would fall on local taxpayers.</p> <p pid="a96.1/8">We need the Government to address how increased pension costs associated with the programme will be funded and, equally importantly, we need a long-term commitment. Our police and communities have been let down badly since 2010, and we need a Government who will show by their actions how much they really value the contributions of our police officers and staff and ensure that they are always properly resourced and protected. As my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10761" title="Our page on Chris Bryant - 'the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)'">Chris Bryant</a> said, we need to ensure that his Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018 is used to help our emergency service workers.</p> <p pid="a96.1/9"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen">The Queen</a>&#8217;s Speech had very little to say for Wales and nothing to say about addressing the perennial underfunding of Welsh rail infrastructure. Welsh routes make up 11% of the UK network but receive only about 6% of UK rail funding. Cross-border services between Newport, Severn Tunnel junction and Bristol are of strategic importance to the economies of Wales and the south-west, and they need to be improved for the sake of passengers who are paying more and more just to get to work in the morning. I regularly receive complaints from constituents who have to make do with severely overcrowded short-formed services. I call again on the UK Government to allow the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Government">Welsh Government</a> to develop new cross-border services. The current restrictions on their doing so are ill thought out and it is rail passengers who are paying the price.</p> <p pid="a96.1/10">Although I note the Government&#8217;s belated intention for new franchises to concentrate on performance and reliability, I ask them please not to forget the issue of rail fares. Passengers face a deeply unfair 2.8% increase in rail fares next January, and average fares are 40% higher than they were in 2010. If the Government are serious about climate change measures, forcing people off the railways due to cost and discomfort is not the right way to go about it. It is completely wrong that commuters are paying for services that are all too often overcrowded and unreliable. I support Labour&#8217;s sensible call to bring our railways back into public ownership, run for passengers not profit.</p> <p pid="a96.1/11">This Queen&#8217;s Speech is nothing more than a party political broadcast and is just a wish list that the Government have no means to deliver.</p>            </div>

I congratulate my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25685" title="Our page on Lee Rowley - 'the Member for North East Derbyshire (Lee Rowley)'">Lee Rowley</a>&#8212;he is also my actual friend, regardless of  the labels we have to give each other in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>&#8212;on moving the Loyal Address. His speech was an excellent example of his advocacy for his <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>. I always take great interest in his speeches because he happens to be my nan&#8217;s MP and she likes to hear about everything he says in the Chamber about Dronfield. I listened intently to him and I will feed back to her that he has done a fantastic job for his constituents today. She is probably watching <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_TV">Parliament TV</a>; she is that kind of nan.</p> <p pid="a97.0/2">The key thing laid out at the start of the Gracious Speech is that we need to get Brexit done on <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-31">31 October</phrase>. Despite the challenges put in the way of that by <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members, nobody in my constituency, as far as I can tell, is desperate for more delay and uncertainty. Mansfield and Warsop voted 71% to leave. People tell me all the time that they are desperate to get the thing done and to get out, come what may. A handful of people tell me that they do not want to leave but would like a decision to be made. However, I have yet to meet on the doorstep in my constituency anyone who is desperate for a further six, nine or 12 months of delay and non-decision from this place over something that they decided three years ago.</p> <p pid="a97.0/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen">The Queen</a>&#8217;s Speech lays out the opportunities to make the most and take advantage of being outside the European Union. It seeks to legislate on agriculture, trade, financial services, immigration and lots of other issues that we can tackle, with our own interests at heart, outside the European Union. That is the right thing to do&#8212;to leave at the end of this month and to embark on a brave new era of global Britain, as it is often called, outside the European Union.</p> <p pid="a97.0/4">I want to focus on the domestic policies in the Queen&#8217;s Speech. As the co-chair, along with my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24882" title="Our page on Esther McVey - 'the Member for Tatton (Ms McVey)'">Ms McVey</a>, of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Collar_Conservatism">Blue Collar Conservatism</a> group in Parliament, I want to celebrate in particular the focus on crime and policing, which is the issue that most regularly crosses my desk as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a> for Mansfield and Warsop. We have pushed for more officers on the streets and for the police covenant, which seeks to protect and support the mental health of officers in the back room and behind the scenes. They are both now Government policy, which is fantastic. For those priorities to have come from my constituents is amazing. That is how our Blue Collar Conservatism movement works. We went out and asked people across the midlands and the north of the country what they wanted to see, and those issues were at the top of the agenda. Now they are Government policy and we are genuinely driving forward to improve people&#8217;s safety in our communities to make sure that we feel safer on the streets and in our homes than we do now. That is fantastic.</p> <p pid="a97.0/5">The focus on ensuring that sentencing truly fits the crime, particularly in the most serious violent and sexual offences, is hugely important to my constituents. Equally, I advocate the additional rights of and security for victims of crime, as outlined in the Gracious Speech. I think that its priorities are absolutely right. That is my own personal perspective, but they are also important for the country.</p> <p pid="a97.0/6">I am also pleased that education in schools continues to be at the top of our agenda. Before I came to this place, I wanted to be a teacher. I failed miserably, so I became a politician. Since I have been here, I have talked  consistently about the need for more resources for our schools. I think that is the right thing to do. I personally thank the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Secretary">Education Secretary</a> for announcing this week that every single school in my constituency will receive a significant increase in funding from September. In some cases, it will be as much as an 11% increase in per pupil funding, which will be fantastic. Those receiving the highest increases tend to be from the most deprived parts of my constituency, where the funding will be most effective and most needed.</p> <p pid="a97.0/7">Not only that, but there is &#163;700 million in additional funding for special educational needs; in Mansfield and Warsop, we have a particularly high concentration of those additional challenges on our educational resources, which have impacted on school budgets in recent years. The extra breathing space will allow local schools to give those kids from deprived communities the experiences that they need from our education system&#8212;sport, art and school trips: the things that most of us in this place will probably have taken for granted, but that so many at schools across the country do not get to experience. That is hugely important.</p> <p pid="a97.0/8">Among the other <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> of note in the Queen&#8217;s Speech is the one relating to fairness in employment practices. That will also hit home with many of my constituents. A huge proportion of the workforce in my constituency are in retail, where wages are not high compared with the national average. That security and fairness in both work and pensions arrangements in today&#8217;s Queen&#8217;s Speech will be important.</p> <p pid="a97.0/9">I turn to the environment, which is important to us all. We have all recently been reminded of the challenge by the goings on outside this place. I, for one, believe that we can improve our environment in a positive way, through channelling and investing in modern, clean technologies, changing consumer habits and looking at the long-term routes to delivering on the zero carbon emissions target. We can do that without glueing ourselves to vehicles and telling all our children that we are doomed. There is a positive way forward to deliver on that agenda. As has been pointed out by many in this debate, we are doing that&#8212;we are among the leading countries in the world in seeking to improve and safeguard our environment for future generations.</p> <p pid="a97.0/10">I sat here listening to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a>&#8217;s speech. It is difficult to say what a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> would be for; I hear more about what they would be against. I surmise from his speech today that he is for shorter sentences for vicious criminals; for uncontrolled immigration; for more schoolkids going on strike; for a free ride on electoral fraud; for seizing private property, from private schools initially&#8212;the thin end of the wedge, which should put fear into the hearts of anybody who owns anything in this country; and for more Brexit delay and uncertainty. I hate to point out to the right hon. Gentleman that none of those things is going to go down particularly well in my constituency and many others like it across the country.</p> <p pid="a97.0/11">I am not entirely sure what the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition">Leader of the Opposition</a> is for, but I do know that this Parliament is fundamentally broken, as we have said many times over recent months. It has not been able to make a decision and, given a <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of minus 43, it is unlikely now to be able to  make a decision on anything. At times, the atmosphere in this place has been absolutely toxic, particularly on Brexit. The reality is that a lot of things coming forward in the Queen&#8217;s Speech and the long-term issues that affect our country cannot be decided in this environment&#8212;they need long-term collaboration and cross-party working, which has been impossible in recent months.</p> <p pid="a97.0/12">Social care, for example, needs a long-term solution&#8212;we need to get together across the House and agree a plan. In recent years, such issues have been weaponised and turned into election issues. A number of Members have said that the Government have not come forward with any plans on social care. That is not true: we did during the 2017 election. A policy that said we would keep more of our money through a new form of funding was dubbed &#8220;the dementia tax&#8221;, shot down and made politically impossible, rather than there having been a sensible conversation about the pros and cons of the policy and how we might move it forward. Until we get Brexit done and we can change the atmosphere and have a new election and a new Parliament, which might be more conducive to those discussions, these things will be incredibly difficult. I hope that that will happen over the next few months.</p> <p pid="a97.0/13">I welcome the positive domestic agenda, which includes key priorities such as crime, schools and regional investment that are so important to my constituents in Mansfield and Warsop. I live for the day, post Brexit, when we can get on with delivering it.</p>            </div>

Member for Mansfield (Ben Bradley)'">Ben Bradley</a>, another Nottinghamshire MP; if nothing else, we are united in our determination to fight hard for the county that we are both proud to represent. I am afraid that I must disabuse him of some of his final comments about &#8220;getting Brexit done&#8221;. We hear many things said about Brexit, and most of it is inaccurate when it comes from those who still seek to make the case for the hardest form of Brexit&#8212;a no-deal Brexit. Even if the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, notwithstanding tonight&#8217;s news that a deal is not possible in any event by Saturday, got a deal, and even if it passed through this Parliament&#8212;rather than there being the confirmatory referendum that I and many others would like&#8212;the idea that Brexit would miraculously be done, and that that would be the end of it, is for the birds.</p> <p pid="a100.0/2">If the hon. Gentleman and many other <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_MPs">Conservative MPs</a> had only applied themselves to all the great debates that have taken place in this Chamber, they would know why so many of us did not vote for the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8217;s deal. I think that he did not vote for the deal until the final occasion; on the two previous occasions he chose to vote against it. But never mind that. If he had actually listened to the voices of those who, like me, voted against the former Prime Minister&#8217;s deal, he would know that one of the primary reasons we were so against it was because it did not actually tell us what our final relationship with the European Union would be. That deal was nothing more than a leap in the dark: a blindfold Brexit, as many of us called it. In particular, it did not settle that final trading relationship.</p> <p pid="a100.0/3">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracious_Address">Gracious Address</a>, or the Queen&#8217;s Speech to use that parlance, is nothing more than a small box of sweeties put together and assembled to try to persuade  the British people, particularly people in the midlands and the north, in the event of a <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a>, to vote Conservative on the back of apparently having delivered Brexit. In many respects, it is nothing more than a dog whistle to some of the most base of our prejudices and fears. In my experience, it will not deliver. In a moment, I will explain that, particularly in relation to crime, of which, as a former criminal barrister, I have some understanding. It was a very sorry speech which, to sum up its failings, offered no vision whatever. It did not even begin to embrace the many problems we have, Brexit aside, to look to the future and to offer hope, in particular to young people.</p> <p pid="a100.0/4">As we all know, if we do not have a good strong economy, we cannot do all the other things that we seek to do, whether that is to invest in our services or to invest back into our economy to make sure that our people prosper and that we can, in turn, pay for those services. Where was the reboot that our economy so desperately needs? Where were the reforms for business, which it has been crying out for now for a number of years? It was nothing more than spend, spend, spend. It is incredible that Conservative Members supporting the Queen&#8217;s Speech have the audacity to criticise the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a>&#8212;rightly when they look to magic money trees that do not exist&#8212;when the Government are embarking on exactly the same folly: making promises to spend money that is not there. As we know, the Government&#8217;s own assessment shows that, whichever way you do Brexit, it will reduce our future prosperity and reduce jobs. That is the Government&#8217;s own assessment.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a101.1/1">No. I completely agree. There was nothing for businesses of any size, or indeed in any sectors. I have listened to the debate over the past two hours. I remember the comments of <a href="/mp/?p=11437" title="Our page on Tobias Ellwood - 'the right hon. Member for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood)'">Mr Ellwood</a>, who sadly is no longer <a href="/glossary/?gl=145" title="Of a male MP, sitting on his regular seat in the House. For females, &quot;in..." class="glossary">in his place</a>. He celebrated the successes of the manufacturing sector&#8212;he talked about pharmaceuticals, for example&#8212;yet nowhere in the Queen&#8217;s Speech is there any measure, not one, to mitigate what will happen if we leave the single market and the customs union. The just-in-time supply chains absolutely rely on, depend on and have been created from that single market.</p> <p pid="a101.1/2">Ironically, the single market found its greatest supporter in the former <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and former leader of the Conservative party, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>. We all know that, without the single market and the customs union, our manufacturing sector&#8212;the 450,000 jobs, by way of example, in the automotive sector&#8212;will be particularly badly hit. There is no plan and no vision of how to mitigate the harm that Brexit will do to our society. It is about not just the manufacturing jobs, but what will happen to the 80% of our economy that relies on the service sector, as well as, of course, what I celebrate: the free movement of people throughout the European  Union and the huge benefits that that has given to our economy. We have had no real plans there and no real solution.</p> <p pid="a101.1/3">Looking at the lack of investment, notably, in our infrastructure, as I said to the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, I am concerned that there is no mention of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HS2">HS2</a> phase 2b: the line that goes through my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, with the east midlands hub at Toton, and then goes up to Leeds. I am sorry that <a href="/mp/?p=10228" title="Our page on Dame Cheryl Gillan - 'the right hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Dame Cheryl Gillan)'">Dame Cheryl Gillan</a> is not <a href="/glossary/?gl=144" title="Of a female MP, sitting on her regular seat in the House. For males, &quot;in..." class="glossary">in her place</a>. I did not intervene on her because this is not really a debate about HS2, but HS2 is not just about taking people to London. In my constituency, it is about taking people up to Sheffield, to Birmingham and to Leeds, about providing the essential connectivity that is at the heart of a modern public transport system and about the ability to bring all these pieces together. HS2 plays a critical part in that. It provides the extra capacity and is an engine for growth. We know that, wherever those hubs exist&#8212;we have seen this from other examples in France and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HS1">HS1</a>&#8212;we find the new skilled jobs, the new exciting world of work, that can be built around that connectivity with all that it gives.</p> <p pid="a101.1/4">I pay tribute to the comments of <a href="/mp/?p=11732" title="Our page on Jessica Morden - 'the hon. Member for Newport East (Jessica Morden)'">Jessica Morden</a>, who rightly talks about the value of investing in electric cars. She speaks with passion about her constituency and what that would mean for her. We certainly want people to use public transport, if we are going to achieve these hard targets that we have set ourselves for climate change, but we also need to make sure that our cars are electric. One per cent. is certainly not enough. When I was a Minister in the old Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, I sat on the inter-ministerial group for the electrification of vehicles. We had so many plans and ideas, looking at the development of battery, research and the implementation of the chargers that must be put in over the full length of the United Kingdom, as my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=13864" title="Our page on Jim Shannon - 'the Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)'">Jim Shannon</a> said. None of this work has been done. Everything has been glued up with the process of Brexit. My fear is that, if we leave the EU, it will still not get any better because we will see the harm and damage that will be done to our economy.</p> <p pid="a101.1/5">Services rely on a successful and growing economy, but I do not think there is anything to encourage businesses to grow in this Queen&#8217;s Speech. Without those services being properly funded, we simply will not be making the investment that we have to make as a nation. One of the great joys of the time that we are in recess, especially in the September break&#8212;and about the only benefit of the unlawful <a href="/glossary/?gl=231" title="Prorogation takes the form of an announcement on behalf of the Queen by the..." class="glossary">Prorogation</a>&#8212;is that it gives us all an opportunity to visit our schools and really put that effort in. That is one of the things that I did, and it is simply not acceptable in this day and age that, for example, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilwell_School">Chilwell School</a> in my constituency, which was built in the late &#8217;60s&#8212;flat-roofed, under the old <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consortium_of_Local_Authorities_Special_Programme">Consortium of Local Authorities Special Programme</a> system&#8212;is not fit for purpose. That is not good enough. It does not inspire young people and does not help a school that is desperately seeking to improve its standards and to offer all children the greatest opportunity to reach their full potential.</p> <p pid="a101.1/6">I also went to Foxwood Academy, for children with special needs, which, again, was built in the early &#8217;70s under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLASP">CLASP</a> system. It has corridors that are not even  wide enough properly to accommodate wheelchairs. This is a special school, with flat roofs. Again, it absolutely not fit for purpose. The deep irony is that only last week we heard from the Government that they were spending &#163;8 billion on no-deal Brexit preparations, which would provide 400 brand spanking new schools throughout the United Kingdom&#8212;schools that are needed.</p> <p pid="a101.1/7">The hon. Member for Mansfield talked about social care. He wrongly said that we do not work cross-party in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>: we absolutely do. Maybe the problem is that he has not taken part in that enough. For years now people have talked about the need to work cross-party to achieve real changes in social care for our elderly population and that still has not taken place. I suggest that there are still no plans in the Queen&#8217;s Speech. We are not meeting the needs of our elderly, or of those children and young people with special needs.</p> <p pid="a101.1/8">We need big, bold, imaginative government to deal with the challenges of climate change and we need rigour. The party that I have the pleasure of leading&#8212;a small band but nevertheless important&#8212;takes the view that the target for complete carbon neutrality should be 2040. That is the rigour that is now needed.</p> <p pid="a101.1/9">I know the clock is against me, but I am nearly done&#8212;</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a103.1/1">I am grateful, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>.</p> <p pid="a103.1/2">We talk a great deal in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> about Brexit, but the one thing that we have not talked about&#8212;or actually addressed&#8212;is the causes of Brexit. I want a democratic revolution. What happened to the commitment in the 2010 manifesto that I was proud to stand on as a Conservative under the leadership of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron">David Cameron</a>? It included a promise that we would reduce the number of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a> and look at the boundaries to make sure that all constituencies were properly represented and we had a fairer system. That has completely gone.</p> <p pid="a103.1/3">I would go further and have a radical reform of local government. One size does not necessarily fit all, and I pay tribute to the courage of Conservative borough councillors in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> who did the right thing by making the case&#8212;bizarre though it may sound&#8212;for the abolition of the very borough council that they sit on. Like the hon. Member for Mansfield, they recognise that we need a new unitary system in the county of Nottinghamshire. We also need a much stronger role for our parish and town councils, if we take out the district and borough council levels in our county authorities. We need to put power back into the hands of local councillors who will represent people at a parish or town level. Give them more power and the ability to raise money, because they will spend it wisely on their communities whom they directly represent.</p> <p pid="a103.1/4">While I am on the subject of a democratic revolution, we have to have honesty in politics now. The trust between us and the electorate has been broken. Long before Brexit, people were disillusioned and fed up. One of the reasons was that too many politicians, especially in this place, were not honest with people about the  tough choices they faced. They promised everything&#8212;often admirable things which could never be delivered in reality. That pragmatic and honest approach is needed.</p> <p pid="a103.1/5">To be honest&#8212;it might get me into trouble with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Post">Nottingham Post</a>&#8212;the city of Nottingham should expand. If we were being honest about how to do things better in the city, that is what we would say. But if we do, we run the risk of headlines and criticism. That lack of honesty is one of the reasons why the immigration debate is in the pitiful state it is and&#8212;at its heart&#8212;is why we have Brexit. Too many politicians could not be trusted to have an open, honest debate based on evidence. On that basis, we look at the Conservative party and see the drift to the right&#8212;</p>            </div>

It was a true honour to be in Parliament today when she delivered her Gracious Speech, and it is an honour to be in this Chamber to speak tonight.</p> <p pid="a104.3/2">I have been a <a href="/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a> for two years, four months and six days&#8212;two, four, six&#8212;and I genuinely believe that the vast <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of people who go into politics do so because they want to make a difference. Where we see good things happen in our constituencies, we want to replicate them. Where we see bad things happen, we want to eradicate them. We want to move forward, and yet, for the past two years, four months and six days, I have often felt that we are going round and round in circles. Every Wednesday, when we meet for <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>&#8217;s <a href="/glossary/?gl=25" title="Question Time is an opportunity for MPs and Members of the House of Lords..." class="glossary">Question Time</a>, it feels like yet another groundhog day. This week gives us a chance: a chance for hope, a chance to end that merry-go-round, a chance to get that first phase of Brexit done and move on&#8212;and people across the country are crying out for us to move on.</p> <p pid="a104.3/3">I voted remain, but I know it is vital for our democracy that we respect the fact that we gave people the vote, and we should deliver on that vote. However, I also know that the EU is our largest trading partner, and that many EU countries are our closest allies. No deal is not a good deal. It is not good for the UK, it is not good for the EU, and it is certainly not good for Ireland. I urge everyone who is involved in the negotiations today&#8212;I see that the Under-<a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Exiting  the European Union, my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=11785" title="Our page on James Duddridge - 'the Member for Rochford and Southend East (James Duddridge)'">James Duddridge</a>, is here&#8212;to roll up their sleeves, to work night and day, to be creative and to find compromises, and I urge everyone in the House to take the same approach. I say to certain Members&#8212;particularly the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a>, who just loves the chaos, and who wants more confusion because he is feeding on it for his own political gain&#8212;"History will not forgive you. I urge you to back a deal and end the chaos.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a104.3/4">This has been our longest Session. The Queen&#8217;s Speech contains much positive news&#8212;news of investment in the NHS, in infrastructure, in schools, in the police and, of course, in caring for our environment&#8212;but sometimes, in order to appreciate where we are and where we need to go, it is necessary to look at where we have come from. I remember when, 10 years ago, the Conservative Government took over from Labour. Our country was suffering a massive economic failure. Our country had some of the highest levels of debt in the world. Our country was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. Our country had run out of money. Reducing public spending was not an ideological mission; it was done because Labour had blown all the cash.</p> <p pid="a104.3/5">Rebuilding our economy meant supporting entrepreneurs, backing innovators, and making sure that we were at the forefront of some of the fastest-growing sectors&#8212;the tech revolution, financial services, science and research, and the space sector&#8212;because those were the sectors that were driving investment and creating opportunity. The harsh reality is that 10 years ago, 1 million young people were not in employment, education or training. They had been left by Labour on the edge of society, with no opportunity. Yet this year, in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, 650 people started apprenticeships.</p> <p pid="a104.3/6">Ten years ago, one in five young people had no job; today we have record employment and record youth employment. Government do not create jobs, businesses do, but it is up to us to create the environment that allows our economy to flourish, and it is because of those policies that we are in the position today to give the opportunities offered in this Queen&#8217;s Speech.</p> <p pid="a104.3/7">First, there is the record investment in our NHS. We know that the NHS needs a long-term vision. In Chelmsford we need more GPs, but that is why we have built a new medical school that is already training them. And we know that a long-term plan needs to come from the bottom up, which is why I am so pleased that the NHS long-term plan is written not by politicians but by physicians and frontline health professionals, and our Queen&#8217;s Speech gives us the opportunity to turn that plan into reality.</p> <p pid="a104.3/8">Before coming here I helped to finance infrastructures all over our country, all over Europe and all over the middle east and Africa, and infrastructure in this country is creaking. As I said in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=143" title="Maiden speech is the first formal speech made by an MP in the House of..." class="glossary">maiden speech</a>, people in Chelmsford spend too much time in traffic jams and on delayed trains; it is a waste of their time and it is a waste of our country&#8217;s productivity. I am honoured to chair the all-party group on infrastructure in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>, and I am pleased to see the national infrastructure strategy right at the heart of the Queen&#8217;s Speech.</p> <p pid="a104.3/9">In my constituency of Chelmsford we have many excellent schools, and I am constantly impressed by the standards of their students and the dedication of their teachers. Our schools have been under pressure in Essex:  costs have increased and the number of pupils with special educational needs in my county has gone up by nearly 22%. Budgets are strained, and I am pleased that the Queen&#8217;s Speech gives that vital boost to our education, levels up the funding and gives the extra funding for special educational needs.</p> <p pid="a104.3/10">On crime and policing, it is no secret that over the past decade Essex police were under-resourced, but in the past two years moves have been made to rectify that, thanks to the Government&#8217;s changing the funding stream and to our excellent police, fire and crime commissioner, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Hirst">Roger Hirst</a>, who has made it possible for us to already be recruiting 368 more police, with another extra 135 promised by the Essex <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a> just last week. We have city centre policing and more power for police, and in this Queen&#8217;s Speech we are also going to be making that extra effort to protect the most vulnerable in our society, the victims of <a href="/glossary/?gl=140" title="violence occurring within the family" class="glossary">domestic violence</a>.</p> <p pid="a104.3/11">Finally, I want to talk about climate change. Our country has reduced emissions faster than any other large economy in the world. We are the first major economy to set net zero in our law; we are leading the world on renewables, especially offshore; we are leading the global fight against coal; and we are leading the global work to protect the poorest countries on our planet. We are also now leading the efforts to protect the world&#8217;s oceans: this tiny island is going to be protecting a third of the world&#8217;s oceans within the next decade.</p> <p pid="a104.3/12">Of course there is more to do.</p>            </div>

It is often referred to as the north-south divide, but it goes way beyond simplistic narratives about particular regions of our country. It is fundamentally about fairness. I simply do not believe that the policies announced in the Queen&#8217;s Speech will address the fundamental unfairness that means that if you live in certain parts of the country, you get a much rougher deal than those living elsewhere.</p> <p pid="a106.2/2">First, however, I would like to mention another issue. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen">The Queen</a>&#8217;s Speech included a new sentencing Bill, but it is extremely disappointing that the Government have still not honoured their previous commitment to bring in tougher sentences for causing death by dangerous driving. In fact, that is more than disappointing; it is a disgrace.   The families of those killed by dangerous drivers have waited for over two years for changes to be made. They believed that their tragic circumstances could at least lead to a change in the law so that other families would not suffer as they had. The Government have yet to see those families find justice; they have let those families down. The Government must now come good on their promise and implement the tougher sentences without delay.</p> <p pid="a106.2/3">The Queen&#8217;s Speech does not do anywhere near enough on investment in the regions and communities of our country that have seen decades of underinvestment. Updated data on transport from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPPR_North">IPPR North</a> shows that, in both historical and future funding, the north of England is not getting its fair share. Over the past 10 years, annual per capita spending on transport in London has been &#163;739, compared with &#163;305 in the north, and that unfairness is set to continue. IPPR North estimates that current planned spending is nearly three times higher in London than in the north, and over seven times higher than in Yorkshire and the Humber. This Government have let the north down. Passengers on cramped Pacer trains between Bradford and Leeds know this, as do people waiting far too long for a bus that often does not turn up. So, whatever the Government say, however they present their figures, and whatever their narrative, we in the north know that we are still not getting our fair share.</p> <p pid="a106.2/4">Two major infrastructure projects are of vital importance to the north. On <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HS2">HS2</a>, it is disappointing&#8212;to say the least &#8212;that one of the possible outcomes of the Government&#8217;s review would be to scrap the eastern branch to Leeds and Sheffield. Phase 2b will bring enormous economic benefits to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Yorkshire">West Yorkshire</a>. It will also provide much of the infrastructure needed for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Powerhouse_Rail">Northern Powerhouse Rail</a>. HS2 and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR">NPR</a> must not be an either/or choice. We urgently need both to be delivered.</p>            </div>

Friend for that <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>&#8212;I think! I will continue with my speech.</p> <p pid="a107.1/2">I urge the Government to go ahead with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HS2">HS2</a> east at the same time as HS2 west. On <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Powerhouse_Rail">Northern Powerhouse Rail</a>, I must stress once again the vital importance of a city centre stop in Bradford. It would be an historic mistake to build an out-of-town station, which would risk denying the full benefits of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR">NPR</a> to the people of Bradford. I also say to the Government: make the funding available to bring this transformational project about, sooner rather than later. The people of the north have waited for too long for proper east-west rail connections, and they should not be made to wait for another generation.</p> <p pid="a107.1/3">Turning to the outstanding work taking place locally in Bradford to improve access to skilled jobs and training, I pay tribute once again to the Bradford manufacturing  week, whose launch I had the pleasure of attending last week in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>. This year&#8217;s event is twice the size of last year&#8217;s, with more than 40 secondary schools taking part and more than 6,000 manufacturing experiences delivered to local young people right across Bradford. Bradford and the north more generally have a great opportunity to lead a Bradford manufacturing renaissance, but we need the Government to listen to areas such as ours and to give us a skills system that is fully funded and that responds to local priorities. That is the way to provide prosperity to places such as my constituency of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_South">Bradford South</a>.</p> <p pid="a107.1/4">It has become something of a clich&#233; to talk about a divided nation, and it is certainly true that Brexit reveals some of the deep fault lines in our society. I firmly believe that we need national effort to reduce inequalities and to give everyone, whatever their background and wherever they live, the tools and opportunities they need to succeed. The Government must ensure that every part of our country gets its fair share of funding. For too long, the north of England has been held back by a failure of Government policy. Northerners will not stand by and let that happen any more. Invest in our infrastructure, properly fund our public services, and give us the tools to create a successful economy. That is what the north demands.</p>            </div>

Member for Bradford South (Judith Cummins)'">Judith Cummins</a>.</p> <p pid="a108.0/2">I rise to welcome today&#8217;s Queen&#8217;s Speech because it lays the foundations for delivering Brexit and ending some of the uncertainty that has affected our country over the past three years. As a Member who voted to trigger article 50 and against delays, that is what the country needs. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen">The Queen</a>&#8217;s Speech also outlines investment in the public services that my residents in Havant rely on&#8212;our police, our schools and our health service&#8212;which is why I am pleased to support it today.</p> <p pid="a108.0/3">I congratulate my hon. Friends the Members for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_Derbyshire">North East Derbyshire</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Rowley">Lee Rowley</a>) and for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truro_and_Falmouth">Truro and Falmouth</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Newton">Sarah Newton</a>) on moving and seconding the Loyal Address eloquently and powerfully.</p> <p pid="a108.0/4">As this new Session begins with a new Government and a relatively new <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, it is important to re-emphasise that investment in technology and science is how this country will secure its prosperity and security after we deliver Brexit. Contrary to <a href="/mp/?p=24772" title="Our page on Anna Soubry - 'the right hon. Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry)'">Anna Soubry</a>, I think that the Queen&#8217;s Speech looks to the future and offers something for communities across the whole country.</p> <p pid="a108.0/5">Looking at Brexit specifically, the seven pieces of legislation in the Queen&#8217;s Speech will create a new regulatory framework for agriculture, fisheries and financial services, and it is right that this Queen&#8217;s Speech gets our statute book ready for Brexit.</p> <p pid="a108.0/6">I welcome the new environment Bill, which, as my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25614" title="Our page on Vicky Ford - 'the Member for Chelmsford (Vicky Ford)'">Vicky Ford</a> rightly said, will enshrine in law important measures to cut air pollution, to reduce plastic usage, and to improve the quality of our water.</p> <p pid="a108.0/7">I am pleased that the Domestic Abuse Bill was carried over from the previous Session. Charities such as Stop Domestic Abuse in Havant do important work in this field, and the new Bill will help them.</p> <p pid="a108.0/8">The police covenant is also being put into law, rightly recognising the bravery and commitment of our police. When I went out with a local response unit in Havant, it was humbling to see the commitment and hard work that they put in day in and day out to keep our communities safe.</p> <p pid="a108.0/9">On an extremely positive note, I was pleased to see the medicines and medical devices Bill, which will give the NHS access to the most innovative medicines. The Bill follows a trend of innovation and the adoption of innovation started by my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=11859" title="Our page on Jeremy Hunt - 'the Member for South West Surrey (Mr Hunt)'">Mr Hunt</a> and continued by the current <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Health and Social Care, because ensuring that our health services are on a proper, strong footing when it comes to technology is incredibly important.</p> <p pid="a108.0/10">All the measures that I have mentioned help to tackle some of the challenges we face today in our public services, in our economy and in delivering Brexit. However, I also support the Queen&#8217;s Speech because it is forward looking, helping the UK to stay prosperous and competitive after Brexit, particularly by seizing the opportunities offered by science and technology, artificial intelligence, big data, precision medicine, robotics and machine learning. Those technologies are already transforming our society and our economy, and the Queen&#8217;s Speech takes that agenda forward.</p> <p pid="a108.0/11">As the founder and chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on the fourth industrial revolution, it is important for the House to know that there is an exciting agenda beyond Brexit, supported by the Government, to ensure that prosperity and the advantages technology are spread to communities across the country. I therefore welcome the commitment to make the UK a global science and technology powerhouse after Brexit, making us a magnet for talented innovators, inventors, investors, entrepreneurs and businesses from around the world, encouraging them to come to this country to invent, manufacture, design and export.</p> <p pid="a108.0/12">The Queen&#8217;s Speech sets out plans significantly to increase public R&amp;D funding, providing a framework that gives long-term certainty to our science community. The Government have already increased public spending on R&amp;D by &#163;7 billion over five years&#8212;the biggest ever increase in public R&amp;D funding&#8212;which is welcome, because R&amp;D is vital to creating a productive economy. The productivity of firms that invest in R&amp;D is around 13% higher than those that do not, so R&amp;D investment is key to our future. The plans in this Queen&#8217;s Speech will help to accelerate the UK&#8217;s position in the world and to reach the target of spending 2.4% of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a> on R&amp;D by 2027. This big boost in funding will allow us to invest strategically in cutting-edge science, while encouraging the world&#8217;s most innovative entrepreneurs and businesses to invest in the UK, but this country also needs to go further. The Queen&#8217;s Speech sets out a path to 2.4% of GDP, but the world leaders, such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea">South Korea</a> and Israel, reach 3% of GDP and we must match them in time.</p> <p pid="a108.0/13">The Government also announced today that the UK will accelerate efforts to realise fusion energy through investment in a new UK fusion reactor design programme, which aims to deliver the world&#8217;s first commercially viable fusion power plant by 2040. I have visited <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Light_Fusion">First Light Fusion</a>, a company in Oxfordshire that is doing incredibly exciting and important work in this field. Fusion energy has the potential to power most of the country, so it is right that the Government invest in it.</p>            </div>

There have been significant advances in defence technology, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence">Ministry of Defence</a> has led the way in helping small and medium-sized enterprises and incubators to develop products for the defence sector. I hope that increases in the future, as it has been a good model in America and other <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> allies for ensuring their armed forces have access to the latest technology. I hope our armed forces do that, too.</p> <p pid="a110.5/3">Returning to the Queen&#8217;s Speech, not only is there an increase in public investment in R&amp;D but there is a commitment to fusion energy, which holds the possibility of driving forward our energy market and our energy capabilities in the years ahead. As I mentioned, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Light_Fusion">First Light Fusion</a> in Oxfordshire is doing exciting and interesting work, and I hope it succeeds.</p> <p pid="a110.5/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen">The Queen</a>&#8217;s Speech also establishes a new space council and launches a comprehensive space strategy. Our space capabilities are increasingly central to our day-to-day lives, whether civilian or military. These important capabilities underpin a range of technologies, from smartphones to navigational devices, so this new national space council and space strategy will help us to lead the way in creating high-value, high-skilled, high-wage jobs across the country. My Havant <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> is already leading the way in this area, with firms such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin">Lockheed Martin</a> doing excellent work.</p> <p pid="a110.5/5">This Queen&#8217;s Speech will help our world-leading science and technology base to grow even further. Science and technology will be the foundation of our prosperity after Brexit, and it will help us to tackle some of the big challenges facing society, such as ending the UK&#8217;s contribution to climate change, managing the adoption and adaptation of &#8220;fourth industrial revolution&#8221; technologies, transforming our transport systems and tackling the challenges associated with an ageing population.</p> <p pid="a110.5/6">The grand challenges and the Government&#8217;s industrial strategy, to which I had the privilege of contributing in a small way when I was at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Business,_Energy_and_Industrial_Strategy">Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy</a>, are already helping the country to secure our position in the world, but this Queen&#8217;s Speech takes us even further and faster, which is why I will be pleased to support it in the Lobby next week.</p>            </div>

Sadly, the Brexit morass that will envelop us all will carry on, regardless of what happens on Saturday and whatever happens by the end of this month. I wish, however, to start on a conciliatory note and something I am pleased to add my comments on. I refer to the commendation of our late friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Flynn">Paul Flynn</a>. Paul helped me enormously. He always said I would become an MP and he proved to be right, and he came over to Stroud to help me on numerous occasions. I owe him so much and he is clearly someone we all miss on this side of the House, and I hope the whole House will feel the same.</p> <p pid="a111.0/2"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen">The Queen</a>&#8217;s Speech is significant not so much for what was in it&#8212;as I said, there was a lot of politicisation&#8212;but, sadly, for what was not in it. It contained no mention of the Women Against State Pension Inequality Campaign, whose tragedy this whole House has to face up to at some point. It contained no mention of housing, which is the key issue for many of us in terms of how public service has to deliver much better. It did contain a mention of animal welfare, but it was minuscule compared with where we need to be going on animal welfare. A genuine animal welfare Bill is required, yet we are now talking about trophy hunting just as we talked previously about ivory bans, both of which are important in their own right but not what we should be doing, which is looking for a much more comprehensive approach. Many of our constituents vote on the issue of animal welfare and they feel we should be taking things forward much more quickly and radically.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a111.2/1">That is what we should have been prioritising in this Queen&#8217;s Speech, along with the abolition of universal credit, which has proved to be a monumental mistake. There was nothing wrong with the concept, but the delivery of UC has caused such hardship, in all our constituencies, and it is beyond reform. We have to get rid of it and start with something different.</p> <p pid="a111.2/2">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, in defence of the Queen&#8217;s Speech, talked a lot about one nation. I know the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> like to talk about themselves as the one nation party.  Sadly, the way things could turn out means we could be facing one nation, because the other three parts of the United Kingdom, for various reasons, no longer seems to want to be part of this one nation. I really worry about the level of English nationalism, which is now driving the Conservative party. We have a fundamental problem and I agree with <a href="/mp/?p=24772" title="Our page on Anna Soubry - 'the right hon. Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry)'">Anna Soubry</a> that we need radical constitutional reform, and that includes devolution in this country of England, where we have failed to do anything to deal with the centralisation of power. That is a fundamental reason why people voted for Brexit; they did so because they feel disconnected from the way in which decisions are made. That comes into the need for a fundamental rethink, with votes at 16, electoral reform and unitary authorities, to which she alluded. As someone who spent 28 years on a parish and town council, I am pleased to say that that means taking power to the first level of government&#8212;it is not the lowest level. That is important, because people can then see what is happening in the communities.</p> <p pid="a111.2/3">Brexit has caused huge divisions, but it has also led to this Government wasting the past year. I regret and resent the fact that we will not be having the Agriculture Bill and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisheries_Bill">Fisheries Bill</a> back&#8212;we did not even get as far as the environment Bill. All those are fundamental pieces of legislation that should have been enacted over the past year. We may disagree about what was going into those <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a>. We had a critique in Committee, but, sadly for those who served on it&#8212;I led on behalf of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a>&#8212;the Agriculture Bill disappeared last November, never to be seen again. That does nothing other than cause disillusion. Farmers are asking, notwithstanding the uncertainty over Brexit, what policy is going to be in place if we crash out. More particularly, even if we do not crash out, we will need an agricultural policy that is understood and that takes account of the idea of public money for public goods. We need to see that in practice and see how it will work. At the moment, we just have a huge void.</p> <p pid="a111.2/4">I welcome the fact that the issue of mental health is in the Queen&#8217;s Speech, and hopefully a Bill will subsequently come forward, but there is a problem. Like many other Members, I go around my local schools&#8212;I have been to 40 schools in the past year&#8212;and besides funding and staff stability, the third issue that all schools raise with me is their children&#8217;s mental health. It is now at a stage where it is a crisis. We cannot underestimate how bad things are. Of course, it is about not only the children but their families. We have a significant problem, even in Gloucestershire, with off-rolling. A lot of it has to do with parents who do not believe that their children can get special needs provision in the normal system, but it is also about the way parents can take their children out of school into so-called home education. There is nothing wrong with home education in theory, but they are not then educating their children, who are being taken out of school more as companions than in the context of a parent-child relationship. That should be addressed by proper investigation and, in due course, the putting in place of a proper legislative context.</p> <p pid="a111.2/5">My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10159" title="Our page on Geraint Davies - 'the Member for Swansea West (Geraint Davies)'">Geraint Davies</a>, who is sadly not currently in the Chamber, talked about air quality as a key issue. I hope that will be addressed, either through the environment Bill or in its own right. I shall just add to what he had to say the  significant issue of incineration, which leads to small particulates that have an enormous impact on the health of children in particular. We have never investigated it, and it should be paramount in the way we try to drive up air quality. Yes, of course traffic is seen as the major cause of the huge issue of our deteriorating health standards, but there are other parts to it. The disposal of waste through appropriate means by getting rid of it in a non-polluting manner is crucial, as is not creating it in the first place.</p> <p pid="a111.2/6">That brings me to the biggest loss in the Queen&#8217;s Speech: the failure to address climate change properly. The target of 2050 is far too late. Earlier this evening, I had the opportunity to go along to a meeting of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_and_Scientific_Committee">Parliamentary and Scientific Committee</a>, at which three experts, including the former chief scientist <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_David_King">Sir David King</a>, basically argued that we are not anywhere near meeting the obligations in this country, let alone in the wider world. Warming of 2&#176; will cause climate change catastrophe. We need to understand that, which is why I am proud to stand by my constituents. As many Members know, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_Rebellion">Extinction Rebellion</a> came from Stroud. Many of my constituents are out there at every moment in time, and I am happy to help them wherever I can. I also pay due regard to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polly_Higgins">Polly Higgins</a>, the creator of the campaign on ecocide who latterly became a Stroud constituent. We need to look at ecocide and the implications&#8212;there is an opportunity for Members to come to a briefing this week&#8212;of how we can pass a law that means we will not leave a worse situation to our children and particularly our grandchildren. We should feel desperately keen to avoid doing that at any cost. Let us listen to the scientists and the campaigners, and let us do something in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>, rather than talk about it.</p> <p pid="a111.2/7">In conclusion, I am pleased that the Domestic Abuse Bill has been carried over and will hopefully see the light of day. Let us make sure that the legislation is not watered down and includes action such as banning sham marriages. We must make sure that it is not just linked to immigration and human rights but stands in its own right. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Opposition">The Opposition</a> will debate the Bills as they come forward and seek radically to improve the legislation. We will make sure that there is an alternative. We heard earlier that it was all about the previous Government&#8217;s failings in power; I argue that austerity was a political programme. We are now coming to the end of austerity. It was such an unnecessary and punitive way for any Government to try to deal with the poorest and most vulnerable in our society. If we have come out of austerity, now is the time to see the real changes that are desperately needed, so that we have a more humane society that addresses issues such as housing, education and health, as well as trying to deal with the morass of Brexit. More particularly, we need to deal with climate change.</p>            </div>

Member for Stroud (Dr Drew)'">Dr Drew</a>, who, as always, made many excellent points. I support the Queen&#8217;s Speech, which I thought was absolutely tremendous, and congratulate my hon. Friends the Members for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truro_and_Falmouth">Truro and Falmouth</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Newton">Sarah Newton</a>) and for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_Derbyshire">North East Derbyshire</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Rowley">Lee Rowley</a>) on their excellent speeches. I draw the attention of the House to my entry in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests, because that is a traditional thing that one has to do.</p> <p pid="a113.0/2">The most important point facing my constituents at the moment is, as always, tuberculosis in cattle. I keep coming back to this matter because&#8212;the hon. Member for Stroud mentioned the animal welfare element in the agriculture Bill&#8212;of the need to tackle this disease, and the issues that are hitting farmers time and again in the countryside. They all come down to the failure of the skin test to correctly identify infection in cattle. There is good news: a new test, the Enferplex <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TB">TB</a> test, has been approved by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Organisation_for_Animal_Health">World Organisation for Animal Health</a>&#8212;or the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OIE">OIE</a>. It is an antibody test, and it is more reliable and more accurate. It will genuinely give us, as a nation, the opportunity to find the disease both in cattle and in badgers and to correctly identify it. Until we can do that, the progress we make will never be as good as it should or could be.</p> <p pid="a113.0/3">There is also work under way on enhanced skin tests and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA">DNA</a> in blood tests, but neither of those are approved by the OIE. The OIE does not approve any old test. It is a respected, proper international body and we need to know what the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs">Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</a> is doing to make sure that these tests are adopted and that the fight against tuberculosis is successful.</p> <p pid="a113.0/4">I have farmers complain to me time and again of the heartbreak of watching their beloved animals being put down. To make matters even worse, they then get a message saying that, during the test later, there was no sign of infection in the animal. Those tests can take up to six months to culture but, by then, of course, my constituents are unutterably miserable and have been treated appallingly, so we need to move on. We need to use science to help to fight this horrible disease in cattle and to ensure that the badger population, which is healthy, is protected. The culling has been proven to work. The peer group review and the science add up. If you do it properly, you can reduce the incidence of outbreaks in cattle and, of course, that is good not only for the farmers and the cattle, but for protecting the healthy population of badgers.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a115.0/1">The problem with vaccinating against bacteria is that it is much harder for the creature&#8212;whether it be human or animal&#8212;to fight a disease unless it is under pressure. That means that, if the disease is prevalent, a vaccine is much more successful than if the disease is not. Although I would welcome an effective vaccination, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCG">BCG</a> in human beings is only 60% effective. But because we all do the same things, and because we can use antibiotics, that is enough to create the herd immunity that, as a society, we need. Unfortunately, we are not winning this battle particularly successfully in the human population, and it is becoming increasingly prevalent. Although I want to welcome every step of science that protects my constituents and their animals, vaccines alone will unfortunately not do it. But if we do everything, we can triumph.</p> <p pid="a115.0/2">One of the things that has been bothering me is the situation for our sheep farmers&#8212;our shepherds. What will they do if we leave the European Union, which takes such a large proportion of our lamb? We produce 3% of the world&#8217;s sheep, but 25% of the EU&#8217;s sheep. We produce a third of the EU&#8217;s sheepmeat and are the sixth largest producer in the world. The average person in the UK eats 1.9 kg of lamb a year&#8212;including you, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, as I am delighted to see from your signalling. That is about the size of a family joint per year. We can do better than that. If our sheepmeat market is threatened, we could double consumption. That would actually make us a net importer of lamb. Some 64% of our product is actually consumed domestically, so the idea that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealanders">New Zealanders</a>&#8212;who have a 90,000-tonne opportunity to sell into the UK already, but who have never fulfilled that quota&#8212;will flood our market is for the birds. We can eat our way to success even if everything goes wrong, and I am a great advocate for that, as the House can see from my aerodynamic dimensions. We produce 298,000 tonnes of sheepmeat per annum, worth &#163;2.216 billion.</p> <p pid="a115.0/3">The other thing that is really upsetting me at the moment is dog meat in China. I have seen the way that these poor people in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> are being treated, and I think our reaction has been rather quiet. One of the things we ought to be doing is using our status in the world to set an example. The example that my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25644" title="Our page on Giles Watling - 'the Member for Clacton (Giles Watling)'">Giles Watling</a> and I seek to set is to make it illegal to eat dogs&#8212;not least because nobody eats dogs in the UK, so resistance to this law should be pretty minimal. It would set an example to the world. The horrendous torture that goes on for more than 10 million dogs in China is so unbelievably revolting and cruel that, if we can do even the smallest thing here, we should do it.</p> <p pid="a115.0/4">We care about animal welfare, and today the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> talked about banning live exports. This is a difficult subject for me. Exporting animals for slaughter abroad is obviously not ideal. It would be much better if they were slaughtered nearer to where they live. We are constantly told that the EU sets these high standards for animal welfare, yet they clearly are not high enough for live exports. That is why our Government want to stop such exports. That is perfectly understandable, but surely when we leave the EU we can have much higher standards for transporting animals. Actually, I think the UK does it very well already, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFU">NFU</a> has some excellent suggestions as to how this could be done. This is one of the EU failures that people do not talk about but jolly well should.</p> <p pid="a115.0/5">There are other things in the Queen&#8217;s Speech that matter to my constituents. I am particularly pleased that railways and buses have come up. Railways really do need to take the passenger to the end of the line, particularly if that is in Hereford. It is no good stopping off in Worcester, Malvern or anywhere else that is jolly nice but where the people do not live; trains really do need to reach the end of the line. There is a wonderful man called <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Morris">Dave Morris</a>, who runs the bus companies in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>. I have been appalled by the way in which bus companies treat each other and seek to compete in order to put their competitors out of business. We need reliability in our buses, and preferably slightly thinner buses that can fit down country lanes.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a116.1/1">I would love to agree with the hon. Gentleman. I am not sure that the buses will ever be completely satisfactory in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>. We have a fairly sparsely populated group of people and more roads per capita than any other county. That means that getting a bus when one wants it to where one wants to go is extremely difficult. However, it has got a lot better since I was first elected. In order to get to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenbury_Wells">Tenbury Wells</a>, one took a bus on a Monday morning but could not get back until Thursday afternoon. Things have, believe it or not, got better</p> <p pid="a116.1/2">Another gripe I have is this vegetarian nonsense. I have absolutely had it up to here. Someone who really cares about the planet should eat grass-fed meat. There is no way that human beings can consume grass. It makes sense to turn the grass that grows across 60% of our country into protein, and the way to do that is to allow a sheep or cow to eat it and then consume the animal.</p> <p pid="a116.1/3">Of course I understand that these animals can produce methane from enteric digestion, but that methane is part of the cycle. The manure goes back into the soil and it is a natural cycle. Once someone starts to add fossil fuels through their tractor or their fertiliser, they totally alter the carbon footprint of the crops they are producing.</p> <p pid="a116.1/4">Therefore, having a plant-based diet is not going to save the planet. All those people nibbling away on soya beans grown on the burnt-out former forests of the Amazon are doing immense harm, not least in lurking outside here and making people stick in a traffic jam emitting carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, NOx&#8217;s and all sorts of other vile fumes&#8212;[Interruption]&#8212;especially the ones from Stroud, who are causing no end of trouble. Most of all, they are upsetting people like me who really care about climate change. I wrote a book about it. I have to tell the House that I slightly spoilt it by putting a picture of myself on the front, but that did not matter: it was a really important subject. Turning people away from doing the right thing, which is what these people and their vegetarianism are doing, is absolutely disastrous. We are leading the world, and to go out of  one&#8217;s way to beat up the world leader for something they are doing right strikes me as very poor politics indeed.</p> <p pid="a116.1/5">I welcome various other parts of the Queen&#8217;s Speech. The rule of law matters so much to my constituents. We have the lowest crime, I am happy to tell the House, but that does not mean that people do not feel frightened or nervous, or care about seeing police officers. Seeing more of those is a wonderful and important thing, so I welcome that. I agree that the punishment needs to fit the crime and that it is no good giving a long sentence and then the criminal who has been found guilty serving only half of it. Who are we trying to fool&#8212;the families of the victims? It is very important that we have honesty in our sentencing.</p> <p pid="a116.1/6">I welcome the hospital building, particularly in Hereford. I think I still have a photograph of me chasing <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Milburn">Alan Milburn</a> and trying to get more beds for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereford_County_Hospital">Hereford County Hospital</a> in 2001. Now, finally, those beds are about to arrive, as the wards built by the Canadian army in the second world war are finally dismantled and replaced with a 21st-century building. The same is true for the funding of our schools. I am sure that all colleagues have, like me, visited their local schools and heard the plea for more money. The bit that has always been incredibly difficult is to explain why, if someone lives in Westminster, their children receive twice as much money as the children of someone who lives in Ledbury. That cannot be right. Raising the funding from the bottom up will be welcome because it does not take from those who have higher needs, but it does lift the base. That is surely the best way to ensure that our children get the best possible start in life.</p> <p pid="a116.1/7">I shall close with the thought that these people who care about the climate, care about the future of our planet and want to do the right thing should be encouraged and not put off. They should start eating pasture-fed meat with the Pasture for Life logo on it so that they know they are not only saving the planet but bringing about the highest levels of animal welfare, which I know all our farmers, particularly those in Herefordshire, strive for, care about and deliver.</p> <p pid="a116.1/8">Ordered, That the debate be now adjourned.&#8212;(<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rutley">David Rutley</a>.)</p> <p pid="a116.1/9">Debate to be resumed tomorrow.</p>            </div>
