This Bill delivers on our ambition by seizing the opportunities of our departure from the European Union, tailoring financial services regulation to UK markets and delivering better outcomes for the economy, consumers, victims of fraud and businesses. There are many amendments for consideration today,  so I will be as succinct as possible, and I look forward to having time to respond to hon. Members&#8217; contributions later.</p> <p pid="d387.0/2">In Committee, I heard from colleagues on both sides of the House about the importance of holding the operationally independent regulators to account regarding their performance&#8212;in particular, that there should be regular reporting on their performance to support scrutiny, beyond just the annual report. Regulation is about not just the contents of the rulebook, but how effectively and on how timely a basis those rules are enforced and implemented.</p> <p pid="d387.0/3">The Government and regulators are both committed to the highest standards of operational effectiveness. That is why last week we published an exchange of letters with the regulators, making clear the intention to publish more detailed performance data in relation to their authorisation processes on a more regular basis. However, I also noted the clear consensus in Committee on the need to enhance the existing statutory provisions. In particular, I thank my hon. Friends the Members for Wimbledon (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hammond">Stephen Hammond</a>) and for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Warwickshire">North Warwickshire</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Tracey">Craig Tracey</a>) for raising this important issue.</p> <p pid="d387.0/4">As a result, new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 17 provides a new power for the Treasury to require the regulators to publish additional information on a more regular basis, where that is necessary to support this House&#8217;s scrutiny of their performance in discharging their general functions.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d388.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend who, as one of my predecessors, has made a significant contribution to getting the Bill to where it is today. I will try to indulge him, but he will also recognise that the Bill is about putting enabling powers in place, and there will be opportunities on future occasions to discuss how we deploy those.</p> <p pid="d388.1/2">New <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 18 introduces a requirement for the regulators to ensure that all members of their statutory panels are external and independent of the Treasury, the Bank of England and the regulators. That will codify the current approach taken by regulators, putting it in statute, building confidence in their independence and ensuring that it is maintained on a long-term basis.</p> <p pid="d388.1/3">New clause 19 introduces a new requirement for the regulators to publish a list of respondents to their public consultations, provided that the respondents consent. The requirement is limited to the financial services regulators and their specific statutory consultation in existing financial services legislation. New clauses 18 and 19 also address points raised by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24787" title="Our page on Richard Fuller - 'the Member for North East Bedfordshire (Richard Fuller)'">Richard Fuller</a> and <a href="/mp/?p=25596" title="Our page on Sarah Olney - 'the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Sarah Olney)'">Sarah Olney</a>.</p> <p pid="d388.1/4">I also note the interest of my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24945" title="Our page on Bob Blackman - 'the Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman)'">Bob Blackman</a> in enhancing regulator accountability through his new clauses on a new regulators&#8217;  supervision council and ending regulators&#8217; statutory immunity from civil damages. I understand where he is coming from, and I note that he chairs the all-party parliamentary group on personal banking and fairer financial services, but the Government&#8217;s position is that a new supervisory council would duplicate  existing accountability structures. Indeed, none of the representations that I receive from industry says that the biggest thing that will help growth and competitiveness is another layer of regulators. There is also a great deal of existing accountability structures, including the role undertaken by this House and its various Committees, which is why that position was supported by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_Committee">Treasury Committee</a> in its July 2021 report. Removing the regulators&#8217; statutory immunity from liability and damages would risk regulators over-regulating to avoid the risk of liability. There are already mechanisms for holding regulators to account, including the complaints scheme. That scheme is overseen by the independent complaints commissioner, who has powers to recommend redress.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d389.1/1">The hon. Member draws our attention to the very tragic cases that occur when financial regulation goes wrong and does not do its job in the way every Member of this House would like to see. He also talks about a legal threshold for that. He will perhaps appreciate that I do not have the facts of that particular case before me and that we are not drafting things here and now. I have heard from Members on both sides of the House about some of the problems in what we are talking about, which is essentially the conduct of the regulator, and I understand colleagues&#8217; desire to look at legal liability as one remedy, but there are many powers in the Bill, and as I say, the Bill will not constrain the ability of this House or Ministers going forward.</p> <p pid="d389.1/2"><a href="/mp/?p=25646" title="Our page on Emma Hardy - 'The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Emma Hardy)'">Emma Hardy</a>, with whom I spent a lot of time in the Bill Committee&#8212;I suspect we will hear from her later this afternoon&#8212;has tabled a new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> on considering economic risks in regulators&#8217; cost-benefit analysis panels. I would like to reassure her that the regulators already take steps&#8212;and, to assuage her concerns, they could perhaps do more&#8212;to think about economic crime when they do that. They have the power, of course, to consult experts where they consider it relevant.</p> <p pid="d389.1/3">I thank my hon. Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_Bedfordshire">North East Bedfordshire</a> again for raising the issue of regulatory proportionality. I wish to reassure him that the Government are clear that the burden of any regulation should be proportionate to its benefits, and that is set out in existing legislation. I am very happy to reiterate again today that I expect the regulators to fully and proactively embrace that principle, which is embedded in statute.  That is particularly important, as the Bill confers on them greater rule-making responsibilities. I suspect we will hear from my hon. Friend later on.</p> <p pid="d389.1/4">I will now turn to Government amendments 8 to 11 &#8212;I apologise, but there are quite a lot of amendments to crack on through. Clause 6 already enables the Treasury to exempt regulators from the statutory requirement to consult on rules when they are replacing retained EU law repealed by the Bill without making material changes. Amendments 8 to 11 go further. They create a blanket exemption from the statutory requirement to consult in situations in which the regulators remove EU-derived rules from their rulebooks without replacement. The amendments also allow the Treasury to exempt the regulators when they are amending EU-derived rules or replacing retained EU law in their rulebooks, and when the only material effect of the change is to reduce regulatory burdens. That ensures that the regulators can take that proportionate approach to consultation, accelerate the repeal of retained EU law, and not let the requirement to consult be an obstacle or delaying factor. It is a long time since the British people voted for Brexit, and it is time to start delivering those benefits. Nothing in the amendments changes the obligation on the regulators to act to advance their statutory objectives, so any reduction in regulatory burdens must be compatible with those objectives.</p> <p pid="d389.1/5">Let me briefly cover the two remaining Government amendments, and I will then move on. New clause 20 ensures that a new type of fund vehicle currently being explored&#8212;the unauthorised contractual scheme&#8212;would be commercially viable if it were introduced. The proposed fund has the potential to improve the competitiveness of the UK by filling a gap in the UK&#8217;s existing fund offering and supporting the domestic growth agenda by facilitating greater investment in UK real estate by UK funds. <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> 17 is a minor and technical amendment to rectify an inadvertent omission in drafting.</p> <p pid="d389.1/6">I will now address the amendments tabled by other Members. I am conscious that I am speaking before Members have had a chance to introduce their amendments, so I look forward to responding in more detail, where necessary, at the end of the debate. Let me start with the important issue of access to cash. I represent a rural <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> with a higher-than-average proportion of elderly and vulnerable residents, so I am acutely aware of the very real concerns around this topic. As of today, there remains extensive access to cash across the UK as a whole&#8212;over 95% of people live within 2,000 metres of a free cashpoint. I want to be clear that it is not acceptable for people to have no option but to travel large distances or pay ATM fees to access their own money.</p> <p pid="d389.1/7">If hon. Members have a concern in their local area, as I know many have, I strongly recommend that they reach out to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINK">LINK</a>, which is leading the industry-led initiative to see what can be done to help constituents. LINK is delivering, for example, a new free-to-use ATM in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollards_Hill">Pollards Hill</a> estate in the constituency of <a href="/mp/?p=10381" title="Our page on Siobhain McDonagh - 'the hon.

That has fallen yet further during the pandemic. There are significant advantages to cashless transactions, not least in the elimination of crime. Actually, it is a bit of a myth that there are sections of society that struggle, and we see that most apparently in the advent of cashless parking. There are hardly any councils left in the country now that use cash for their parking. They are all using apps on smartphones. When we introduced it when I was at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_City_Council">Westminster City Council</a>, we did not have a single complaint from an elderly person&#8212;quite the reverse.

Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25346" title="Our page on Kit Malthouse - 'the Member for North West Hampshire (Kit Malthouse)'">Kit Malthouse</a>. Cash is being used far less than it was previously. That is good and convenient for many people. I fully support the Government&#8217;s moves and the ambition across this House to ensure that we have access to free cash, but there is no point in people having access to free cash if they cannot spend it on essential items. I just flag that many retail outlets no longer accept cash. It is not just parking; there are cashless bars and so on. That is fine, but there is a scenario where outlets that sell essential items such as food shops and chemists might at some point be required to accept cash, because if they do not accept cash, lots of people will be excluded.</p>            </div>

These were promised as a panacea for towns where the last bank has gone, such as Acton. It is not just about rural communities. Acton was one of 10 places that were promised a bank hub last December, but nothing has happened. There is a lack of will, and they are under-resourced and voluntary. Perhaps there is an argument for more regulation to make them happen, because <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail">Daily Mail</a> were saying in the autumn that none of these&#8212;zero&#8212;has happened, but I understand that since then two of them have. In the meantime, Acton is a cash desert. In 2018 we lost our <a href="/glossary/?gl=124" title="http://www.postoffice.co.uk/" class="glossary">post office</a>, never to be replaced. What advice does the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> have for me?

Frankly, these initiatives have started relatively recently, and as well as making sure today that we get the right balance in statute, we also need to see them delivered. I will take that case forward for the hon. Lady, and I will write to her. The bank hubs programme is now being deployed at pace. My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25868" title="Our page on Anthony Mangnall - 'the Member for Totnes (Anthony Mangnall)'">Anthony Mangnall</a> boasts of his bank hub, which I suspect will not make the hon. Lady delighted, but it shows that they can deliver, and that is what we want.</p> <p pid="d393.3/2">I will clarify for the record what we are saying, if I may. Under the Bill, the FCA, when acting to ensure reasonable access to cash, has to have regard to the Treasury&#8217;s policy statement in this area. That is the statement that will set out from time to time the Government&#8217;s position on matters such as cost and location, and the FCA will have to have regard to that when setting the detailed prescriptive regulations.</p> <p pid="d393.3/3">That gives time&#8212;I am putting the industry on notice&#8212;for those industry-led schemes to prove that they can deliver, and to ensure that the Government have a robust regulatory framework: a belt-and-braces framework. I believe that is the right and flexible way of dealing with the matter, rather than right now locking it in statute for all time. I will ensure that we reflect the House&#8217;s views on that when we craft the policy statement.</p>            </div>

The point made by <a href="/mp/?p=25346" title="Our page on Kit Malthouse - 'the right hon. Member for North West Hampshire (Kit Malthouse)'">Kit Malthouse</a> makes clear the need for free access to cash to be provided for in the Bill. As the number of people making cash transactions falls, it becomes more expensive to distribute cash freely. There is, however, as I hope we all understand, a vulnerable group in our society who still need free access to cash. As cashless transactions increase, the need to maintain free access to cash for the most vulnerable people in our society increases. That is why we are asking for it to be provided for in the Bill.</p>            </div>

He may not be old enough, but some of us will remember the moment the cheque started to go out of usage. There were lots of claims of damage to certain sections of society, and that lots of people would be outraged when the cheque disappeared. Now people operate without chequebooks on a daily basis, and no retailers, as far as I am aware, accept cheques. On the idea that we should mandate that cash be accepted, we cannot stand in the way of the fact that consumers are voting not to use cash. The market is telling us that cash is running out of use, and let us scotch the myth that there is such a thing as a free ATM. The network at the moment costs about &#163;5 billion to operate. That is paid for by every user of the bank, whether they use the ATM or not.</p>            </div>

Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Hampshire">North West Hampshire</a> is flattering. We will make some progress and allow others to contribute.</p> <p pid="d395.1/2">Let me move on to access to banking and payment services. Just as we have said about cash, they are the essential ingredients of modern life and for many businesses. The new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for Hastings and Rye (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally-Ann_Hart">Sally-Ann Hart</a>) and for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northampton_South">Northampton South</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Lewer">Andrew Lewer</a>) raised the important issue, to all of us in this House, of free speech, and the crucial role of payment service providers in delivering services without censorship. Since Committee stage, I have met with my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye, the FCA and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal">PayPal</a> regarding its recent temporary suspension of some accounts. I draw hon. Members&#8217; attention to my letter deposited in the House, in which I set out the Government&#8217;s position on that important matter. I also circulated the letter from PayPal that sets out that it re-evaluated and reversed its decision in a number of the specific cases raised. It says that it was never its intention to be an arbiter of free speech, and that none of its actions was based on its customers&#8217; political views.</p> <p pid="d395.1/3">I want to be extremely clear that the Government are committed to ensuring that the regulations respect the balance of rights between users and service providers&#8217; obligations, including in respect of freedom of expression, whether of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Speech_Union">Free Speech Union</a>, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=226" title="A group of workers who have united to promote their common interests." class="glossary">trade union</a> movement, law-abiding environmental movements or anyone else expressing lawful views. To ensure that the existing regulatory regime is operating as it should in that respect, I will seek further evidence through the Government&#8217;s review of payment services regulation in January. To continue this transparent dialogue with colleagues on an important subject, I will provide an update to Parliament in the form of a written ministerial statement before the formal closure of that review, and table amendments to the relevant regulations using the powers in today&#8217;s Bill, if necessary.</p> <p pid="d395.1/4">We recognise the value that the mutuals sector brings to the UK economy in providing a door to affordable credit. The Government are committed to the health and prosperity of the mutuals sector, which is why we supported the private Member&#8217;s Bill of <a href="/mp/?p=10682" title="Our page on Mark Hendrick - 'the hon. Member for Preston (Sir Mark Hendrick)'">Sir Mark Hendrick</a>, which would allow co-operatives, mutual insurers and friendly societies further flexibility in determining for themselves the best strategies for their business. As I said in Committee in response to amendments tabled to today&#8217;s Bill by <a href="/mp/?p=25344" title="Our page on Tulip Siddiq - 'the hon. Member for Hampstead and Kilburn (Tulip Siddiq)'">Tulip Siddiq</a>, the Government consider that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Services_and_Markets_Act_2000">Financial Services and Markets Act 2000</a> already ensures that regulators consider mutual entities as they exercise their regulatory functions.</p> <p pid="d395.1/5">Let me turn to another matter, which is as important to me as I know it is to many colleagues across the House: financial inclusion and consumer protection.  The Government are committed to financial inclusion, and want to ensure that people, regardless of background or income, have access to useful and affordable financial products and services. While I respect the intention behind the amendments tabled by <a href="/mp/?p=25646" title="Our page on Emma Hardy - 'the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Emma Hardy)'">Emma Hardy</a>, who has been a consistent voice on this important matter, the FCA gave evidence that it does not consider that a new requirement for it to have regard to financial inclusion would add to its ability to act in this area.</p>            </div>

Lady&#8217;s points further when I sum up, so I can make some progress. We had that debate several times in Committee. We have to be slightly cautious about the unintended consequences of taking into scope a much wider set of transactions that involve an element of deferred payment, but I am sympathetic to her points.</p> <p pid="d397.4/2">I thank my hon. Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_East">Harrow East</a> for raising the topic of a statutory duty of care for consumers. Ensuring that consumers of financial services get the right protection they need remains a priority. The FCA comprehensively analysed the options for improving that, which led to the consumer duty that will come into force in July.</p> <p pid="d397.4/3"><a href="/mp/?p=25648" title="Our page on Wera Hobhouse - 'The hon. Member for Bath (Wera Hobhouse)'">Wera Hobhouse</a> tabled new clauses 34 and 35 to require trustees of occupational pension schemes and fund managers to act in the best interest of beneficiaries, which is indeed the position as it stands today, although I will listen carefully to her points. Trustees and fund managers will be subject to the FCA&#8217;s consumer duty, which puts on them a focus of delivering good outcomes for customers.</p> <p pid="d397.4/4">I turn to amendments relating to frauds and scams. The Bill is a huge step forward in tackling the growing problem of authorised push payment scams. I will be clear that, as I set out in my response to the hon. Member for Hampstead and Kilburn in Committee, the Government are committed to tackling fraud far more widely than in just financial services. She may like to know that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> has now confirmed that a national fraud strategy will be published early in the new year.</p> <p pid="d397.4/5">Specifically for financial services, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Finance">UK Finance</a> publishes a half-year fraud update, which sets out how the industry is working together to respond to the fraud threat and to support customers. In relation to the amendments concerning the reimbursement of victims of authorised push payment scams, the payment systems regulator has already signalled its intention to deliver a higher degree of consumer protection.</p> <p pid="d397.4/6">On sustainable finance, no Government have done more on the climate. We have legislated to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We support strengthening the UK financial services regulatory regime&#8217;s baking in of the climate, as underlined by <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 25, which requires the regulators in discharging their functions to have regard to the need to contribute to achieving compliance with net zero. The regulators will be required to report annually on how they have considered that regulatory principle. That is a significant step in our goal of making the UK a net zero-aligned financial centre, and builds on our green finance and net zero strategies across the whole gamut of regulatory activity. The Government committed to updating our green financial strategy and will announce further information on timing imminently.</p>            </div>

I listened with great care to what the hon. Lady said, but action starts at home. In her <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, the Green party leader flew on a jet aeroplane to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COP">COP</a> and the level of recycling is half that of neighbouring <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Sussex">West Sussex</a>. People should get their own house in order before coming to virtue-signal about others&#8217;.</p> <p pid="d399.4/2">New clauses 8 and 9 in the name of <a href="/mp/?p=25908" title="Our page on Olivia Blake - 'the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Olivia Blake)'">Olivia Blake</a> raise the important issue of financial stewardship. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Department_for_Work_and_Pensions">The Department for Work and Pensions</a>, which is responsible for that,  has already made a public commitment to review stewardship disclosure requirements. That will be done during 2023.</p> <p pid="d399.4/3">Finally, the Government believe that effective commodities market regulation is key to ensuring that market speculation does not lead to economic harm. The current regime we have inherited from the EU is overly complicated and poorly designed. To ensure that this is calibrated correctly, the Bill delegates the setting of position limits from the FCA to trading venues themselves. The amendments in the name of <a href="/mp/?p=10383" title="Our page on John Martin McDonnell - 'the right hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)'">John McDonnell</a> seek to reverse this. The Government&#8217;s position is that this would place unnecessary restrictions on investors, to the detriment of all market participants. It would place the UK at a disadvantage compared with other international financial centres, such as the EU, that apply restrictions only to contracts that genuinely pose a risk.</p> <p pid="d399.4/4">Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>, I apologise for having spoken at some length&#8212;I wanted to engage with as many colleagues&#8217; amendments as possible&#8212;but I hope I have provided a clear and reasonable explanation of the Government&#8217;s position and why we have taken it. I look forward to a constructive debate on the Bill.</p>            </div>

Member says, and I will come on to that a little later in my speech, but the call-in power is very different from what he is describing. Time and again, we warned Ministers that this would be detrimental to our regulatory  independence, and they did not listen. However, if the hon. Member listens carefully, he will hear, when I come on to the next page of my speech, that I will address the valid points he is making.</p> <p pid="d400.4/2">In Committee, when I pushed the current <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> on why this dangerous <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> power was necessary, he told me that voices in the industry had told him we needed an &#8220;agile and flexible system&#8221;, which he claimed could only be brought about by this intervention power. After all of this from the three Economic Secretaries I have shadowed in 10 months, who kept pushing this dangerous intervention power, strangely enough the Government then dropped the policy: I just received an opaque letter, which did not really offer any proper explanation for why this Government have had a change of heart. If you do not mind my saying so, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>, I thought about when I got a text from my crush in the sixth form telling me there would be no second date, without his actually telling me face to face why he did not want to see me again. I do wonder why, but I say to the Minister that I am grateful that he listened to the Labour party and has dropped the dangerous intervention power. I only wish he had done it sooner, so we could have saved some unnecessary damage to our global reputation.</p> <p pid="d400.4/3">While the intervention power was wholly inappropriate, we recognise that the Bill facilitates an unprecedented transfer of responsibilities from retained EU law to the regulators, and this does require democratic accountability. That is why I am glad the Government have listened to the concerns raised by me and others in Committee and have introduced new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 17, which will allow regulators to be held to account against key metrics.</p> <p pid="d400.4/4">I hope the Minister will be able to commit to supporting new clause 10, tabled by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24728" title="Our page on Nick Smith - 'the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Nick Smith)'">Nick Smith</a>, to further strengthen the democratic accountability of regulators.</p> <p pid="d400.4/5">I was absolutely delighted that <a href="/mp/?p=24785" title="Our page on Harriett Baldwin - 'the hon. Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin)'">Harriett Baldwin</a> was following my speeches at the Labour party conference so closely, where again and again I made the case for a new form of regulated personalised guidance.

Member has a wealth of knowledge in this area, and I accept what he is saying. Overall, the Labour party agrees with a lot of the  policies in this Bill, which is why we have given it our wholehearted support. There are some missed opportunities that we feel could have been taken, and I think we could have strengthened our attractiveness for investments, as he is saying&#8212;I will come on to that later in my speech. I take his point, which is well made, and I hope the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will listen and will respond to it in his summing up.</p> <p pid="d401.1/2">Turning to my own amendments, I am worried about the lack of ambition in the Bill on strengthening fraud prevention. My new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 1 would introduce the first national fraud strategy and data sharing arrangement for a decade. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Audit_Office">National Audit Office</a>, in its recent report, said that the Government simply do not understand the full scale of the fraud epidemic, despite the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAO">NAO</a> calling for rapid action over five years ago. That is a damning statement. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Finance">UK Finance</a> has found that the Government&#8217;s failure to act on the fraud strategy and data sharing has seen the amount of money stolen from hard-working families&#8217; and businesses&#8217; bank accounts through fraud and scams hit a record high of &#163;1.3 billion.</p> <p pid="d401.1/3">Despite that, in Committee, the Minister urged me to withdraw my new clause on the matter. He told me to be patient, and he told me that there would be a fraud strategy before Christmas. Now he is saying there will be one early next year, but how can we trust him not to kick the can further down the road? So I will be holding the Minister to account. There are only 24 days left until the end of the year, and people whose lives have been ruined by fraudsters cannot afford to be patient any longer.</p> <p pid="d401.1/4">Following our debate in Committee, leaders from across the financial services sector told me that the Government&#8217;s approach of placing data sharing responsibilities on the banks alone was stuck in the last century and allows tech-savvy criminals to get rich at the public&#8217;s expense. My new clause would put in place a data sharing arrangement that extends beyond just the banks to include social media companies, crypto-asset firms, payment system operators and other platforms that are exploited by criminals. If the Minister does not listen to the Labour party, I hope he will listen to the National Audit Office, businesses and victims of fraud, and finally give enforcement agencies the powers they need to crack down on criminals by voting for our new clause today. I also hope the Government will support my new clauses 2 and 3 and new clause 7, tabled by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10381" title="Our page on Siobhain McDonagh - 'the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh)'">Siobhain McDonagh</a>; because we have spent a substantial amount of time speaking about free access to cash I will not elaborate too much on that, but she has our full support.</p>            </div>

I welcome the fact that the Government have finally announced that they will bring forward access-to-cash legislation, but this Bill does nothing to protect face-to-face banking or free access to cash, which is our main concern and is what the most vulnerable in our society depend on.</p> <p pid="d403.1/2">Since 2015, on this Government&#8217;s watch nearly half of the UK&#8217;s bank branches have closed. It is inevitable that banking systems will continue to innovate&#8212;no one is denying that&#8212;but the failure to protect these services risks leaving millions of people behind. My <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> would empower the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Conduct_Authority">Financial Conduct Authority</a> to review communities&#8217; needs for and access to essential in-person banking services. To be clear, I am not saying banks should be prevented from closing underused branches&#8212;far from it. I explained this thoroughly in Committee but will say it briefly again now: vital face-to-face services could be delivered through a variety of models, such as shared banking hubs, which are already being set up across the country to provide cash services.</p> <p pid="d403.1/3">In Committee, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> was again very persuasive and convinced me to withdraw my new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a>. He said he accepted the underlying need for action and that solutions would be brought to the table. I believed him, but despite warnings from Age UK, Which? and the Access to Cash Action Group&#8212;which does fantastic work in this area&#8212;that vulnerable people are at risk of being cut off from the services they desperately rely on, the Government have completely failed to engage on this important issue, and this time I will not be making the same mistake: I will not withdraw my new clauses. The Government need to demonstrate they will not simply abandon those who are struggling to bank online.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d403.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is right that this is not just about bank branch closures; it is also about pressures in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=124" title="http://www.postoffice.co.uk/" class="glossary">Post Office</a>. It is possible to provide some of the services through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office">Post Office</a>, but we have a duty to preserve some of the banking hubs to ensure that the Post Office does not get overwhelmed. I am sure the hon. Gentleman has travelled around his <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, and anybody who walks around their  constituency will see the need for bank branches, banking hubs and post offices for our most vulnerable constituents. I am also surprised that the Bill has so little to say on financial inclusion more broadly, despite my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25646" title="Our page on Emma Hardy - 'the Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Emma Hardy)'">Emma Hardy</a> flying the flag for financial inclusion with her brilliant amendments.</p> <p pid="d403.3/2">The co-operative and mutual sector also plays an important role in delivering financial inclusion. The Bill&#8217;s measures fall short of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_and_Co-operative">Labour and Co-operative</a> parties&#8217; shared ambition to double the size of that sector in the UK. That is why I have tabled new clauses 4 and 5 requiring the regulators to report on how they have considered mutual and co-operative business models. In Committee, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> said that given that appropriate arrangements are already in place for regulators to report, that the FCA and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudential_Regulation_Authority">Prudential Regulation Authority</a> already produce well combed-through annual reports and that there is no deficiency in the level of engagement with the sector, such a measure is simply unnecessary. The sector was shocked by the Minister&#8217;s ill-informed response. It pointed to the FCA&#8217;s most recent annual report, published in July, where there is not one mention of the needs of co-operatives, mutuals, building societies or credit unions, while in the latest <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRA">PRA</a> annual report, building societies are just lumped in with standard banks. Every single business leader that I have spoken to, from Nationwide to the firms represented by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Societies_Association">Building Societies Association</a>, have called for the FCA and the PRA to report separately on these specific business models. Either the Minister believes he understands the needs of British mutuals and co-operatives better than the sector itself or he should support my amendments.</p> <p pid="d403.3/3">What is perhaps most striking, however, is how little the Bill has to say about green finance. Over a year ago,  the present <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> promised to make the UK the world&#8217;s first green financial centre, but on Monday the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBI">CBI</a> warned that the Government are &#8220;going backwards&#8221; on building a greener economy. CBI director-general <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Danker">Tony Danker</a> said firms need more action from Government on green finance. I therefore hope the Minister will support my new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 6 requiring the Treasury to publish an updated green finance strategy with a clearly defined green taxonomy, as well as new clause 24 tabled by <a href="/mp/?p=10920" title="Our page on Chris Grayling - 'the right hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)'">Chris Grayling</a> introducing greater protections against deforestation. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> has said he is going to produce such a strategy imminently, but we look forward to hearing a timeline, because we are now very suspicious of the word &#8220;imminently&#8221; and want to hear clear dates and times.</p> <p pid="d403.3/4">In Committee, the Minister and his Conservative colleagues seemed astounded when I said that the Government and Minister were complacent about green finance. They took such issue with that that I felt I had to provide some evidence in my speech as to why I said it. The Government&#8217;s own independent Green Technical Advisory Group told them last month that they had to send a rapid market signal or we would risk falling further behind Europe, which launched its taxonomy back in 2020. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_2020">In 2020</a> the Government legislated through a statutory instrument for a legal deadline of <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2023</phrase> for the UK to establish the first set of green taxonomy criteria. That is less than a month away, so can the Minister tell me whether he is going to meet his own legal deadline? He is welcome to intervene on me if he thinks he is going to meet it.</p> <p pid="d403.3/5">The highlight of the Committee stage was when I received an early birthday present from the Minister: he gave me a copy of the &#8220;Global Green Finance Index&#8221; to read, which I read from cover to cover. It is scintillating. I thank him for the interesting read, but has the Minister read his Government&#8217;s own policy document, &#8220;Greening Finance&#8221;? If not, I have a copy here for him. The report says that the country is committed to consulting on the UK&#8217;s green taxonomy in the first quarter of 2022. No one will disagree that we are well beyond the first quarter of 2022. The reason I used the word complacent is that we are dealing with a Government who have missed their own deadlines and their own targets on green finance. If that is not complacency in action on green finance, I do not know what is.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d405.0/1">I want to talk about new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 17, especially in relation to the insurance sector.</p> <p pid="d405.0/2">The insurance sector is extremely important in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>. Insurers and insurance brokers based in Chelmsford are responsible for about 3,000 jobs in my constituency. In addition, Chelmsford is a major commuter city and many more of my constituents commute into London to work in the insurance sector. It is also a very important sector to the UK. The entire UK insurance industry accounts for 4% of our national <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a>. The sector brings in an estimated total tax contribution in the region of &#163;16.1 billion, or 2.2% of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> tax receipts for 2020. To put it another way, the insurance sector&#8217;s tax paid the salaries of every single nurse in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a> in 2020-21. It is a really important sector and we do not discuss it often enough.</p> <p pid="d405.0/3">Insurance is also a very international business. Insurers and brokers based in Chelmsford have parent companies in the US, Switzerland, Japan and Australia. All have chosen to be in the UK as a centre for investment, and more international investment means more highly paid jobs supporting not only the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London">City of London</a> but local economies such as those in my constituency and beyond. That investment is under threat. It faces competition from other jurisdictions and the amendments we are debating today will help to show new and existing investors that the UK is open for business. It is a highly competitive global trading environment and London must keep pace with other parts of the world&#8212;they want our business. London remains a world-leading speciality insurance market. Three quarters of business booked in the UK comes from outside the UK and London. It is an export-led market. It is not replicated anywhere else in the world.</p> <p pid="d405.0/4">London retains a lead role thanks to its historical prominence. However, its market share has stagnated in the past decade. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> needs a renewed focus on competitiveness and growth, and the amendments we are discussing today will help to ensure clear accountability and transparency in how we do that. It is not a theoretical risk that we will lose business to other countries. We have already lost out on new markets, investment and opportunities. Singapore copied the UK&#8217;s insurance-linked securities regime, a new form of insurance and risk transfer product. It recognised the quality of the UK&#8217;s legislation that this Government introduced in 2017, but when it implemented the regime, the Singapore regulator took a proportionate regulatory approach and that has encouraged many more new entrants. Singapore has approved 18 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILS">ILS</a> vehicles in less time  than it took the UK to do five. In 2021 alone, the UK lost out on over $700 million of foreign investment in ILS to Singapore, because its regulator is more agile and more proportionate, even though it has the same legislation.</p> <p pid="d405.0/5">There are also problems in just getting the day-to-day work done. The Bill Committee heard evidence from industry about how the FCA is sometimes taking nine months to authorise a chief executive coming from overseas to operate in the UK. That is just not good enough. I have also been told that not a single new insurance company has been set up in the UK in the last 15 years. Surely that is a clear sign that the UK is risking its position as the world&#8217;s leading insurance centre? Businesses face vital choices about where they place capital, income and people. Regulation is a key part of that decision-making process. That is why it is so welcome that the Government are introducing the new secondary objective on international competitiveness and economic growth. It is crucial. This is not a call for a race to the bottom in regulation. High regulatory standards are a strength of the UK system, but regulators across the world, from Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and the EU, are all required to consider international competitiveness, so we should do so, too.</p> <p pid="d405.0/6">I congratulate the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and his officials on their work to date, especially on new clause 17. It is a very welcome recognition from the Government that there is a cultural problem with the regulators, that action is needed on the part of the regulators to address key issues regarding their performance, and that the Government have a key role in holding the regulators&#8217; feet to the fire. The new clause introduces a power over the regulators&#8217; reporting requirements by providing a mechanism through which to direct information to be published, but it is unclear how and in what circumstances <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Majesty">His Majesty</a>&#8217;s Treasury would use the powers within it. Can the Minister therefore confirm whether he intends to seek a report on the new international competitiveness and growth objective as soon as possible, given that it is a critical new objective for the regulators? Can the Minister also confirm that, in future reporting of the international competitiveness objective, he and other Ministers will impress upon the regulators the need to consider metrics specific to competitiveness, not just domestic competition, and that that must include comparative analysis of our regulators&#8217; performance against competitor jurisdictions, as well as analysis of product and service innovations taking place in key markets?</p> <p pid="d405.0/7">The new clauses tabled by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24787" title="Our page on Richard Fuller - 'the Member for North East Bedfordshire (Richard Fuller)'">Richard Fuller</a> go further on proposing a clear reporting criteria for the regulators to follow and on delivering international competitiveness and the growth objective. That would enable Parliament&#8212;I am looking at the Chair of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_Committee">Treasury Committee</a>, my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24785" title="Our page on Harriett Baldwin - 'the Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin)'">Harriett Baldwin</a> here&#8212;to understand better how the regulators have been performing and the contribution they are making to facilitate our competitiveness and growth. In particular, new clauses 13 and 14 are designed to give the Government powers to require the publication of more performance metrics, including on new applications, authorised entities and persons. They already have some performance criteria, but the new clauses would extend that approach. It does not mean reinventing the wheel. Many are taken from the performance criteria of regulators  in competitive jurisdictions. It would not compromise their independence, high standards, financial stability or consumer protection.</p> <p pid="d405.0/8">New clause 14 would add to the regulators&#8217; authorisation key performance indicators outlined in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Services_and_Markets_Act_2000">Financial Services and Markets Act 2000</a>. It would require them to publish monitoring data related to the determination of authorisations. This is a real issue for many of those acting in financial services. It would reduce the compliance burden for firms that regularly need to give clear applications for approved individuals and would, in turn, promote the openness of the UK for highly skilled talent. I am nearly finished, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>, but there are a few more I want to mention.</p> <p pid="d405.0/9">New clause 15 would require both the FCA and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRA">PRA</a> to publish an annual report setting out how they facilitated international competitiveness and growth against a range of data and analysis requirements. Instead of allowing the regulators to mark their own homework, it would enable Parliament to understand how the regulators are helping the UK to be more competitive and ensure that they undertake comparative analysis with other jurisdictions.</p> <p pid="d405.0/10">New clause 16 is targeted at achieving a more proportionate approach to wholesale and retail financial services. Although the regulators have a proportionality principle, it is clearly not working in practice. I have heard time and again from insurers in my Chelmsford constituency and others that the regulators have adopted a one-size-fits-all approach to regulations by treating all financial services, no matter the product or customer, as the same. This means that the regulators in insurance are spending time and effort on over-regulating sophisticated corporate entities with teams of professional advisers, which is really affecting their competitiveness. It would be much better for them to spend that time and effort on protecting individual retail customers, such as our constituents, when they are buying products online or on the high street. The wording of the new clause should be familiar to the Minister&#8217;s officials, because it is borrowed from the recommendation for a proportionality principle for all regulators, which was published in June of last year by the Government&#8217;s taskforce for innovation, growth and regulating reform.</p> <p pid="d405.0/11">Amendments 1 to 6 would ensure that the cost-benefit analysis panels are better equipped to undertake the necessary scrutiny of regulators&#8217; work, and would ensure that they are independent from the regulators, that they can publish their recommendations, and that the regulators must respond to those recommendations. Again, this would mean that Parliament, industry and public see the data and avoid a situation in which the regulators are marking their own homework behind closed doors.</p> <p pid="d405.0/12">I understand that my hon. Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_Bedfordshire">North East Bedfordshire</a> might not move the amendments, but they are all extremely serious. As I said, the industry makes such an important contribution to the tax income of this country and is key to funding our public services. It would be a tragedy to lose our international competitiveness and an industry that dates back to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Fire_of_London">Great Fire of London</a>, so let us make sure that the Minister and the Treasury team can take the amendments into account.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d408.1/1">Thank you, Madam <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>. I am pleased to speak on behalf of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National">Scottish National</a> party in this afternoon&#8217;s debate, and I find myself in a strange position: after welcoming the new SNP leader last night, it is quite possible that, having stood up from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>, I might be sitting down on the Back Benches. It is a strange experience for me, but it has been quite common on the Conservative Benches for most of this year.</p> <p pid="d408.1/2">Colleagues who served on the Bill Committee will know that I had to miss most of its considerations for family reasons, and I want to place on the record my thanks to my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25275" title="Our page on Martin Docherty - 'the Member for West Dunbartonshire (Martin Docherty-Hughes)'">Martin Docherty-Hughes</a>, who unhesitatingly took on my share of the work on the Committee as well as his own. By all accounts, from what I have heard from Members of all parties, he did so very well. None of them said that he did it better than I would have done, although quite possibly he did.</p> <p pid="d408.1/3">We have well over 60 new clauses and amendments in front of us today, and we are not going to do justice to 10% of them&#8212;that is the nature of the way <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> operates. I am also well aware that since we started the Committee deliberations, only three parties have had the chance to contribute, and I think it is only fair&#8212;I hope it is possible&#8212;that that balance be addressed later today. Other parties have voices and constituents, and the voters and constituents who do not like the governing party have a right to have their voices heard in the debate, which will be the only chance that they get.</p> <p pid="d408.1/4">I intend to simply restate the SNP&#8217;s position on the main themes of the Bill, as an indication of where we stand on most of the amendments. I will mention some specific amendments, but I hope that my comments will give an indication of which ones we support.</p> <p pid="d408.1/5">We recognise that there is a need for a complete overhaul of the UK&#8217;s financial services regulatory framework, although possibly in a slightly different direction from where the Government want to take it. For example, I have long argued that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Conduct_Authority">Financial Conduct Authority</a> does not have enough powers or resources. It has to be said that sometimes it does not seem to have the desire to take swift and effective action to stop frauds before they happen, and sometimes it does not have the power to compensate victims afterwards.</p> <p pid="d408.1/6"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_SNP">The SNP</a> continues to have severe reservations about forcing regulators to put international competitiveness on an equal and sometimes higher footing than their actual regulatory responsibilities. There is a potential and very clear conflict of interests between being responsible for regulating the conduct of organisations and being responsible for helping them to become profitable. There are ways that companies can become more competitive that are quite clearly helpful to the public interest, and there are ways they can do it that are neutral to the public interest. There are also ways that a company can become more competitive that are extremely damaging to the public interest&#8212;for example, look at the way P&amp;O treated its workers a few months ago. That made the company more competitive, but it was clearly against the wider public interest.</p> <p pid="d408.1/7">The regulators should have clear responsibilities on matters such as financial stability, consumer protection, fraud prevention and climate change objectives. On climate change objectives, I will not shilly-shally and make excuses; I will support new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 25 if the House divides on it.</p> <p pid="d408.1/8">The Government have missed the chance&#8212;although from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8217;s comments, I think we can assume that they have deliberately ignored the chance&#8212;to put financial inclusion at the heart of the Bill, so we will support amendments that address that. My understanding is that the official <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> will press new clauses 2 and 7 to a <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">Division</a> today and we will certainly support them. As has been mentioned, free access for people to get their cash out of the bank is important and has to be available as a legal right, not simply as a by-your-leave on behalf of the banks and other financial institutions. I share the suspicion that if the amendments had not been tabled and if the banks had not known that those were coming, they would not have been nearly so keen to adopt voluntary codes of practice, and so on. We will also support new clause 23, which will force the FCA to give much more recognition and priority to the requirement for greater financial inclusion.</p> <p pid="d408.1/9">As I mentioned, we welcome the Bill&#8217;s anti-fraud measures, but they do not go nearly far enough. The Bill is hardly even present-proof, never mind future-proof. It is almost as though we are finally catching up to legislate, at the end of this year, for last year&#8217;s scams, and we are failing to notice that the bad guys and gals have designed new scams for this year and are already working on next year&#8217;s. For example, I welcome the fact that the Bill will give the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Systems_Regulator">Payment Systems Regulator</a> a duty to improve the reimbursement of authorised push payment scams, but the same provision will not be carried over to the victims of crypto-scams, pension scams, investment scams or various others.</p> <p pid="d408.1/10">We will support new clause 1, as well as new clause 36, if that is pushed to a vote. New clause 36 emerged from a conversation between <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Accounts_Committee">Public Accounts Committee</a> members after we took evidence recently on the Government&#8217;s record on tackling fraud. A lot of us were struck by the fact that we knew, but had never really thought about, the fact that nobody has any idea of what the real level of fraud is in the United Kingdom, because, too often, financial institutions have a self-interest in choosing to cover it up rather than to report it. We know that 40% of reported crime in the United Kingdom is fraud, and the proportion is probably higher than that because a lot of the frauds against individual institutions are covered up rather than reported.</p> <p pid="d408.1/11">I am grateful to <a href="/mp/?p=25908" title="Our page on Olivia Blake - 'the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Olivia Blake)'">Olivia Blake</a> for taking the time and trouble to introduce that new clause. If, as I strongly suspect will happen, the Government say that they are not against the principle but that they do not like the way in which it has been drafted, I hope that they commit to introducing a similar <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a> in due course.</p> <p pid="d408.1/12">I remember&#8212;I think a lot of Opposition Members do&#8212;that not that long ago, the Tories were very enthusiastic about the idea of forcing people, including <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a>, to report cases of suspected illegal immigration. It will be a real test and give a real indication of how seriously the Government take the damage that fraud  causes to all our constituents if they refuse to even consider a similar requirement to report cases of suspected fraud.</p> <p pid="d408.1/13">The final serious concern that we have about the Bill, as with several other <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> that we have seen being rammed through this place, is the relentless drive to become as different as possible from the European Union, just for the sake of it. Although I do not know whether amendments 8 to 11 will be voted on tonight, had the Government submitted those as new clauses in Committee, or had they been part of the Bill as published, it is almost certain that we would have opposed them.</p> <p pid="d408.1/14">It will come as no surprise that, on behalf of the people of Scotland, the SNP will resist any attempt to drag us further from our European friends and neighbours than we already are. We make no secret of our intention to keep our country in a position where the restoration of our independence will be followed as swiftly as possible by our restoration to our rightful place as a sovereign nation in the EU. We want the transition back into EU membership to be as easy as possible, so we want that to be from the starting point of being as close to alignment with the EU as we can be.</p> <p pid="d408.1/15">This morning, an opinion poll showed support for Scottish independence at 56%&#8212;by jings! The new leader of the SNP group has fairly made his mark, has he not? Fifty-one per cent. would vote SNP in a Westminster election; that is even more than the landslide that we had in 2015. That increases to 53% if, as the SNP intends, the Westminster election becomes a de facto referendum.</p> <p pid="d408.1/16">The prospect of Scotland applying to rejoin the European Union as an independent nation within the next few years is not just a fanciful idea, nor is it just likely; it is now highly probable and is rapidly becoming a certainty. We have to act in the best interests of the people of Scotland by making sure that after independence we remain as close as possible to our friends and neighbours in the European Union so that our transition back to European Union membership can be as swift and smooth as possible.</p> <p pid="d408.1/17">When we rejoin the European Union, it is very likely that central Scotland will immediately become its second biggest financial services centre. It matters to our economy to be able to get back into the European Union with as little fuss and disruption as possible. For that reason, the future of our financial services sector lies not in isolationism from the Government, but in internationalism through membership of the European Union.</p>            </div>

I will try not to gabble.</p> <p pid="d410.2/2">I rise to speak to new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.

I should clarify that I am speaking in this debate as an individual <a href="/glossary/?gl=47" title="A Backbencher is a Member who holds no official position in government or..." class="glossary">Back Bencher</a>, rather than as Chair of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_Committee">Treasury Committee</a>.</p> <p pid="d410.2/3">As the Economic Secretary has highlighted, one of the many benefits of being able to bring financial regulation back into the UK is that we can create rules that will help to unleash growth and investment here. My new clause highlights the opportunity that reviewing MiFID presents for us to look again at the boundary between regulated advice and guidance.</p> <p pid="d410.2/4">I am proposing personalised guidance on financial matters. As we all know, the implementation of the retail distribution review about a decade ago has meant that financial advice is now a very high-quality service that is very expensive. The vast <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of our constituents do not pay and are not willing to pay for it. Something like 8% of people&#8212;I confess that I am one of them&#8212;are lucky enough to afford a financial adviser, but 92% of our constituents do not have that luxury.</p> <p pid="d410.2/5">When I was Economic Secretary in 2015, I launched the financial advice market review, which came up with 28 recommendations to help our constituents. Many wise steps were taken at the time, including enabling people to use &#163;500 from their pension savings to pay for financial advice when using their pension freedoms. Despite those measures, however, there is still an enormous gap for our constituents. For example, about 10 million people in this country are fortunate enough to have more than &#163;10,000 in savings, but 58% of that money is just sitting there in cash, and we all know how inflation is eroding the value of those investments.</p> <p pid="d410.2/6">My new clause 11 approaches the problem from the other direction. I was pleased to hear the Economic Secretary commit at the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> today to using the new flexibilities and seeing whether he can do something like a personalised guidance review with great urgency. That will help our constituents in the following generic examples.</p> <p pid="d410.2/7">A customer may be saving for a deposit for their first home, but doing so with a cash individual savings account. They could get a nudge from their financial institution to consider putting the money into a lifetime <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISA">ISA</a> so that they get the Government rebate.</p> <p pid="d410.2/8">A customer may be sitting on a large cash balance for many months, well above their normal three-month outgoings. They could get an alert to warn them about the detriment to the value of cash as a result of inflation and to narrow down some suggestions for getting a better deal for their cash. With many of our constituents, particularly our elderly constituents, there is a lot of inertia because they are not receiving very much on their deposits. This approach would give them a nudge that there are better rates out there that they could be receiving.</p> <p pid="d410.2/9">A customer might have invested in a fund on a platform many years ago and have done nothing with it since. If the fund is poorly performing, they could get a nudge with some personalised guidance. A customer who opened a junior ISA, which by definition would have a very long time horizon, might get a nudge that cash was not the ideal investment, and that in his or her circumstances an investment with a longer time horizon might provide better protection from inflation.</p>            </div>

Gentleman for signing the new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a>, and for his Committee&#8217;s excellent report. He is right to suggest that the workplace is one of the best places for people to be given these nudges, and for employers to explore that boundary between advice and guidance.</p> <p pid="d412.1/2">Our constituents are craving advice of this kind, especially during this cost of living crisis. They want more guidance from their financial institutions. They are turning to online sources of often unregulated information to help them navigate their finances. They are finding the process complex and confusing. They are choosing investments that are often very high risk and not suited to them at all, such as meme stocks, crypto or spread betting.</p> <p pid="d412.1/3">It should not need to be this way, because the technology exists for financial services and fintech firms to guide people towards making better financial choices and following good mainstream investment opportunities, but MiFID-originated legislation is getting in the way. My new clause would enable the Treasury to introduce, with great urgency, the necessary legislation to allow regulated financial services firms to offer UK households personalised guidance. It is a great opportunity to unlock investment in our country, it will help our constituents to earn more, and it will allow innovation. Financial technology will help our constituents to level up their own economic futures. I am therefore delighted that the Economic Secretary has agreed today to look into this as a matter of urgency.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d412.4/1">I entirely agree with what <a href="/mp/?p=24785" title="Our page on Harriett Baldwin - 'the hon. Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin)'">Harriett Baldwin</a> has said, and I apologise for not signing her new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a>; I wish I had.</p> <p pid="d412.4/2">I will be very brief, Madam <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>. This is an appeal more than anything else. I am concerned about the way in which the Bill will undermine the constraints on commodity market speculation that were introduced during the financial crash of 2007-08. I was in the House before and during that crash. People remember that it was a banking crash based on the sub-prime housing market, but what is less discussed is what then happened with regard to commodity speculation. The funding shifted from housing to commodity and, in particular, food speculation, and we saw massive food price increases as a result. The price of wheat rose by 168% during that period, and the price of rice doubled. This was largely not to do with supply, which at that time was relatively stable; it was to do with commodity speculation.</p> <p pid="d412.4/3">We supported, on a cross-party basis, reforms to regulate the market. We gave the FCA the task of setting position limits. We also opened up the whole commodity market to greater transparency. I accept that there has been a watering-down of those regulations since then, particularly by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Administration">Trump Administration</a> but also by signals from Ministers in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a>. That weakened regulation and weakened culture have opened the door to what is happening now, which is billions shifting into food commodity speculation. This is fuelling the cost of living crisis. It is not just about energy; it is now also about food prices, some of which have gone up by as much as 16%.</p> <p pid="d412.4/4">Of course, we cannot ignore Ukraine, climate change or the breakdown of supply chains with regard to covid, but another severe factor that is influencing this is commodity market volatility. Speculation is creating price rises, and this is making fortunes for individual speculators, but I have to say that the banks themselves are also making a killing at the moment.</p> <p pid="d412.4/5">I say this not as some kind of Cassandra&#8212;I was the first to raise <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Rock">Northern Rock</a> in this Chamber, although others have claimed that too&#8212;but economists on both sides of the Atlantic are saying that this could be a systemic crisis unless we get to grips with it and accept that we need to strengthen, not weaken, regulation. One of the reasons I am concerned is that the Lighthouse report suggests that a lot of commodity investment is taking place by pension funds themselves. That could have an effect not only on prices but on the stability of people&#8217;s pensions.</p> <p pid="d412.4/6">The Government will say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;re not scrapping the limits. We&#8217;re handing over control to the trading floors.&#8221; That is madness in itself. The trading floors have an interest in attracting traders, and the lesson of history is that they cannot be relied upon to regulate themselves. They do not worry about the interests of the whole economy. That is the job of the Government and Parliament. Also, I see no rationale for scrapping the transparency element of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiFID_II">MiFID II</a>. I would love to know what possible justification there could be for undermining access to more transparent information, because the markets are already opaque and this would make them worse.</p> <p pid="d412.4/7">A final comment from me&#8212;you will note that I am well under time, Madam Deputy <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>&#8212;is one that I have made before. The best writer on the banking crash of 1929-30 was J. K. Galbraith, who said that, yes, we would put institutions in place to protect against a repeat of that kind of crash but one of the most  significant things would be memory; people would remember what had happened. Unfortunately, I fear that we are now replicating the circumstances of 2007-08 and undermining the very regulations that we as a House put in place to protect against the food speculation, the price increases and, I have to say, the starvation that occurred as a result of that crisis. I never want to see that again. I think this is a mistake by the Government, and I hope that they will think again. I also think we might be able to bring forward some amendments in <a href="/glossary/?gl=274" title="The other chamber of Parliament, i.e. the House of Lords when said in the..." class="glossary">the other House</a> that will help the Government to move along a more constructive path than the one they are on at the moment.</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 24, tabled in my name and with the support of a number of Members on both sides of the House. It focuses on one of the great challenges of the moment, which is how we reverse the loss of habitats and forests around the world. Deforestation in South America, Asia and, to an increasing degree, in the northern parts of the world is a real crisis for our planet. It is appropriate that we are having this debate today, the day on which the biodiversity summit begins in Montreal. It is my hope that that summit will lead to a new international agreement on tackling habitat and biodiversity loss around the world.</p> <p pid="d414.0/2">New clause 24 focuses on taking the battle against illegal deforestation to the next step. This Government and this House took the first important step last year in the passage of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Act_2021">Environment Act 2021</a>, which introduces a requirement for those dealing in potential forest risk products in the United Kingdom to have a due diligence process in place to ensure that they are not sourcing their products from areas of illegally deforested land. That was a substantial and very positive step, and I am pleased to see that the European Union has taken a similar step this week and is perhaps going slightly further in tackling the issue of forest risk products.</p> <p pid="d414.0/3">But a substantial area that remains untouched both here and in many countries around the world is the question of financial services investing, whether through equities, loans or bonds, in companies that source forest-risk products. We know from the work of organisations such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Witness">Global Witness</a> that, over the years, there have been far too many examples of banks knowingly, or sometimes unknowingly, financing the activities of companies that purchase directly from those who are illegally deforesting areas of the Amazon, for example, for beef production or soya production.</p> <p pid="d414.0/4">We need to extend the work we have already done on forest-risk products, and those who directly deal in them, to the financial services sector and the banks that fund companies that have the potential to participate directly or indirectly, knowingly or unknowingly, in illegal deforestation.</p> <p pid="d414.0/5">I hope the Government will take this on board, and I am grateful to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, <a href="/mp/?p=25344" title="Our page on Tulip Siddiq - 'the hon. Member for Hampstead and Kilburn (Tulip Siddiq)'">Tulip Siddiq</a>, for her words of support. New clause 24 would replicate almost exactly what this House has already approved in the Environment Act 2021, translating it into a duty on the financial services sector to carry out similar due diligence to ensure that its work does not support illegal deforestation.</p> <p pid="d414.0/6">The reality is that these financial services businesses already do due diligence. No major institution simply lends or invests in a business without doing very careful due diligence on where it is putting its money, on the likely return on that investment and on the likely risks of that investment. New clause 24 would not ask them to do something wholly different from what they are already doing; it would simply require them to extend their due diligence into this area, which most institutions, at a senior level, would say is vital to all of us.</p>            </div>

Friend is making an incredibly important point about an issue I also massively care about, and I totally support the ambition to get some form of regulation in this space. When I was environment editor of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Observer">The Observer</a> and <a href="/glossary/?gl=49" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/" class="glossary">The Times</a>, I often wrote about deforestation. There is a real problem with doing due diligence on supply chains, as the loggers in Brazil log illegally but tell their intermediaries that they log legally, so the intermediaries say they are logging legally, and so on. That is all quite difficult to trace. If there is not a robust due diligence system, and many people have struggled on that, my fear is that financial services companies will end up not backing any wood product companies at all, as even the legitimate ones would be seen as a risk.</p>            </div>

What makes it possible for big organisations to track their supply chains is the presence of Earth observation data, which many supermarkets now use to understand where they are sourcing from. Interestingly, it is a central part of this week&#8217;s proposal by the European Union. The data is available, but it is complicated. I recently had a meeting with a major institution that financially supports companies in Brazil, and it said it is incredibly difficult to track, all the way down the supply chain, where products are coming from. Well, it may be incredibly difficult, but it still has to be done.</p> <p pid="d415.1/2">New <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 24 would place a duty on financial institutions, as we did with retailers, to carry out proper due diligence on their investments, to understand and to be absolutely certain that the companies they deal with have due diligence processes in place themselves, so they know from where they are buying beef, soya or palm oil and so they work properly to ensure they deliver products from sustainable sources in a responsible way.</p> <p pid="d415.1/3">We hear warm words coming from the executive suites of our major financial institutions all the time about their commitment to sustainability, to net zero and to being responsible citizens. Sometimes they do it, sometimes they do not. There might be the will in head office, but sometimes a local branch does not deliver. New clause 24 would make it a clear duty on those institutions to do due diligence to make sure they know where products are coming from and so they know where investments are being made. This country has been a leader, and new clause 24 would be one further step in dealing with the blight of deforestation, which affects everyone&#8217;s future.</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 7, which stands in my name and those of dozens of right hon. and hon. Members from all corners of this House.  The <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> is simple: it proposes that the Treasury must not only make provision to guarantee a minimum level of cash access, but ensure that this access is free. Why? Because surely it cannot be right in 2022 that almost a quarter of our cash machines charge people to access their own money.</p> <p pid="d415.2/2">The facts are stark but simple, and may I give particular thanks and praise to Which? for such hard-hitting evidence? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> has lost more than half of its branch network since 2015&#8212;that is 5,013 branches, at a terrifying rate of 54 every month. But money talks, and as they flee the high streets, our free cash machines disappear with them. We have lost 12,599 free-to-use ATMs in the UK since 2018, which is a decrease of nearly 24%&#8212;and it is getting worse. Replacing them are paid machines, with almost a quarter of ATMs now charging people to access their own cash. The providers really are in the money. How can that possibly be right at any time, never mind in the heart of a cost of living crisis, where the reliance on cash has soared, with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=124" title="http://www.postoffice.co.uk/" class="glossary">Post Office</a> handling its highest total on record in August?</p> <p pid="d415.2/3">This is not just a problem for rural areas. As we have already discussed, in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> in south London, Mitcham has seen three bank branches flee our town centre in the last three years. When Barclays left, it swapped a busy branch for a bus that pulled up every now and then outside the empty building. But at least Barclays had the decency to show up to face the music at a public meeting, unlike Halifax, whose pledge to engage with its most vulnerable customers did not quite chime with its no-show at a packed <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mark">St Mark</a>&#8217;s church hall. Many of the attendees were from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollards_Hill">Pollards Hill</a>, a neighbourhood cut off from the London transport network, with residents relying on the small shopping parade for everyday spends. There are two cash machines on the parade, but both charge a fee and are very profitable. That means that residents who are carefully managing a budget and taking out &#163;10 at a time face a 20% premium just to access their own cash. How can that possibly be right or fair? When the Co-op moved into the parade last year, with the expectation of bringing a free-to-use machine with it, a ridiculous clause in its lease prevented it from opening a free ATM. If this is happening in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitcham_and_Morden">Mitcham and Morden</a>, it is happening in all hon. Members&#8217; constituencies.</p> <p pid="d415.2/4">Success has many parents, and if this new clause is successful today, it will be in no small part thanks to the six Select Committee Chairs, seven members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_Committee">Treasury Committee</a> and the dozens of <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> MPs, from all parties, who have put their names to it. But I recognise the particular importance of the 21 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_MPs">Conservative MPs</a> who have put their heads above the parapet to add their voice on behalf of their constituents. I thank them, because I recognise the importance of working on a cross-party basis when an issue is as uncontroversial as this. I sincerely hope they will bring their view and their colleagues to the voting Lobby later today.</p> <p pid="d415.2/5">I understand that the Government are considering advising free access in the policy statement, concerned that requiring free access will result in the loss of paid machines. That simply does not make sense.</p>            </div>

It is why MP after MP has led local campaigns fighting to save bank branches in their town centres, but what is the point of the photo in the local newspaper or the packed public meeting unless the rhetoric is matched by a vote in favour today?</p> <p pid="d417.0/3">It is time for Members to put their money where their mouth is, to listen to their constituents, to challenge their Whip, and to make a simple, lasting change for the most vulnerable people in their community. It is uncontroversial, tangible, straightforward, no nonsense, common sense and cross party. Free access to cash is, quite simply, bang on the money, and I hope that it will have the support of the House.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d417.1/1">After such a thoughtful presentation by <a href="/mp/?p=10381" title="Our page on Siobhain McDonagh - 'the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh)'">Siobhain McDonagh</a>, I am sure the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will consider carefully her entreaties and also the opinions of those on the Conservative Benches.</p> <p pid="d417.1/2">I congratulate the Minister and his Treasury team on this important and big Bill passing through its Committee stage and maintaining its cross-party support, which is so evident here today.</p> <p pid="d417.1/3">One of my greatest concerns about the Bill is that we underestimate the importance and the severity of the international competition that our financial services face. We are in a fierce global competition and the balance of risk has to be that the UK will not move fast enough, it will not be smart enough and its moves will not be significant enough to maintain and build the comparative advantage of our financial services sector, which is why I have tabled some of my new clauses. It is also why I am looking forward to hearing what the Minister will say to reassure me in his closing remarks.</p> <p pid="d417.1/4">We need a Bill, a Government and a country that are pro the financial services sector. That is where the wealth is created in this country. If we do not allow the financial services sector in this country to grow to be globally competitive we are harming the taxes that then pay for all the public services on which our constituents depend. In addition, as my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25614" title="Our page on Vicky Ford - 'the Member for Chelmsford (Vicky Ford)'">Vicky Ford</a> has said, and as is the case in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> and the constituency of my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25290" title="Our page on Craig Tracey - 'the Member for North Warwickshire (Craig Tracey)'">Craig Tracey</a>, I have many constituents whose incomes are directly related to the success of our financial services sector.</p> <p pid="d417.1/5">My new clauses put down some requirements on the regulator to get with that spirit behind its new objective of international competitiveness. New <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 12 would make it a requirement to publish regulatory performance information that is material to new authorisations, because  new authorisations mean growth for the United Kingdom&#8217;s financial services sector. We need a very close focus on how effective the regulators are being on that, and the new clause asks for some general statistics.</p> <p pid="d417.1/6">New clause 13 talks about how the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Conduct_Authority">Financial Conduct Authority</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudential_Regulation_Authority">Prudential Regulation Authority</a> work effectively to support already authorised firms, and is specifically to do with approved persons, rules and timings on change in control, variation of permissions and waivers and modifications. Those are the tools of doing business, and if they are not greased and moving quickly enough, that is a source of competitive disadvantage.</p> <p pid="d417.1/7">New clause 14 is about determination of applications. It would create a new key performance indicator for the FCA. None of this is a criticism of the two individuals who run the FCA and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRA">PRA</a>. They are doing a fine job, but the FCA has a lot of KPIs, which have nothing to do with how effective it is in building the financial services sector in this country. It needs to rebalance&#8212;I know the Minister is supportive of this&#8212;and I will talk about that in a minute.</p> <p pid="d417.1/8">New clause 15 would create a duty for the regulators to report on their competitiveness and growth objectives. For me, this is a crucial new clause, and I would like to hear from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> today that the Minister will commit to this report. If he could look through some of the specific items in my new clause about what should be included, I would very much appreciate a specific response.</p> <p pid="d417.1/9"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> talked about the proportionality principle, and there is indeed a proportionality principle, but I reworded it, because it was not done in a way that was effective for the success of our financial services sector and made a difference between wholesale and retail financial services firms. I have tabled amendments about the cost-benefit panel, which gets to the root and branch of how Government should work out whether to enact a new regulation: what are the cost and what are the benefits?</p> <p pid="d417.1/10">I appreciate that the Minister has said that he is excluding people who are direct employees of the regulators from being part of those panels, and it seems a pretty basic principle that people should not mark their own homework. However, we need the voices of those who are being regulated in that cost-benefit analysis&#8212;their opinions, their views and their data.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d419.2/1">With respect, I did not say it was the position of the Government, but the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> cannot deny that it has been advocated for on many occasions during the referendum campaign and on many occasions since. I think he is being disingenuous.</p> <p pid="d419.2/2">Although the Liberal Democrats welcome some aspects of the Bill that will update the regulatory framework for financial services, we remain concerned by the lack of accountability of the regulators to Parliament and by the potential impact of this Bill on financial stability. The Government have described this Bill as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape financial regulation, but as currently written the Bill lacks ambition and inspiration. In particular, it is a missed opportunity to create a regulatory framework that turbocharges the green agenda and strengthens protections for victims of fraud.</p> <p pid="d419.2/3">My fundamental concern with the drafting of the Bill is how it undermines the role of Parliament while extending significant new powers to both regulators and the Treasury. As ever, the devil is in the detail, which will be largely hidden within secondary legislation that will not receive parliamentary scrutiny or oversight. Accountability and transparency are the cornerstone of effective regulation. It is vital that those principles are upheld to maintain national and international confidence in the UK&#8217;s financial services sector and to improve the operational performance of regulators.</p> <p pid="d419.2/4">The Bill did not previously contain sufficient powers to require the regulators to report on their performance against their objectives. I am therefore pleased that the Government have made some steps towards improving accountability and transparency though the addition of new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 17. However, the new clause still does not go far enough in establishing parliamentary oversight of the regulators. Regulators&#8217; powers are granted by  Parliament, and that is who they should be accountable to&#8212;not to a Minister who may only be in place for a matter of weeks.</p> <p pid="d419.2/5">I remain concerned that the new statutory objective on international competitiveness could increase risk-taking in the financial services sector. We do not need to be reminded of just how damaging that sort of behaviour can be. I am particularly concerned that the secondary objective of competitiveness will negatively impact the regulator&#8217;s delivery of its primary objective of ensuring financial stability.</p> <p pid="d419.2/6">Our amendments (a) and (b) to new clause 17 would place additional requirements on the regulators to report on the delivery of their objectives, including with an assessment of the impact of the Bill on financial stability. If the last few months have proved anything, it is that volatility in financial markets has a very real and direct impact on households, so I urge the Government to think about how the Bill can be strengthened to ensure that financial stability remains at the forefront of regulators&#8217; activities.</p> <p pid="d419.2/7">I am pleased to see that a number of amendments on green finance have been tabled, but it is disappointing to see the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a>&#8217; lack of ambition in that area. We have such an opportunity to be a leading global centre for green finance, but the Bill does nothing to facilitate that. There is an increasing appetite among investors to support the green transition, but British businesses often struggle to access the green capital they need. New clause 33, tabled in my name, would place a requirement on the regulators to report on ways in which they have promoted and incentivised green finance and green investment. Time is running out for us to lead the world on this, and I urge the Government to commit to a green finance strategy and to start thinking seriously about how a regulatory framework can mobilise green finance.</p> <p pid="d419.2/8">The final aspect of the Bill that I will talk about is its failure to tackle fraud, of which there is only one mention. Fraud causes enormous financial hardship and distress to businesses and individuals, and the Government are simply not taking it seriously enough. According to figures from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Finance">UK Finance</a>, less than half the money through bank transfer scams is reimbursed to the victims&#8212;in 2021, that equated to just &#163;271 million of &#163;583 million. Clause 64 requires banks to reimburse victims of push payment scams, but it allows the payment services regulator to set the rules on the grounds of reimbursement. We have tabled <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 7 to close that loophole and ensure that banks cannot refuse to reimburse victims on the grounds that they ought to have known it was a scam. This Government must do more to protect victims of fraud; the onus should not be solely on individuals to protect themselves, because they are being increasingly disempowered.</p> <p pid="d419.2/9">To conclude, we welcome the Bill in principle, but there are real weaknesses in its drafting&#8212;primarily, the lack of parliamentary oversight and the missed opportunities in promoting green finance and tackling fraud.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d420.0/1">In 1215, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta">Magna Carta</a> was written and signed into law by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_John_I_of_England">King John I of England</a>. Although that important document did not guarantee freedom of speech, it was  considered the cornerstone of liberty in England and began a tradition of civil rights in Britain that laid the foundations for our first <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_of_1689">Bill of Rights of 1689</a>, which granted freedom of speech in Parliament.</p> <p pid="d420.0/2">That was the first time in history that any form of freedom of speech was codified in law. It was extremely influential throughout the western world, leading to the declaration of the rights of man in 1789&#8212;a fundamental document of the French revolution that provided for freedom of speech&#8212;and the US Bill of Rights in 1791. In 1948, the universal declaration of human rights was adopted virtually unanimously by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_General_Assembly">UN General Assembly</a>, and urged member nations</p> <p class="indent" pid="d420.0/3" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;to promote a number of human, civil, economic, and social rights&#8221;,</p> <p pid="d420.0/4">including freedom of expression. Under article 10 of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Act_1998">Human Rights Act 1998</a>,</p> <p class="indent" pid="d420.0/5" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Everyone has the right to freedom of expression&#8230;subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society&#8221;.</p> <p pid="d420.0/6">Criminalising the incitement of violence or threats, for example, is widely considered a justifiable limit on freedom of expression.</p> <p pid="d420.0/7">What we cannot have are global tech firms, online payment services, banks and others deciding who they can censor because they do not like or are offended by the views of others. It is essential to have freedom of expression&#8212;it is essential to society&#8212;and we have to be able to express and discuss differing ideas and ideals to ensure that we have a full and therefore better understanding of the challenges we all face in this modern world.</p> <p pid="d420.0/8">Freedom of expression in the UK is under threat and must be protected. New <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 27 protects free speech and the exercise of free expression. It seeks to prohibit service refusal by financial service providers on grounds relating to lawful exercise of free expression by requiring providers to explain the reason for a refusal of service, allowing the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Conduct_Authority">Financial Conduct Authority</a> to intervene, and creating a civil law remedy for affected customers. We should not allow a system where payment service providers or even high street banks can terminate the accounts of individuals or organisations on the basis of lawful speech if adequate notice is given. Britain has led the world for centuries on democracy and freedom of speech, and it needs to do so again against the global tech companies that want to impose their view of the world and stifle free speech.</p> <p pid="d420.0/9">Members may remember in early September media agitation surrounding <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal">PayPal</a>&#8217;s decision to cancel the online payment accounts of the Daily Sceptic, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Speech_Union">Free Speech Union</a> and an individual&#8217;s personal accounts. Many of us here may not agree with the politics of these organisations or that individual, but it is fundamentally wrong that online payment accounts can be exited because the payment service provider or its staff do not agree with the opinions of the service user. We are not talking about hate speech, terrorism or crime&#8212;we have legislation to deal with that; we are talking about lawful speech.</p> <p pid="d420.0/10">The relatively recent digitalisation of financial transactions has placed an unprecedented amount of power in the hands of online payment service providers such as PayPal, as well as banks, credit companies and online platforms. UK legislation must keep pace with these rapid technological changes and financial censorship  must be prevented. As we switch to an increasingly cashless society, we must put in legislation to protect people from being punished by payment processors for expressing legal, but different views, no matter our politics.</p> <p pid="d420.0/11">New clause 27 is designed to ensure that the regulator has the ability to ensure that financial service providers cannot withdraw or withhold service from a customer on political grounds. The battle to preserve free speech in our society is something we must all fight for. Rising political polarisation is contributing to the threat to our freedom of expression, and the alternative&#8212;placing power in the hands of the easily offended&#8212;cannot be an option. This issue has to be of grave concern to us all, whatever our politics. I am grateful to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for his assurances earlier, spelling out what he is going to do and his commitment to take this matter further.

Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 10, and I am pleased to have worked alongside <a href="/mp/?p=10119" title="Our page on Geoffrey Clifton-Brown - 'the hon. Member for The Cotswolds (Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown)'">Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown</a> on it, as fellow members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Accounts_Committee">Public Accounts Committee</a>. Since 2017, I have worked with others supporting steelworker pensioners across <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaenau_Gwent">Blaenau Gwent</a> and the United Kingdom. Thousands of them fell victim to financial sharks. They were wrongly advised to move out of their defined benefit <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Steel">British Steel</a> pension scheme. It took until last Monday, five years later, for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Conduct_Authority">Financial Conduct Authority</a> to announce a redress scheme. It was about time. The FCA righted those wrongs, but I think too late.</p> <p pid="d422.0/2">Early on in the campaign, I remember meeting the then chief executive of the FCA, now the Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, where I was met with a lacklustre response. Along with my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25297" title="Our page on Stephen Kinnock - 'the Member for Aberavon (Stephen Kinnock)'">Stephen Kinnock</a> and other campaigners, I continued to press the FCA. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_2020">In 2020</a>, I wrote to its newly appointed chief executive, however Mr Rathi did not want to meet. He asked one of his directors to meet us instead.</p> <p pid="d422.0/3">Later, in 2021, frustrated with the FCA giving us the cold shoulder, I wrote to the Comptroller and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditor_General">Auditor General</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Audit_Office">National Audit Office</a>. I asked if it would please investigate the FCA&#8217;s oversight of this terrible scandal. Fair do&#8217;s, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAO">NAO</a> did that, and it published its full report in March this year. It observed that in the summer of 2017:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d422.0/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;The FCA had limited insight into&#8230;what was happening in the BSPS at the time of its restructure.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d422.0/5">There were terrible things going on.</p> <p pid="d422.0/6">Even more damning were the conclusions of the Public Accounts Committee. We found that:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d422.0/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;The FCA failed to take swift and effective action at all stages of the BSPS case.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d422.0/8">It failed</p> <p class="indent" pid="d422.0/9" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;to prevent consumers from being harmed&#8221;,</p> <p pid="d422.0/10">which makes clear the</p> <p pid="d422.0/11">&#8220;limitations with the FCA&#8217;s supervisory approach&#8221;.</p> <p pid="d422.0/12">The point is that the FCA took proper notice of this injustice only when Parliament, through the NAO and eventually the Public Accounts Committee, dug deep to investigate.</p> <p pid="d422.0/13">Of course, the BSPS case is not the only example of the FCA&#8217;s failure to protect consumers in recent years; I have heard many complaints from Members across the House. The scandals surrounding Blackmore Bond, Dolphin and Azure come to mind. Consumers are our financial sector. As long as the FCA fails to exercise its powers to protect ordinary workers, it will continue to fail our constituents. New clause 10 would require the FCA&#8217;s consumer panel to lay an official report before Parliament. We could then judge whether the regulator is fulfilling its duty to protect consumers.</p> <p pid="d422.0/14">During my 12 years in this House, I have learned many things, but one thing stands out: parliamentary scrutiny matters. I am pleased to have support from across the House for the new clause&#8212;from our Labour Treasury team, senior Conservative Members, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_Committee">Treasury Committee</a> members, other colleagues and fellow members of the Public Accounts Committee. By supporting our new clause, Britain&#8217;s consumers could be better heard, and our financial services sector would be all the better for it.</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 7, as I may not be able to be present at the conclusion of the debate, but I wanted to speak on the issue, having campaigned on it since I returned to the Back Benches, principally with my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24764" title="Our page on Paul Maynard - 'the Member for Blackpool North and Cleveleys (Paul Maynard)'">Paul Maynard</a>. I am very pleased with what is proposed overall in the Bill, because during the period of covid it became clear that the system of use of cash could have collapsed. It was incoherent in the way it was managed and regulated, and we saw the potential pressures of not using cash or its usage not being permitted.</p> <p pid="d423.0/2">I am disappointed that my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25346" title="Our page on Kit Malthouse - 'the Member for North West Hampshire (Kit Malthouse)'">Kit Malthouse</a> has left the Chamber, because I could not disagree more with the points that he made in interventions. We cannot simply move in an unstructured way to a cashless society. We are not ready for that. As I pointed out in an <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>, about 8 million people, whether they are rural dwellers or those living in deprived areas, rely on cash and will continue to do so. I declare that I still have a chequebook, because there are circumstances, particularly when dealing with small voluntary organisations, where a cheque is accepted. Cheques may be on the way out, but there are still circumstances where they are required. Therefore, we have to move forward at the pace of the slowest in our society.</p> <p pid="d423.0/3">I believe that the prospect of regulation has been very positive, in terms of forcing the banks and others in the sector to become a lot more constructive in the debates and discussions. As the hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitcham_and_Morden">Mitcham and Morden</a> mentioned, the banks have been pretty disingenuous over the period. I have had many closures in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, and they have often been made with undertakings that certain things would happen. For example, in the community of Lochmaben, the branch closed and the free auto-<a href="/glossary/?gl=240" title="A person involved in the counting of votes. Derived from the word..." class="glossary">teller</a> was to remain; now it is to be removed, two or three years on. Often the promises given are not worth very much, but I am sure that the  threat of legislation, and hearing the Minister say that the Government&#8217;s position is a commitment to free access to cash, will ensure that the industry stays on board and delivers for people.</p> <p pid="d423.0/4">As has been set out, there has been a significant drop in the number not only of bank branches but of free-to-access ATMs, while the number of ATMs that require a fee has risen. As the Minister would expect from our lively discussion, I am in favour of consumer choice&#8212;if people want to pay for convenience, that is fine by me&#8212;but they should not have to pay several pounds to withdraw &#163;10 from an ATM. At the core of this issue is the fact that many transactions are small transactions, not the ones that we might think of that are made of larger cash sums, which is why we have to stick to the free-to-access commitment.</p> <p pid="d423.0/5">There are two points that I would like the Minister to address, as I asked him to do when we met. First, the FCA should have an overview of the ability to use cash. There are many anecdotes about whether cash can be used in particular circumstances, but we need to know the facts about the current reality of locations where people can and cannot use cash, and the FCA should have a role in that. Secondly, I would like more detail about what the geographic requirement will be for people to have an ability to access cash. I have one of the largest constituencies in the United Kingdom&#8212;indeed, it is larger than any constituency in England or Wales&#8212;and its needs are clearly different from central London. We need to get that right.</p> <p pid="d423.0/6">We also need to get the situation right with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=124" title="http://www.postoffice.co.uk/" class="glossary">post office</a>. In the earlier statement, I was pleased to hear my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25844" title="Our page on Duncan Baker - 'the Member for North Norfolk (Duncan Baker)'">Duncan Baker</a> highlight the fact that it is not working in the way that we would want and it is not an attractive prospect for many businesses. In my constituency, when a post office is cited as being close by, that often means a small van going to a community for two hours a week; it does not mean that there is a post office in that community.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d424.1/1">I rise to speak to new clauses 22, 23 and 29 and amendments 19, 21 and 22 in my name, which are all about financial inclusion. I thank Martin Coppack from Fair By Design, the Phoenix Group and Mastercard for meeting me earlier this week to talk about why they support financial inclusion.</p> <p pid="d424.1/2">When we think of financial inclusion, we tend to think of the consumer groups that support it, such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Advice">Citizens Advice</a>, and it is not widely known that it is supported by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100">FTSE 100</a> companies such as the Phoenix Group, Mastercard and Legal &amp; General. When I asked why they support it, they said that since we left the EU, regulators are more powerful than ever before. Of course, I do not believe that the Government should have the call-in powers that were debated earlier. That huge  transfer of powers to the regulator means that it becomes even more crucial for Parliament to set the correct objectives; we have to get the objectives right if we are to allow our regulators to function effectively in the post-Brexit world.</p> <p pid="d424.1/3">There was a rumour that the Government were keen to push back on any additional objectives for the regulators. Apparently, they compared it with the national curriculum, where everybody wants to get their bit in, and perhaps in the same way, everybody wants their bit to be a new objective for the regulators. But even if that is the case&#8212;clearly, there is a demand for the regulators to have many new objectives and for objectives to be strengthened&#8212;that does not mean that we are incorrect, because financial inclusion is important. Ensuring that the FCA has regard to financial inclusion turns it from a nice to have to something that we must have. It would embed financial inclusion in the design of financial services and products forever.</p> <p pid="d424.1/4">When I met people from Mastercard and they were talking to me about future innovations in financial services, fintech and the way financial services are developing new products, they said that at the moment financial inclusion is seen as an add-on, in that they develop a product, and financial inclusion is fitted into it by asking, &#8220;Well, how can we make this financially inclusive?&#8221; Those from Mastercard told me that they want financial inclusion to be there from the beginning, so that when new products are designed and created, it is given primacy, and is there throughout the whole design.</p> <p pid="d424.1/5">Without financial inclusion, constituents will continue to face what is called the poverty premium. I have spoken before about the poverty premium, which is basically the additional cost of being poor, and it explains why it is so expensive to have such a low income. In Kingston upon <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_West_and_Hessle">Hull West and Hessle</a>, the poverty premium works out at &#163;459 per household, which is nearly &#163;6 million paid in extra costs by my constituents just because they happen to come from lower-income families. This is all calculated by Fair By Design.</p> <p pid="d424.1/6">For too long, the idea of financial inclusion has been a hot potato passed between the FCA, the Treasury and other regulators and Departments, with nobody prepared to take ultimate responsibility. For example, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_and_Markets_Authority">Competition and Markets Authority</a> started to carry out investigatory work on the poverty premium across essential services, but in the end determined it was too difficult, and it now signposts organisations to sector regulators such as the FCA. However, the sector regulators say that this is not their responsibility, as it involves elements of social policy and pricing of risk&#8212;and so we go on.</p> <p pid="d424.1/7">We are asking the FCA to collate the information needed to really look at and analyse the poverty premium. Of course, as we expected, the FCA says it does not want another objective. I think we probably understand why it does not want to be given any additional work to do, but it is our job as Parliament to set and establish the types of financial services we want, and to ask what our principles are as parliamentarians, what things we care about and what we want our future financial services to look like. Surely Members across the House would agree that having a financially inclusive sector or financially inclusive products that cater for people right across the population of the UK, not merely the most profitable ones, is a good thing.</p> <p pid="d424.1/8">When I was talking to people from Mastercard and Phoenix about this, they said that financial inclusion could open up new markets for them among those who would be interested in their products, if they were designed in an effective way. My new clauses and amendments ask the FCA to have regard to financial inclusion, and would place a duty on the FCA to report to Parliament annually on how well it is doing with financial inclusion and giving that information back to us. The proposals would end the current damaging situation by placing a clear remit on the regulator to ensure it routinely and properly explores financial inclusion issues across its work, allowing greater clarity on unintended consequences and the best interventions needed to ensure financial inclusion, as well as who is best placed to act.</p> <p pid="d424.1/9">The Government could save my constituents in Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle nearly &#163;6 million, and it would not cost them a penny. Surely that, if nothing else, means that the Government should look more favourably at the amendments I have tabled.</p>            </div>

Member for Blaenau Gwent (Nick Smith)'">Nick Smith</a> on tabling new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 10, for which he should receive much of the credit. This <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> has an extremely simple intent in laying a duty on the FCA to report to Parliament on</p> <p class="indent" pid="d426.0/3" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;(a) the adequacy and appropriateness of the FCA&#8217;s use of its regulatory powers; (b) the measures the FCA has taken to protect vulnerable consumers, including pensioners, people with disabilities, and people receiving forms of income support; <br><strong>and</strong>&#8221;&#8212; finally and most importantly&#8212;</p> <p class="indent" pid="d426.0/5" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;(c) the FCA&#8217;s receptiveness to the recommendations of the Consumer Panel.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d426.0/6">I will now say why paragraph (c), in particular, is so important. The hon. Member has explained clearly why the FCA should regularly report to Parliament, and in my role as deputy Chairman of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Accounts_Committee">Public Accounts Committee</a>, I have constantly urged openness and transparency, wherever possible, so that our constituents can make full and proper judgments on the actions, or lack of them, of regulators such as the FCA.</p> <p pid="d426.0/7">Like the hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaenau_Gwent">Blaenau Gwent</a>, I will give the House an example. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAC">PAC</a> inquiry that we held in April and June this year highlighted the plight of some 2,000 of the 7,700 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Steel">British Steel</a> pensioners who in 2019 suffered significant financial shortfalls because of the wrong advice given by a significant number of independent financial advisers who advised pensioners to opt out of their valuable defined-benefit pension schemes. To add further insult to injury, the actions by the regulator caused a number of independent financial adviser companies to go out of business or merge with others, and therefore the compensation that pensioners received rightly was capped. I know this is a complicated subject but both the hon. Member and I are using it as an egregious example of why the FCA needs to be more accountable to Parliament and our constituents. This amendment stems from recommendations 5a and 5b in the PAC report &#8220;Investigation into the British Steel Pension Scheme&#8221;, published on <phrase class="date" code="">21 July</phrase>:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d426.0/8" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;The FCA should be more proactive and consumer-focused in its engagement with stakeholders. It should have a better mechanism for responding to consumer harms and collect more evidence on a regular basis to pick up on issues that are being raised, especially  from emerging risks in financial markets&#8230;The FCA must also review how effective the Financial Services Consumer Panel is at consumer protection and how it influences policy debates within the FCA from a consumer angle.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d426.0/9">The hon. Member and I have had discussions with the Economic Secretary, who is on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> today, and I believe he is sympathetic to the principle that the FCA needs to be much more accountable. If that is the case, I very much hope that he will concede the principle of this amendment and incorporate it as a Government amendment in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>. Neither the hon. Member nor I wish to be prescriptive about how or when this reporting should take place to Parliament; that is a matter for the Government.</p> <p pid="d426.0/10">No financial institution will ultimately exist without its consumers. The whole point of the FCA as a regulatory authority is to protect their interests. Rather than having to work through long and complicated reports, there needs to be clear, easily available information on what regulators are doing, or not doing, on their behalf. All of this requires a fundamental shift in the regulator&#8217;s&#8212;the FCA&#8217;s&#8212;attitude to the consumer and a commitment to engage more when things go wrong.</p> <p pid="d426.0/11">Finally, I want to comment on the fraud aspects of the Bill. The PAC recently conducted an inquiry on fraud and discovered that 41% of all reported crime in June was accounted for by fraud, up from 30% in 2017, yet just 1% of police resources is being devoted to fraud crimes. So we urgently need to see the Government&#8217;s new comprehensive fraud strategy.</p>            </div>

Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25646" title="Our page on Emma Hardy - 'the Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Emma Hardy)'">Emma Hardy</a>, to new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 7, to my <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>, and indeed to the points made by <a href="/mp/?p=10119" title="Our page on Geoffrey Clifton-Brown - 'the hon. Member for The Cotswolds (Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown)'">Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown</a>: many of us have had concerns about the FCA and its ability to represent consumers for many years, and it is good to see that work being done.</p> <p pid="d427.0/2">I shall focus on new clause 28. The bridge of the Titanic received seven warnings about icebergs. It was told exactly where the iceberg was, but on hearing those warnings it varied the direction of travel by one or two degrees yet kept going full steam ahead. The visible iceberg was 50 to 100 feet high and 200 to 400 feet long, yet still they ploughed into it. It does not take a rocket scientist to recognise that we have a personal debt crisis in this country with a cost of living crisis, that our constituents are struggling because there is too much month at the end of their money, and that those who make their money from those who are struggling are licking their lips.</p> <p pid="d427.0/3">This Bill is about financial regulation yet one of the most pernicious legal loan sharks is the buy now, pay later industry. The pool in which they fish is wide. This country has &#163;205 billion-worth of consumer credit lending to account for, up &#163;482 million on the previous month. People are borrowing not just to pay <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Paul">Peter and Paul</a>, but to pay for their mortgages, to put food on their table, petrol in their car and clothes on their children&#8217;s backs. Let me be clear: I do not stand here with a hair shirt on saying nobody should borrow, but in that environment, when our constituents are being exploited  by these companies, it is absolutely right to regulate them and protect our constituents, yet that is not what is happening here.</p> <p pid="d427.0/4">For nearly three years we have been warning the Government on the need to act on legal loans harks and the buy now, pay later companies&#8212;those warnings that came to the bridge of the Titanic. The Klarnas, the Laybuys and the Clearpays are the companies whose names we see when we go to check out online. They account for 6% of all online spending in the UK, and that is expected to double in the next two years. High thousands of reputable retailers have them on their websites. They have them not to help people to spread their payments as the companies claim, but because people spend on average 30% to 40% more if they use buy now, pay later.</p> <p pid="d427.0/5">But what people are telling us very clearly is that they are spending money they do not have. A quarter of all buy now, pay later users have been unable to pay for at least one essential because they are having to make repayments on buy now, pay later products. Some 25% of users have also missed a payment or made a late payment on a buy now, pay later loan in the last 12 months.</p> <p pid="d427.0/6">In the three years we have been warning, urging, holding votes in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> and begging the Government to regulate those companies, the companies have exploded their interest across the UK. Companies such as Klarna are now worth billions of pounds because they can exploit our constituents. Two and a half years ago, the FCA said, &#8220;Yes, we should regulate these companies.&#8221; They exploit a loophole. Officially they do not charge interest, so they are not regulated by consumer credit.</p> <p pid="d427.0/7">What does that mean in practice? It does not just mean that right now our constituents are better protected if they take out a payday loan; it means they have nobody to complain to. They cannot go to the ombudsman if they feel they have been mis-sold this type of credit, and many constituents and consumers are saying they are being mis-sold. They did not realise that they had used buy now, pay later because it is so pervasive on websites. It means that consumers are dependent on the companies themselves, because they are not regulated, to do their own affordability checks, which is literally like asking turkeys whether they think Christmas is a good idea. It also means that when consumers get into debt they can only turn to these companies again for help.</p> <p pid="d427.0/8">For retailers, this is where the money is being made: the 30% to 40% extra that people are spending that they do not have. It is worth recognising who is using these companies. This is not about fast fashion anymore. People are buying food using buy now, pay later. The average age of users is my age, 44&#8212;I am actually 45, but there you go. One in 10 people using the service are buying basic items such as toiletries and food. We can now get Klarna on Deliveroo and Zilch on the Domino&#8217;s Pizza app.</p> <p pid="d427.0/9">For years, we have been forwarding proposals to regulate and the Government have accepted proposals to regulate, yet regulation has not come. We have had consultation after consultation. Indeed, the companies themselves now say they think they should be regulated. They all say, as they do, &#8220;It&#8217;s the others who are the bad  apples. We&#8217;re not the bad guys; it&#8217;s somebody else.&#8221; Where have we heard that before? Where have we seen this behaviour before&#8212;dragging people into debt so they keep having to borrow from you because they cannot go to anyone else? We have seen that from the Wongas, the BrightHouses and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amigo_Loans">Amigo Loans</a> of this world. Time and again, high-cost credit companies have plagued our constituents and we have been too slow to tackle them. Why have we been too slow? Because of the idea about unintended consequences.</p> <p pid="d427.0/10">The iceberg is looming. We can see it in the water. We can already see the numbers of people who are getting into debt. This time last year, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StepChange">StepChange</a> reported that 10% of all adults were holding one or more buy now, pay later debts. A survey out today says that 40% of our constituents will put their Christmas spending on buy now, pay later. To wait another year is unforgivable in a cost of living crisis. New clause 28 would bring in the protection of the ombudsman, so that at the very least when people come to our <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> surgeries there is somebody who can take up their case.</p> <p pid="d427.0/11">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> ignored my question before, using time as the reason why. He has to do better than that. We have to understand what is being done to urgently tackle the damage that these companies have done. I can tell him that I heard all these stories before in relation to legal loan sharks, and we still have thousands of people in debt because of Wonga. Let us not make the same mistakes again. Let us regulate the buy now, pay later lenders and make sure that this Christmas does not turn into a terrible January for all our constituents.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d429.0/1">I rise to speak in support of new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 27, tabled by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25902" title="Our page on Sally-Ann Hart - 'the Member for Hastings and Rye (Sally-Ann Hart)'">Sally-Ann Hart</a>. As she said, it would prohibit payment service providers from refusing to supply a customer based on the customer exercising their lawful right to freedom of expression.</p> <p pid="d429.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="">15 September</phrase>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal">PayPal</a> notified the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Speech_Union">Free Speech Union</a> that it had closed its account with immediate effect. The reason given was that the Free Speech Union had breached the company&#8217;s acceptable use policy, but no further information was forthcoming. The accounts of UsForThem, the Daily Sceptic and the journalist <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Young">Toby Young</a> were also terminated. It is still not entirely clear why PayPal closed the accounts, but the apparently common theme among those organisations and individuals is that they have each become prominent champions of free speech, expressing critical, non-conforming opinions and asking challenging questions.</p> <p pid="d429.0/3">The effect of PayPal&#8217;s decision was to temporarily disrupt the ability of those organisations to operate. In some cases, their accounts were frozen, thereby denying them access to their funds. In the light of that, 42 peers and MPs wrote to the then <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Secretary">Business Secretary</a>, my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24926" title="Our page on Jacob Rees-Mogg - 'the Member for North East Somerset (Mr Rees-Mogg)'">Mr Rees-Mogg</a>, and to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> currently on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>. PayPal then restored the accounts of UsForThem and the Free Speech Union. Although PayPal&#8217;s actions may seem unjustifiable, payment providers and high street banks may terminate the accounts of groups on the basis of lawful speech, so long as adequate notice is given. As the law stands, the only thing that PayPal did wrong was not to give sufficient notice of the closure.</p> <p pid="d429.0/4">Sadly, the actions of PayPal in September were not a one-off. It also closed the accounts of the UK Medical Freedom Alliance and Law or Fiction, both of which are opposed to lockdowns, and it has not reopened either of them. It is therefore hard to avoid interpreting PayPal&#8217;s actions as an orchestrated, politically motivated move to restrict certain views within the UK. This is unacceptable.</p> <p pid="d429.0/5">In an increasingly cashless society&#8212;we have heard a lot about the merits of cash today&#8212;access to a digital payment system is not a luxury, but a basic requirement for participation in society. No campaigning organisation can function without the ability to perform financial transactions. Imagine if the suffragettes had not been allowed to have or use cash, or if those campaigning for Brexit had been refused a bank account. Freedom of speech and freedom of expression are foundational to democracy, and there can be no meaningful freedom of expression without the ability to conduct financial transactions.</p> <p pid="d429.0/6">It is of course right that in the UK private companies can choose which customers they do and do not want to do business with, but this is based on the assumption that there is a functional marketplace with healthy competition and that companies are regulated by, and compliant with, UK law and regulations. PayPal is eight times larger than its nearest competitor. It is a Californian company with its European headquarters in Luxembourg. Are we happy to delegate important powers relating to freedom of speech and expression to unaccountable global tech firms?</p> <p pid="d429.0/7">Of course, unlike socialists, <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">conservatives</a> want markets to operate freely, without unnecessary bureaucracy and state control. But as conservatives, unlike liberals or libertarians, we understand that there must be limits to this freedom, because without limits, human beings and organisations will sometimes&#8212;perhaps often&#8212;put their own interests before the best interests of customers and societies. As UK national conservatives, we believe that the proper bodies to set the bounds of free speech and political opinions in the UK are the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Parliament">UK Parliament</a> and UK courts. That is why we must act to legally prevent payment providers from closing accounts of the basis of political beliefs, because if we do not, big global companies will put their own interests&#8212;financial, reputational and political&#8212;before any moral duty to act fairly.</p> <p pid="d429.0/8">The principle of using law to protect free speech is well established. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_Act_2010">Equality Act 2010</a> prohibits discrimination on the grounds of religious or philosophical beliefs, but this protects individuals, not organisations, which is why it cannot be used in this case. The Government are also acting to protect free speech in universities, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education">Higher Education</a> (Freedom of Speech) Bill is today making its passage through the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>.</p> <p pid="d429.0/9">The PayPal saga identified a gap in our free speech protection that must be filled with appropriate legislation, which is why I support new clause 27. I thank the Minister for his engagement on this issue, which I know he takes very seriously&#8212;I was delighted by his opening remarks and commitment to work further on it. I very much hope that, following the evidence that he will gather, he will legislate if it is appropriate to do so. I appreciate his assurances on that.</p> <p pid="d429.0/10">I want to finish with a recent example of what happens when free speech is threatened. I know we do not want to think back to covid, but we had lockdowns and  school closures. In fact, UK schools were closed for longer than those in almost any other country in Europe, and our children missed more face-to-face learning than those in any country other than Italy. The effects on children have been absolutely horrendous and will last a generation. They include lost learning, an increase in eating disorders, self-harm, a loss of socialisation, exposure to <a href="/glossary/?gl=140" title="violence occurring within the family" class="glossary">domestic violence</a>&#8212;I could go on and on. [Interruption.] But I will not, because you are clearly telling me not to, Madam <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>.</p> <p pid="d429.0/11">The Government now say that doing that was a mistake and that there was not sufficient evidence, but one reason that schools were reopened and children were eventually protected was the effective campaigning of the group UsForThem, which&#8212;unlike so many&#8212;stood up for children and their welfare. Its views were unpopular and it was said to be spreading misinformation. Imagine if its bank account had been cancelled two years ago&#8212;where we would be now? We need this protection. I appreciate the Minister&#8217;s commitment and I look forward to working with him further.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d431.0/1">The Bill is important because it presents an opportunity to set out a new, responsible and green vision for the City and financial services, but the Government are squandering that opportunity. That is why I rise to speak in support of amendments that would enshrine climate protections and harness the power of the City to act as a force for people and planet.</p> <p pid="d431.0/2">Let us look at the resources in that sector. Globally, privately invested financial assets are expected to reach $145.4 trillion by 2025&#8212;a 250% growth in less than 20 years. In the UK, pension assets amount to a staggering &#163;2.7 trillion. The financial challenge for decarbonising the economy is significant. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN">The UN</a> has estimated that, globally, we require &#163;90 trillion of infrastructure investment by 2030 alone. In the UK, private investment in carbon-cutting activities needs to grow by an extra &#163;140 billion over the next five years to reach our net zero goals. We should mobilise the huge resources in the finance system to meet the existential challenge of the climate crisis. Instead, financial institutions are adding fuel to the fire, as I mentioned.</p> <p pid="d431.0/3">Britain is a financial giant and is the biggest net exporter of financial services in the world. I support new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 6, tabled by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25344" title="Our page on Tulip Siddiq - 'the Member for Hampstead and Kilburn (Tulip Siddiq)'">Tulip Siddiq</a>, because we need a strategy for how we use that influence to reshape the system in accordance with climate priorities. However, those climate priorities are not the priorities in the Bill. Rather than making it a statutory aim of regulators to ensure compliance with our net zero aims and protect our natural environment, the Bill makes the main  aim of regulation growth and competitiveness in the  sector. In fact, although it is supposed to represent  the Government&#8217;s vision for the future of financial services, it does not mention &#8220;nature&#8221; once. That is why I support new clause 25, which aims not for growth and competitiveness on its own, but for a regulatory regime designed for long-term economic resilience, climate safety and nature restoration.</p> <p pid="d431.0/4">The science is clear: complying with our net zero and Paris agreement obligations means keeping dirty fossil fuels in the ground, so we should encourage divestment  in fossil fuels and put an end to fossil fuel extraction. New clauses 21 and 26 have my full support because they rightly restrict and provide disincentives for that kind of harmful investment. We need not only to incentivise fossil fuel divestment, but to ensure that investors make demands of companies on climate action.</p> <p pid="d431.0/5">I tabled new clauses 8 and 9 because we need to raise the bar on stewardship rules, putting ethical engagement with companies on the climate crisis and much more at the heart of investor activity. I support amendments 23 to 27 because they would reinstate the position limit rules on the kinds of awful things that we have seen relating to speculating on food and betting on hunger. We should stand firmly against that, especially given global heating.</p> <p pid="d431.0/6">I will finish by saying a few words about fraud. My constituents have been frustrated by the lack of accountability in the financial services sector. Some fraud victims are passed from pillar to post in trying to access justice, so I welcome new clause 1, which tasks the Government with creating a national strategy on preventing fraud. Although these will not be pressed to a separate vote, I draw the House&#8217;s attention to my new clause 26 and my <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 20, which make clear the responsibility for reporting fraud and compensating victims. I also express my support for new clause 2, which would ensure that everyone has access to essential in-person banking services.</p> <p pid="d431.0/7">We need financial services that work for people and planet. As the clock ticks on climate action, now is the time to pull every lever and seize every opportunity to decarbonise our economy and society. However, the Bill has presented us with more of the same agenda&#8212;deregulation and lip service to climate goals. As the slogan goes, we need &#8220;system change not climate change.&#8221; I am afraid that without significant changes, the Bill will deliver the opposite.</p>            </div>

It is great to see it coming forward. I echo much of the speech of my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25614" title="Our page on Vicky Ford - 'the Member for Chelmsford (Vicky Ford)'">Vicky Ford</a>, who used the example of insurance-led securities to set out why the Bill matters, and why it matters that we get it right.</p> <p pid="d432.0/4">For the Bill to be meaningful and to deliver what I and the Minister want to achieve, I still think it needs to set out definite KPIs and metrics. Members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Bill_Committee">Public Bill Committee</a> will remember that I tabled several new clauses designed to add certainty, both for  firms and for the regulator. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> agreed to meet me and look in more detail at what could be done, so I did not press my new clauses to a vote.</p> <p pid="d432.0/5">Off the back of my new clauses, the Government have now tabled new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 17, which is welcome inasmuch as it demonstrates their clear recognition of the need to improve the regulatory culture. However, I do not think that it goes far enough in setting out the expectations that Parliament and Government have of the regulator.</p> <p pid="d432.0/6">I am therefore pleased to be a co-signatory of new clauses 12 to 16 and amendments 1 to 6, which my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24787" title="Our page on Richard Fuller - 'the Member for North East Bedfordshire (Richard Fuller)'">Richard Fuller</a> has tabled and which I urge the Minister to consider. The most important of them, as my hon. Friend articulated, is new clause 15, which sets out some sensible metrics for the regulators to include in their reports:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d432.0/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;steps taken to simplify regulatory rulebooks and frameworks&#8230;the number of new market entrants to the UK&#8230;comparative analysis of the number of new authorisations in the UK and other international jurisdictions&#8230;comparative analysis of product and service innovations introduced in the UK and other international jurisdictions&#8221;.</p> <p pid="d432.0/8">I ask the Minister to consider adopting the metrics in new clause 15 to address the gaps in the Bill that are worrying me. I know that my worries are shared by the industry itself: it has never been frightened of regulation, but that regulation needs to be right if we are to get the full aims of the Bill across the line.</p> <p pid="d432.0/9">If the Minister is unable to give such a commitment in winding up today, will he commit instead to providing some kind of statutory guidance to address concerns about new clause 17, such as how the Government will decide the criteria for requesting a report and whether they will seek input from the industry or Parliament? Will he ensure that the regulators provide a comparative analysis of performance against key competitors, including for product and service innovations? What do the Government consider &#8220;reasonably necessary&#8221; as a trigger for a report? How can we ensure that the regulators provide info of sufficient quality to be meaningful? Finally, do the Government consider the impact on regulators&#8217; reputation of a poor report on its regulatory performance to constitute an adverse effect?</p> <p pid="d432.0/10">I appreciate that I have thrown quite a lot at the Minister with not long to go in the debate, but I would appreciate it if he addressed some of my questions or wrote to me after the debate. Just by adopting new clause 15, he could take away some of the uncertainty. I welcome and appreciate the Bill&#8212;there is much in it that we can welcome&#8212;and I thank the Minister for his time.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d433.0/1">This Bill should be a once-in-a-generation opportunity to ensure a rapid, stable, co-ordinated and just transition to a low-carbon economy, to advance financial inclusion and to protect consumers, investors, banks, asset managers and other financial institutions against the catastrophic financial risks associated with climate and nature breakdown. Sadly, I believe that it fails to deliver on all those counts, and many others too.</p> <p pid="d433.0/2">I have signed a number of new clauses with the aim of improving the Bill, on matters such as free access to cash and better regulation of buy now, pay later credit. I also strongly support the new clauses tabled by <a href="/mp/?p=25908" title="Our page on Olivia Blake - 'the hon.  Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Olivia Blake)'">Olivia Blake</a>. However, I want to use my speaking time to focus on three new clauses in my name.</p> <p pid="d433.0/3">New <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 25 goes to the heart of what the Bill is about. It seeks to reposition the objectives of the regulator so that they are consistent with the future that we are facing. It would change the strategic objective so that it is no longer simply about ensuring that the relevant markets function well, but about ensuring that they deliver long-term economic resilience and prosperity. It would also create two new operational objectives. The first is a climate objective to facilitate the meeting of targets set out in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change_Act_2008">Climate Change Act 2008</a> and the 1.5&#176;C temperature rise limit of the Paris agreement. The second is a nature objective, to facilitate alignment with the Government&#8217;s commitment to halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030.</p> <p pid="d433.0/4">Those changes matter on a great many levels. Most obviously, as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Secretary-General">United Nations Secretary-General</a> warned just last month:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d433.0/5" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;We are in the fight of our lives and we are losing&#8230;And our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible.</p> <p class="indent" pid="d433.0/6" pwmotiontext="yes">We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d433.0/7">We therefore need to deploy every tool at our disposal to the task of creating an economy that reflects this new reality. There is no greater moral imperative, or indeed any greater financial imperative.</p> <p pid="d433.0/8"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bank_of_England">The Bank of England</a>&#8217;s first climate stress test was published in May. It sought to understand how climate change would affect banks&#8217; business models, and whether they held enough capital to cover climate-related risks. The results were clear: banks need to take climate action immediately, or face a hit to annual profits of up to 15%. If the net zero transition is delayed by a decade and global temperatures reach 1.8&#176;, by 2050 banks will face losses of &#163;225 billion. However, the banks are not alone in being exposed to huge climate risks. Investors, consumers, anyone with a pension, asset managers, savers, mortgage holders and other financial institutions are all threatened.</p> <p pid="d433.0/9">The Bill should provide an opportunity to meet those challenges and lay the foundations for a secure and stable future-facing economy, but I believe that without my new clauses, it simply does not do that. Leading financial institutions agree, including Aviva Investors, Phoenix, Hargreaves Lansdown and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BUPA">BUPA</a> Insurance. They raised concerns with the Bill Committee, saying that</p> <p class="indent" pid="d433.0/10" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;the proposed regulatory principle will not provide a sufficiently strong legal basis for regulators to promote a thriving net zero financial sector. It certainly won&#8217;t encourage the regulators to ensure that the UK becomes the world&#8217;s leading green financial centre.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d433.0/11">Moreover, as it stands, nothing in the Bill acknowledges the crucial role of nature, although the Economic Secretary himself recognised in Committee that we could not achieve our climate goals without recognising and acknowledging that vital role.</p> <p pid="d433.0/12">New clause 25 would go further and remove the proposed competitiveness and growth operational objective for the FCA. The financial impacts of pursuing a climate-busting competitiveness and &#8220;growth at all costs&#8221; approach over climate action is clear. For example, it is estimated that the UK will lose 10% of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a> by 2050 if  we do not tackle climate change, and that Europe will see a 30% rise in defaults on corporate loans to the most exposed companies. No wonder the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_Committee">Treasury Committee</a> advised against a primary focus on competitiveness, warning that it could lead to weakening standards and a reduction in the UK&#8217;s financial resilience, and could undermine the reputation of the UK&#8217;s finance sector.</p> <p pid="d433.0/13">It is worth recalling that Parliament itself deliberately removed competitiveness from the mandate of the financial regulator just a decade ago, learning the lessons from the regulatory failure leading up to the global financial crisis of 2007-08, which saw millions lose their savings, homes, businesses and jobs. With so much at stake, I can think of no good reason why the Government is making such a reckless move, and no good reason why it could not instead support a focus on the creation of a wellbeing economy designed to foster long-term economic resilience and prosperity.</p> <p pid="d433.0/14">I have also tabled new clause 21, which mandates the introduction of a one-for-one capital requirement for the financing of new fossil fuels. In other words, for each pound that finances fossil fuels, financial institutions should have a pound of their own funds held liable for potential losses. It is a principle that is used elsewhere. In June 2021, for example, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_Committee_on_Banking_Supervision">Basel Committee on Banking Supervision</a>&#8212;the global standard setter for the regulation of banks&#8212;recommended its application to some cryptocurrencies&#8217; exposures. At present, however, the Government are not seizing these opportunities.</p> <p pid="d433.0/15">Even with no fossil fuel expansion, by 2025 global emissions from existing projects will be 22% too high to stay below 1.5&#176; and 66% too high by 2030&#8212;all while the scientific reality makes it clear that fossil fuels assets are uneconomic and financially uncompetitive in a 1.5&#176; or 2&#176; world. Fossil fuel financing increasingly threatens economic stability. It increases the physical risks of climate change, thereby leaving the financial system exposed to significant losses from balance sheets and from environmental damage to the wider economy. That is why these amendments are so important and that is why we should get fossil fuels out of our financial sector now.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d435.0/1">I am going to speak briefly to new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 7 on access to cash, and to new clause 27 on access to banking services. I very much support the Bill and completely commend what the Government are trying to do. It is a source of great pride that they are bringing financial regulation home as one of the great benefits of Brexit. I applaud what they are doing and appreciate all the engagement that Ministers have had with colleagues on the new clauses that I am speaking to.</p> <p pid="d435.0/2">I understand that there is an intention not to push new clause 27 to a vote, and I intend to abstain on new clause 7 if there is a <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">Division</a> on it, because I look forward to the policy statement that the Government have promised. I support the principle behind both the new clauses. As Members have mentioned, we seem to be moving inevitably towards a cashless society, and we can all see the personal convenience of that. Like the royal family, I personally do not carry cash around. It is only embarrassing when I am in church and the platter  comes around. That is pretty much the only occasion when I feel the need for it, but that is not the case for everyone.</p> <p pid="d435.0/3">For anyone using a digital payments system, the operator of the platform has potentially immense control over their life, in principle and in practice. That is why what <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal">PayPal</a> did to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Speech_Union">Free Speech Union</a> and others a few months ago is so important. Yes, we can acknowledge that that event was an outlier. It was a rare and slightly inexplicable event and, yes, it was quickly corrected in some of the cases of the accounts that were closed, but the fact is that it happened. It was a straw in the wind, and the fact that individuals and organisations with heterodox political opinions found themselves unable to operate economically because of the decision of a private company acting entirely on its own initiative, possibly under pressure from external campaigns, is a troubling development. So it is vital that we send the strongest regulatory, and also cultural and political, signal to these private payment platforms that the opinions of their customers are none of their business.</p> <p pid="d435.0/4">Nor are private opinions any business of the state, and this is why the question of access to cash is about more than the important issue of protecting the vulnerable, although I agree with the points that have been made on that. It is also about liberty. Just now, behind the scenes, the Government and the Bank of England are developing plans for their own central bank digital currency. Again, we can see the practical appeal, but the threat is that the Government will have oversight of the economic activity of private citizens, which is something that no Government of this country have ever had in our history. It is therefore vital that the debate on a central bank digital currency has liberty front and centre. We can all say warm words about the importance of safeguards and freedoms, but the fact is that if the emergency is bad enough and the powers are available, those powers could well be used.</p> <p pid="d435.0/5">We saw this happening around the world, and to some degree in our own country, during the covid crisis. We have only to look at what the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Government">Canadian Government</a> did to block access to the bank accounts of truckers protesting against the covid policy there to see what can be done in a modern liberal western country. It would be a shame if we took back control of financial regulation from the EU only to empower private payment platforms, or indeed our own central bank, in that way. Cash services and banking services are part of the infrastructure of our communities. They are also part of the infrastructure of liberty.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d436.0/1">I rise to speak in support of new clauses 34 and 35. Both are tabled in my name and deal with the rules and duties of pension schemes and investments.</p> <p pid="d436.0/2">This Bill could be a unique opportunity to develop the green economy we need by providing the finance required to support our net zero transition. Unfortunately, this Government might again miss the boat. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bank_of_England">The Bank of England</a> recently warned that UK banks and insurers will end up shouldering nearly &#163;340 billion-worth of climate-related losses by 2050. Such losses will be unrecoverable, so it is cheaper to save the planet than to destroy it.</p> <p pid="d436.0/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Bank">The World Bank</a> suggests that up to 216 million people could be forced to move within their countries by 2050, but immediate climate action could reduce that  by up to 80%. Limiting global warming to 1.5&#176;C instead of 2&#176;C could result in around 42 million fewer people being exposed to extreme heatwaves. We have pensions to provide adequate quality of life after retirement. How absurd it would be if the climate catastrophe meant that there was little quality of life left.</p> <p pid="d436.0/4">My amendments would remove a significant barrier to private investment contributing to a sustainable net zero future. The amendments would broaden the investment duties of pension schemes to require that investment decisions are made in the best interests of beneficiaries. They would clarify what is meant by &#8220;best interests&#8221; to encompass the long-term risks and impacts of investment decisions, including social and environmental factors. In doing so, the amendments would retain the core principle of fiduciary duty while amending the law to enable schemes to think more holistically about their investment decisions.</p> <p pid="d436.0/5">A recent paper published in Nature estimates that the UK&#8217;s financial sector is exposed to $98 billion-worth of losses from stranded oil and gas assets. Most of those losses would be borne by individual people through their pensions, investments and savings. The law must empower schemes to avert these losses and to ensure savers retire into a world they wish to live in. My amendments would ensure that trustees still have a duty to ensure adequate financial returns for retirees while being released from pressures to qualify and justify every investment decision on its short-term returns. That will enable them to focus on the long-term financial, social and environmental prosperity that is genuinely in the best interests of savers.</p> <p pid="d436.0/6">There is still confusion about fiduciary duties and environmental, social and governance factors. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Commission">Law Commission</a> has set out a two-part test for trustees aimed at helping them to consider the impact of investments on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESG">ESG</a>, but it does not go far enough in empowering trustees to embed these considerations in investment plans. The Government always defend their net zero strategy by placing responsibility on the markets, yet investors and the markets prioritise short-term returns at the expense of social and environmental risks and the long-term health of planet and people.</p> <p pid="d436.0/7">We can no longer afford to view climate investment as a future consideration. We need investors to put their money where their mouth is now. It is morally wrong to make climate action a task for future generations. The worst impacts of climate change stretch well beyond typical election cycles. Rather than prioritising short-term competitiveness, the Bill must help us to meet our long-term net zero commitments. The law must support investors to make more prudent choices to ensure a liveable future for all of us. It is difficult to put an exact number on the financial risk of climate inaction, but we know the impact will be catastrophic if we continue to invest in fossil fuels. Climate change is the biggest threat to our future. It is time that the Government put our net zero targets at the heart of every sector.</p>            </div>

Judi Billing had served as a district councillor since 1980 and was an excellent servant, and I wanted to make that point on the Floor of the House.</p> <p pid="d438.0/2">I rise in particular to support new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 17. As we all know, this is really an enabling Bill and a lot of its meat will come in regulations that will be passed in the coming weeks and months. In the short time available to me, I think it is important to stand up for the regulators, because someone has to in this debate. I want to stand up for them not because I have agreed with every decision of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudential_Regulation_Authority">Prudential Regulation Authority</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Conduct_Authority">Financial Conduct Authority</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Systems_Regulator">Payment Systems Regulator</a> or anyone else, but because a lot of the right criticisms that I and many other colleagues have had of the regulators arise more as a function of the system in which they operate than as a result of the decisions made by those individual regulators or institutions.</p> <p pid="d438.0/3">There is a key point about accountability, which many colleagues on both sides of the House have already raised: there needs to be strengthened accountability to this House. I have made the point many times before, but I urge those on the Treasury Bench, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Majesty">His Majesty</a>&#8217;s Treasury and Parliament to look at this more deeply. Unless we can strengthen the accountability to this House and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a> of the regulators directly, we will continue to run up against criticisms that they are not taking colleagues&#8217; considerations into account.</p> <p pid="d438.0/4">There is also a need for more effective accountability to the Government. What I mean by that is that the Government have clearly set out, in a series of actions, policy statements, speeches and strategies over the past few months, and in numerous reviews, what their intentions are. Those have been supported when it has come to votes on the Floor of this House, but sometimes there is a gap between the intention of the Government and what ends up coming through, even when regulations are passed to that end. It is important that the regulators and the Government work together to find a system whereby the Government can ensure that their strategic aims are being supported on an ongoing basis by the regulators. This is not just about saying what the policy is, passing regulations and allowing the regulators to get on with it. However well they try to do that, a lot will get missed, so we need to think about that.</p> <p pid="d438.0/5">We need to rethink the entirety of our regulatory structure, particularly as to how it governs financial services. We have very powerful regulators that have taken on a huge amount of power from the European Union, and they are doing their best. There are some overlaps between them and there are times when certain aims of one conflict with the aims of the other, even in relation to the competitiveness objective that has come up many times in the passage of this Bill. We end up with the situation where the regulators have to balance off competitiveness and other secondary objectives, and indeed the primary objectives. We have to work out how we are going to put together a framework that enables better accountability to this House, and better accountability to the political aims that have been passed by this House and to the aims of the Government, so that we get a regulatory system that drives a better, more competitive, safer financial services system.</p> <p pid="d438.0/6">To that end I have set up the Regulatory Reform Group, of which some Members of this House and others outside are a part. I intend to work with the Government on this issue, because unless we get it right, all the best intentions that all colleagues have in different areas will find it hard to be effected because of the structural difficulties that are inherent. So I would like to stick up for the regulators but say that they need to be able to operate in a more effective system.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d439.0/1">I am delighted to be able to speak in support of the Government this evening, because this Bill is of great importance to my constituents, many of whom work in our financial sector, and also to the capital city, of which my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> is a part.</p> <p pid="d439.0/2">Since I contributed to the earlier stages of the Bill, I have had the opportunity to hear from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Finance">UK Finance</a>, Zurich, Lloyds, the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Property Institute and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Group">Just Group</a> and many others, and they have reflected back to me the broad and strong support of the financial sector, which is the jewel in our industrial crown, for the measures that the Bill envisages. The key thing from the perspective of my constituents is that the Bill seeks to right-size regulation in the United Kingdom to reflect the fact that the risks and the challenges that the sector faces change over time. Just as we need to manage the risk from competitors, through the measures on competitiveness, we also need to ensure that we have a financial sector that enables all of our citizens to access the broadest possible range of financial services.</p> <p pid="d439.0/3">I have listened carefully to the points made about financial inclusion, for example, which are very important in the context of our financial sector. We need to ensure&#8212;and I think this Bill does&#8212;an appropriate balance between products that are pricing in a degree of risk, but that enable people to build their creditworthiness and their participation in the benefits that the financial sector can bring in their lives, with a recognition that there are risks to constituents, in particular from the development of new products, which the Bill seeks to address through better regulation in areas such as crypto investments.</p> <p pid="d439.0/4">Briefly, on new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 27, although I have sympathy with the points that have been made by a number of Members, this strikes me as an example of where there  is a significant risk of unintended consequences. As Ministers have heard, there is a need for due process for those who feel that they have been wronged by the decisions of a provider to be able to seek a remedy for that, but we do not want to get into the kind of situation that we have seen in the past, where an obligation to provide a universal service sees significant numbers of providers&#8212;useful providers&#8212;exiting the market because they are not prepared to accept the risks that come with that. My view is that the Government are finding about the right balance.</p> <p pid="d439.0/5">Let me turn now to the issues around the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Conduct_Authority">Financial Conduct Authority</a> and the regulators. There will be a new chair of the FCA from <phrase class="date" code="">21 February</phrase> next year. I wish to bring to the attention of the House and of Ministers that the strong view of my constituents and many in the sector is that we need to see a greater degree of rigour in the enforcement action that the FCA in particular is able to take. It is a matter not of new powers, but of making sure that they are operating effectively.</p> <p pid="d439.0/6">In respect of access to cash, I would like to thank Ministers. Certainly, in my constituency, we have seen really significant efforts by financial institutions to ensure that every high street has at least one free-to-use cashpoint, and, thus far, the feedback from business owners is very good.</p> <p pid="d439.0/7">In conclusion, I strongly support the Government&#8217;s position. I am not afraid to say if I think things are going wrong, but, in this case, it is clear to me that the Bill is beneficial to my constituents as business owners, as employees in the sector, and as consumers of the sector&#8217;s product, and it is beneficial to the taxpayers of the United Kingdom.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d440.0/1">I rise in support of new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 17. The Bill is central to the Government&#8217;s commitment to long-term economic sustainability while also ensuring that our banking system is fair and provides reasonable protections for the vulnerable, including continued access to cash. Now that we are outside the EU, it is vital that we take this opportunity to build an even more agile and an even more muscular internationally facing financial centre. To do that, we need regulation that is designed to unlock growth, that will attract international investment into the UK, and that will also attract the best talent into our financial services sector, while not forgetting our equally important duty to level up financial services across the UK, including continued access to cash, to which I wish to turn straight away.</p> <p pid="d440.0/2">I welcome the wording of the Bill about providing &#8220;reasonable&#8221; access to cash. I appreciate that the Government have a balancing act to perform, given a fast-moving sector, changing consumer patterns and the need to provide protections. It is a balance that the Government have provided with this &#8220;reasonable&#8221; access to cash.</p> <p pid="d440.0/3">I wish to place on record that in picturesque <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leigh-on-Sea">Leigh-on-Sea</a>, a part of wonderful <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southend_West">Southend West</a>, we have lost every single one of our high street banks over the past four years. In a <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> such as Southend West, where over one fifth of the population are over 65 and more than 6% are over 80&#8212;significantly more than the national average&#8212;local banking services are vital. Senior citizens in Southend West do not want to bank online, they do not want to bank on an app, and they should  not have to. That is why I am working with fantastic organisations such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINK">LINK</a> and OneBanx to set up a local banking hub.</p> <p pid="d440.0/4">However, access to cash is not the only reason elderly people need to visit a branch. A point made very powerfully today by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24785" title="Our page on Harriett Baldwin - 'the Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin)'">Harriett Baldwin</a> and touched on by my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25614" title="Our page on Vicky Ford - 'the Member for Chelmsford (Vicky Ford)'">Vicky Ford</a> and my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10119" title="Our page on Geoffrey Clifton-Brown - 'the Member for The Cotswolds (Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown)'">Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown</a> is the need for personal financial advice. For many people, visiting their branch is the only way to make sure they are getting the best possible interest rates on their savings.</p> <p pid="d440.0/5">There is a piece of work to be done there, because I believe that every saver should have the opportunity to get the best possible rate of return on their money. Reasonable access to financial advice is essential&#8212;that is what levelling up financial services means. When interest rates move, banks must pass those changes on swiftly to borrowers and savers alike.</p> <p pid="d440.0/6">Sadly, that is not always the case. On <phrase class="date" code="">29 November</phrase>, the Bank of England published a report highlighting that UK savers are receiving on average 0.52% on their interest-bearing sight deposits, an increase of only 0.4% this year. Yet we know that during that time the UK banking base rate has risen by a massive 2.9% to its current level of 3%. According to the Bank of England, &#163;998 billion&#8212;almost &#163;1 trillion&#8212;of hard-working taxpayers&#8217; savings is in low-earning savings accounts, earning an average of 0.52%.</p> <p pid="d440.0/7">Many of those savers are elderly and financially unsophisticated and they do not have access to sophisticated financial advice. That is why it is so important that we provide access to that advice, so I welcome the comments by my hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> that he is going to take this point away. To put the Bank of England figures into perspective, they equate to UK savers losing &#163;15 billion or more a year. In Southend West, that equates to &#163;19 million a year or &#163;270 per person.</p> <p pid="d440.0/8">I conclude by reminding the Minister&#8212;not that he needs any reminding&#8212;that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Conduct_Authority">Financial Conduct Authority</a>&#8217;s first objective is to promote effective competition in the interest of consumers, and that it is specifically charged with identifying where firms may exploit the difficulties that customers face in making choices. I welcome this Bill and look forward to seeing the FCA step up to its greater responsibilities. Everybody who lives in Southend West deserves a fair rate of return on their hard-earned savings and to have fair access to banking facilities. I urge the FCA and the Treasury to use their groundbreaking new powers to make sure that happens.</p>            </div>

I love this exercise in democracy where different MPs with different interests come forward with their amendments; I have actually worked with many of them in my life and have direct experience with them.</p> <p pid="d441.0/2">I absolutely support new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 27 on freedom of expression, which my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25897" title="Our page on Miriam Cates - 'the Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Miriam Cates)'">Miriam Cates</a> mentioned.  UsforThem, which was founded by someone in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, has done some great work campaigning on schools, but was utterly traumatised by the sudden loss of access to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal">PayPal</a>, and we need due process around that.</p> <p pid="d441.0/3">On new clause 28 relating to buy now, pay later, which <a href="/mp/?p=24949" title="Our page on Stella Creasy - 'the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Stella Creasy)'">Stella Creasy</a> mentioned, I was involved with the regulation of payday loans, something else that fell between the gaps and needed to be sorted&#8212;it was outrageous. I am convinced by her arguments that buy now, pay later is another gap that is not addressed. I am sure the FCA has powers to deal with that already, but I hear her frustration that the Government keep saying that they will deal with it but have not done so, so I urge the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> to put that on his list of things to take up and deal with.</p> <p pid="d441.0/4">The same applies to new clause 11, which the Chair of the Treasury Committee, my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24785" title="Our page on Harriett Baldwin - 'the Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin)'">Harriett Baldwin</a>, talked about convincingly. It is an absolute scandal that huge swathes of the population cannot get access to financial advice and are impoverished as a result because of a failure of regulation, or excessive regulation&#8212;we can blame the EU. I was on an FCA taskforce some time ago to try to sort out this problem&#8212;I was trying to remember where it went, but it clearly ran into the sand. We absolutely need to deal with this urgently. Again, I take reassurance from the Minister&#8217;s comments that he will deal with it as a matter of urgency. I will hold him to that, as, I am sure, will the Chair of the Treasury Committee.</p> <p pid="d441.0/5">Access to in-person banking is really important. In fact, I negotiated the deal with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=124" title="http://www.postoffice.co.uk/" class="glossary">Post Office</a> on behalf of the banks to open up post offices to offering banking services. There are actually more post office branches than all the bank branches in the country combined. A lot of people complained to me about the lack of access to certain banking facilities, and I would always point out that they can do those things at their local post office, which they did not know&#8212;we need to raise the profile of that.</p> <p pid="d441.0/6"><a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members need to define clearly what they mean by &#8220;in-person banking&#8221;. There are lots of different things. Do they mean going to ask for a mortgage or just paying a bill, for example? We do lots of different things in different places. The deal with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office">Post Office</a> is being renegotiated, and I think the main thing there will be to ensure that whatever services we want are put into the negotiations.</p> <p pid="d441.0/7">Finally, I want to talk about access to free cash. I said in an <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> earlier that I massively support access to cash. Cash use is dwindling&#8212;clearly, more people are using cards and other payment types&#8212;but we need to make sure that people who do not want to use other means have access to cash and, indeed, access to free cash. I should say&#8212;I do not think anyone has remarked on it&#8212;that paid ATMs have been dying a death over the last 15 years. There is about half the number now than there was 15 years ago. People pay for only 5% of ATM withdrawals&#8212;I never do because I find it offensive to pay to take out my own money. I fully support the sentiment.</p> <p pid="d441.0/8">However, on new clause 7, there is already a power in the Bill for the FCA to ensure access to cash, and that could include pricing so that the FCA can ensure access to free cash. I have two things to say about the drafting of the new clause. First, it does not stipulate whether it  applies to personal or business customers. Traditionally and historically, a lot of business customers have paid for cash-handling services. Is the new clause saying that they should no longer pay for them? It is not quite clear. If they are no longer required to pay, are non-cash businesses cross-subsidising them? Secondly, the new clause does not stipulate whether it applies just to sterling cash and not to foreign exchange. If I was a bureau de change dealer, I would be rather worried about having to offer my services for free.</p> <p pid="d441.0/9">With those comments, I basically urge the Minister to stand by the various commitments he has made this afternoon. I support the Bill.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d443.0/1">I very much welcome the Bill and congratulate my hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> on listening to and engaging with the points raised by many of us on the Back Benches.</p> <p pid="d443.0/2">I support new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 11 in particular&#8212;I was heartened to hear what the Minister had to say about it&#8212;but may I perhaps reinforce a very simple message about the urgency required on financial advice? We in this country have been blessed with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London">City of London</a> and many other world-leading financial institutions around the UK. I think I can say with some confidence that London is the financial capital of Europe, if not the world. The world comes here to do business on a variety of fronts. Yet we have very little good access to advice. In fact, if anything, we have a widening advice gap.</p> <p pid="d443.0/3">On the one hand, we have wealth managers raising their minimums, banks withdrawing from the high street and withdrawing fully from providing investment advice; we also have the retail distribution review, which I supported because it was ending the backhand commission for unit trusts&#8212;that was bad for the consumer&#8212;but it has resulted in independent financial advisers having to charge more and few of them being used. On the other hand, with all that advice in retreat, we have the Government and all parties saying that we must take greater control of our finances, there are greater pension freedoms and there is a great demand for good advice.</p> <p pid="d443.0/4">A lot of people of modest means who have no access to good advice fall into that void. They may be tempted, for example, to leave cash in the bank earning a pitiful rate of interest while inflation erodes its value. This is where the law of unintended consequences comes in, because all that regulation that had to be met before one could offer full-blown advice is fine when we are talking about full-blown advice, but there is a middle ground that needs to be covered. I offer a basic statistic that might interest or help those willing to take a particularly long-term view to their financial planning: instead of leaving money in cash, if they invest in equities over the long term&#8212;25 years, for example&#8212;they stand a very small chance of losing money. There will be volatility, but because they are investing, hopefully, in growing businesses, they will do well, and 97 times out of 100, that will beat cash deposits. That is the sort of advice that banks, building societies and many others could give, without getting too complex about financial planning. It would offer consumers a choice, rather than just letting their cash sit in banks and get eroded. Will the Minister therefore give impetus to the assurance he has given on new clause 11 and really get the Treasury  looking at this issue, because there is a halfway house, and we must not stop regulation being the enemy of the good? That is what we are asking for.</p> <p pid="d443.0/5">I will add one other thing quickly in the minute I have left. Please make sure that our regulators listen to the various trade bodies when it comes to regulation, because we are inheriting&#8212;I very much welcome this Bill&#8212;a lot of powers from the EU. We are in control of our own destiny, but I take issue with the FCA on a number of points. One of them is that when it comes to investment trusts, there are such things as key information documents. They are an invention of the EU and are misleading about risk and putting consumers at risk of losing money&#8212;it is as simple as that. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Investment_Companies">Association of Investment Companies</a> has said that. By the way, it has also said, in relation to those key information documents, &#8220;burn before reading&#8221;. Despite that, there has been no meaningful action from the FCA on that issue, and that is wrong. I ask the Minister to make sure that our regulators do not rest on their laurels, realise the greater freedoms they have got and rise to the occasion.</p>            </div>

I sense a tone of disappointment in <a href="/mp/?p=25344" title="Our page on Tulip Siddiq - 'the hon. Member for Hampstead and Kilburn (Tulip Siddiq)'">Tulip Siddiq</a>, my <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>. I will try to endeavour not to disappoint her in return for her party&#8217;s support for this important and landmark Bill. I spoke at length in my opening remarks. I hope I was generous in taking interventions, and perhaps colleagues will indulge me if I try to get through this as quickly as possible.</p> <p pid="d444.0/2">We heard from my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25614" title="Our page on Vicky Ford - 'the Member for Chelmsford (Vicky Ford)'">Vicky Ford</a>, my predecessor, who contributed so much to this Bill. We also heard from my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24787" title="Our page on Richard Fuller - 'the Member for North East Bedfordshire (Richard Fuller)'">Richard Fuller</a> and from my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25290" title="Our page on Craig Tracey - 'the Member for North Warwickshire (Craig Tracey)'">Craig Tracey</a>, who served on the Bill Committee. They all spoke to a greater or lesser degree in support of new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 17 and about how we can make that better and better hold the regulators to account.</p> <p pid="d444.0/3">We heard about the specific metrics suggested in new clauses 12, 13, 14 and 15&#8212;my hon. and right hon. Friends are very productive. I can say that I will consider things very carefully. In those amendments, they gave specific examples of how we could potentially deploy the powers in new clause 17, and I undertake to consider carefully whether those are the right way forward. We heard from my right hon. Friend the Member for Chelmsford about that sense of urgency, and we got that again in new clause 11. Again, it is potentially a good way forward that I would like to consider.</p> <p pid="d444.0/4">We all understand that it comes down to financial inclusion, for which <a href="/mp/?p=25646" title="Our page on Emma Hardy - 'the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Emma Hardy)'">Emma Hardy</a> rightly never fails to agitate. If, however, the consequences of our financial regulation exclude, as I think we heard, 92% of people from getting basic guidance on the sorts of products that are right for them, that is a problem for inclusion and for the industry. It is something that I was asked to take away with due urgency, and I commit that once we have the Bill on the statute book that is absolutely what I will do. Technology can be our friend there as well. We heard that from my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24785" title="Our page on Harriett Baldwin - 'the Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin)'">Harriett Baldwin</a>, the Chair of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_Committee">Treasury Committee</a>.</p> <p pid="d444.0/5">Hon. Members on both sides of the House are wrestling with what to give to the financial regulators, in a sector that touches the lives of so many individuals and so many facets of human behaviour, and how to manage the process of repatriating those rules from the unaccountable <a href="/glossary/?gl=234" title="The European Commission is the politically independent institution that..." class="glossary">European Commission</a>, which my friend, <a href="/mp/?p=25273" title="Our page on Peter Grant - 'the hon. Member for Glenrothes (Peter Grant)'">Peter Grant</a>, the spokesman for the SNP, is so anxious that we do not diverge or derogate from, so as to ease our passage immediately back into that unaccountable world.</p> <p pid="d444.0/6">We heard contributions from my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10119" title="Our page on Geoffrey Clifton-Brown - 'the Member for The Cotswolds (Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown)'">Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown</a> and <a href="/mp/?p=24728" title="Our page on Nick Smith - 'the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Nick Smith)'">Nick Smith</a> on the work, and frankly the challenges, that hon. Members have faced in the case of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Steel">British Steel</a> pension fund, trying to get redress and to speak up for their constituents in the face of regulators that&#8212;whether this was real or imagined&#8212;they certainly felt were unaccountable to <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>. They had to use the mechanisms of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Accounts_Committee">Public Accounts Committee</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Audit_Office">National Audit Office</a>. I have taken away how we can improve the parliamentary scrutiny in the way that both hon. Members sought. We heard about that big issue again from <a href="/mp/?p=25596" title="Our page on Sarah Olney - 'the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Sarah Olney)'">Sarah Olney</a>. It would be cheap to suggest that going back into the EU would remove the parliamentary accountability that she seeks, but nevertheless we are all pushing, in many ways, at the same thing.</p> <p pid="d444.0/7">We rightly spent a lot of time talking about access to cash. We heard significant contributions from <a href="/mp/?p=10381" title="Our page on Siobhain McDonagh - 'the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh)'">Siobhain McDonagh</a>. I still look forward to visiting her new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINK">LINK</a> ATM cash machine as part of the industry-led initiative. I am now as keen to see it as she and her constituents no doubt are&#8212;I hope that can be an early 2023 commitment. My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=11970" title="Our page on David Mundell - 'the Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell)'">David Mundell</a> also talked with great passion, and his knowledge from campaigning on the issue. He spoke about 8 million households. It is absolutely the position of the Government that this is a problem, and there is a firm expectation on the industry to help us address it.</p> <p pid="d444.0/8">We must not underestimate the significance of the legislative action that we are taking in the Bill, putting an access to cash obligation on the regulators for the first time. I have made very clear my expectation of what that will look like, as well as the consequences if the regulators, together with the industry voluntary sector, do not solve the issue for us. The Government will achieve that by means of the statement that will set out our position on matters such as cost and location.</p> <p pid="d444.0/9">Although I understand the desire behind new clause 7, and its superficial attractiveness to many in this House, we need to be wary of unintended consequences. It is not as simple as just inserting the word &#8220;free&#8221;. There are a number of initiatives in this space already, and I do not want them to be prejudiced by artificially rushing to statute. The Government will therefore not support new clause 7, but we will continue to work to ensure that we protect our constituents on this issue.</p> <p pid="d444.0/10">We are protecting our planet as well. My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10920" title="Our page on Chris Grayling - 'the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)'">Chris Grayling</a> talked, on this day of the biodiversity summit in Montreal, about the deforestation crisis and the need for financial providers to do due diligence on where their money is going. That is of course absolutely right. It is what we  expect from good stewardship. He was kind enough also to talk about some of the challenges, in that financial providers do not always know directly or indirectly where their capital ends up. I will continue to work with him.</p> <p pid="d444.0/11">The Government have supported the taskforce on nature-related financial disclosures. We are a big backer of that taskforce, which we have given &#163;3 million of funding, and its work continues in the first half of 2023. In parallel with that, we will consider bringing those standards into the disclosure framework as they develop; I hope to continue to work with my right hon. Friend on that.</p> <p pid="d444.0/12">I was clear in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=30" title="The Opening Speech is the first speech in a debate. The MP who has moved,..." class="glossary">opening speech</a> about the importance of freedom of speech and expression. We heard passionate contributions from my hon. Friends the Members for Hastings and Rye (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally-Ann_Hart">Sally-Ann Hart</a>), who has done so much work on the issue, and for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penistone_and_Stocksbridge">Penistone and Stocksbridge</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Cates">Miriam Cates</a>), who first brought the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Speech_Union">Free Speech Union</a> and the issue to my attention. I am disturbed to learn of other cases. As I said, we commit to consult on that, to look at whether there is a more systemic problem and to consider what the right legislative solutions could be.</p> <p pid="d444.0/13">The hon. Member for Hampstead and Kilburn talked about the climate and our position on green and sustainable finance&#8212;I do not fully accept what she said about us not being a leader. That is our objective and I will do everything I can to continue what I regard as London&#8217;s lead on that. We have exchanged various documents about it and she does not quite agree with my interpretation, but we are pushing in exactly the same direction.</p> <p pid="d444.0/14">We will introduce new sustainability disclosure requirements, on which the FCA is consulting. We are introducing transition planning requirements to move to the clean, green future that we all seek as we move into the clean, low-carbon economy. Last September we launched the green financing programme with a record-breaking debut sovereign green bond, and I hope the Opposition support that initiative. Subsequently, that programme has raised &#163;22 billion of green finance to finance the green transition. London is a leading hub, with issuances totalling more than &#163;10 billion from worldwide issuers, including Chile, Egypt, Mexico, Hong Kong and Fiji.</p> <p pid="d444.0/15">We have heard a lot about fraud, on which the hon. Lady has tabled an <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>. I reassure hon. Members that the Government take that important issue extremely seriously. We are dedicated to protecting the public from that devastating and sadly growing crime. Tackling fraud requires a unified and co-ordinated approach across Government, law enforcement and the private sector to better protect the public and businesses from fraud. We want to reduce the impact of fraud as well as its prevalence, and increase the disruption and prosecution of fraudsters. We will put the right resources into frontline policing to ensure that they can do that.</p>            </div>
