I very much welcome this opportunity to discuss the issues surrounding the future development of Heathrow airport. It is of course not the first debate on this subject in the House, but it is the first time that I have had the opportunity of taking part as <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Transport. I am looking forward to hearing the views of right hon. and hon. Members. I know that many here today have particular points that they wish to make about Heathrow; indeed, some have previously asked to meet me personally. However, with the consultation on Heathrow now closed, it would have been extremely difficult for me to meet particular individuals or interested parties without invoking criticism that they were being given undue influence. That is why I asked for this debate to take place. The great benefit of today's proceedings is that they are on the record and give all Members an equal opportunity to have their say before any final decisions are taken.</p> <p pid="c.641.2/4">As my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1433" title="Our page on Ruth Kelly - 'the Member for Bolton, West (Ruth Kelly)'">Ruth Kelly</a> informed the House in her written ministerial statement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-08">8 July</phrase>, I hope to announce my decision on whether, and if so how, additional capacity might be added at Heathrow before the end of the year. It is right that we bring this period of uncertainty to an end as soon as practically possible for the benefit of the people directly affected and for the country as a whole. However, it is also right that we carefully and thoroughly review all the available evidence before reaching our conclusions. That is precisely what we are doing.</p> <p pid="c.641.2/5"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> will be aware that the Government completed a very extensive consultation on the future development of Heathrow earlier this year. I am acutely aware that airport development in general, and the future of Heathrow in particular, arouses strong feelings. Indeed, we received almost 70,000 responses to the consultation from individuals and organisations across a whole spectrum of views. It is worth emphasising at this stage that this consultation was not about the need for new capacity at Heathrow. The Government made clear their views in the 2003 <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Future">The Future</a> of Air Transport", which supported the case for future development of Heathrow, including a further new runway and additional terminal capacity.</p>            </div>

If the hon. Lady will wait, I shall set the scene and set out the principles. It is important that the House should have this opportunity. I will certainly give way when we get on to the detail.</p> <p pid="c.642.4/2">We have since undertaken a three-year programme of technical analysis to assess whether these conditions can be met for a new runway given the construction time frame, as well as for the other options we set out for adding capacity at the airport. I will return to these conditions in more detail later in my speech.</p> <p pid="c.642.4/3">After that work had concluded, the consultation launched in November last year invited views on three different options: first, a third runway with a new terminal around 2020; secondly, mixed-mode landing and take-off patterns within existing capacity around 2010 and a third runway with a new terminal around 2020; and, thirdly, mixed-mode within existing capacity around 2010, full mixed-mode around 2015 and a third runway with a new terminal around 2020. The mixed-mode process involves using each runway for both landings and landings and take-offs&#8212;the kind of operation that happens now at any single-runway airport such as Gatwick or Stansted. At Heathrow, however, it would mean aircraft arriving and departing on both runways, in contrast to the current practice of runway alternation, whereby aircraft normally arrive on one runway and depart from the other. Mixed-mode operations could provide additional runway capacity in the period before a third runway could be operational.</p>            </div>

The increase in the number of flights and of worldwide destinations that can be reached from UK airports has greatly benefited British business, offering faster and more convenient connections to global markets. That is crucial for a trading nation in a global economy.</p> <p pid="c.645.5/3">Just as important&#8212;this is sometimes forgotten in debates about airport development&#8212;is the fact that the growth of aviation has helped to democratise air travel. More people than ever can now travel abroad at lower cost. At our regional airports, such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Midlands">East Midlands</a> airport, the destination board looks positively exotic, with regular flights to everywhere from Goa in India to Dalaman in Turkey to Banjul in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gambia">The Gambia</a>.

However, the real point is that everyone is benefiting. The number of international flights taken by UK residents more than trebled between 1986 and 2006. That meant that in 2006, UK residents made on average one international flight a year, whereas in 1986 that figure was one flight between three people. In the past 12 months, more than half the population took at least two flights.</p> <p pid="c.646.0/3">To illustrate what that means in practice for our constituents, let me take an example chosen not entirely at random. The latest census data show that the leafy north London seat of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipping_Barnet">Chipping Barnet</a> has a population of 103,000 people. Using those UK averages, we can calculate that more than 50,000 constituents of <a href="/mp/?m=1500" title="Our page on Theresa Villiers - 'the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers)'">Mrs. Villiers</a> took at least two flights in the past 12 months. Of course it is also important to bear in mind the fact that some 50 per cent. of the hon. Lady's constituents are in managerial occupations and so tend to use air travel even more.</p> <p pid="c.646.0/4">I hope that the hon. Lady will be explicit to her constituents about the implications of her party's position: less frequent, less reliable and more expensive flights. Moreover, she will have to explain to her constituents that if she gets her way, instead of making the 25-mile journey to Heathrow, they will have to get used to flying to Paris or Schiphol for a connecting flight. The number of passengers passing through UK airports has also grown rapidly, from 32 million in 1970 to 241 million in 2007, a rise of around 650 per cent.</p>            </div>

                    <blockquote><p>Mr Hoon argues against himself on a number of points.<br>
<br>
One persons inconvenience twice a year is nothing compared to anothers inconvenience 365 days a year because of the noise and pollution of more flights.<br>
<br>
Travel inconvenience may make people consider more the merits or air travel.<br>
<br>
Many of the 241 million are transit passengers that bring little to the UK economy.<br>
<br>
The fact that there has been such an increase in travellers during the last 20 years (most of which have been economical boom years) does not mean that the increase will continue. Airlines are currently struggling and many aircraft leave Heathrow only partially filled.<br>
<br>
The traffic to Heathrow are often above the capacity of the surrounding road network.<br>
<br>
25 mile trip from Chipping Barnet is hardly representative when many travel much further and may benefit from more flights from other airports.<br>
<br>
His speech seems to back the profitability of the airlines flying from Heathrow and the BAA against the environment.</p><cite>Submitted by David Clark</cite>

That is precisely why the right hon.

Gentleman's Government&#8212;the Government whom he consistently supported&#8212;were looking at capacity in the south-east in the early 1990s. He knows that full well. Therefore, as a distinguished Member of the House, he ought to be able to explain rather more effectively than those now on his <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> why his party's policy has changed so dramatically on the basis of a massive increase in the number of flights, albeit without any explanation of how that capacity will arise.</p>            </div>

As I have referred to the previous Conservative Government looking into capacity in the early 1990s and concluding by 1995 that Heathrow was already full in a practical sense, let me make it clear that even if we decided to go ahead today, which clearly we will not, it would be at least 2020 before a further runway was available and a further terminal constructed. That means that some 30 years would have elapsed on a decision that was being considered by the previous Conservative Government in the early 1990s.</p> <p pid="c.647.0/2">It is therefore wrong to suggest that the issue can be determined on the basis of this year's or next year's forecast. We are talking about a strategic decision.

Family and friends are travelling between countries more easily, but they are also staying in touch by coming back home from time to time. People visiting friends and relatives account for some 23 per cent. of total air travel today, compared with 15 per cent. in 1995. We may be entering difficult economic times, but it is important to remember, as I have already mentioned to <a href="/mp/?m=1680" title="Our page on Norman Baker - 'the hon.

We are now experiencing the consequences of travel to Heathrow along the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4">M4</a> and inadequate surface transport infrastructure.

There cannot simply be more runways and terminals as the years go by. Will he give some thought to, for example, a feasibility study for a Thames estuary airport or some equivalent? Aviation will doubtless grow. Such a study would enable us to feel that, in the long term, there could be a solution that could enable it to grow without causing untold misery for all the communities that are currently affected by it.</p>            </div>

It is not only about greater personal freedom and keeping in touch with far-flung friends and family. Aviation in general continues to make a significant contribution to the UK economy. It brings in around &#163;11 billion a year, and it supports 200,000 jobs directly, and many more indirectly.</p> <p pid="c.648.8/3">As one distinguished commentator from <i> <a href="/glossary/?gl=49" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/" class="glossary">The Times</a></i> has said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.648.8/4">"If we're going to remain competitive in the future, then of course we're going to have to ensure that we have the capacity to allow goods and individuals to move freely into and out of this country".</p> <p pid="c.648.8/5">Who am I to argue with the insight and wisdom of <a href="/mp/?m=1858" title="Our page on Michael Gove - 'the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)'">Michael Gove</a> on this matter? It is therefore crucial that we continue to protect Britain's position and plan for the long term. To those who propose that we sit on our hands and do nothing, I ask: what are the alternatives? Are we to ration flights? Are we to go back to a situation in which only the rich can travel abroad, a policy that many <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members actually favour? The practical consequence of their policy would be to export jobs to the continent. That is what would happen if the Conservative party got its way.

Lady needs to think about the fact that more than half of her constituents&#8212;probably considerably more than half, given the demographic profile that she represents&#8212;will use Heathrow and other British airports pretty regularly.</p> <p pid="c.650.1/2">I shall deal further with the issue of Heathrow acting as a hub in a few moments, but the logical consequence of Conservative party policy is clear: more and more constituents who want to use Heathrow will be told that the only way of getting the connecting flight they want is to go to Schiphol, Paris or Frankfurt. <i> [Interruption.] </i>I see that the hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipping_Barnet">Chipping Barnet</a> shakes her head, but that is already happening. The number of British citizens who have to take connecting flights to travel to the continent, simply because the capacity at Heathrow is not available, has increased significantly. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The hon. Lady still shakes her head, but she needs to look carefully at the statistics.</p> <p pid="c.650.1/3">Heathrow has a unique position in British aviation. It is the United Kingdom's only hub airport, and it has seen dramatic growth in recent decades. It serves two thirds of all our long-haul routes, and operates the United Kingdom's only direct air links to world cities such as Mumbai, Shanghai, Beijing and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sao_Paulo">Sao Paulo</a>. It serves some unique destinations from the United Kingdom, including San Francisco, Mumbai&#8212;which I mentioned a moment ago&#8212;Miami, Tokyo and Sydney. That is possible only because Heathrow is a hub airport. As such, it caters for a mix of short-haul and long-haul services to a wide range of destinations, attracting large numbers of passengers connecting from one flight to another.</p>            </div>

It also means that operators can offer greater choice and more frequent services than they could if they relied only on meeting local demand or providing "point to point" services. Without the connecting passengers, we could lose flights from Heathrow to destinations such as Seattle, Bangalore and Riyadh.</p> <p pid="c.650.3/3">Heathrow also serves crucial domestic markets. <i> [Interruption.] </i>The hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipping_Barnet">Chipping Barnet</a> is muttering away. If she listens she will understand the argument, but it is quite important for her to listen first of all.</p> <p pid="c.650.3/4">There are 10 United Kingdom airports served by Heathrow, including cities that are vital to the regional economies of this country such as Aberdeen, Belfast, Newcastle and Glasgow. Links to Heathrow are essential to enable passengers from those airports to connect with the rest of the world. Unfortunately, however, Heathrow is already losing its ability to serve its many customers across the country as a result of capacity constraints. The number of destinations served by it has fallen by 20 per cent. since 1990. Services to places such as Inverness, Newquay, Plymouth, Prestwick, Guernsey and the Isle of Man have all ceased to operate. Heathrow now serves around 184 destinations compared with Amsterdam's 233, Paris's 244 and Frankfurt's 289, and without additional capacity its position will be eroded even further.</p> <p pid="c.650.3/5">If I had to highlight one statistic that underlines Heathrow's importance to the United Kingdom's economy, it would be the statistic that more than 70 per cent. of foreign companies moving to the United Kingdom for the first time choose a location within an hour's journey of Heathrow.</p>            </div>

                    <blockquote><p>Heathrow's position (and that of the UK economy) might be enhanced if a high speed rail network were able to replace domestic flights from places such as Glasgow and Newcastle, and this without the need for a 3rd runway. Charles de Gaulle airport is served by TGV and Thalys rail services and it is possible to buy tickets involving combined rail and airline routes which connect at CdG. The government should look at encouraging rail/air code sharing in a similar manner for UK destinations. No expansion at Heathrow should occur whilst these alternative solutions have not been investigated. The CO2, NOx and Hydrocarbon emissions from aviation also need to be addressed and Mr Hoon appears to be behind the curve on recognising the need to reduce dangerous climate change emissions from aviation and across the transport sector as a whole.</p><cite>Submitted by Dominic McCann</cite>

If he looks at his own technical documents, attached to the consultation, he will find that leisure demand is driven primarily by fares, and specifically by cheap fares. We have cheap fares because aviation is so heavily subsidised. If it were properly priced, the demand that the Secretary of State has just claimed to be the basis for Heathrow would not exist. As for business demand, if he talks to firms he will find that they require a sufficiency of destinations. They do not require the ability to travel to every destination on the globe. That is why, although the number of destinations has fallen, business in London has increased at exactly the same time.</p>            </div>

Does he also accept that that constraint could be overcome only through unacceptable noise nuisance, which would have an horrendous impact on the lives of people living around the airport? That is the argument for considering an alternative site, for example in the Thames estuary, which would not be so constrained.</p>            </div>

We will need to continue to invest in public transport to and from Heathrow. A good proportion of Heathrow's passengers already access the airport by public transport; about 38 per cent. do so, which compares well with many airports, but we want to see that increased. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a> plc has already taken concerted action to improve public transport links at Heathrow with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Express">Heathrow Express</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Connect">Heathrow Connect</a> services from Paddington, and now the &#163;16 billion Crossrail project will join Heathrow to the City and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Wharf">Canary Wharf</a>. That link will provide much-improved access to Heathrow for thousands of passengers and airport workers. When it is complete in 2017, Crossrail will carry four trains an hour into Heathrow for most of the day, cutting journey times across London and the south-east, strengthening international links and tourism, and supporting the economy. We have committed more than &#163;5 billion to deliver Crossrail, and last week BAA confirmed a &#163;230 million funding package for the scheme, representing a major step forward in its delivery.</p> <p pid="c.652.4/3">This is not the only step that is necessary, however. We are also looking to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground">London Underground</a> public-private partnership to deliver important enhancements to Piccadilly line services, with an increase of up to 25 per cent. in capacity from 2014. We are looking, too, at new rail links, such as Airtrack, which would provide direct rail access from terminal 5 to the rail network south-west of the airport and Waterloo, Guildford and Reading, as well as the potential for new high-speed lines.</p>            </div>

Why cannot we simply curb domestic flights by investing in high-speed rail? It makes sense, of course, to use rail where this provides a viable, practical and cost-effective alternative. Passengers know that and, to a large degree, they are already taking those decisions for themselves. For example, the proportion of London to Manchester journeys is now two thirds by rail as against one third by air. In 2004, before the &#163;8.8 billion investment this Government made in the west coast main line, the position was the reverse.</p>            </div>

I am, therefore, a big fan of high-speed rail, but it is wrong to suppose that a national network of high-speed lines in the UK could replace more than a fraction of Heathrow journeys, or provide a substitute for a third runway. Apart from anything else, domestic flights make up less than 10 per cent. of the airport's traffic. The number of flights between Heathrow and Manchester and Leeds-Bradford last year was less than 3 per cent. of Heathrow's total number of flights, with approximately 13,000 over the past 12 months. Even if every single one of those passengers was transferred on to a new high-speed rail line&#8212;which is the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a>'s policy&#8212;Heathrow would still be operating at 97 per cent. of capacity, so high-speed rail could only ever make a modest reduction in that figure. As <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lambert">Richard Lambert</a>, director general of the CBI, has said,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.653.3/3">"a high speed rail link would have a lot going for it, but don't think for a minute that it will solve the capacity problems at Heathrow. We need to have a third runway at Heathrow, as long as all the environmental conditions are met".</p> <p pid="c.653.3/4">I could not have put it any better.</p> <p pid="c.653.3/5">Positing airport growth and high-speed rail as alternatives is an entirely false and bogus choice. I hope the hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipping_Barnet">Chipping Barnet</a> will accept that. We need to make progress on both.</p>            </div>

Although I have been on my feet for a while, I have been answering questions as well as making a speech. Given the hon. Gentleman's implicit criticism, I shall make some further progress.</p> <p pid="c.654.2/2">I need to deal with the suggestion that Heathrow might be replaced with a new airport in the Thames estuary. As I have said, 400 potential locations for a new airport in the south-east were assessed ahead of the 2003 <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>, including a number in and around the Thames estuary area. After detailed analysis of the costs and benefits, the Government decided against a completely offshore airport, but consulted on a serious proposition for a new four-runway airport at Cliffe in north Kent. After careful consideration, that proposal was rejected for three major reasons&#8212;high up-front costs; lower benefits than the options for the development of existing airports; and a significant risk that the site would not be financially viable&#8212;and it should be noted that it was the best of the options for a completely new airport. The bird populations in the area were also a significant consideration, given the significant safety implications arising from the risk of bird strike.</p> <p pid="c.654.2/3">I know that the new Mayor of London is an enthusiast of that scheme, but I am less clear on the position of the Conservative party. Just last Friday, <a href="/mp/?m=1700" title="Our page on Theresa May - 'the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)'">Mrs. May</a>, to whom I would be delighted to <a href="/glossary/?gl=176" title="To allow another Member to speak." class="glossary">give way</a>, was asked whether her party liked the Mayor's plan. Her answer was "That's Boris's proposal", which reveals the chaos and confusion on the Benches opposite. I hope that the hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipping_Barnet">Chipping Barnet</a> will today be able to clarify her party's position on the Thames estuary proposal, once and for all. I look forward to what she has to say.</p> <p pid="c.654.2/4">The arguments against increasing capacity at Heathrow involve the impact on our environment. Some argue that capping capacity at Heathrow will somehow cap the climate change impact. It is clear, for all the reasons I have set out, that if there is not sufficient capacity at Heathrow, the reality is that more and more flights will simply move east to Schiphol, Paris or Frankfurt&#8212;other hub airports that are in direct competition for long-haul services. There will be no reduction in carbon emissions; they will simply be displaced and British jobs will be lost.</p> <p pid="c.654.2/5">We should also remember that as Heathrow is now full and operating at 99 per cent. capacity, there is a good chance that without further development we will actually add to the environmental burden: the resilience of the airport will decrease, delays will increase and more planes will be stacked above us using fuel and producing carbon emissions across the south-east of England. The current congestion and lack of capacity wastes fuel and increases carbon emissions.</p> <p pid="c.654.2/6"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Stern">Lord Stern</a> advocated international emissions trading as a central part of plans to reduce carbon emissions, and that is precisely the approach that this Government have pursued. We have been working hard over recent years to ensure that aviation is included in the EU emissions trading scheme, and that is exactly what is going to happen from 2012. It means that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2">CO2</a> emissions from EU aviation, covering all departing and arriving flights, will be capped at 97 per cent. of average 2004 to 2006 emissions in 2012, tightening to 95 per cent. in 2013. As a result, any growth in aviation emissions from the expansion of Heathrow would be fully offset by a reduction in emissions elsewhere. Moreover, the scheme would be EU-wide, affecting all EU hub airports equally. It is simply wrong to say that more planes at Heathrow means there will be more CO2 emissions overall.</p>            </div>

That brings me back to the consultation we completed this year and the conditions contained in the air transport <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>. The "Adding Capacity at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport">Heathrow Airport</a>" consultation was a vast exercise, publicised extensively online and through local and national media. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Transport">Department for Transport</a> sent out more than 217,000 summary documents to households in the Heathrow area. In addition, the Department held a series of public exhibitions from Hounslow in the east to Windsor in the west to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Drayton">West Drayton</a> in the north. The Department also published 14 technical reports containing the evidence that we relied on.</p> <p pid="c.656.2/3">More recently, we also completed a further consultation on the potential equalities impacts associated with Heathrow development. This examined the possible differential impacts on equality priority groups by reason of race, age, gender or disability, and closed last week.</p> <p pid="c.656.2/4">We made it clear in the 2003 White Paper&#8212;and repeated in last November's consultation on "Adding Capacity at Heathrow Airport"&#8212;that our support for further development at Heathrow was subject to the three critical tests on air quality, noise and public transport. In the November consultation, we set out the results of our analysis and showed how we believed those conditions could be met in the future under the various development options, and we invited views, both generally and in response to specific questions.</p> <p pid="c.656.2/5">The first condition concerns air quality. We do not intend to compromise on our European air quality obligations, especially concerning local nitrogen dioxide limits, the key pollutant of concern around Heathrow.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.656.4/1">I shall make a little more progress.</p> <p pid="c.656.4/2">The key factor affecting local air quality around Heathrow is actually emissions from road vehicles. Our analysis shows that even immediately outside the airport, nitrogen dioxide emissions from road vehicles in 2002 exceeded that from airport sources, and near the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4">M4</a>, nitrogen dioxide from road use represents 70 per cent. of the total nitrogen dioxide emissions, with aviation accounting for only 4 per cent. That does not mean&#8212;[<i> Interruption.</i>] I am not giving way. That does not mean that we take the issue any less seriously because of the source&#8212;it simply means that we have to keep working just as hard to make sure that we mitigate such effects no matter what the source of emissions.</p> <p pid="c.656.4/3">Reports that we are seeking to abrogate from our responsibilities in this area solely in order to promote expansion at Heathrow are completely and utterly wrong. Along with many member states, we recognise that we face a stiff challenge in meeting European air quality limits by the deadlines originally envisaged. The new directive on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe, adopted in June, allows additional time for member states to meet the limit values for both particulates and nitrogen dioxide. We have an extra five years, to a target date of 2015, subject to Commission approval of a plan for securing compliance for nitrogen dioxide. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dutch">The Dutch</a> have already applied for this flexibility until 2015 and other member states will certainly follow suit. In the United Kingdom the problems are mainly to do with existing pollution from traffic in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_London">Greater London</a>, including around Heathrow, and traffic in other major cities across the country. They are not to do with decisions about future capacity at Heathrow.</p> <p pid="c.656.4/4">The second condition is a commitment not to increase the size of the area significantly affected by aircraft noise, as measured by the 57 dB noise contour in 2002. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Transport">Department for Transport</a> works closely with industry to reduce noise and emissions wherever it can. Some of the progress we have made to date can already be seen in today's modern aircraft. For example, the double-decker <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380">Airbus A380</a> generates no more departure noise than the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A340-200">Airbus A340-200</a> or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A340-300">A340-300</a> despite being more that twice their size. The number of people within the 57 dB noise contour has fallen by more than 80 per cent. since 1975, from around 2 million to just over a quarter of a million, despite an increase of more than 70 per cent. in the number of flights.</p> <p pid="c.656.4/5">We can and we fully intend to do more. That leads me to the other condition included in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>, which was the commitment to improve public transport access to the airport. Again, we set out in the consultation documents our assessment of the prospects for improving public transport access, especially by rail. I have already set out the range of measures that we have in progress, but we made it clear that, in the event of a confirmed policy decision to support expansion, it would be for the airport operator to develop a comprehensive transport assessment working with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highways_Agency">Highways Agency</a> and local authorities as appropriate.</p> <p pid="c.656.4/6">We are not just thinking about Heathrow in isolation. Improving access to the airport is part of a long-term strategy for this country's transport network as set out in our "Towards a Sustainable Transport System" document.</p>            </div>

The consultation exercise in relation to mixed mode will certainly have the effects that my hon. Friend describes. It increases the resilience and capacity of the airport, and so it also means that the likely interval between flights will be reduced because of the greater flexibility that mixed mode would offer. Mixed mode would have a significant effect. That is why we are consulting about it, and why that decision will be subject to precisely the same conditions, which I have set out, as any decision to go ahead with either mixed mode or the third runway in combination. I have addressed those matters, but I am grateful to my hon. Friend for emphasising them.</p>            </div>

I do not believe that the Conservative party is sensible to pose the two options as alternatives. It is important that we develop a high-speed rail link alongside taking important decisions about airport capacity across the UK. That is why we have been through one of the most comprehensive and thorough consultation exercises ever undertaken. That is entirely appropriate, as we are looking at policy decisions of crucial importance to west London, the south-east and the UK as a whole.</p> <p pid="c.658.3/2">Taking all the issues into account, we have carefully analysed all the responses that we have received, either in written submissions or online. We are in the process of updating our assessments, taking into account all the information that we received during the consultation, as well as recent economic developments. It has been a massive effort that has stimulated a huge volume of data and opinions. As I said earlier, I am aiming to announce my conclusion to the House before the end of the year.</p> <p pid="c.658.3/3">I am very conscious that we need to take account of all the available evidence before taking decisions. We have heard a range of views on the issue of Heathrow expansion, not just from people and businesses located close to the airport but from others right across the UK.</p> <p pid="c.658.3/4">I am grateful for the opportunity of this debate and I look forward to responding to points where I can, although I hope that the House will recognise that I may sometimes be constrained in my replies to ensure complete fairness and transparency. [<i> Interruption.</i>] Nevertheless, I assure the House that I will reflect fully on all the issues that have been expressed on these questions before reaching my conclusion.</p>            </div>

The potential economic benefits of a third runway are unclear and unproven.

We also understand the benefits of flying and its importance to families across the country. We want to make Heathrow better, not bigger, so that we have the top-class international airport that we need for business competitiveness and for holidaymakers, but without the negative environmental impact of a third runway.</p>            </div>

There is absolutely no evidence that those jobs at Heathrow will start disappearing unless there is the major expansion that the Government plan. There is no evidence to suggest that Heathrow will go into terminal decline if it does not get a 46 per cent. increase in flights.</p> <p pid="c.660.0/2">A third runway at Heathrow would mean that there would be 220,000 more flights there every year, which amounts to a 46 per cent. increase from current levels. It would be the equivalent of bolting on to Heathrow a new airport the size of Gatwick. An increase on that scale would clearly make it significantly harder to deliver the 80 per cent. cut in carbon emissions to which the Government signed up just a few short weeks ago.</p> <p pid="c.660.0/3">Labour's own advisers on the environment have asked the Government to think again. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Commission">Sustainable Development Commission</a> has strongly disputed the data underpinning the Government's whole aviation strategy. Chris Smith, Labour's choice to head up the Environment Agency, has directly challenged the case for a third runway. <a href="/mp/?m=1774" title="Our page on Martin Salter - 'The hon. Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter)'">Martin Salter</a>, who, I believe, is Labour's vice-chairman for the environment&#8212;at least he was this morning; I am not sure whether he still is&#8212;has signed early-day motion 2344, calling for the Government to think again, as have 51 of his colleagues on the Labour Back Benches.</p> <p pid="c.660.0/4">The environmental concerns are not confined to climate change. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_46">A 46</a> per cent. increase in flights would blight the lives of thousands of people because of the increased aircraft noise and pollution. Heathrow's proximity to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4">M4</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M25">M25</a>, two of the busiest roads in Europe, means that pollution from the combined effect of aviation and road transport is already a very serious problem around the airport, even at its current size. The Government's 2007 revised air quality strategy confirms that the airport is already in breach of the rules in the EU air quality directive, which should become legally binding by 2010. I fail to see how Heathrow could possibly handle another 222,000 flights, or have any chance whatever of complying with the directive.</p>            </div>

Gentleman in due course.</p> <p pid="c.661.2/2">To come back to the point about NOx, when we talk about the EU air quality rules, we are not talking about some dry point of EU law. The health damage that NOx pollution causes to people suffering from respiratory conditions is clear. They include the increased risk of early death, in some cases. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Environment_Agency">The Environment Agency</a> has warned of the risk of increased morbidity and mortality if the third runway goes ahead. Neither the Government nor <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a> have come up with any convincing plans for the major shift away from the car and on to public transport that would be needed if we are substantially to reduce surface pollution around the airport. BAA has failed to meet the 40 per cent. target that the Government set it eight years ago. Labour's analysis rests on the assumption that there will be such a dramatic step forward in vehicle technology that cars will become clean enough to provide the headroom to allow a major increase in flight movements, as well as to allow the number of car journeys to increase from 67 million to 122 million, as a result of passenger growth at Heathrow, without breaching the terms of the directive.</p> <p pid="c.661.2/3">The Government's assumptions are hopelessly optimistic, and their credibility is further undermined by the documents obtained under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_2000">Freedom of Information Act 2000</a> by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1771" title="Our page on Justine Greening - 'the Member for Putney (Justine Greening)'">Justine Greening</a>&#8212;I shall come to that later. Greenpeace has used the Act to reveal another worrying development&#8212;the Government are going to apply for a derogation from the directive. Labour's clear promise that it would not press ahead with expansion if it violated EU air quality rules turns out to be worthless. A third runway would mean a new flight path over one of the most densely populated areas in the country, with thousands more people living with a plane overhead every 90 seconds.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.662.2/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for making that point. Indeed, aircraft noise is already an issue in areas as far apart as Windsor and Camberwell, Brixton and her <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>. A key issue is that the 57 dB contour on which the Government have focused underestimates the extent of the problem. It would be useful for the House to consider the Government's ANASE&#8212;"Attitudes to Noise from Aviation Sources in England"&#8212;study, which concluded that annoyance sets in at much lower levels than the 57 dB threshold that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Transport">Department for Transport</a> uses. Labour spent &#163;15 million of taxpayers' money on that report, which was the first major study of aircraft noise for 30 years. When the Government commissioned it, the aviation <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> at the time said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.662.2/2">"This new study underlines the Government's commitment to underpin our policy on aircraft noise by substantial research that commands the widest possible confidence."</p> <p pid="c.662.2/3">However, the Government dismissed the study's conclusions as soon as they were published.</p> <p pid="c.662.2/4">Far from commanding the widest possible confidence, the research underpinning Labour's approach to Heathrow is deeply flawed. Yes, planes have become quieter over the past 20 years but, again, Labour has relied on a massive leap forward in aircraft technology to enable it to reconcile its promises on noise with the increase in flight movements that it wants at Heathrow. The freedom of information documents indicate that when the fleet mix data provided to support the air transport <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> was fed into the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Authority">Civil Aviation Authority</a>'s noise model, they failed the noise test that the Government had set. The documents then show the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFT">DFT</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a> working together closely on a subsequent "re-forecasting" of both aircraft types and numbers&#8212;a process that went on until a few weeks before the publication of the November 2007 consultation. To all intents and purposes, the projections for the future flight mix were reverse engineered to try to meet the noise and NOx tests, and get the answer that the Government wanted. The document even revealed that Department for Transport officials were worried that the final BAA projections were not credible, but it seems that they did little about it.</p> <p pid="c.662.2/5">I draw the House's attention to a document entitled "ERCD Report 0705", the technical annexe on noise, which was published alongside the consultation. The document makes it clear that the compliant fleet mix that the Government expect to be delivered by 2030 includes a new 450-seat, twin-engine, wide-bodied jet, and that, according to table 2.3 on page 11, the Government assume that, by 2030, that new green jumbo will completely replace the four-engine <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747">Boeing 747</a>. Not only that, they assume that it will replace almost all of Boeing's successor to the 747&#8212;and it is not even on the market yet. The freedom of information documents reveal that the percentage of four-engine, 747-type aircraft with their higher noise levels was steadily reduced every time the figures were recalculated and failed to produce the result that the Government wanted. That new green jumbo is crucial to the final calculation, but, as BBC's "Panorama" programme highlighted, the plane does not actually exist&#8212;it is a virtual plane. When the BBC approached <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_and_Airbus">Boeing and Airbus</a>, it was told that the aircraft was not even in their design portfolios, and that neither company had any plans to produce it. It is a fantasy plane.</p> <p pid="c.662.2/6">In the face of major blows to the credibility of their data, all the Government have said is that if the new cleaner and quieter aircraft do not materialise, the airport will simply scale back the flight numbers to meet the 57 dB noise contour area, but, frankly, no one believes a word that the Government or BAA say on flight counts&#8212;not after all the broken promises that have been made about Heathrow expansion over the years. It is clear that the Labour party is making every possible effort to try to wriggle out of its promise that expansion at Heathrow would not be allowed to lead to a deterioration in the noise climate around the airport.</p>            </div>

I made that point at the beginning of my remarks, and I pay tribute to the industry. Indeed, I believe that aircraft will become cleaner and quieter, but I challenge the Government's assumptions.

It is a cause for major concern. Leaving aside BAA's obvious commercial interest, why should we believe a word that it says when so many times over the years, it clearly said that it would not seek to build a third runway at Heathrow?

Friend's point is excellent, and I do not need to add to it.</p> <p pid="c.664.1/2">I turn to the alleged benefits of a third runway. The economic arguments simply do not stand up to scrutiny. Their main sources are the 2006 study by Oxford Economic Forecasting and the "Adding Capacity at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport">Heathrow Airport</a>" consultation document. Both contain serious flaws. Neither makes any attempt to include the cost impact of NOx pollution, a point made strongly by the Environment Agency, the Government's own environment adviser. Nor is the cost of noise in the areas around the airport assessed. Anyone who owns a property under the flight path will say that noise has a real financial impact. It has even been reported that Hounslow primary care trust is considering attempting to recoup from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a> the costs of health care for noise and pollution-related illnesses in the borough. Neither document includes the carbon cost of inbound international flights. The consultation document incorrectly lists revenue from air passenger duty as a net benefit to the UK, although clearly much of that would be simply a transfer from the private to the public sector. In its study for the Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise, the Dutch economic consultancy <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE_Delft">CE Delft</a> concludes that Oxford Economic Forecasting considerably overestimates the extent of suppressed business demand for air travel at Heathrow.</p>            </div>

These are long-term, strategic decisions that the country expects the Government to take. They are not driven by winning the next election or by appeasing people who are understandably concerned about noise&#8212;they are about taking a sensible strategic view. I demonstrated statistically to the hon. Lady the fact that this country is already losing out to Schiphol and Frankfurt. In a horizon that goes to 2030, we would expect a little more of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> thinking in the long term, and not taking easy, populist decisions. She has to face up to that.</p> <p pid="c.666.0/2">The hon. Lady completely failed to deal with the points that I made about the number of long-distance destinations served by Heathrow having fallen since 1990. Let me give her one further statistic to consider. More people now travel from Manchester to Schiphol than through Heathrow in order to get connecting flights. Why is that? It is because Schiphol has a greater number of destinations available. That will continue, and, in the long term, it will affect the competitiveness of the British economy.</p>            </div>

I agree that we must take long-term decisions on how we achieve an 80 per cent. cut in carbon emissions. We must also take long-term decisions on delivering a high-speed rail network that could have a huge positive impact economically and environmentally. It is Labour Members who are taking short-term decisions based on data that are flawed and that have been wholly undermined by the "freedom of information" documents that I have discussed.</p> <p pid="c.666.1/2">If runway capacity determined whether a financial sector captured market share, why is London streets ahead of Frankfurt? Why are there more German banks in London than in Frankfurt? What happens if Schiphol and Charles de Gaulle build yet more runways? They have the space to do it. Do the Government expect us to match them&#8212;to play a game of indefinite runway poker until even more villages have to be demolished for more and more runways? Where do they draw the line? Would the Secretary of State care to rule out the possibility of a fourth runway, or even a fifth?</p> <p pid="c.666.1/3">Perhaps the most fundamental flaw in the Oxford Economic Forecasting study and the consultation document is that they consider only the status quo versus a third runway, and nothing else. They do not consider alternative ways of dealing with the problems that passengers all too often experience at Heathrow. I believe that in proposing a new high-speed rail line connecting Heathrow terminals directly with Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and the channel tunnel link to Paris and Brussels, we have found that alternative. Our proposal would relieve overcrowding problems and make Heathrow a much better airport, but without the negative consequences for the environment and for quality of life that would inevitably come with a third runway. It would not only dramatically improve public transport access to Heathrow&#8212; evidence from Europe clearly shows that high-speed rail provides a viable and attractive alternative to competing flights. For example, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France">Air France</a> has entirely abandoned flying between Paris and Brussels, preferring instead to charter carriages on Thalys high-speed trains. The extension of the Spanish high-speed rail network to the south had a major downward impact on domestic flight numbers. Figures published by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a> confirm that there were about 63,200 flights between Heathrow and Manchester, Leeds, Brussels, Paris, Amsterdam and Rotterdam in 2007.</p>            </div>

Furthermore, there is an increasingly widespread acknowledgment that the flight growth forecast made in the 2003 <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> should be revisited. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Paper">The White Paper</a> is simply no longer fit for purpose, drafted as it was in completely different economic times and before the urgent need to tackle climate change had forced its way up the political agenda. Eurostar tells us that its high-speed trains emit just a tenth of the carbon of competing aviation. The latest generation of high-speed trains from Alstom are greener still.</p> <p pid="c.667.3/3">Even with a higher carbon electricity generation mix than those figures assume, it is clear that high-speed trains are far greener than planes. Our high-speed link would provide a major boost to jobs throughout the country, but the impact would be particularly strongly felt in the midlands and the north, helping to remedy long-standing imbalances in the economy&#8212;imbalances that have seen more and more pressure piled on the south-east with the north left at an economic disadvantage and starved of the transport improvements it needs.</p>            </div>

There is an industry consensus that the west coast main line will be full to bursting within a decade, necessitating the construction of a new line anyway.

Their consultation is a sham&#8212;no one believes a word that they say about environmental pre-conditions. They pushed for the terminal 5 flight cap to be lifted when the ink was barely dry on the planning inquiry that imposed it. They said that they would not let their expansion plans violate EU air quality rules, yet today the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> confirmed that he is applying for a derogation from them. They want to remove all semblance of democratic scrutiny of the ultimate decision on the issue by giving it to an unaccountable quango. They are split down the middle on Heathrow.</p> <p pid="c.668.5/3">On the question of Heathrow expansion, the world has moved on, but Labour has not moved with it. It is on the wrong side of the argument. The Government are wrong about the economics, wrong about the environment and wrong about noise and quality of life. I therefore appeal again to the Secretary of State to see sense, seize the chance to do the right thing and say no to a third runway at Heathrow.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.669.2/1">For literally thousands of my constituents, the debate is too important for party political knockabout or policy making by electioneering.</p> <p pid="c.669.2/2">According to the Government's figures, at least 1,500 of my constituents will be forcibly removed from their homes in the village of Sipson. Another 4,000, in the villages of Longford, Harmondsworth and Harlington, will have their homes virtually surrounded by the airport or the road network. Noise and air pollution will render their homes uninhabitable, and they will lose not only their homes but their communities. Those villages have survived for 1,000 years. They have community halls, churches, a gurdwara, a doctor's surgery and so on. All will be wiped off the face of the earth. The only difference between those communities and others is that they will be sacrificed for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a>'s profits.</p> <p pid="c.669.2/3">It has been argued that people should have known before moving into the area that the runway posed a risk. However, we are considering settled communities, with families who go back generations in the area, and successive Governments have assured them that no further expansion of Heathrow will occur. I remember vividly the community meeting that BAA representatives attended. One of them read out the "Dear Neighbour" letter, which gave the assurance that BAA would not seek a third runway if it gained a fifth terminal.</p> <p pid="c.669.2/4">My constituents have been subjected to a litany of lies and deceit about the development of the airport. First, we were told that there would be a runway but no terminal. In weeks, there was a lobby for a new terminal. Then we were told that the development would encompass only one village; we now know that it will encompass all the villages to the north of the airport.</p> <p pid="c.669.2/5">We have recently seen plans for the road network. To my constituents' distress, one of the roads is planned to go through our local cemetery. The Under-<a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Transport, my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1765" title="Our page on Jim Fitzpatrick - 'the Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick)'">Jim Fitzpatrick</a> assured us in the House that that was not the case, but subsequently had to apologise to <a href="/mp/?m=1893" title="Our page on John Randall - 'the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)'">Mr. Randall</a> and admit that he was wrong because BAA had supplied the information. I am told that this week I will receive another letter from BAA, assuring me that there will be no road through the cemetery. I will believe that&#8212;just as I believed the Sir John Egan letter of several years ago.</p> <p pid="c.669.2/6">When the <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> was published, the Government gave us assurances that any development had to stand the test, especially for air pollution, that an independent consultation exercise would take place to verify that, and that the process would be peer reviewed. The process was peer reviewed, but the information that went into it was not; it was largely provided by BAA. It reached a farcical level when, as has already been mentioned, fictitious aeroplanes were invented.</p> <p pid="c.669.2/7">I am told that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QinetiQ">QinetiQ</a> was involved in some of the assessments of the supposedly independent process, yet an advert in the <i> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times">Financial Times</a> </i>only a few weeks ago listed it as one of the companies that supports the expansion of Heathrow. BAA tainted the evidence, confidence in the process was undermined and integrity was breached. <a href="/glossary/?gl=34" title="Ministerial statements are made after questions and urgent questions,..." class="glossary">Ministerial statements</a>, which are so positively in favour of the third runway, are interpreted as pre-empting the Government's decision and the consultation.</p> <p pid="c.669.2/8">All that leads to the conclusion that if the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> announces that a third runway is to go ahead, litigation will ensue because the consultation was contaminated. If local residents lose, the litigation will be followed by a lengthy public inquiry, which, covering a sixth terminal and third runway, would make the terminal 5 inquiry appear almost brief.</p> <p pid="c.669.2/9">It is time to stand back and review the position, because the situation, and the evidence, have moved on since 2003. We now know more about the effect of air pollution, which will cover the south of my borough. We now know that the new aeroplane technology that we were promised would be developed has not materialised. We now also know that we already violate the European Union's air pollution directive. That means that a number of my constituents are already living in a poisoned atmosphere. It also means that with a third runway, we will have no chance of meeting the European directive limits, as my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1774" title="Our page on Martin Salter - 'the Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter)'">Martin Salter</a> said.</p> <p pid="c.669.2/10">Reference has been made to the ANASE study, which I welcomed, and which said that the level of noise at which people get annoyed and their quality of life is affected would be 50 dB, not 57 dB. That means that 2 million people, rather than 200,000, as was originally envisaged, will suffer.</p> <p pid="c.669.2/11">On the health of my constituents, like other hon. Members, I have been urging a health impact assessment, but the Government have consistently refused to undertake one. We are told that one will take place during the planning inquiry process, but that will be too late to inform the Secretary of State's pre-Christmas decision, which we await. We now know much more about the effects on health, however, including from the Chicago study on the links to cancer and from more recent studies on the links to stress and heart conditions.</p> <p pid="c.669.2/12">We were given a reminder of the safety risks at Heathrow only two years ago, when an aeroplane fell out of the sky and was literally minutes away from crash-landing in one of the most densely populated areas of the country. I still fear for people's safety with all this over-flying, particularly given the risk of terrorist attack.</p> <p pid="c.669.2/13">Our position on climate change has moved on since 2003. I welcomed&#8212;indeed, the whole House welcomed&#8212;the commitment to the 80 per cent. target in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change_Bill">Climate Change Bill</a>. I voted for the Bill, but there is no way that we will be able to meet that target with the expansion of aviation at Heathrow. The Tyndall study basically says that if we want to cope with the increase in emissions from aviation on our current growth path, we will virtually have to shut down the rest of UK industry. That is obviously not feasible. The two things are not compatible.</p> <p pid="c.669.2/14">That is why <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Smith">Lord Smith</a>, the chair of the Environment Agency, told the Government that building a third runway at Heathrow would be a mistake. It is not just him saying that, however. The Government's <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Commission">Sustainable Development Commission</a> and the Institute for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Policy_Research">Public Policy Research</a>, in the joint study that we commissioned, have said that the Government should stand back and allow an independent review of the White Paper. The European Environment Commissioner, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stavros_Dimas">Stavros Dimas</a>, has made it clear that we are already violating EU directives and have little chance of meeting them in future.</p> <p pid="c.669.2/15">I listened to what the Secretary of State said last week about the existing limits, and the impact of our non-compliance on the health of Londoners overall worries me. We are now revisiting the economic arguments, too. What concerns me is the automatic acceptance of some of the economic arguments that were put forward in certain studies&#8212;I would not say that they were shoddy, but it is now coming to light that those studies were paid for by the industry.</p> <p pid="c.669.2/16">New information comes to light even as we drill down into the consultation paper. I refer to the work of Jeff Gazzard, the aviation expert and environmentalist, that was published this week. He says that even with the 480,000 limit still in place, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Transport">Department for Transport</a> and BAA agree that we can grow passenger numbers at Heathrow from 67 million in 2006 to 85 million in 2015 and 95 million in 2030. Why? Because aeroplanes are getting bigger and can carry more passengers in each flight. That throws into question the very need for expansion.</p> <p pid="c.669.2/17">With regard to competition with other European airports, we now have a world-leading aviation industry in London and the south-east, with a five-airport system. Each of those airports plays a specialist role, developing and competing effectively. The reason Schiphol and other airports have different flight movements is that we have won all the best at Heathrow&#8212;the most profitable ones. I will not rehearse the point about how the economic arguments have been exaggerated, but alternatives have been brought forward.</p> <p pid="c.669.2/18">It is not just the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> who have proposed the alternative, high-speed link; it is the coalition of rail and other unions, which has commissioned its own independent study. It means that we have the opportunity to expand our transport network overall without the significant environmental cost of the expansion of Heathrow. I must also say that the breaking up of BAA by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_Commission">Competition Commission</a> has led the Government to review their aviation policies.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.671.1/1">I am arguing for reaching some form of consensus across the House about the way we approach the issue. This is such a big decision that it needs to be taken out of the party political knockabout arena. We need to have a discussion. I dislike the tenor of the debate on both sides of the House, not only because of my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> interests but because of the significance of the decision, which I mentioned. The onus is on us to treat the matter seriously and see whether we can find cross-party agreement.</p> <p pid="c.671.1/2">The alternatives that have been put forward deserve better analysis. I actually think that the Marinair proposal that the Mayor has now taken up was dismissed too lightly in the assessment in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>. I also believe that the Government dismissed too lightly the idea of developing a proper regional airport strategy linked to a high-speed rail system.</p> <p pid="c.671.1/3">Let me briefly go through the arguments and look for a way forward, and let us see whether we can get some agreement. This is a major decision that will, as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> said, affect the long-term interests of our economy. It will also make or break our climate change policy. It has immense economic consequences not only for London and the south-east, but for the country as a whole. If we are good Europeans, we should look to the overall implications for European economic and transport policy. The policy will cause immense social <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">division</a> within the country. Many people are disillusioned with the whole process of consultation, assessment and policy making that the Government have undertaken. They are angry, and the anger is building. I believe that it is building into a form of direct action the like of which neither the Government nor the country have ever seen. We saw what happened at the climate camp, but Heathrow is becoming the iconic battleground for the climate change campaign, not only in Britain but throughout Europe. Forging ahead with a decision to expand Heathrow will sow social division; it will divide our country and bring us into conflict in a way that we have not seen before.</p> <p pid="c.671.1/4">We need to take the decision out of the political knockabout arena. We should accept that events have moved on since the 2003 White Paper. The Government have introduced a new Planning Bill. We were given assurances on the Floor of the House that if the Heathrow decision was taken under the procedures in that legislation, there would have to be a new national policy statement. If the decision is not taken under the new legislation, we will go back to the old planning inquiry system. The process for terminal 5 lasted five years, and on that basis the process for terminal 6 and a third runway will probably take seven years.</p> <p pid="c.671.1/5">We should commence cross-party discussions about the development of a new national policy statement on aviation, and see how times have moved on and how Government climate change policy has changed. We should set up an independent&#8212;properly independent&#8212;review of aviation strategy and decide where the Heathrow decision fits into it. On that basis, we can at least attempt to seek consensus on this critical decision.</p> <p pid="c.671.1/6">However, if the Secretary of State thinks that he can railroad the decision through the House without a Division, he is sorely mistaken. The least the Government can promise us is that any final decision will be taken democratically, by this House, in a Division, on the basis of the decisions that our electorates made to have us represent their interests in this matter.</p>            </div>

They will be pleased that he has come to the House to make the points that he has made this afternoon. He mentioned the word "consensus", and I am a great fan of consensus on environmental issues, as I hope Members will know. I believe that a consensus is emerging and that it embraces my party, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> and a good many Labour Members; it certainly embraces the public at large, but it does not yet embrace the Government. It is for them to move to join everyone else, rather than for everyone else to move to join them.</p> <p pid="c.672.0/2">I would like to raise a matter with you, Mr. <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>. I had a meeting with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a> early last week&#8212;I am always happy to meet representatives of the transport industry&#8212;at which I was informed that the House would debate Heathrow this week. No statement had been made through the usual channels. I contacted my Whips Office, which contacted the Government Whips, who said that no information was available and that they could not confirm either way whether such a debate would take place. The announcement through the usual channels came as late as <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-05">Wednesday 5 November</phrase>. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am_I">Am I</a> and other Members, Mr. Deputy <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, expected to learn about House business from BAA rather than through the Government Whip system?

I welcome your reiteration of Mr. <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>'s statement that the House should properly be informed first. I fear, however, that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a> rather than the House was informed first, which underlines the concerns of many of us that the Government are hand in glove with BAA. It shows that the Government give higher priority to keeping BAA rather than Members of this House informed about their intentions.</p> <p pid="c.673.1/2">That is nothing new, of course. We know that in January 2007 there was a meeting between <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Transport">Department for Transport</a> officials and BAA, at which they discussed how to ratchet down forecasts of the environmental impact. <i> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times">The Sunday Times</a></i>, which revealed this matter, said that the civil servant involved had sought clarification from BAA on what data could be</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.673.1/3">"stripped out to achieve compliance".</p> <p pid="c.673.1/4">I raised this matter before, as did <a href="/mp/?m=1771" title="Our page on Justine Greening - 'the hon.

There seems to be no attempt to correct it now, so the hand-in-glove relationship between the Government and BAA continues to this day.</p> <p pid="c.673.1/5">In common with <a href="/mp/?m=1579" title="Our page on Bernard Jenkin - 'the hon.

I blame the Government, and I ask the House this question: if BAA had written the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>'s statement today, in what way, if any, would it have differed from the statement that was actually read out?

He said in 2003 that</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.674.1/3">"the demands of the aviation industry are insatiable" and that</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.674.1/5">"successive governments have usually given way to them...It wants more of everything&#8212;airports, runways, terminals".</p> <p pid="c.674.1/6">That appears to be absolutely the case. Other elements in our society have learned to live within their carbon footprint to some extent. Predict and provide has been abandoned for the road network, albeit not entirely, but it seems that the aviation industry, rather than cutting its cloth accordingly and changing its operating procedures to improve its service, simply wants more of what it already has. If it wants more concrete, the Government simply say, "Yes, how much do you want?" That appears to be the policy that the Government have now embarked upon.</p> <p pid="c.674.1/7">Let me remind the House what a former <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Transport, <a href="/mp/?m=1888" title="Our page on Stephen Byers - 'the right hon. Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers)'">Mr. Byers</a>, said in 2001. He said that the Government had endorsed the public inquiry inspector's recommendation that terminal 5 be given the go-ahead, but with a cap on the number of flights. That would rule out a third runway. I agree with the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington, and others who have spoken, that that is a broken promise. We were given clear assurances that if permission was given for one piece of infrastructure, that would be the end&#8212;but like some kind of drug addict, the Government come back for more and more each time.</p>            </div>

According to a parliamentary answer that I received from the Government&#8212;of course, we must believe Government statistics&#8212;the average cost of a one-way flight in the United Kingdom has declined from &#163;205 in 1997 to &#163;103 today. In other words, the cost of domestic flights has halved. Meanwhile, the cost of travelling by rail, which is much more carbon-friendly, has increased by more than the rate of inflation, and the Government refuse to rule out further above-inflation increases. They have stuck to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPI">RPI</a> plus 1 formula&#8212;RPI plus 3 for those who happen to live in the wrong part of the country&#8212;driving up rail prices while air prices are cut. That is not a sensible climate change policy, by any stretch of the imagination.</p> <p pid="c.675.1/3">Climate change is an important issue, which was rightly raised by the hon. Members for Hayes and Harlington and for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipping_Barnet">Chipping Barnet</a> (Mrs. Villiers). I am pleased that the Government have introduced a climate change Bill, and I congratulate them on the fact that ours is the first country in the world to introduce such legislation. That is a matter for consensus. I am equally delighted that <a href="/mp/?m=1805" title="Our page on Elliot Morley - 'the right hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley)'">Mr. Morley</a>&#8212;along with others, including my colleagues&#8212;has helpfully managed to persuade the Government to increase their 60 per cent. target to an 80 per cent. target.</p> <p pid="c.675.1/4">All that is good news. We need an 80 per cent. target, because the climate change challenge that we face is enormous. But how can it possibly square with the construction of an extra runway at Heathrow? How does it square with the predict and provide policy that the Government seem so determined to maintain? How does it square with the additional flights, increased pollution and increased carbon emissions that will inevitably accompany an increase in the number of flights from Heathrow? The Government are talking about almost doubling the number of flights. How does that square with an 80 per cent. cut in carbon emissions?</p>            </div>

We are against any expansion of aviation in the south-east: we believe that there is no environmental case for it whatsoever.</p> <p pid="c.676.0/2">The issue of high-speed rail has been raised in a positive way by the hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipping_Barnet">Chipping Barnet</a>, the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington and me, and in a sort of "grunt, grunt" way by one or two Labour Members who do not agree that it has a role to play. Well, it has got a role to play. First, let us consider carbon. Eurostar's externally validated figures demonstrate that the environmental cost in terms of carbon of travelling from London to Paris by train is about a tenth of what it would be by air.</p> <p pid="c.676.0/3">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Transport">Department for Transport</a> fiddled some other figures earlier&#8212;that was the fault not of the present <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>, but of one of his predecessors. The original campaign for high-speed rail was discredited in part because we were told it was not particularly carbon-friendly, but an examination of the figures for that shows that the Department had assumed a speed for high-speed rail that would have been impossible and that no one was projecting, and a load factor so low as to suggest that the train was almost empty. It is, therefore, not surprising that the Department's figures demonstrated a poor carbon case. If sensible and realistic parameters are applied, however, it can be demonstrated that there is a massive carbon saving.</p> <p pid="c.676.0/4">We know that plenty of journeys could switch from Heathrow. There are up to 60 flights a day to Paris, which is more than to any other destination even though there is a very good connecting train service, and there are still 36 flights a day to Manchester, despite the improved west coast main line, and other such regional UK destinations could also be considered in this regard. Even if the high-speed line went only to Manchester or Leeds&#8212;although I would like it to go further than that, up to Scotland&#8212;there would be a significant saving in journey time for Glasgow and Edinburgh, which would make the rail line more attractive all the way down its route.</p>            </div>

Despite all the doom and gloom from the Government, it will not suddenly shut down if it does not get a third runway. It will carry on at, or near, capacity. We need to deal with the situation of passengers arriving at Heathrow who currently find it most convenient to transfer to another aircraft, so that in future they transfer to rail. That requires plugging in the high-speed network with Heathrow in a way that facilitates such journeys, so there is one more leg to go. That would be a sensible way forward.</p> <p pid="c.676.2/3">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> was keen to talk about the 2003 <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>, but, as <a href="/mp/?m=1852" title="Our page on John Gummer - 'the right hon.

After all, the Government's 2003 energy policy was against nuclear power, and we are now told that it is the best thing since sliced bread. They have managed to change on that in the past five years, but they have not changed on aviation. Why not?</p>            </div>

Business in London has been mentioned, and I should say that when <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_First">London First</a> met me, it was sceptical about the value of all those transit passengers. Part of the cause of passenger congestion at Heathrow is people who come in, spend &#163;5 at Heathrow on a cup of coffee and give nothing else to the economy. It is about time we reassessed what the point of Heathrow is; it is about serving this country, rather than serving people who are getting off one plane and on to another to go somewhere else. <i> [Interruption.]</i> The <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> is keen to intervene from a <a href="/glossary/?gl=128" title="In the process of debate, members of parliament need to stand up in order..." class="glossary">sedentary position</a>, but I am keen to put British residents first, and if he does not want to do that, that is a matter for him.</p> <p pid="c.678.6/2">Nitrogen dioxide is the issue that the Government do not want to address, but they will have to do so, either through litigation or through a vote in this House. Alternatively, judging by today's <i> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evening_Standard">Evening Standard</a></i>, they may have to do so because of the European Environment Commissioner, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stavros_Dimas">Stavros Dimas</a>, who has made it very clear that the Government's policy will not be acceptable and that he will insist on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NO2">NO2</a> limits being respected.</p> <p pid="c.678.6/3">I know from a letter that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs">Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</a> sent me on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-21">21 October</phrase>&#8212;to be fair, the Secretary of State confirmed this today&#8212;that the existing pollution from traffic in London, including around Heathrow, will already put the Government beyond the NO2 limit. They have a major problem even in present circumstances, so how will that be solved by increasing the number of flights at Heathrow, which will mean increased road traffic, and even low-carbon rail journeys to Heathrow? How will those increases help the Government to meet a target that they already fail to meet? Even their non-existent planes and other attempts to find ways around this major problem will not solve that issue.</p> <p pid="c.678.6/4">From <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Transport">Department for Transport</a> papers and internal documents that have come my way, we know that officials have been working with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFRA">DEFRA</a> officials on the interpretation of the relevant EU directive to try to ensure compliance. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFT">DFT</a> is a hopeless basket case on climate change, but we might have expected DEFRA to be more sympathetic to attempts to meet climate change targets. However, that does not seem to be the case.</p> <p pid="c.678.6/5">The Government have got into a hole on this matter. They are on the wrong side of the argument. From the top down&#8212;the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the previous Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8212;they have bought the line that Heathrow must go ahead. They have also misread the mood of the business community, not all of which is in favour of the Government's proposals. They have certainly misread the opinion of the population in London and elsewhere. Most importantly, the Government have misread the environmental challenge they face. They have a potentially good story on climate change, and could credibly claim to the electorate that they have done something on that issue. But they will be shot out of the water if they go ahead with the third runway at Heathrow. People will not remember the 80 per cent. target or the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change_Bill">Climate Change Bill</a>, but they will remember being betrayed over the third runway.</p>            </div>

Members on all sides of the argument have very strong feelings. I shall attempt to highlight some of the key problems that need to be considered carefully.</p> <p pid="c.680.0/2">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Committee">Transport Committee</a> has considered this issue on three occasions in the context of inquiries into broader aviation matters. First, in 2003, in a study on aviation, the Committee concluded that the targeted development of existing sites was one way to deal with the anticipated expansion of aviation. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee">The Committee</a> said that</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.680.0/3">"if the Government believe Heathrow should expand its position as a prime European hub then expansion is needed there as a matter of urgency".</p> <p pid="c.680.0/4">The Committee recognised the significance of the environmental concerns and said that a decision must not be taken lightly.</p> <p pid="c.680.0/5">More recently, the Committee conducted two further inquiries&#8212;on passengers' experience of air travel in July last year, and this year in March on the future of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a>. In both inquiries, the Committee considered poor conditions at Heathrow, which is currently overcrowded. It castigated the monopoly airport owner&#8212;BAA&#8212;and advocated its break-up. The Committee found that inadequate runway capacity was a major cause of the problems that passengers experienced at Heathrow. The report supported the Government's proposal to add capacity at Heathrow, subject to strict environmental conditions being met. That is a key condition.</p> <p pid="c.680.0/6">Underlying many of the comments in support of the expansion of Heathrow was the recognition of it as an international hub, important to our economy and the jobs in it. It is our only such hub, with 68 million passengers a year and 56 per cent. of freight. It is because of the high volume of transit passengers that the hub is able to operate long-haul flights to multiple destinations, including to centres of economic growth in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_India">China and India</a> that are important to our economy. If the arguments in favour of expansion are to be challenged, the whole issue of whether Heathrow should be an important international hub needs to be considered.</p>            </div>

Heathrow is full&#8212;it operates at more than 98 per cent. capacity, and that is why it is losing some of its flights to rivals such as Schiphol, Paris and Frankfurt, where more runways cater for fewer passengers with greater reliability. That fact was highlighted in the recent <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_Commission">Competition Commission</a> report, which examined <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a>'s operations. The importance of regional routes for regional connectivity should also be taken into account. I am a strong supporter of high-speed rail, but I would pause before advocating that we should sever aviation links between the regions and the capital. That would be a major step.</p> <p pid="c.680.2/2">Several key questions must be asked before deciding how expansion of Heathrow could take place, if that is felt to be desirable. First, we should ask whether there are other ways of achieving that aim. A partial proposal for high-speed rail from limited destinations has been put forward as an alternative. It appears that that would deal with only some 3 per cent. of flights, and would not make a significant difference. That proposal may need to be developed further, but it is not the alternative at present.</p> <p pid="c.680.2/3">It has been suggested&#8212;</p>            </div>

Perhaps that proposal should be considered more seriously.</p> <p pid="c.681.1/3">Several issues that have been identified need more scrutiny than they have had so far. Can the environmental conditions that we have set be met? They include noise and air quality in the locality of Heathrow, and the contribution to climate change. We must also consider our obligations under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change_Bill">Climate Change Bill</a> to reduce emissions. We must remember that a transfer of flights to Schiphol or elsewhere in Europe would mean only a transfer of emissions, not a reduction. We should look much more closely at changes in technology and aircraft design, including alternative fuels. That point has been mentioned in today's debate, but I do not think it has been scrutinised very deeply.</p> <p pid="c.681.1/4">The recent provisional decision by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_Commission">Competition Commission</a> suggested that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a> should be broken up, and steps have already been taken in that direction with BAA stating that it wishes to sell Gatwick airport. That will have implications for financing and the efficiency of BAA as an operator.</p> <p pid="c.681.1/5">What are the implications of the current recession for long-term aviation trends? Much has been made of the recent reduction in aviation caused by the recession&#8212;indeed, we may only be at the beginning of what may prove to be a prolonged recession. However, these plans are about the future&#8212;about 2020 and beyond. We need to take a further look at what the recession might mean for long-term aviation trends and for trends in our economy.</p> <p pid="c.681.1/6">Those are all important questions that need to be addressed in the planning process. It would be helpful if the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> said how he envisaged any proposal for the expansion of Heathrow proceeding. Would it be conducted under existing planning legislation or under new planning proposals? How would that scrutiny take place in both those scenarios?</p>            </div>

Making a constructive contribution is quite a challenge but, happily for my colleagues on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>, I do not see that there is much to be gained by setting out all over again what I see as the overwhelming local, regional and national case for another runway. That approach has been done to death. I doubt whether there is anyone in this Chamber who did not make up their mind, one way or another, long ago.</p> <p pid="c.682.0/2">Instead, I want to echo what my neighbour, <a href="/mp/?m=1624" title="Our page on John McDonnell - 'the hon.

If that is what is necessary, that is what is necessary.</p> <p pid="c.682.2/2">I believe that the answer to the question, "Can we all agree on anything?" is&#8212;to quote someone else&#8212;"Yes, we can." Do we not all agree that shutting Heathrow is a bad idea? Do we not all agree that Heathrow has problems? Do we not all agree that we want a better Heathrow? If I am right, and we all agree on those points, that means that we are all signed up to keeping Heathrow open, curing its problems and deciding how to make it better.</p> <p pid="c.682.2/3">If Heathrow is to survive it has to prosper, which is the opposite of what is happening at the moment. To keep Heathrow open, we all need to be against the proposals made by the Mayor of London. As he rightly says, for his scheme to work Heathrow will have to be shut. If that happened, where would it leave the 70,000 people who work inside the boundary fence? They would face redundancy. I hope we all agree that redundancies are a bad thing.</p> <p pid="c.682.2/4">Heathrow's key problems are all horribly familiar to us: frustrating departure delays, annoying landing delays, cancelled flights, missing bags&#8212;[Hon. Members: "Noise."] I shall come to noise later; do not worry. We all agree that those problems have to be overcome. The problems of planes queuing to take off and circling overhead before landing can only sensibly be solved by another runway. Many cancellations are caused by delay: if runways are 99 per cent. full, when flights are delayed they simply cannot be slotted in between the other flights that are waiting to take off, and they become cancellations.</p> <p pid="c.682.2/5">Many bags go missing because of landing delays. Those delays leave too little time for a bag to make it from the flight that it has come in on to the flight that it should go out on. Again, the solution is to get rid of landing delays, for which we need another runway.</p>            </div>

Heathrow is losing passengers to continental competitors, and that is already costing us jobs.</p> <p pid="c.683.3/3">Heathrow is losing passengers as businesses start to relocate because a declining Heathrow no longer meets their needs. The computer firm Dell has begun to move its operations from London to Frankfurt for that very reason. Heathrow's inability to accommodate new intercontinental airlines, especially from such crucial places as India and China, is forcing those airlines to set up their European hubs across the channel. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Airways">Jet Airways</a>, one of India's most successful new airlines, can get only two slots at Heathrow and has therefore decided that its European hubs ought to be Brussels and Paris. That will cost us routes and jobs and will damage Heathrow.</p> <p pid="c.683.3/4">I am sure we all agree that we want a better Heathrow. "Better, not bigger" has in fact become something of a mantra. However, there is one thing wrong with that analysis. A better Heathrow requires additional runway capacity, not so that Heathrow can expand but because that is the way to sort out its problems. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_5">Terminal 5</a> was not all about expansion, but represented an effort to sort out the chaos in the four other overcrowded terminals.</p>            </div>

Interestingly, those people who live under existing flight paths need to think about the fact that if we take the use of a runway down from 99 to 75 per cent., fewer flights will go over the houses of those people who live under the flight paths. We all agree that we do not want to end runway alternation, and another runway would make that unnecessary. To cheer up those on my <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>, I want to tell them that the policy of opposing the scrapping of alternation has my wholehearted support.</p> <p pid="c.683.5/3">I ought to say something about the environment. I would like to say a lot, but Mr. <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a> urged us to be as brief as we could, so I shall limit myself to a couple of points. My approach is that it should not be expansion at any price. Quite properly, the Government have set out conditions, and if they cannot be met, there cannot be another runway. I have never said other than that, and I do not want to be misunderstood either here or in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>.</p> <p pid="c.683.5/4">However, in my 21 years of representing Spelthorne, the environmental problems caused by Heathrow have got better. Noise has reduced dramatically: since 1998, BA has halved the noise impact of its aircraft at Heathrow, and emissions have also been reduced dramatically in my time, with fuel efficiency doubling over the past 40 years. The improvements are set to continue. The new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Dreamliner">Boeing Dreamliner</a> will be 75 per cent. quieter than the 747s it will replace, and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce">Rolls-Royce</a> tells me it is confident that by 2020 its new generation of engines will reduce NOx emissions by 80 per cent. Things are getting better.</p> <p pid="c.683.5/5">Again because of time constraints, I shall limit myself to just one comment on global warming, although there is a lot that I could say about what I have heard in the course of the afternoon. I hope we all agree that we have to get the debate on global warming into perspective. UK civil aviation produces only 6 per cent. of the UK's greenhouse gases; it is not the demon that some people want us to believe it is. Only 2 per cent. of the UK's transport sector emissions&#8212;that is, everything produced by our transport sector&#8212;comes from civil aviation.</p> <p pid="c.683.5/6">The global perspective is crucial. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a>'s total emissions production is just 1.6 per cent. of the world's output. By 2050, civil aviation worldwide will produce only 5 per cent. of the world's total emissions. That is the perspective that we need to understand. We also have to understand that this is a global issue. Punishing ourselves by damaging our aviation industry and our businesses unilaterally will not do us any good, but it will make our competitors very happy indeed.</p> <p pid="c.683.5/7">Finally, I want to say a few words about Heathrow, my constituency and the financial crisis that faces us all. Some 26 per cent. of my economically active constituents depend directly on Heathrow for their jobs, and redundancies have begun already. For example, it has been announced that some 450 managers will be out of their jobs at Heathrow by the end of the year. The success of regional and national economies owes a great deal to Heathrow keeping its status as Europe's No. 1 hub.</p> <p pid="c.683.5/8">The key position that Heathrow holds in the global aviation network is under threat, and decline has already started. That is why I agree with my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1932" title="Our page on David Cameron - 'the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)'">Mr. Cameron</a>: we <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> have a moral obligation to help people who are at risk of losing their jobs. I believe that my constituents face a clear choice&#8212;another runway, or redundancy. I know what I would prefer.</p> <p pid="c.683.5/9">My constituents sent me here to speak up for them. I know it is not popular in some quarters, but speak up for them I will. I hope that that is what I have done today.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.684.0/1">I want to make a few points almost at random, but I shall start by noting that my friend <a href="/mp/?m=1832" title="Our page on David Wilshire - 'the hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire)'">Mr. Wilshire</a> said that planes are somehow getting less noisy. For people in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, the difference is like getting hit on the head very hard as opposed to extremely hard. It is impossible for them to live proper lives, or to enjoy time out in their gardens. I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman supports my <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> to the ending of runway alternation, but the planes are not really any quieter.</p> <p pid="c.684.0/2">I agree with every word that my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1624" title="Our page on John McDonnell - 'the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)'">John McDonnell</a> said. I have nothing to gain in election terms from this debate. I am often told by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a> that most of my constituents support expansion, although others tell me differently. In any case, I do not think that this should be a political issue, so I shall say what I always say in these debates.</p> <p pid="c.684.0/3">Along with my special friend who is Under-<a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Health, <a href="/mp/?m=1448" title="Our page on Ann Keen - 'the hon. Member for Brentford and Isleworth (Ann Keen)'">Ann Keen</a>, up to now I have always supported Heathrow expansion. We both supported terminal 5, but there has to be a limit at some point. Whatever the hon. Member for Spelthorne may say, there really is no room for another runway on the south side of the airport. In fact, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington has said so many times, there is no room for another runway on the north side of the airport either.</p> <p pid="c.684.0/4">I want to speak up for my constituents, many of whom work at Heathrow and depend on it for their living. We understand the economic benefits extremely well, and my constituents have given a tremendous amount to the aviation industry. Many of them came from the Punjab in the late 1950s and early 1960s and, regardless of whether they were professional people, in the main they worked on the ramps at Heathrow airport. They deserve better than the treatment that they are getting now, as we seem to have little concern about the effects of increased noise.</p> <p pid="c.684.0/5">The ending of runway alternation will make life impossible for some of my constituents, who will never be able to enjoy time in their gardens because planes will be flying over their houses continuously. There will be no day free of that, and I think that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State seemed to say that the ending of runway alternation&#8212;what is called mixed mode&#8212;would lead to there being a few more seconds between each aeroplane. He seemed to suggest that that would be <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK">OK</a>, but I return to my point about the difference between being hit on the head very or extremely hard. It is impossible for people to cope when they are being hit on the head by aircraft noise every day, with no break. The people who have given so much to the aviation industry deserve better than that.</p> <p pid="c.684.0/6">My constituents also deserve better transport. I have said this many times, but they complain as much about the traffic congestion around Heathrow as they do about noise, but the industry wants to spend nothing on that, even though it would improve people's daily lives. They deserve better, and we cannot keep on ignoring them time and again.</p> <p pid="c.684.0/7">I am a friend of the air transport industry, and I still do work to help with various issues. For instance, we are trying to limit the weight of individual pieces of baggage to 23 kg because, whatever the House may have been told about mechanisation, each suitcase has to be handled by a person. It is important to understand that, although the airport has modern systems, all suitcases&#8212;and they can be very heavy&#8212;are packed away into aircraft holds by people who have to bend double to do so.</p> <p pid="c.684.0/8">While I am on this subject, I should like to pay tribute to someone who I presume is beginning to come to the end of his career. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Michael_Bishop">Sir Michael Bishop</a> has made a great contribution to the aviation industry. I do not get a lot of joy from the fact that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMI">BMI</a> has been sold to Lufthansa, but I want to pay tribute to a man who has given so much of his life to the air transport industry. That is a lot more than most of the chief executives of the large companies give, and that is why they never worry about taking long-term decisions. Most chief executives believe that short-term decisions about profit over the next five or six years are all that really matters, but Sir Michael Bishop has given a lot to the industry.</p> <p pid="c.684.0/9">The economic arguments for the expansion of Heathrow sound very attractive. Is the airport completely full or not? I wish that I could hold a competition about that here this afternoon. A week on Saturday, I am taking one of my grandsons to see a football game at Middlesbrough. I am taking him on an aeroplane from Heathrow airport&#8212;not because I want to, as I always go by train, but because his parents do not like to fly, so the flight will be a special treat for him.</p> <p pid="c.684.0/10">I wonder how many hon. Members can guess how much the trip from Heathrow to Teesside will cost? I ask that question to illustrate the fact that Heathrow is not really full. In fact, the trip will cost &#163;4 each, which shows that another runway at Heathrow is absolutely unnecessary. The seats are being filled to display to everybody that Heathrow is full, and the slots that are worth so much money have to be justified so that airlines can hold on to them. Obviously, the price is higher with tax, but &#163;4 will be what BMI gets for tickets on that flight.</p> <p pid="c.684.0/11">People have said that it would be an absolute disaster if Heathrow did not expand; I think that the hon. Member for Spelthorne mentioned that point of view. The airline industry keeps telling us that we need the economic expansion, and says that the expansion and the jobs are important, but why is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways">British Airways</a> looking to shift its engineering work overseas? We are told by the industry that the jobs are important, but it is happy to shift the really high-paid, high-skilled jobs overseas to save a little money. However, the attitude is that it is okay to make more noise for my constituents.</p> <p pid="c.684.0/12">I have already said that it does not really make a lot of difference whether one is hit on the head very hard or extremely hard. I repeat that when runway alternation ends, people will never again be able to enjoy their garden in the spring or summer. As for planning their lives outside the house, they may be able to dig their garden while the planes are going over incessantly, but they cannot enjoy their garden. That is too much to ask of people who have given their whole lives to the air transport industry. It is repeated time and again&#8212;we have heard it said this afternoon&#8212;that planes are now a lot quieter. That is just not the case. It is absolutely unacceptable.</p> <p pid="c.684.0/13">The informal Cranford agreement has existed since the late '50s. My constituents are very close to the take-off point on the northern runway. That is why, unless it is an emergency, planes do not take off towards the east; they use the southern runway. I know that that gives a lot of pain to people on the west side of Heathrow, because planes come in to land along the same line, all day, every day, when the wind comes from the east. People are therefore unhappy on the west side. It is impossible to live a reasonable sort of life close to Heathrow. The Cranford agreement will be done away with as part of the plans before us, and that is completely unacceptable.</p> <p pid="c.684.0/14">The economic situation has changed dramatically. Will the tremendous demand for air transport continue, or not? Some people say that the jobs will go, and others disagree, but if the economic situation has changed dramatically, let us take account of that when making decisions about Heathrow airport. We all understand the seriousness of sustainable development considerations much more than we did five or 10 years ago. Let me make a simple point that I have made before: if there is to be a contraction of air transport need, we will not need expansion at Heathrow. However, if need continues to increase year on year, there will be less need for Heathrow to be a hub, as there will be enough flights from Manchester and other regional airports to justify flights from those regional airports to many other destinations around the world. That would take away the need for people to travel to Heathrow.</p> <p pid="c.684.0/15">We have not reviewed the situation in the light of the changed circumstances. I ask the Secretary of State and those who will take the decisions to look again at the likely scenario. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State said that we are talking about long-term decisions. It will be the first time that the air transport industry has ever made a long-term decision; as I have mentioned, chief executives usually stay in their position for a few years, and then disappear.</p>            </div>

May I gently mention one aspect of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMI">BMI</a>'s policy that rather makes my point, instead of my hon. Friend's? When I was an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEP">MEP</a>, there was a direct service from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Midlands">East Midlands</a> airport to Heathrow, which allowed me to travel on to Strasbourg and Brussels. BMI withdrew that service because it had a limited number of slots. It used those slots for a service to Frankfurt&#8212;a service that was already well provided by BA and Lufthansa. The consequence is that now, anyone who wishes to travel from the east midlands to a connecting destination almost certainly does so by road. That does not help our environment, and it does not particularly help our economy.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.687.2/1">I shall try to be as brief as possible. I completely share the views of my neighbour and, dare I say, comrade in arms, <a href="/mp/?m=1624" title="Our page on John McDonnell - 'the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)'">John McDonnell</a>. Certainly, on this issue, we are comrades. He rightly said that this is far too important a subject for us to get into petty, party political arguments on it. I have to say that I was extremely disappointed by the manner in which the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> made his speech. I do not think that it did the debate any good at all. I am sure that if he reflects on it&#8212;perhaps I will buy him the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD">DVD</a> so that he can watch it&#8212;he will realise that he got it badly wrong.</p> <p pid="c.687.2/2">Luckily, the debate has improved. The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington made a wonderful speech; some of us often hear him speak on the subject. I should also like to congratulate my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1832" title="Our page on David Wilshire - 'the Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire)'">Mr. Wilshire</a>; he perhaps made the speech that the Secretary of State should have made. He made points that I do not agree with, and points that I do agree with, but he made a well-reasoned argument, from his sincere point of view.</p> <p pid="c.687.2/3">My constituents, and many of the constituents of other hon. Members present, are effectively living on death row. To many people who live further away, that may seem a bit of an exaggeration, but it is not. What is proposed will completely alter our constituents' lives. Of course this is a national issue, but we have to consider what sort of nation we want to live in. Do we live in a Stalinist state, or Ceausescu's Romania, where people are just removed&#8212;taken out of their homes, and moved somewhere else&#8212;as part of what is ostensibly a state project?</p> <p pid="c.687.2/4">Earlier today, there was a debate in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Hall">Westminster Hall</a> about housing provision in London. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Members">All Members</a> who attended agreed that there is a desperate shortage of housing in London, but we are talking about uprooting people from 4,000 homes. There is nowhere for those people to go. That has not been thought out at all. I have repeatedly tried to find out from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Transport">Department for Transport</a> whether it has plans. It does not, because there can be no plans. It has no idea where those 4,000 homes will be put. Do we live in a country where those people's lives are treated as being of no significance, so that we can carry out a scheme that we are not even sure about? As was rightly said, it is not just a runway, but another airport&#8212;a Gatwick&#8212;that will be tacked on to the side of Heathrow.</p> <p pid="c.687.2/5">I feel very strongly about the issue, and many of my constituents, and the constituents of other Members&#8212;my fellow residents&#8212;are deeply concerned and angry. They sometimes wonder, "What is the point?", because there are consultations and meetings, but nothing happens. The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington spoke of the impact on young people in their schools, and on old people, who expected to live out the last few years of their lives in the area. They will be drummed out of their homes, and God knows where they will have to go. They will not be near their loved ones, whether those loved ones are alive or dead. As we heard, we do not know whether the cemeteries are safe. Centuries-old communities and buildings will be destroyed, and we do not even know that there is an argument in favour of development. Increasingly, I think that the business argument has been destroyed, and I am delighted that my hon. Friends have seen sense.</p> <p pid="c.687.2/6">I do not take delight, however, in the fact that it is my party, together with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>, against the Government, because I want the Government to understand that they are wrong. Many of their hon. Members realise that. I am not sure all the alternatives&#8212;I do not necessarily mean location&#8212;have been considered, and we must look seriously at what we expect from aviation. Can it continue to grow endlessly, year after year? I know how important this is: air quality is an issue of huge importance for my residents, and we have health problems. Many people who are much more capable than an old retailer know about climate change, but if I try to explain to my constituents the importance of adapting their lifestyle to ensure that they adapt to climate change by fitting energy-efficient light bulbs or lagging their property&#8212;those things are all good measures&#8212;they say to me, "What is the point? They are going to put a huge great airport down there and increase aviation emissions endlessly."</p> <p pid="c.687.2/7">I shall end by failing to be consensual in one respect. The consultation document was extremely flawed, and I would say to the Secretary of State that it was a dodgy dossier. May I take him back to those years when we were looking for weapons of mass destruction? For my constituents, potential weapons of mass destruction can be found on their doorstep, as homes and people's lives will be destroyed. When we had the dodgy dossier before, I decided that I did not believe in it. I had to follow my conscience, and I walked through the <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">Division</a> Lobby, shoulder to shoulder with many Members who have now spoken. If my party had not taken this decision about the expansion, I would have taken the same decision to go against it, despite my position as one of those ghastly individuals who tell colleagues how to vote, because it means more to me and my constituents than anything else. I hope that the Secretary of State will allow a vote in the House, and I hope to see many of those old comrades walking through the Lobby shoulder to shoulder with my hon. Friends and me. If we do not win that vote, I expect to see them with me in front of the bulldozers.</p>            </div>

I am reminded once again of what an immense privilege it is to do so, whatever geographical position one speaks from. May I offer my apologies to you and the House because I will not be present for the winding-up speeches due to family commitments? I hope that the House will understand that.</p> <p pid="c.689.0/2">I begin by paying tribute to <a href="/mp/?m=1832" title="Our page on David Wilshire - 'the hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire)'">Mr. Wilshire</a> because&#8212;and I agree with <a href="/mp/?m=1893" title="Our page on John Randall - 'the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)'">Mr. Randall</a>&#8212;his comments were extremely well thought out and expressed. I genuinely hope that his party listens to the arguments that he made. This is a not just a debate about the case against the third runway at Heathrow; it is an argument about the case for or against Heathrow itself. We can all argue about the economic factors that will affect Heathrow's long-term economic health, and everyone will take a different view. My strong view is that without a third runway, Heathrow will be left to wither on the vine, and it will cease to be the economic powerhouse for the country.</p> <p pid="c.689.0/3">One of the arguments against the third runway was expressed in yesterday's <i> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evening_Standard">Evening Standard</a> </i>by&#8212;God help me&#8212;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gilligan">Andrew Gilligan</a>, which is probably reason enough to go against it. It suggested that, in anticipation of an economic downturn and a recession over the next year or so, the case for such a runway was not valid. My vision&#8212;and the Government's vision&#8212;for the British economy is slightly more long-term than next year, and I have more optimism and more confidence in our economy. We should plan for the next decade at Heathrow, not just for the next year.</p>            </div>

We all have our own view on this, and we all have to make our own decision about what will happen to Heathrow in the longer term if expansion is not allowed. From my experience of Heathrow, and from speaking to the people who use it, it appears that the business community is running out of patience with the airport. Business people will tolerate delays and cancellations at Heathrow for only so long. It is only a matter of time before that business goes elsewhere in Europe, and not to this country unless there is the prospect of serious expansion. I accept that the hon. Gentleman takes a different view, and he is entitled to do so. However, I hope that he accepts that those of us who believe that the absence of a third runway will lead Heathrow to wither on the vine must follow our conscience and adopt whichever economic remedies present themselves.</p> <p pid="c.690.1/2">Today, I received a Friends of the Earth briefing that stated that</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.690.1/3">"we believe that the proposed expansion is based on a flawed economic case".</p> <p pid="c.690.1/4">Of course, it believes that: I doubt that there has ever been an economic case for a major infrastructure project that Friends of the Earth believed was not flawed. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Monbiot">George Monbiot</a>, the esteemed environmental journalist, said on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-09">9 October 2007</phrase> in an article in <i> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian">The Guardian</a> </i>under the headline, "Bring on the Recession":</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.690.1/5">"I hope that the recession now being forecast by some economists materialises...A recession in the rich nations might be the only hope we have of buying the time we need to prevent runaway climate change."</p> <p pid="c.690.1/6">To paraphrase what was said by a former Conservative <a href="/glossary/?gl=99" title="The chancellor of the exchequer is the government's chief financial..." class="glossary">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, that is saying that joblessness and unemployment are a price well worth paying to stop climate change. That would be an entirely unacceptable position for any hon. Member to take, as I do not believe that economic growth can be anything other than good for my constituents. I am sure that most hon. Members believe the same.</p> <p pid="c.690.1/7">I wanted to contribute to the debate because, as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> who took the Crossrail Bill through the House&#8212;</p>            </div>

Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1609" title="Our page on Derek Twigg - 'the Member for Halton (Derek Twigg)'">Derek Twigg</a>, and I had the privilege of taking the measure through its remaining stages in the House until it received <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Assent">Royal Assent</a> earlier this year. I have strong reservations regarding the effect of the cancellation of the third runway on Crossrail, which will link Maidenhead and Heathrow in the west to Kent in the east, and will provide an essential link to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London">City of London</a> from Heathrow. In recognition of the importance of that link, the City will fund up to a third of the &#163;16 billion capital cost. It is a robust funding package, but it is not immune to external factors, including any Government decision to say no to a third runway.</p> <p pid="c.690.3/3">If the Government expressed such a lack of confidence in Heathrow's future, how would the confidence of City institutions in Crossrail be affected? Is <a href="/mp/?m=1500" title="Our page on Theresa Villiers - 'the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers)'">Mrs. Villiers</a> aware of the unhappiness in the business community about her party's policy for Heathrow? I will say something about her solution to capacity constraints at the airport.</p> <p pid="c.690.3/4">Lest <a href="/mp/?m=1680" title="Our page on Norman Baker - 'the hon.

I am not in favour of it for environmental reasons in particular, but it has a part to play in the long-term prosperity of this country. It can provide extra capacity, and, if we get <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Speed_2">High Speed 2</a> and, I hope, High Speeds 3 and 4 up and running over the next decades, it will be of economic benefit to the whole country. But can we separate the argument for high-speed rail from the argument for the third runway? If we are to propose a high-speed rail network, let us propose it and work towards it. I hope that the next Government&#8212;of whichever colour, although I hope that they will be Labour&#8212;will begin the planning process for a new high-speed rail network.</p>            </div>

The hon. Member for Lewes told me earlier in an aside across the Floor of the House that his calculations for a 26 per cent. shift from flights to high-speed rail assumed that people would use high-speed rail to reach European destinations. But that would happen only if every single person was forced&#8212;against their will&#8212;to use high-speed rail instead of flights to reach European destinations. I understand why the Liberals, being a liberal party, might want to force people to do that, but I am amazed that the Conservative party has put itself in the position where it suggests that we need a 100 per cent. shift to high-speed rail by everyone who would normally use those flights.</p>            </div>

On a Thursday night, when I leave <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>, I should be more than happy to take a high-speed train to Glasgow, but it seems that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> do not have enough confidence in their planning ability or, indeed, in their electoral prospects north of the border to invest in a high-speed line to Glasgow.</p> <p pid="c.692.1/3">The Conservative party knows how long it took to get the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossrail_Act_2008">Crossrail Act 2008</a> on to the statute book. It took three years of parliamentary time, and we still have not started laying any lines and the first Crossrail services will not start until 2017. If the Conservative party is truly serious about relieving congestion at Heathrow, it will have to come up with a solution that is slightly more short term or medium term than a high-speed rail network, because how long will a 300-mile or 400-mile network take to plan and to go through the hybrid Bill process over goodness knows how many years? That is before we have laid a single piece of line. We are talking about decades before a high-speed rail network would be up and running, and the idea that Heathrow and its capacity can wait that long is fantasy politics.</p> <p pid="c.692.1/4">I strongly suspect a deep level of cynicism from the Conservative party that is more about winning seats to the west of London at the next <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a> than it is about any concern at all for climate change.

If the Conservative party goes into the next election with that commitment in its manifesto, it will have proved that it is not serious about growing this country's economy.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.692.2/1">I shall keep my comments as sharp and as brief as I can and address four issues: the economic concerns that I have; the concern about the concept of a hub being undermined if Heathrow is not expanded; the quality of life for people around Heathrow and in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>; and, why the other options have not been considered in full.</p> <p pid="c.692.2/2">We live in exceptional times. We have recognised the environmental impact of climate change, we face a banking crisis and we will face an economic recession or, at least, a serious downturn. The question is how painful and deep that downturn will be. Under the circumstances, it cannot just be "business as usual" when it comes to Heathrow expansion; something fundamental has changed over the past few years since the <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> and, certainly, within the past 12 to 14 months. We must therefore re-examine the case for expansion and challenge the assumptions that underpin our thinking about the creation of a third runway at Heathrow. From what I have heard from the Government Front-Bench team today, I must say that their ideas are painfully stuck in the past, they have not been updated as the facts have changed and there is now a strong demand for the renewal of their thinking.</p> <p pid="c.692.2/3">When the assumptions about economic growth and whether the runway would impact on the environment have been swept away, when the assurances that boom and bust would not return have been exploded, and when the notion that economic growth is inevitable has been turned on its head, it is necessary for us to consider the impact of aviation before rushing into another costly mistake that is out of kilter with the modern world.</p> <p pid="c.692.2/4">Let us be clear: with a third runway, the quality of life of millions of people will be at risk. But before I reach those concerns, I shall make two quick points, so that I do not end up taking interventions suggesting that I am arguing for Heathrow to close or for it to be undermined. First, Heathrow provides a wonderful level of jobs, contributes greatly to the economy and, along with the other four airports around London, is important in our international framework. Nobody in this debate is arguing for Heathrow to be reduced in size or fundamentally undermined.</p> <p pid="c.692.2/5">Secondly, from my personal perspective, terminal 5&#8212;despite the massive teething troubles&#8212;was great, incorporating the idea that if we want to make Heathrow better, why not create a new terminal that makes life easier and smoother for passengers? I am sure that many other things can be done at Heathrow to make travelling far better for those who pass through it or fly directly from or to it.</p> <p pid="c.692.2/6">I turn to my concerns. First, on the economy, <i> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> suggested in one of its reports that there will be about a 2 per cent. reduction in the number of flights during this winter alone at Heathrow, amounting to 25 flights a day. The argument has been made that even if there is a downturn or a recession, we will still have to take long-term decisions, and that is absolutely right. However, if we have a three-year or four-year slowdown or a slight decrease in activity, it will nudge forward the point at which any project needs to be started. There have been delays, and I take the point about Crossrail, so we need to make up our minds fairly briskly. However, we should not ignore the fact that a slowdown in economic growth delays the necessity for, and start date of, further developments.</p> <p pid="c.692.2/7">As an economics graduate, I must say that the Oxford Economic Forecasting report, which I mentioned earlier in an <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>, missed three or four key variables that we must consider when assessing the economic impact of an airport, the economic impact on the take at the Exchequer and the overall value to the economy. If we ignore the money spent abroad by people leaving the UK relative to the money spent here by people who fly in, we clearly ignore a vast sum. That fact seriously undermines the report.</p>            </div>

That was just one of the variables&#8212;a multi-billion-pound variable&#8212;completely missing from the Oxford Economic Forecasting report. We have to take a lot of that report with a pinch of salt, especially considering who commissioned it. I shall not go through the details of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE_Delft">CE Delft</a> response to the report, but it undermines many of the main assertions and assumptions in it.</p> <p pid="c.694.1/2">I also want to challenge the idea that if we do not significantly increase the number of flights in and out of Heathrow, the concept of Heathrow being a hub will be undermined. I would put it this way: it is the five airports in the south-east and around the London area that constitute a hub. A few routes or destinations may have been lost in the past decade or 15 years, but where is the model that demonstrates the extent to which it is no longer viable for Heathrow to be a hub or part of a five-airport hub? I have even asked <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a> to show me the evidence, but so far nobody has been able to present the relevant mathematical model or the relevant evidence from other places around the world. Again, the challenge is still there, but the facts and the model to demonstrate the extent to which Heathrow's or the UK's status might be undermined are not.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.694.5/1">Yes, but it also indicates that people are willing to pay the price. A market can operate at any price. I shall leave that issue there; I have only a few minutes left.</p> <p pid="c.694.5/2">The third issue that I want to consider is the quality of life for people around the airport. There is no doubt that the quality of life for those woken by night flights is ruined. To be slightly contrary on the issue, I should say that if people purchased houses under an existing flight path, they knew what they were buying into. The great injustice of expansion at Heathrow, however, is against the hundreds of thousands&#8212;potentially millions&#8212;of people who did not purchase houses under flight paths but who will live under them. That gross injustice needs to be taken into account.</p> <p pid="c.694.5/3">I should like to put on record once again that the noise of a single aircraft will wake people at night and disturb the environment during the day. The issue is not only about the average noise levels across an area; the specific noise of each individual aircraft also needs to be taken into account. There is also the traffic, certainly around the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M25">M25</a>, that interferes with the daily lives of my constituents in Windsor and those of the constituents of many other hon. Members. I turn to the flight limit of 480,000; if we proceed with the Heathrow expansion, that figure will be blown out of the water. There will be a 40 to 50 per cent. increase in flights and the Government will find an immense amount of active public campaigning to ensure that the limit is not undermined. Pollution is also a factor, of course.</p> <p pid="c.694.5/4">I want to say a few words about the alternatives. Given the change in economic circumstances and the understanding and acknowledgment of climate change, this is surely the moment to step back, take a breath, think about the issue for a month or two and take the changing facts into account. Some Members have been having a bit of fun, laughing at high-speed rail links and asking how long they will take to build and how difficult they are to bring about. Actually, it is a serious matter. We could have a strategy based on very-high-speed rail links throughout the United Kingdom, perhaps including Scotland.</p> <p pid="c.694.5/5"><a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members have been doing our best to work out a better way to tackle climate change and our transport challenges. With the rest of the British public, we are incredibly frustrated and annoyed that the Government have not stepped forward with anything that would do that. We are working with limited resources. Rather than lambasting what we are trying to do, the Government should get on board and put forward their own proposals as soon as possible.</p> <p pid="c.694.5/6">I would like better noise and fuel efficiency standards for aircraft. I think that they are coming through, but we may be able to do something to lay out the longer-term framework for the type of aircraft that we would welcome into Heathrow and other airports in the south-east.</p> <p pid="c.694.5/7">Finally, I turn to the new airport that has been proposed, tentatively, by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson">Boris Johnson</a>, the Mayor of London. He is clearly passionate about the concept. Surely, once again, we should take a pause, step back and have another look at such alternatives. Technology has moved on; there has been a lot of innovation in the aviation, construction and engineering sectors. There may now be possibilities that did not exist five or 10 years ago, when they were last considered.</p> <p pid="c.694.5/8">It feels to me, my constituents and those of many other hon. Members that the Government are riding roughshod over the views of local people and the mood of the country. They have neither taken into account the changing economic circumstances nor adequately considered the alternatives. The facts are changing, and I urge the Government to pause and take the opportunity to change their mind.</p>            </div>

Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Transport has answered one of the questions that I was going to ask him. It was about how he travelled when he was a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament">Member of the European Parliament</a>. He was lucky in being able to travel from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Midlands">East Midlands</a> airport. I live 20 minutes from Cardiff airport, but when I was a Euro-MP I had to travel every week, backwards and forwards, to Heathrow. Reasons such as that are among the many reasons Members other than those with constituencies in or around London are interested in what happens at Heathrow.</p> <p pid="c.696.0/2">The debate has been interesting and I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to the various points of view. However, I am surprised that people have not made the case more strongly for regional airports and their further development. Cardiff airport is just down the road from where I live. Every morning in London I wake up at about half-past 5, for the usual reason&#8212;noise overhead. I am arguing for the expansion of Cardiff airport, but I realised this weekend, as I was lying in bed at home in Wales, that I woke at exactly the same time, because there is aircraft noise overhead there as well. Nevertheless, I want to argue for the future of regional airports, because air transport in the UK is over-centralised. Those who have been Euro-MPs will realise that more and more. Compared with other European countries, there is over-centralisation in this country.</p> <p pid="c.696.0/3">The 2003 <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> contained a specific undertaking to encourage the growth of regional airports in order to support regional economic development, provide passengers with greater choice, and reduce pressures on more overcrowded airports in the south-east. It also set out the general importance of regional airports to regional economies. Encouraging people to fly on direct services from their local airport rather than making a long journey to a hub airport not only reduces emissions but can reduce travel time for business and leisure users. For example, the airline Flybe estimates that the 900,000 extra passengers that it carries to and from Southampton airport in a two-year period saves 17 million car miles per year. That is an important consideration.</p> <p pid="c.696.0/4">The 2003 White Paper proposed 33 per cent. higher volumes of air traffic in Cardiff if south-east capacity were constrained and there were no additional runway. The 2006 progress report on the White Paper says that the policy remains to make the best use of existing airport capacity. Cardiff airport has capacity available at all times, including peak times. The other week, on my way to Geneva, I was held up at Heathrow for three and a half hours because of fog, yet my own local airport is practically fog-free all year round. That is an additional irritation and an additional argument for the development of Cardiff-Wales airport.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.696.2/1">I hope that that is true. I have heard similar stories over the past 25 years, when I have been frequently travelling by air, yet in all those years of representing my area I have not been able to fly from Cardiff regional airport to any place where I want to go. Some 2.5 million journeys use other airports, with increased journey times, mainly by road, to and from non-Welsh airports, and 800,000 Welsh passengers use Heathrow. One can imagine the movement up and down the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4">M4</a>; in fact, I know it, because I take part in it most weeks. That route is becoming increasingly congested.</p> <p pid="c.696.2/2">About 10 per cent. of the south Wales traffic going to Heathrow is to destinations already served by Cardiff airport, but people go to Heathrow because the service is more frequent. A further 40 per cent. of the south Wales traffic lost to Heathrow goes to European destinations that Cardiff could and should serve. Half the market that Heathrow gets from south Wales is not long haul. All those passengers access flights via road because there is no direct Cardiff-Heathrow flight. The additional surface journeys also add to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2">CO2</a> signature of those journeys compared with using the local airport in Cardiff. Unfortunately, airlines have little incentive to serve the south Wales market directly via Cardiff while they can concentrate demand via Heathrow. High-speed rail alternatives do not exist for the south Wales market to any destinations that the airport serves or would wish to serve. That is another deficiency.</p> <p pid="c.696.2/3">In March 2006, Cardiff airport published a master plan setting out the case for the airport and the economic benefits that it generates for the surrounding community. The airport's location permits the scale of development required to optimise its potential to be undertaken with very low environmental impact and with the opportunity to protect against future noise impact on people. That creates a competitive advantage for Wales relative to many other regions.</p> <p pid="c.696.2/4">It is recognised that aviation could make a significant contribution to the Welsh economy and social welfare. As we have heard so often today, air services play an important role in attracting inward investment and in stimulating and supporting the growth of local businesses in an increasingly global marketplace. They are also a means by which people can enjoy the benefits of leisure travel and by which Wales can, and should, attract more direct tourism.</p> <p pid="c.696.2/5">CBI Wales has said that it is</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.696.2/6">"concerned by the lack of strategic importance attached to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_International_Airport">Cardiff International Airport</a> and the business community strongly supports development of the airport and access to it."</p> <p pid="c.696.2/7">It also points out the necessity of air freight facilities for many hi-tech manufacturing companies and says that such companies would not locate in south Wales unless airport access and capacity were improved. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales_TUC">Wales TUC</a> said in response to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Transport">Department for Transport</a>'s consultation on air transport in Wales that it saw the</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.696.2/8">"development of Cardiff International Airport as a key strand within any economic development strategy for Wales".</p> <p pid="c.696.2/9">The Government's own forecasts acknowledge that an unconstrained Heathrow would adversely affect regional airports, including Cardiff. Heathrow takes significant numbers of short-haul European passengers from south Wales. As I understand it, the third runway would be aimed at maintaining the frequency of flights in the short-haul markets that might otherwise be capped or constrained at Heathrow. Constraint in the short-haul markets at Heathrow would encourage greater use to be made of regional airports such as Cardiff, thereby also reducing emissions arising from journeys by road.</p> <p pid="c.696.2/10">I thank my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for sitting in the Chamber all afternoon&#8212;it is much appreciated. He will have heard the arguments from all parts of the House. However, let me say finally that Cardiff airport is ready and able to take up the opportunity that a constrained Heathrow airport would present, and it enjoys widespread support for growth. I am sorry to say that the Government's support for the third runway flies in the face of the commitment that they made in their own <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.696.2/11">"A key priority is to increase the choice of routes and services at airports outside the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East">South East</a>, to promote regional development, relieve pressure on the more overcrowded airports, and cut down on the need for long-distance travel to and from airports, thereby reducing emissions."</p> <p pid="c.696.2/12">I rest my case.</p>            </div>

There may be a little breathing space when there is some capacity and a pleasant atmosphere but, given the way that BAA runs that airport, it will be filled to the brim even if it has to offer &#163;4 seats. That is how the aviation industry works: if it is given some additional infrastructure and capacity, it will do to fares whatever is necessary to fill it. In only a matter of years, we would return to exactly the same chaos we have now.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.698.2/1">The right hon. Gentleman is exactly right. Even a whole debate would not encompass some of the complexities and biases, including the subsidies mentioned earlier, involved in aviation economics.</p> <p pid="c.698.2/2">Much has been said that I do not want to repeat, but with which I would like to associate myself. Concerns have been raised about the devastating impact of the third runway on Sipson in particular, but on the entire surrounding community. Concerns have also been raised about climate change and the fact that moves to expand Heathrow fly in the face of any attempt to tackle what is probably the most serious problem of our day. I want to associate myself, too, with all the plans for modal shift and high-speed rail, which I have spoken about in this House before. Those issues have been expressed clearly.</p> <p pid="c.698.2/3">However, because of the circumstances of my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, I would like to focus not on the third runway but on the plans to end runway alternation. The Government plan to approve the third runway, but there are so many impracticalities and economic issues&#8212;not just the recession, but <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a>'s financial condition&#8212;and environmental resistance to the runway is growing so strongly, that I believe those plans will be set aside. The Government will then pursue an end to runway alternation, which will mean utter devastation for my local residents.</p> <p pid="c.698.2/4">The consultation documents propose that with a full mixed-mode process&#8212;the opposite of runway alternation&#8212;an additional 60,000 aircraft movements a year become possible, which is a 12 per cent. increase. Those are not movements as we know them because the airport is currently able to pursue a policy known as continuous descent approach. In other words, aircraft stay as high in the air as possible and come down as steeply as possible, minimising the noise impact on the ground. That will disappear with a move to mixed mode, and the consultation documents are clear on that. At present, about 85 per cent. of planes use a continuous descent approach; that figure would fall to between 35 and 40 per cent. if we moved to mixed mode, which would mean the noise was much louder. The noise would be overhead all day.</p> <p pid="c.698.2/5"><a href="/mp/?m=1584" title="Our page on Alan Keen - 'The hon. Member for Feltham and Heston (Alan Keen)'">Alan Keen</a> commented that the impact on daily life would be phenomenal. That was very well said. When we look at the consultation documents, we see that the shoulders of the day would be most impacted by the move to mixed mode. One of those shoulders is the period from 6 am to 7 am. Let us imagine that being the worst hour of the day for noise in my constituency. There would be a plane overhead every 90 seconds between 6 am and 7 am. The second worst time of the day would be between 11 pm and 11.30 pm. Those would be the two most noise-impacted periods if we adopted the mixed mode. The impact would be devastating.</p> <p pid="c.698.2/6">There would not just be an impact on my constituents, although that is bad enough. Already, little boys stop me and say that they cannot hear their television programmes because of planes overhead. We all know that people cannot talk in their gardens, and that families who want a wedding in a church garden have to pick an afternoon when the planes will not be overhead; otherwise, the whole ceremony will be destroyed. I went to the opening of a school by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_David_Attenborough">Sir David Attenborough</a>. The opening of the wildlife garden was timed slightly wrong, and he had to stop his speech every 30 seconds to allow for the planes to go past. The impact is huge. However, my area is economically important, and if people will not live there because their lives are about to be destroyed, the potential of London's economy will be undermined.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.700.1/1">The hon. and learned Gentleman is exactly right. He will know that the consultation document says that if we go to mixed mode, 20,000 schools&#8212;a phenomenal number that I will need to double check, but the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will undoubtedly do so&#8212;will be impacted by the greater noise to the extent that they will require compensation and insulation. The impact would be huge and devastating.</p> <p pid="c.700.1/2">I am afraid that there is a divide-and-conquer strategy behind the policy. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> could come to my constituents and say, "Look, if we have a third runway, you can get rid of runway alternation." That strategy would be an attempt to divide and conquer. We have hung together because of the issues of climate change, quality of life and London. My constituents are determined, and they would not appreciate the subterfuge that I think will be presented to us.</p> <p pid="c.700.1/3">I shall move on because I am trying to get through my speech quickly. I will make a couple of comments on the business issues that were raised, because business is my background. When I first saw the consultation document and asked for the addendums with the technical details, I thought I would see a proper analysis of business in London and what it needed in the way of transport and aviation services. It was not there. We have a generalised analysis that says, "If fares go down, leisure traffic goes up, and we assume that fares will go down, therefore leisure traffic will go up." That is part of the mispricing process we talked about.</p> <p pid="c.700.1/4">The analysis said that business travel was not much attached to anything&#8212;except perhaps slightly to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a>. Essentially, it said that we do not really know why business travellers travel. From talking to businesses, I find that nearly everyone is determined to reduce their carbon footprint, and they are all looking at alternatives to travel. When I ask them the simple question, "Do you want a bigger Heathrow?", they say, "Yes, and more destinations would be nice," , but when I ask them what they specifically want, I find that they want to get to certain major destinations across the globe with reasonable frequency, and nothing more. Heathrow provides for that, which is exactly the point I have been making. That is why the number of destinations have come down. This is not a macho situation where people say, "I move to the place with the most destinations". Businesses want a service that works for them, which is all that they need. They need a reasonable number of services to the main destinations around the globe. They already have that, and growth is not required.</p> <p pid="c.700.1/5">My final point relates to my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>. Mention was made of Airtrack, and I attempted to intervene on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> on that issue. Airtrack is a wonderful notion, and it is tied into Heathrow, not just with regard to PR matters but as a way of showing people that air quality will be managed by new public transport.</p> <p pid="c.700.1/6"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a> Airtrack sounds wonderful. People can get on a train at Heathrow, go through Staines, Twickenham and Richmond and end up at Waterloo. Who could complain about that? But in developing this proposal, BAA and the Government forgot my constituency. I only heard that this project was to be made real some days ago, through an accidental comment made by a reporter. I have met BAA since, and it understands my concerns. It is finally going to hold an exhibition on this project in my constituency as part of their consultation.</p> <p pid="c.700.1/7">About a third of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Park">Richmond Park</a> is bounded to the north and east by the river and to the south by a railway line. There are four level crossings on that railway line and, according to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Rail">Network Rail</a>, those level crossings will be down for 45 minutes out of the hour at peak time because of the Airtrack project. About a third of my constituency will become, in effect, landlocked. People will not be able to get out to work, school or the shops. We will not be able to get police, ambulances or fire services in&#8212;we are landlocked. The consequences will spill on to the major arteries&#8212;the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A316">A316</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A205">A205</a> and the south circular&#8212;making them impossible. Nobody considered the matter&#8212;it did not even occur to anybody. No one picked up the phone to Richmond council when developing the proposal. It is phenomenally daft. It happened because, when they hear the word "Heathrow", BAA and the Government think about the airport and the passengers and forget the surrounding communities.</p> <p pid="c.700.1/8">I ask the Minister to help me. I have attempted to arrange a meeting with the new Minister responsible for rail. BAA had the courtesy to send its chief executive to participate in the conversation, and I hope I can get that commitment from the Minister in his winding-up speech.</p> <p pid="c.700.1/9">We have demonstrated the lack of concern for people who live near the airport. The airport is where it is because neighbouring residents are willing to allow it to be there. However, if we try everyone's patience too far, we will begin to threaten Heathrow's continued existence. That would be devastating.</p>            </div>

That reflects not neglect or negligence through the failure of Governments in the past 30 or 40 years to expand facilities, but the fact that expansion at Heathrow is inherently problematic. Every proposal for expansion has encountered strong <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a>, and the public inquiries that examined the proposals for terminal 5 and, before that, terminal 4 highlighted the conflict between economic, environmental and quality of life arguments. I shall return to that shortly.</p> <p pid="c.701.2/2">First, I want to reflect on the conclusions of the mammoth inquiry, over which Roy Vandermeer <a href="/glossary/?gl=139" title="A barrister appointed to senior rank by the Lord Chancellor. When the..." class="glossary">QC</a> presided. He reported on terminal 5 after a five-year inquiry. At the end of an eight-year process, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> agreed Vandermeer's proposals for terminal 5, with a clear understanding that there would be a cap of 480,000 flights a year because of the need to protect the environment and people's quality of life. It is worth quoting Roy Vandermeer's report. He said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.701.2/3">"While I consider that the noise impact of 480,000 movements could be made acceptable, I am firmly of the view that any such further increase in flights, however it might be achieved, would rapidly become intolerable. The proper application of the precautionary principle demands the imposition of a planning condition to prevent this and to restore public confidence that Heathrow would be properly controlled."</p> <p pid="c.701.2/4">He emphasised restoring public confidence partly because his predecessor Ian Glidewell, who presided over the terminal 4 inquiry, also suggested that if terminal 4 went ahead, it should be accompanied by restrictions. However, no restrictions were imposed in that case. That was in the lifetime of a Conservative Government, so no one should make party political points&#8212;Governments of all persuasions probably have something to answer for. However, no restriction was imposed and people felt angry. Roy Vandermeer reflected in his report the anger at the fact that the assurances that had been given could not be believed.</p> <p pid="c.701.2/5">Those of us with long memories have a sense of d&#233;j&#224; vu. Once again, we are presented with economic arguments for further expansion at Heathrow, which would make a mockery of the conditions that Roy Vandermeer set down and that the then Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1888" title="Our page on Stephen Byers - 'the Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers)'">Mr. Byers</a>, accepted in 2001, and which would expose those living on the flight path to even worse noise and more prolonged noise disturbance than they experience today.</p> <p pid="c.701.2/6">The proposal for a third runway and mixed-mode operation would increase capacity at Heathrow to up to 720,000 flights a year, compared with the 480,000 that Vandermeer felt was the maximum that could be accommodated. As we have heard, it would involve the demolition of 700 homes at Sipson and the destruction of the community there, as well as having an adverse impact on other surrounding communities. It would intensify noise nuisance for millions of people.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.702.1/1">My hon. Friend, who made a forceful speech, rightly highlights the huge adverse impact that the proposal would have on large numbers of people in his <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>.</p> <p pid="c.702.1/2">As <a href="/mp/?m=1783" title="Our page on Susan Kramer - 'the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)'">Susan Kramer</a> rightly said, ending runway alternation would have serious consequences, not least because of the prolonged period during which people would be exposed to noise without the benefits of the alternation system that currently operates, and because of the ending of the continuous descent approach, about which she made a specific point. That is important to me, in a constituency many miles from Heathrow, where the continuous descent approach means that aircraft are at a relatively high altitude when they fly over Greenwich. Ending <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDA">CDA</a> would compromise that, and, with several flights coming in very much lower, the noise problem, which is already significant in Greenwich, even at our distance from Heathrow, would become much worse.</p> <p pid="c.702.1/3">It is significant that I get more complaints about noise from aircraft approaching Heathrow, which is approximately 14 miles away, than I do about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_City">London City</a> airport, which is just across the river, only 1 mile away. That gives an indication of the existing problem and it is why residents in my area and elsewhere regard the 5:7 dBA <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEQ">LEQ</a> contour, which is used as an indicator of noise, with deep suspicion. Noise nuisance is much broader than that contour suggests. It is a genuine problem, which, even at my distance from Heathrow, I experience.</p> <p pid="c.702.1/4">The worst consequence of proceeding with the proposal for a third runway is that no one believes that that would be the end of the story. If the previous restrictions were swept away, and we were told that a third runway and a sixth terminal were essential, what would stop a future <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> saying in a few years, "We need a fourth runway. After all, Schiphol's got four runways, so why can't London? It's time for terminal 7 or 8"? The process would continue, there would be further demands for airport capacity and, therefore, further conflict with the needs and aspirations of people whose lives would be blighted by the expansion, and a scenario that would lead to even more unacceptable noise nuisance and pollution.</p> <p pid="c.702.1/5">Heathrow is simply not in the right location for London's hub airport. If we started from scratch today, no one would propose putting London's hub airport at Heathrow. The location is the product of planning decisions that were made in the 1940s in a completely different world for traffic movements, noise and other matters, and in the curious absence of any new airport building in this country in comparison with others. Let us look across the channel to France. In the same period, France has moved its main airport from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Bourget">Le Bourget</a> to Orly to Charles de Gaulle. There was no problem about moving it to a new site. France felt that that was necessary and did it. We ended up simply adding capacity at Heathrow, thereby aggravating the problems that I have mentioned.</p> <p pid="c.702.1/6">If there was no alternative, and the proposal was the only way we could expand an airport that is essential to our economy&#8212;I entirely accept the arguments for its economic importance&#8212;it would be understandable. However, 40 years ago people began to realise that there was an alternative, and that we could plan an airport in a location in the Thames estuary, where there would be less conflict between the needs of the surrounding population, the environment and the economic demands than at Heathrow. Unfortunately, Maplin did not proceed. I personally believe that the subsequent Cliffe proposal was unsatisfactory and bound to fail, and I wonder whether it was made with that outcome in view.</p> <p pid="c.702.1/7">However, I still believe that the estuary is the right location, although any decision will have to be carefully planned. There are genuine concerns&#8212;my hon. Friends who represent constituencies in that area have expressed doubts about estuary locations&#8212;but there is the potential to achieve an airport on reclaimed land. That has been done in other places, such as Kansai in Japan and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> in China, where reclaimed land has created a far better environment for an airport, as flights can approach and land over water, thus reducing noise nuisance and, incidentally, the risk to public safety. I must emphasise that having flight paths approaching and leaving Heathrow over densely populated areas raises genuine concerns. My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1624" title="Our page on John McDonnell - 'the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)'">John McDonnell</a> rightly highlighted the risks implicit in that.</p> <p pid="c.702.1/8">In the words of the Secretary of State, who earlier argued for a strategic approach to airport development, the issue is one that we really need to address. We need to address it in the context of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Gateway">Thames Gateway</a> regeneration, which gives us an opportunity to transform the entire economy of south-east England, by improving the performance and development of some of the more deprived parts and thereby rebalancing the economy, which has shown a heavy tendency towards overheating to the west of London and too much dereliction and underdevelopment to the east. The Thames Gateway opportunity, aided by the siting of an airport there, holds out a great economic opportunity for our country.</p> <p pid="c.702.1/9">My final point is that siting an airport there also holds out the prospect of far better integration of different modes. Good high-speed rail links via Ebbsfleet could easily be established at an appropriate site in the estuary, which would then connect both to London and the rest of the country, and to Europe. That would give people opportunities to travel to Europe by rail rather than by aircraft and would improve links throughout the country. My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1990" title="Our page on Tom Harris - 'the Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris)'">Mr. Harris</a>, the former Transport <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, who is no longer <a href="/glossary/?gl=145" title="Of a male MP, sitting on his regular seat in the House. For females, &quot;in..." class="glossary">in his place</a>, argued the case for Crossrail, which could provide a link between Heathrow and an estuary airport and further enhance those opportunities.</p> <p pid="c.702.1/10">I am not one of those who believes that an estuary airport is an alternative. The estuary is the right location for the hub in the long term, but that is compatible with continued operation at Heathrow for many years to come. That would help us to begin to overcome the dreadful consequences of our failure to grasp the nettle and get the right location for our hub airport over the past 30 years.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.704.0/1">I welcome this debate about the huge proposed expansion of Heathrow, which would obviously affect my constituents considerably. Many hon. Members will be wondering what problems Reading might have with such expansion&#8212; after all, we are more than 30 miles away. I will try to explain to the House over the next few minutes.</p> <p pid="c.704.0/2">Reading already suffers from considerable flight traffic, as most of the traffic flying out of and into Heathrow goes over some part of my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>. I have written to Ministers on a number of occasions to express my concern about the growing levels of noise and pollution. I have also raised concerns about the proposals for increased air traffic with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATS">NATS</a>. The general arguments about Heathrow expansion are well rehearsed, including from the Front-Bench spokesmen today, and I do not wish to repeat them. I want to focus on local matters that are important to my constituents. Their quality of life is every bit as important as a flawed decision to expand Heathrow with a third runway.</p> <p pid="c.704.0/3">I acknowledge that Heathrow is operating at capacity, handling nearly 68 million passengers a year, when it was designed to deal with many fewer. Heathrow plays a disproportionate role in UK aviation&#8212;it caters for 35 per cent. of the UK's aviation business traffic, is used by 90 per cent. of airlines and handles nearly 500,000 air traffic movements a year. Heathrow is already a colossus in aviation terms, however we measure it. However, is the answer to the problem really to build a third runway and add terminal capacity at Heathrow?</p> <p pid="c.704.0/4">The Government looked into the issue in their <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>, as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> said, and set out three conditions. I do not want to repeat them in detail, but they can be summarised as noise, pollution and public access. My constituents are interested in the first two&#8212;noise and pollution&#8212;both of which I have received regular complaints about. It was therefore a great disappointment to them that the Government appear to be focusing the case for expanding Heathrow on the airport's role in supporting the UK economy. It is almost as if the Government have decided that the best way to get their own way is to frighten or bully the public into agreement, rather than fulfilling their own criteria for any decision. Indeed, that was reiterated somewhat by the Secretary of State's performance at the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> today.</p> <p pid="c.704.0/5">The conditions that the Government have set have been overlooked and I am deeply concerned about how the expansion will play out among my constituents. As I am sure hon. Members can imagine, I have had a sizeable postbag on the matter, as many of my constituents, especially those living in the north of my constituency in Caversham, are getting a daily taste of life under the flight path. The strength of feeling about the issue cannot be ignored. Indeed, I have received many letters urging me to oppose any third runway.</p> <p pid="c.704.0/6">My constituents in the north of Reading already believe that they are experiencing a substantial increase in flight traffic and all the noise that comes with that. They are rightly discontented with that. I know that many hon. Members have constituencies that are much closer to Heathrow and constituents who suffer the daily torment of low-flying aircraft. My constituency is 30 miles away and yet we, too, suffer similar problems with noise and pollution.</p> <p pid="c.704.0/7">I have corresponded with several Ministers in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Transport">Department for Transport</a> over the past 18 months or so. I recently wrote again to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> who is due to wind up this debate. His reply confirmed that Reading, East suffers from substantial air traffic noise. Indeed, I have become quite a nerd on the subject, because it has become so important to my constituents, although I shall try not to go into too much detail.</p> <p pid="c.704.0/8">It has been confirmed that a westerly preference for take-offs, owing to prevailing westerly winds, has been operating at Heathrow since 1962, as the airport attempts to reduce the number of departing aircraft taking off over areas to the east of the airport. That is quite sensible, because the areas to the east of the airport are more densely populated. Generally, the westerly preference operates for 70 per cent. of a typical year. An aircraft taking off towards the west is slightly less of an issue for my constituents, because departing aircraft have to follow set routes known as noise preferential routes or NPRs. When an aircraft reaches 4,000 ft, air traffic control can leave it on that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR">NPR</a> or put it on a more direct route to its destination. The key point, aircraft experts tell me, is that aircraft today can reach 4,000 ft pretty quickly.</p> <p pid="c.704.0/9">Normally, an aircraft would be above 4,000 ft by the time it reached Reading and still ascending. In those circumstances there is not really a problem. But&#8212;and it is a pretty big but&#8212;because aircraft departing to the west must have a vertical separation of 1,000 ft from arriving aircraft, which descend from the southern holding stacks for safety reasons, they have to lower their altitude until there is a clear crossing area. That basically means that aircraft have to lower their altitude at Reading for safety reasons. Many aircraft are now so low that my constituents have written to me to express their concern that they are in fact flying below 1,000 ft. I do not know whether that is true without getting out my measuring tape. It seems unlikely, but even so, it may be worth the Minister taking a look at that claim, because it could be quite dangerous if it were true.</p> <p pid="c.704.0/10">Matters are made much worse for my constituents when Heathrow changes to an easterly operation for 30 per cent. of the year. The Department for Transport has sent me the landing maps, which show that Reading is a blizzard of low-flying aircraft. Aircraft are held in holding stacks and then join the airport's instrument landing system. That brings aircraft much lower over my constituents. Again, the situation is not as bad as it is in the areas closer to Heathrow, but the noise makes a difference to my constituents' quality of life. Expansion will mean more noise and pollution for them, and the number of flights to and from Heathrow could rise from 480,000 a year to nearly 800,000 with a third runway. More and more people, including my constituents, will be under Heathrow's flight paths, and the effects will be intolerable. We all know that the south of England is increasingly overcrowded, particularly regarding road transport. Any expansion of Heathrow will make matters much worse. One constituent who wrote to me put it simply:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.704.0/11">"I feel very strongly that we cannot just keep accepting this endless expansion without question."</p> <p pid="c.704.0/12">In the absence of anything like a compelling case from the Government, my party has decided to oppose the building of a third runway at Heathrow, and is instead advocating high-speed rail as part of the alternative.</p>            </div>

I believe that on all three counts, the balance of evidence is clearly now against proceeding with the expansion.</p> <p pid="c.706.2/2">On the first point, the airline industry has of course staked its demand for continued expansion on the claim that it is central to the UK economy, but it is not. No one will deny that the aviation industry has an important role, but it ranks as only the 26th largest industry in the country. It is half the size of the computer industry and, until a few months ago, just a 10th the size of banking and finance<i> &#8212;[Laughter.]</i> That figure will now be slightly different, but I hope that the point is still made. Far from being key to the balance of payments, as the industry often argues, it helps to create a tourism deficit of some &#163;17 billion a year&#8212;that is what British tourists spend abroad over what visitors to Britain spend in this country.</p> <p pid="c.706.2/3">In addition, the UK airline industry gets a subsidy of some &#163;10 billion a year from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAT">VAT</a>-free tickets and planes, and tax-free fuel. That is taxpayers' money that could be far better spent on promoting sustainable transport systems, not least as a substitute for domestic, short-haul flights. In the past decade, the subsidies have been so large that they have allowed a 40 per cent. reduction in air fares at the same time as rail fares have rocketed by 70 per cent.</p> <p pid="c.706.2/4">The economic case for the third runway is a lot more questionable than has been made out. Indeed, that view was recently expressed in a report released in February this year by the respected consultant <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE_Delft">CE Delft</a>, which argued that the official figures greatly overestimate both the number of jobs that the runway would generate and the value brought to Britain by extra business travellers.</p>            </div>

As the hon. Gentleman says, the debate is not only on the third runway at Heathrow, nor on Heathrow in general, but on the need for a national policy review and a statement of exactly what aviation means to the national economy, and how we should deal with the requirements given all the options. Like many other hon. Members, I agree that a great deal has happened in the past five years that should cause us to look at the situation again. I am thinking of the volatility in the price of oil; the fact that peak oil supply is probably, on some calculations, only 40 years away; the increasing tightness of carbon budgets worldwide; and possibly&#8212;I realise that this is uncertain and that it could be challenged&#8212;the gradually changing attitude of many consumers to air travel. For all of those reasons, I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman.</p> <p pid="c.707.1/2">The second issue is the local environmental impact on 2 million people in hard-put-upon communities in west London. Jets roar over densely populated areas, in some periods as frequently as every 30 seconds. Bad air quality hot spots already exist, and they will certainly increase if the expansion goes ahead. I am glad to leave talk of the road links back to London, which are often snarled up, to those who are far better acquainted with the situation&#8212;we heard powerful speeches from my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1624" title="Our page on John McDonnell - 'the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)'">John McDonnell</a> and <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members on that. I shall say simply that those issues, which were eloquently expressed in the Chamber today, will have widespread political, economic and social consequences. We ignore that at our peril.</p> <p pid="c.707.1/3">I wish to concentrate on the third issue, which I think is decisive in its own right. To put it bluntly, tripling Britain's airport capacity is irreconcilable with meeting our climate change mandatory targets. A parliamentary answer in April this year made it clear that aviation already accounts for 13 per cent. of the UK's total climate change impact. That is quite a high figure, but the key point is that it is now the fastest-rising generator of greenhouse gases in Britain. That has awesome implications.</p> <p pid="c.707.1/4">The Tyndall centre in Norwich, which is widely respected worldwide for its climate change research, is now predicting that aviation emissions on their current trajectory will account for up to 100 per cent. of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a>'s carbon budget by 2050. In other words, even if we retired every car off our roads, unplugged every electronic device and closed every factory, we would still not be able to meet the climate change targets, because of aviation. I recognise that a <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Transport may not be overly concerned about climate change targets that, after all, have to be met 40 years in the future. However, it is extremely unwise not to take account of the fact that we now have five-year carbon budgets. If aviation continues disproportionately to increase its share of that limited budget, others, which can only mean industry and private households, will have to take a sharply decreasing share. That could cause extreme difficulties, to put it mildly.</p>            </div>

                    <blockquote><p>I am surprised to see Mr Meacher say (in debate on Heathrow, 11 Nov 08) that, "peak oil supply is probably, on some calculations, only 40 years away" when on his website he says "...peak oil &ndash; the point at which oil production reaches its global peak before it then steadily declines &ndash; is widely expected to be reached some time between 2010-2015." In 40 years time, that's the end of 2048, we will be leading very different lives and if people who do understand peak oil and its implications, are not more realistic about the situation, that future will be all the worse. Acording to BP's statistical review, global oil production has been stable since 2005 (81,255 kbd in 2005, 81,659 in 2006 and 81,533 in 2007). As we run out of light, sweet crude, we are turning to dirtier fuels - rather than tackling climate change and preparing for a low-energy future. Please, Mr Meacher, speak out on peak oil, energy security, localisation and the things that are needed for the future.</p><cite>Submitted by Mandy Meikle</cite>

There is considerable argument over which base figure to use and it is possible to produce very different conclusions depending on what is chosen.</p> <p pid="c.708.1/2">Of course, it is possible to argue&#8212;the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> did so afternoon&#8212;that we should not worry too much because the Government are going to include the aviation industry in the EU emissions trading scheme. I draw the Secretary of State's attention to the fact that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_and_Young">Ernst and Young</a> calculated in June last year that even in the toughest EU scenario&#8212;I must say that, bearing in mind we are talking about the EU, I would not bank on that&#8212;aviation emissions will grow by 83 per cent. by 2020. That is fractionally less than business-as-usual scenarios.</p> <p pid="c.708.1/3">Another argument that is often used and which needs to be put on the table is that the airline industry will get round the problem simply by buying carbon credits from other industries or from abroad under the emissions trading scheme, while still expanding with impunity. I think that that is extremely perverse and the fact remains that the EU will almost certainly set the credits allowance well below the level that is needed by the industry.</p> <p pid="c.708.1/4">Finally, one environmental constraint, which will apply very quickly, is mandatory under EU law and cannot be circumvented. I refer to mandatory EU targets on nitrogen oxide, which come into force in 2010&#8212;only a little more than a year away. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs">Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</a> admitted at last week's <a href="/glossary/?gl=25" title="Question Time is an opportunity for MPs and Members of the House of Lords..." class="glossary">Question Time</a> that NOx levels are already being breached in London. I hate to say this, but, frankly, it is ridiculous to pretend, as the Government do, that if the number of flight movements goes up by 50 per cent.&#8212;from 480,000 to 720,000&#8212;it will not push up NOx pollution and noise above lawful levels.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.709.1/1">I have not got time to <a href="/glossary/?gl=176" title="To allow another Member to speak." class="glossary">give way</a>.</p> <p pid="c.709.1/2">In a very revealing article in March last year, <i> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times">The Sunday Times</a> </i>showed how the Government created that canard&#8212;by allowing senior executives from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a> to</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.709.1/3">"select alternate input data for the environmental predictions until they got the right results".</p> <p pid="c.709.1/4">They did it by removing international flight arrivals from the calculation and by other spurious and misleading devices. As a result, I wrote later in the same month to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stavros_Dimas">Stavros Dimas</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU_Commissioner">EU Commissioner</a> for Environment, asking him to make his own investigation to decide whether he thought the third runway was compatible with EU air quality and noise standards. I received an answer in July, which stated in the third paragraph:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.709.1/5">"Technical reports underpinning the Heathrow expansion suggest that nitrogen limit values near Heathrow will be significantly exceeded in 2010, the year in which those limit values become mandatory, and that this will be the case even after 2015."</p> <p pid="c.709.1/6">Even if the derogation occurs, <phrase class="date" code="2015-01-01">1 January 2015</phrase> is the final date by which the mandatory targets become operable. In my view, that settles the argument. There is absolutely no way, when NOx levels are already significantly above the required limit, that adding nearly 250,000 additional flight movements can somehow reduce them. This project is not supported by the Government's own Environment Agency; it does not command a consensus, as we have seen so clearly today; and if the Government recklessly press ahead, the EU is bound to block it. Now is the time for the Government to have another very close look at the issue.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.709.2/1">What is wrong with Britain when we can never take any big decisions in a sensible manner? I happen to think that airport expansion is not&#8212;for reasons associated with climate change&#8212;the way forward. If it really is necessary to have more airport facilities, it would be sensible to do what every sensible nation has done, which is to put them somewhere where aircraft do not have to fly over large numbers of people. That seems perfectly obvious to me. Why we cannot take such infrastructure decisions defeats me.</p> <p pid="c.709.2/2">It is depressing in the extreme to see a former <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> laugh at the idea of doing something about high-speed rail, when he used to be in charge of the railways at a time when nobody was working for the railways, and then suggest that it is somehow inappropriate to demand what every other nation in Europe has done about similar problems.</p> <p pid="c.709.2/3">We then heard the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> suggest that it was somehow disgraceful for Members to be against Heathrow expansion on the grounds that their constituents were affected. He sought to distinguish me from my colleagues on the basis that I had a high-minded view whereas they had a low-minded view, which seemed to me to be intolerable. It is not taking a low-minded view to say that people's constituents deserve a better quality of life than the one they will get if we go ahead with a third runway at Heathrow. I will not be distinguished from my colleagues in that way simply because I do not have a <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> interest in the matter. I have a very big interest in it, which is the interest of my children and my grandchildren&#8212;and unless we bite the bullet and face the fact of what climate change really means, we might as well give up the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change_Bill">Climate Change Bill</a> and all the rest of it.</p> <p pid="c.709.2/4">I read carefully what the new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Energy_and_Climate_Change">Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change</a> said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.709.2/5">"Only if Britain plays its part will a global deal in Copenhagen to cut emissions be possible, so far from retreating from our objectives, we should reaffirm our resolve."&#8212;[<a href="/search/?pop=1&s=date:20081016+column:935+section:debates"><i> Hansard</i>, 16 October 2008; Vol. 480, c. 935</a>.]</p> <p pid="c.709.2/6">What does he then do? He goes to Copenhagen and says, "What I want you to do is to follow the British route. We are going to build a new coal-fired power station in Kingsnorth without any kind of carbon capture or sequestration. We are going to expand the airport at Stansted. We have already increased the number of airplanes there. What is more, to show our commitment to the battle against climate change, we are going to have a third runway at Heathrow." What kind of leadership is Britain going to be able to provide in Copenhagen if the Government fail to understand that joined-up thinking is a necessary part of fighting climate change?</p> <p pid="c.709.2/7">The truth of the matter is that we have a real opportunity to set the world on the right course. It is no good wittering on about the fact that this or that country has not done it, so until they do, we are not going to do it. We did not win the battle of the industrial revolution by saying, "We are not going forward with industrialisation until they have."</p> <p pid="c.709.2/8">In the new green revolution, we have to take these decisions for the economic future of our country. I remind the Secretary of State that the quality of life report was written by someone who did not have a constituency reason for writing it and he did so at the point at which the Conservative party took the ideas on board&#8212;not for short-term, local constituency reasons, but for the longer-term reason that we cannot cut our emissions by 80 per cent. by 2050 and build a third runway at Heathrow at the same time. We simply cannot do that.</p> <p pid="c.709.2/9"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State's problem is simple. He must recognise that there comes a moment in the life of any politician&#8212;it is a very frightening moment&#8212;when he has to think about how he is going to tell his grandchildren about the decision he made. This right hon. Gentleman is truly a right hon. Gentleman; if he does not have grandchildren, there are many surrogates to help him. He is a right hon. Gentleman and he knows very well that it is not honourable to do in the short term what he knows will destroy the policy of this and any other future Government of this country in the long term. The building of a third runway at Heathrow will make any possibility of Britain leading the world on climate change absolutely impossible. To suggest that we would replace present capacity by means of a sensibly placed airport somewhere in the estuary is reasonable, but a replacement is what it must be.</p> <p pid="c.709.2/10">People speak with forked tongue, if that is not a unparliamentary phrase, when they say&#8212;as my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1832" title="Our page on David Wilshire - 'the Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire)'">Mr. Wilshire</a> said&#8212;that we are not talking about expansion while asking, as he did, for more airport capacity to allow flights to Bangalore, Osaka and other such cities. It cannot be said that this is merely a matter of "tidying up" the airport; the intention is to expand the airport, to allow more flights, to increase emissions, and to make it more difficult for people to live nearby. That is the purpose of this proposal.</p> <p pid="c.709.2/11">What is more, as <a href="/mp/?m=1602" title="Our page on Nick Raynsford - 'the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)'">Mr. Raynsford</a> pointed out, the same arguments will emerge next time. I have been in the House for a long time, and I have heard them all before. I have heard it said that we must have a fourth terminal, we must have a fifth terminal and we must have more capacity, because otherwise Heathrow will collapse, the British economy will collapse, and the world will collapse. That is not true, and the figures have to be fiddled to make that argument appear true. I realise that every time I look at the figures, and I hope that the Secretary of State will be honourable enough to look at them again.</p> <p pid="c.709.2/12">First, a calculation must be made on the basis that the airport is a place where people come in and go out. To make the figures work it is necessary to include both the number coming in and the number going out, but that is not what is actually happening: only one movement is involved. It is possible to halve the percentages, which is supposed to be so important, merely by getting the figures right. Then there is the comparison with rail travel. It is 13 times as sensible to travel to Paris by rail as it is to fly there, but the only way to contradict that statistic is to pretend that no one is on the train and everyone is on the aeroplane. If a full aeroplane of the most efficient kind is compared with a train containing one person in each carriage, it can indeed be proved that the aeroplane is more efficient. That is not a true representation of what is happening, but it is what must be done. The Government stand accused of being prepared to use any figures that are around to prove a case on which they have already decided.</p> <p pid="c.709.2/13">That leads me to the subject of the consultation, and, indeed, to the speech of the Secretary of State. Let me say frankly to him that it is not acceptable to turn to the House and argue that because the Government have met the requirements of 2003&#8212;even if they have not&#8212;the case has somehow been proved. The case that the Secretary of State must answer is this: how does he explain the expansion of Heathrow in terms of the commitments on climate change that are being considered at this moment in both <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houses_of_Parliament">Houses of Parliament</a>? How does he explain the expansion of Heathrow in terms of what will be the 2009 Copenhagen statement? What will the Secretary of State tell the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change that he should say when he goes to Copenhagen? I have written one or two speeches in my time, but I would not like to try to write that speech. What is more, I do not think that he would accept it.</p>            </div>

What is not reasonable, however, is to build a new airport in the Thames estuary to expand the airport facilities that we already have. There are two different arguments, and I am clearly on one side of both of them.</p> <p pid="c.712.3/2">I cannot understand why we do not take seriously the opportunities presented to us. Between a fifth and a quarter of flights out of London airports go to places that are already well served by the train and that get there within the same time scale. Why can we not remove those flights and, if necessary, use their slots for long-haul flights? Why is it still more expensive to land a long-haul flight than a short-haul flight? Why do we not take the issue of railway development seriously, and why have the Government no policy for high-speed rail? Why do we not allow the hypothecation of revenue&#8212;that very important issue&#8212;so that the present subsidy for aviation can be transferred to the railways? Why do we not have a joined-up transport policy?</p> <p pid="c.712.3/3">I believe that this <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> is capable of changing the face of British transport, but to do that he must stop the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Transport">Department for Transport</a> doing its usual thing&#8212;proceeding with road building until someone says no, and proceeding with airport building until someone says no.

I strongly endorse what he said about political leadership, and&#8212;I say this in as comradely a spirit as possible&#8212;I regret the tone of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>'s <a href="/glossary/?gl=30" title="The Opening Speech is the first speech in a debate.

Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)'">Mr. Randall</a>. Their constituencies stand to be devastated by the consequences of proceeding with the third Heathrow runway.</p> <p pid="c.712.4/3">I, too, have an emotional attachment to Heathrow. As I said in an <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> earlier, I was born in Bedfont, and many members of my family worked at Heathrow airport. For a number of years I was a cargo handler and union steward at Heathrow, and I know the area well. I know how important the airport is to the local economy; I know how an airport can drive a local economy, and how vital it can be to jobs. I know how much support Labour Members have from many of our colleagues who represent constituents containing regional airports that would have the potential to expand if Heathrow were not seen as the be-all and end-all of British aviation policy.</p> <p pid="c.712.4/4">I also speak as a signatory to early-day motion 2344, and, until I am told otherwise, as vice-chair of the Labour party group on the environment.</p> <p pid="c.712.4/5">Let me deal with the point about political leadership. I think I know where the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of members of my party stand on this issue. I think I know how proud we all are&#8212;with the exception of a few right-wing nutcases on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Benches&#8212;of the letters that we are receiving from members of the public, from members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wildlife_Fund">World Wildlife Fund</a> and Friends of the Earth, congratulating us on voting through the world's first climate change Bill. We take the advantages, and we take the praise and the plaudits, but we must not abuse that by negating much of the good work that we have done in this Chamber over previous months.</p> <p pid="c.712.4/6">The arguments in favour of a third runway are fundamentally flawed on three counts: the environment, surface access, and the organisation of Heathrow itself. There were clear commitments in the aviation <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> on surface access and the environmental consequences. I want to read into the record the following passage:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.712.4/7">"To tackle local impacts around airports, the White Paper prescribes a range of measures to be applied nationally and locally. These include new legislation and economic instruments as well as improved technology and stringent planning conditions attached to airport development. The Government's under-pinning objectives are to limit and, where possible, reduce noise impacts over time, to ensure air quality and other environmental standards are met, and to minimise other local environmental impacts."</p> <p pid="c.712.4/8">On surface access, the White Paper stated:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.712.4/9">"Increasing the proportion of passengers who get to airports by public transport can help reduce road congestion and air pollution. We expect airport operators to share this objective, and to demonstrate how they will achieve it in putting forward their proposals for developing new capacity."</p> <p pid="c.712.4/10">Let us consider surface access. I represent a constituency that is some 25 miles from Heathrow airport. I was a member of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Affairs_Committee">Northern Ireland Affairs Committee</a> in the late 1990s, and Committee members regularly caught the 9.05 flight to Belfast. To arrive at Heathrow on time, I would leave my house for what was a 25-minute journey at just before six o'clock in the morning, because that was the only way to beat the gridlock on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4">M4</a>. Why did I not take public transport? There is a public transport link, I suppose, if I want to travel 60 miles by journeying 40 miles into London and then 20 miles back out again.</p> <p pid="c.712.4/11">The former <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1990" title="Our page on Tom Harris - 'the Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris)'">Mr. Harris</a>, talked about Crossrail and the opportunities it provides, but the big flaw with Crossrail is that there is no western rail access into Heathrow. I work closely with <a href="/mp/?m=1700" title="Our page on Theresa May - 'the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)'">Mrs. May</a> and with the Thames Valley Economic Partnership. It represents the six major corporates in the Thames valley, which is the hub of the dynamic sub-regional economy; 23,500 jobs depend on those six corporates alone, and last year they spent upwards of &#163;12 million on taxi fares running clients backwards and forwards from Heathrow because there is no sensible public transport surface access from the Thames valley. That is complete nonsense.</p> <p pid="c.712.4/12"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Paper">The White Paper</a> gave the commitment that surface access must improve as a precondition of expanding the airport, but years later there is precious little evidence that we will see anything tangible. Before anyone cites Airtrack in reply, let me say that Airtrack is a slow route, and that it will not deliver what business needs by providing fast, efficient transport into <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Heathrow">London Heathrow</a> from the west.</p>            </div>

One can only imagine how much worse the situation will get if we increase capacity by up to 50 per cent.</p> <p pid="c.714.1/2">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> said we are not hitting European air quality targets now because of traffic and exhaust emissions. That will not wash. If we know that there will be a massive increase in exhaust emissions because of increasing capacity at Heathrow, how much further away will we be from delivering on our 2003 promise to comply with internationally agreed air quality targets? That is why the Government are already looking at a derogation from the 2015 directive.</p> <p pid="c.714.1/3">There are wider issues as well. There was talk of noise. I do not want to get into detailed discussion of the topic, but I remember as a youngster seeing people run screaming into their house when prop-engine planes such as Comets and Viscounts came so low over the roofs that eventually people could not take it any more&#8212;they had had enough. Living under a flight path is stressful. I am sure that is why I have a loud voice. Irrespective of property prices, we must think about quality of life.</p> <p pid="c.714.1/4">My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1584" title="Our page on Alan Keen - 'the Member for Feltham and Heston (Alan Keen)'">Alan Keen</a> talked about the contribution airport workers have made to the success of Heathrow airport, and that is true, but this is not about just getting a night's sleep. There are probably more workers working shift patterns around Heathrow airport than anywhere else. Any increase in numbers of flights and noise at any time of the day will disadvantage communities and family life and ruin the quality of life for many people.</p> <p pid="c.714.1/5">I have looked at the figures for flights in and out of London Heathrow. The last set I saw showed that about 475,000 flights use Heathrow each year, but some 100,000 are to destinations to which there are alternative means of travel, and about 100,000 are some of the short-haul hops that I suggest are not vital to sustain Heathrow airport as the nub of the sub-regional economy. Therefore, the argument that we need a better, rather than a bigger, Heathrow gains credence from these figures.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.717.0/1">It has been a depressing afternoon, and not solely for that reason.</p> <p pid="c.717.0/2">The Government appear to have made their mind up, despite evidence that the social cost will be enormous in Hillingdon, in Hayes and Harlington and across west London. Their sensitivity to this issue is reflected in the fact that although they pride themselves in carrying out the most "comprehensive" consultation&#8212;I think that was the adjective used by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>&#8212;we are yet to be given an assessment of the health impact, which is probably one of the biggest issues for my constituents, and an equality assessment, which is also important. A health impact assessment is not considered important enough to be in the mix to help us with this decision and this debate.</p> <p pid="c.717.0/3">The environmental cost has been touched on late in the debate, and I wish to say a word about it. Although we take pride in the process of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change_Bill">Climate Change Bill</a>, in which I was heavily engaged, we remain in the business of setting and monitoring targets, and the mechanics of all that. It is time for an "emperor's new clothes" moment, because we are failing and our emissions are rising. We are failing not only in this country, but across Europe. We have raised the bar to 80 per cent on emissions, but in the context of failure, we must acknowledge that the transport sector is the most stubborn one, and that within it, aviation is the fastest-growing source of emissions.</p> <p pid="c.717.0/4">The problem is that we will not get help from technology. Whereas we can just about see that car technology is on the brink of major change and that our children and grandchildren will drive something very different, fuelled by something very different, from what we drive, aviation is not the same, because we cannot see an alternative to kerosene. The fact that stock takes 20 years to pass through the system means that no technological solution is in sight, which gives us big policy challenges in managing this problem and in the degree to which we are prepared to manage demand. The Government have done really well on climate change on so many levels, but there has been a failure in their response in this area, because they are prepared to place just one chip on the table&#8212;emissions trading. That is so despite the evidence, which suggests that emissions trading, for the time that we have had it, has improved the mechanics of the process, but has been a failure in doing what it is meant to do, which is to reduce emissions. It has been a failure because there is so much political risk in the process; it is a haggle and a negotiation. It is a cap-and-trade scheme that is only as good as the cap, and that is the function of a political process.</p> <p pid="c.717.0/5">For the Secretary of State to say that things are going to be all right because the emissions trading scheme will sort them all out is not good enough. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commission">The Commission</a> has set out its stall on the parameters and the kind of cap that it is imagining. It is quite demanding and there will be costs to consumers, but you can bet your bottom dollar that the industry will pass them on to our constituents. The price of flying will rise, as will the price of carbon credits, because aviation will start trying to buy them in the market, and that will have implications for other industries. The point is that the negotiation process has not even started yet. The mother of all lobbies is about to be unleashed and it will take real political courage, which I do not see evident either here or on the continent, to assure us that the cap will be set at a meaningful level to help genuinely curb the growth in aviation emissions.</p> <p pid="c.717.0/6">The Government can slap themselves on the back for everything that they have done on climate change, and they can talk about how they are prepared to consider aviation within the targets, but it counts for nothing in the minds of our constituents when set against the decision to give a green light to the fastest-growing source of emissions. People simply do not understand that decision, and it makes a mockery of the whole climate change strategy.</p> <p pid="c.717.0/7">In that context, there needs to be a fantastic, overwhelming business case for taking such a decision&#8212;but there is not one. The case being made is pathetic. Even the advocates put forward only a small number of benefits, and the Government have not even bothered to do their own work. We hear long lectures about the importance of the hub model, without any reflection about whether that is the economic model that will survive for the next 10 or 15 years. My constituents do not understand what the national economic benefit is of a passenger arriving and then sitting in Heathrow airport waiting to catch another plane&#8212;although they can see the benefits to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a>. We are given a long solemn list of destinations that have been cancelled, but what my constituents and I are saying is, "Help us to understand just how important it is." Where is the Government modelling to help us understand the erosion of the hub and when it will bite in terms of affecting our competitiveness? Again, there has been silence, and no evidence has been provided.</p> <p pid="c.717.0/8">One thing that does matter in terms of the economic case is foreign direct investment, and whether companies will change decisions about whether to relocate in the UK in the light of the capacity of Heathrow. What matters is whether they will relocate because they cannot fly to where they want&#8212;but where is the evidence to suggest that that is happening? Other airports on the continent have grown during a period of fantastic prosperity for London, so where is the evidence that we face an abyss in terms of this business risk? We all know that the airport is not the only factor in business decisions. Many other factors shape business attitudes towards staying or locating in London, such as the tax environment, the regulatory environment and the quality of life. It is ironic, but many business executives are thinking about relocating their business because of the impact of noise pollution from Heathrow, let alone concerns about where they can or cannot fly.</p> <p pid="c.717.0/9">The voice of business that I hear does not say, "I can't get to where I want to go." It says, "Heathrow is a terrible airport, with an awful passenger experience." People want a better airport, not necessarily a bigger airport. In the light of that, we are forced to conclude that the Government's decision is rooted in the worst possible reasons, and is politically motivated. We can be confident in that judgment, because we had the most ridiculous political and partisan speech from the Secretary of State, which did neither his Department nor himself any credit. The decision is based on inadequate data, a discredited consultation process and a tremendous insensitivity to the reality of the climate change agenda, and it drives another nail into the coffin of public trust in our public institutions and the way in which we are governed. We have to be able to do better. I wholly support the call from the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington to step back and rethink.</p>            </div>

What the right hon. Gentleman was really saying was that building a third runway at Heathrow would be the end of this Government's commitment to the environment, and of our leadership in Europe. It was a millennial speech. But he makes that argument in the context of hubs all over Europe&#8212;not just the ones that have been mentioned, such as Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt and Schiphol, but Madrid, Copenhagen and others&#8212;increasing their capacity. Such contentions are absurd when viewed in that broader context.</p>            </div>

My right hon.

Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1525" title="Our page on Ann Clwyd - 'the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)'">Ann Clwyd</a> made the reasonable point that capacity exists throughout the regional airports. If we used all that capacity, we could have 10 times as many planes coming into this country. In theory, we could replace the routes that are duplicated at Heathrow, but that is not the economic reality. This Government and the previous Government&#8212;and the European Union&#8212;have increasingly liberalised the skies, so no one can tell planes where to land. They will go wherever they want, and there are fewer bilateral agreements all the time. It simply is not possible to say that too many flights from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> go to Heathrow, and to send five to Manchester, three to Birmingham and two to Glasgow.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.720.0/1">The hon. Gentleman asks for evidence. I shall give him a piece of what I believe to be evidence that has not been mentioned in this debate so far. Let us consider the air freight industry, and the two great world integrators of that industry&#8212;FedEx and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHL">DHL</a>. Where are their European hubs? They are at Brussels and Charles de Gaulle. We have missed that opportunity; those jobs have gone. Businesses that want to locate next to an integrator, because they need just-in-time, high-value widgets, have gone. Those hubs, and the jobs and relocations that go with them, have disappeared. We will not get them back. I hope that the hon. Gentleman finds that adequate evidence.</p> <p pid="c.720.0/2">The other points that I want to make come from my experience of representing the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> shareholder in Manchester airport and chairing the board at Manchester airport when it built the only extra runway that has been built in this country since the second world war. <a href="/mp/?m=1785" title="Our page on James Duddridge - 'The hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge)'">James Duddridge</a> looks surprised, but that is true.</p> <p pid="c.720.0/3">I do not blame any of my hon. Friends or any other hon. Member for doing their best to represent their constituents' interests when their lives will be affected by the building of a runway. That is the proper job of a <a href="/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a>. However, when we talked to people and carried out opinion polls, we found that even in the village that would be most badly affected by the second runway&#8212;Styal, in the second most affluent county in the country, Cheshire&#8212;there was majority support for the proposal. There were many headlines against it, but it had majority support. We were able to satisfy many of the environmental criteria.</p> <p pid="c.720.0/4">There is a detailed argument, which is often about cash. One of the people whose house was going to be affected by the second runway at Manchester fought the hardest battle. Her grandson was a barrister. At the end of the day, it came down to cash, and that barrister, who had fought a hard fight, went to work for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways">British Airways</a>, on the other side.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.720.2/1">No, I have given way twice.</p> <p pid="c.720.2/2">That is the detailed side of the argument, and there has to be a debate about those issues. My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1624" title="Our page on John McDonnell - 'the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)'">John McDonnell</a> said that this had become an iconic issue. I agree. It is iconic: it is symbolic of the role of aviation in the economy and the environment.</p> <p pid="c.720.2/3">The aviation industry makes a relatively small contribution to global warming. The figures given vary between 2, 3, 4 and 6 per cent., so it is increasing, and it is said that it will reach a certain level in 50 years' time. I do not trust any politician&#8212;because I have yet to meet a politician who can do differential equations&#8212;who talks about rates of change over a 42-year period. That is another absurdity. People say, "This will happen." And yet when it comes to the economy, we do not know what will happen next week.</p> <p pid="c.720.2/4">Aviation has become symbolic because of the way in which it is modern. We do not see the same level of savage attacks on the contribution to global warming made by the computers and services that are necessary to make the internet work. Those factors make a huge contribution to it, but we do not talk about them. I talked to the people who opposed the second runway in Manchester on many occasions, and when we went through all the improvements to the environment and all the damage that the 2 miles of concrete would do, I came to the conclusion that we were having a symbolic debate about the future of society in which it was not possible to convince people that aviation and modern technology was the way forward. I hope that my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> will bear that in mind.</p> <p pid="c.720.2/5">I do not think that the alternatives that have been proposed are realistic. Let us take as an example the proposal to build an airport out on the Thames estuary, with all the extra infrastructure and costs that that would require. My guess is that even without the airport, changing the roads, the railway tracks and the access routes would make a much greater contribution to global warming and greenhouse gases than anything else in the package. It took 25 years to build the new Munich airport, at a time when environmental standards were less stringent. Quite simply, the Thames estuary airport is not going to happen. It is on the agenda only because it was the Mayor of London who decided <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> policy&#8212;in the interests not of the country, or even of the Conservative party, but because he wanted votes in west London so that he would win the mayoral election. It was as simple as that, and the Conservative party should be ashamed of itself for allowing its policy to be tweaked like that during the mayoral election.</p> <p pid="c.720.2/6">I shall finish by making two points. Some people say that we cannot meet our climate change objectives but, even though such things are very difficult to predict, restricting Heathrow expansion is not the same as restricting emissions. We will merely be exporting them, just as we will be exporting jobs, and those emissions will come instead from Copenhagen, Schiphol or somewhere else. We will not make a contribution to the environment in that way.</p> <p pid="c.720.2/7">I shall conclude by stating that I agree with some of my hon. Friends that we should not be in this position. It is absolutely extraordinary that only one new runway has been built in this country over the past 60 years or so, and we are suffering as a result. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Transport">Department for Transport</a>, under different Governments, has seen BA and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a> as clients, even after privatisation. Because of that, it has not looked after the country's interest; instead, it has been advising those companies and looking after their interests. That is why complaints that I consider to be completely reasonable have been made about the commitments that have been made to the effect that there would be no third runway or fifth terminal.</p> <p pid="c.720.2/8">Those commitments were wrong. If this country is to make its way in the world economically, it needs a hub airport. I wish that that airport could be in Manchester, but it can really only be in west London. The hub is not going to be transferred. Had the people who planned it known what was going to happen in the 60 years since it was built, they would not have put it where they did, but it is where it is, this country needs it&#8212;and needs it to expand.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.721.0/1">Today's debate is not just about the future of Heathrow airport&#8212;whether it should get a third runway or whether we should introduce mixed mode&#8212;because we are talking about a judgment that will have a real and profound consequence for millions of Londoners. On Ministers' judgment will depend Londoners' day-to-day quality of life and, for some, even their health. I believe that people have a right to expect a reasonable quality of life, and that it is the Government's duty to respect that right and to protect public health.</p> <p pid="c.721.0/2">The Government have given the House the fantastical assurance that adding an airport the size of Gatwick on to Heathrow will somehow make it less noisy and polluting. Ministers assure us that Heathrow is a hub and that London's economy will be irrevocably damaged and threatened without expansion. However, neither case has been made, and I believe that Ministers are about to take a deeply reckless decision for whose consequences they will never be held personally accountable.</p> <p pid="c.721.0/3">Right at the beginning, the Government set important tests in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> on noise and, in particular, on air quality. They assured people that they would "bear down" on noise and meet EU air pollution limits but, as we have heard, on air pollution the simple fact is that the UK is already set to breach the EU's 2010 mandatory limits on NOx levels, and that is even before any extra flights are added.</p> <p pid="c.721.0/4">This afternoon, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> admitted that our country will have to apply for a three or five-year derogation when it comes to meeting the EU pollution limits. How on earth, then, can the Government consider expanding Heathrow, given that that would mean an even greater rise in NOx emissions? It simply defies common sense&#8212;nearly as much as do the fantasy planes that my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1500" title="Our page on Theresa Villiers - 'the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers)'">Mrs. Villiers</a> mentioned and which have been included in some of the modelling that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Transport">Department for Transport</a> claims proves that the proposal to expand Heathrow is possible.</p> <p pid="c.721.0/5">Suspension of disbelief seems to be a common thread in the Government's attitude to the environmental case for expanding Heathrow. Let us take the subject of noise. The "Attitudes to Noise from Aviation Sources in England" report, compiled by experts and commissioned by the Government, which took six years to complete, said that people were more sensitive to noise now than in the past, which undermines the historical 57 dB limit used by the Government. The Government simply ignored that report.</p> <p pid="c.721.0/6">My constituents will lose the half-day respite from aircraft noise that they so value. It is a crucial balance that all previous Governments have appreciated, yet the value of that half day does not feature anywhere in the economic case that the Government considered. All-day flights will make life in parts of London intolerable. Families and many other residents will simply want to leave.</p> <p pid="c.721.0/7">The increased pollution will come not just from more planes in the sky, but from more cars on the road&#8212;a lot more cars. The expanded Heathrow will handle more than 60 million more passengers. That will mean around 40 million more people travelling to and from the airport, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of whom will be on the roads. As we have heard, that raises the nightmarish prospect of a serious deterioration in air quality, with major health implications, chaos on London's roads, and a gridlocked <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4">M4</a> that will grind to a halt more often than it already does. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_London">West London</a> businesses and residents will face traffic hell. More planes, more cars, more pollution, more noise, a ruined quality of life&#8212;the environmental case for expansion simply does not stack up, and neither does the economic case.</p> <p pid="c.721.0/8">As we have heard, the Government's own figures say that the net present value of the economic benefit is &#163;5 billion. That includes &#163;3 billion of extra air passenger duty, but we would be hard pressed to find anyone in finance who would say that tax should be counted as an economic benefit. Of course, if we included the full costs of the extra missing emissions for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2">CO2</a>, it would add an extra &#163;5 billion cost, which would give the project a negative net present value; we all know that that is the reality.</p> <p pid="c.721.0/9">Of course, all the so-called key evidence on adding capacity has been generated by the Department for Transport and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a>, which, unlike the rest of us, seems to have had unfettered access to the process. I am afraid that throughout that process, Ministers have not been frank with Members of this House or with the public about the information that they have looked at, on which they based their decisions. When I have tried to get information, whether through parliamentary questions or freedom of information requests, so that we could have a level playing field, at every stage I have met resistance. I have made freedom of information requests to which it has taken seven months to get an initial substantive response.</p> <p pid="c.721.0/10">I was not the only one who was denied access to information. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Environment_Agency">The Environment Agency</a> was given no access to the detailed fact base that the Department for Transport had considered, so it is no wonder that the Environment Agency reached the chilling conclusion that there was a risk of increased morbidity and mortality if the Government went ahead with this reckless plan. Even the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs">Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</a> was kept out of the loop when it came to the environment. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFT">DFT</a> compiled its own assessment of the risk of expansion, called the risk register, yet when I met the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs">Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</a>, he was blissfully unaware of the existence of the document, let alone its contents.</p> <p pid="c.721.0/11">The risk register states that the risk of pollution mitigation measures failing to meet air quality targets is high, but did Ministers make sure that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFRA">DEFRA</a> was aware of that? No. Did Ministers make sure that that "high risk" assessment, made back in October, got into the public consultation document, so that the public and businesses were aware of the risk assessment and the dangers? No. We should put that "high risk" assessment of pollution mitigation measures failing into context: the same team that assessed that risk as high also considered the risk of terminal 5 being a botch job, leading to reputational damage. I am sure that hon. Members will be amazed to hear that the risk attached to that was low. Of course, we all know what actually happened. The Government have shown that they did not foresee the risk of national disgrace and embarrassment in the case of terminal 5, yet we are about to walk headlong into another disgraceful risk. However, the outcomes could be far worse, and irreversible.</p> <p pid="c.721.0/12">Concealing information and ignoring risks are all just part of the Government's consistently disingenuous attitude towards engaging with the public. That has pervaded all levels of the consultation process. At every stage of the modelling process, the Government's approach can best be described as "How can we fix the data to support our policy, and how can we twist the facts to get the result we want?"</p> <p pid="c.721.0/13">Let me give the House a couple of examples of the discussion. On tackling air pollution, a DFT airmail on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-28">28 March 2007</phrase> summarised the conclusions of a departmental meeting:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.721.0/14">"Moving the source"&#8212; the pollution&#8212;</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.721.0/16">"away from the receptor is the most effective mitigation".</p> <p pid="c.721.0/17">In other words, let us just have the pollution, but nowhere near places where it can be monitored.</p> <p pid="c.721.0/18">A Heathrow project board meeting minute of <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-16">16 April 2007</phrase> noted:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.721.0/19">"It was clear that moving NOx away from areas of exceedence was the most effective mitigation".</p> <p pid="c.721.0/20">Translation: "Don't worry about reducing pollution&#8212;just move it away from measuring equipment, and spread it out a bit so that it doesn't show up too much." Most compellingly, an e-mail from the DFT on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-10">10 August 2007</phrase> hit the nail on the head:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.721.0/21">"It looked like a hunt for a model&#8212;any model" that would give a green light. That is self-explanatory. It was never a hunt for the reality of what Heathrow expansion would do to the environment&#8212;that never entered the Government's thinking&#8212;but a hunt for a model to get the right answer. One team member was reported as saying:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.721.0/23">"It was a classic case of reverse engineering&#8212;it was awful."</p> <p pid="c.721.0/24">I agree.</p>            </div>

It is clear that there is no substance to their case, yet they pursue it. I have long since stopped wondering why they have gone down such a reckless route. Given the serious health and environmental impacts at stake, I find their attitude to the situation disgraceful. How can we trust Ministers who said that Heathrow expansion was sustainable, when we have seen the tactics they use and the evidence they have ignored in reaching their conclusions. The fact is that Heathrow expansion will leave many Londoners facing a toxic combination: more planes making more noise, causing more pollution; more cars clogging the roads, reducing air quality; and a public health risk that the Environment Agency says could lead to increased morbidity and mortality rates around the airport.</p> <p pid="c.724.1/2">Every day, I receive letters from constituents who are concerned about Heathrow expansion. They are worried and, as a resident who lives in Putney, I am worried. They believe that if we have all-day flights on a third runway, our part of London will become a place where families no longer want to bring up their children, and where people simply do not want to live. The noise will be so intolerable that I predict it will make people ill with its relentlessness. For my constituents, there will be no respite from aircraft noise ever again. It will be perpetual.</p> <p pid="c.724.1/3">In conclusion, the reality is that, economically, there are better alternatives to expansion. The economic benefits have been vastly overstated. Environmentally, expansion means more emissions and noise, and greater risks to health, not to mention safety. The Government are isolated on this issue, and Ministers must ask themselves what is more important&#8212;saving face and sticking with a bad decision, or having the courage to admit that this is wrong, and change course. It is time to listen to the 70,000 people, including my constituents, who responded with their grave concerns to the consultations. As far as they are concerned, with Heathrow, enough is enough.</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> that even approximates to the words, 'as pretty as an airport.'"</p> <p pid="c.725.0/3">That is particularly true of urban airports, of which Heathrow might be advanced as an exemplar. They are paradoxes, and they destroy lives, as we have just heard eloquently expressed, but they provide livelihoods, so nobody should approach the issue in a cavalier way and without considering balance. But, having considered balance, I must say that there is not the slightest doubt that this proposal for Heathrow should be opposed in this Chamber, implacably opposed outside this Chamber, will, I predict, be voted on in this Chamber, which is a point that I shall come to in a moment, and will be defeated in this Chamber. All those processes should be gone through.</p> <p pid="c.725.0/4">I should like to set out three simple premises. They have been mentioned before, and I regret that there will be repetition, but it is worth repeating these things&#8212;three simple premises that seem to me to be immutable. First, of course, Heathrow is in the wrong place. In 1946, the last Lancaster flew out of the site and the first converted Lancaster bringing passengers flew into the site, where they disembarked and sat in tents in armchairs, no doubt sipping glasses of champagne and smoking cigarettes through long, elegant holders. If one had said to those first passengers, "Do you know that from this site in barely half a century's time, we are proposing to fly 700,000 flights a year?", they would have looked around at the villages and said, "You are stark mad." But, of course, the madness persisted, and it persisted because of an irresistible and, apparently, irreversible process.</p> <p pid="c.725.0/5">The process was very simple: every expansion of Heathrow was used to reinforce the idea that Heathrow was indispensable. And that indispensability became the basis for every subsequent application and demand for expansion, so the process became circular, and it became never-ending. It is never-ending, and the villages in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> of my good and hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1624" title="Our page on John McDonnell - 'the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)'">John McDonnell</a> will be the first to go. But the truth is that nowhere is safe. I have a mental vision of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty">Her Majesty</a> herself standing on the battlements of Windsor castle, looking with angst-stricken eyes as the first bulldozers appear on the far side of Windsor Great park. Indeed, for those who know it, the royal ride through the centre of the park would make a splendid runway&#8212;apart from the statue of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III">George III</a> in the middle of it, which would have to be ritually removed.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.726.3/1">Absolutely. Heathrow is, of course, a curse and, in some ways, a blessing for those who live around it. Those who have lived around it&#8212;I declare an interest, because I have, to a greater or lesser extent, for 40 years, so I know about it&#8212;have come over the years to a sort of melioration, a sort of understanding, with the airport. It is based on certain concessions that have been made over the years. The Cranford agreement is one of them, but immensely important as well is the alternation of the runways. A failure to alternate runways will simply be the breaking of a bargain that has existed with Heathrow's neighbours for half a century, and it will change beyond repair the lives, and the dimension of the lives, of children and other people living in that area. The Government need to get on board, because raw anger will manifest not among a few privileged people but among 2 million people in London who will be exposed to that blight.</p> <p pid="c.726.3/2">The second premise that I wish to place before the House is a very simple one. In this day and age of climate change and the desperate fight to preserve our environment, it is a very simple premise: the days have long gone when we can destroy and despoil our environment to create a non-essential improvement in human lifestyle. Of course, there can be essential improvements in lifestyle; as we all know, they exist in the third world. In such circumstances, some compromise with the environment may be necessary, but not here&#8212;not to enhance the lifestyles of people, frequently mentioned by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>, who travel to visit their relatives. That is not a reason for the kind of damage being contemplated.</p> <p pid="c.726.3/3">As has been said, the Government are now in an extraordinary position. Two weeks ago, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Energy_and_Climate_Change">Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change</a> came to the House and, amid justified adulation and approval, gave the best and most outstanding undertakings on the environment in the world. Two weeks later, his <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> colleague, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Transport">Secretary of State for Transport</a>, has come to the House and wrecked them. We are told that there is <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">division</a> in the Cabinet&#8212;such information must be highly unreliable of course, because, as we know, the Cabinet is a leak-proof zone. However, we are told that there are deep Cabinet divisions on this issue. That is hardly surprising: when one Secretary of State wrecks another's policy, there will be such division from time to time. Let us hope that it is resolved sensibly and properly.</p> <p pid="c.726.3/4">The third premise is the myth of demand and the idea that it should be assuaged in these circumstances. That demand is not atavistic or fundamental&#8212;it does not relate to food, drink or even the desire to procreate. It is based on the preference of people who wish to fly. That is all. Manifestly, that demand can be managed and controlled. It is, to use a word employed by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros">George Soros</a> in relation to the economy, a "reflexive" demand&#8212;that is, it increases according to the capacity used to feed it, and it will recede as that capacity goes away. Such demand must be addressed, but it must also be sensibly managed. One citizen must understand that their right to fly is not immutable, and cannot be predicated on the destruction of other people's lifestyles.</p> <p pid="c.726.3/5">Finally, I turn to Cliffe airport, which was to have been in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>. It was one of the potential airports in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> and the consultation. Let me say this: Cliffe was never a sensible option, and it was never thought to be. I shall say how I know that. We all thought it all the time, but immediately after the consultation the former <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, Mr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair">Tony Blair</a>, came to my constituency and helpfully said so. It was never a sensible or real option. It began to look like a real option only for a moment on one occasion. That was when I was talking to the former Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> about the subject at the beginning of the consultation, and told him that even putting Cliffe in as a proposal would make it likely that we would lose my parliamentary seat. For a moment, I saw a thought flash across his mind as he contemplated virtues that he had not previously seen.</p> <p pid="c.726.3/6">There will be a vote on this issue; the Government will not avoid that. <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">This place</a> is not so enfeebled or lacking in creativity that we cannot find the means to have a vote, and we will have it. I say to the Secretary of State that when that vote comes, the Government will lose it&#8212;and with it, their new-found and deserved reputation for environmental custody. That will be terrible, not only because of the loss of that reputation, but in electoral terms. I hope that the Secretary of State and the Government will take that on board.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.727.0/1">It is a great pleasure to take part in this debate. We have heard some high-quality contributions in which the common factor, in almost every case, has been <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> to the expansion of Heathrow; in fact, I have heard only one Back-Bench speech in favour. I agree with <a href="/mp/?m=1709" title="Our page on Robert Marshall-Andrews - 'the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews)'">Mr. Marshall-Andrews</a>&#8212;if there were a vote on the proposal, I would very much expect it to be defeated.</p> <p pid="c.727.0/2">I have always been a pragmatist as regards Heathrow. I am not necessarily opposed to its expansion, but I would always look to see whether the net overall effect on the environment was neutral or positive before supporting that proposal. I used to be an admirer of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a>. In the early 1990s, I used to fly an awful lot, transatlantically and domestically within the United States, and I was always impressed by how BAA managed its airports and its customers. Regrettably, those days are long gone. For me, the fading gold and black graphics in BAA airports sum up what has happened to the company: it has not really achieved anything since its heyday in the early '90s.</p> <p pid="c.727.0/3">Heathrow brings some benefits to my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>&#8212;I have met quite a few constituents who work at the airport; my constituents use it a great deal for the purposes of air travel; and one of the reasons <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammersmith_and_Fulham">Hammersmith and Fulham</a> has been attractive to businesses over the years is its location between Heathrow airport and central London. Nevertheless, the airport has become a major issue in my constituency, but I try to approach the whole question rationally. However, having considered all the benefits and disbenefits, I have come to believe that, on balance, the current set of proposals is most detrimental to my constituency.</p> <p pid="c.727.0/4">My local council is awaiting the result of the official consultation, but it decided to send out its own consultation document. So far, some 4,000 residents have responded. Incredibly, 93 per cent. of those responses are against expansion. Only 6 per cent. are in favour, with a mere 1 per cent. undecided. I praise my local council, which had a change of policy when the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> took over in 2006. It joined the 2M group and became very active in campaigning against Heathrow expansion.</p> <p pid="c.727.0/5">The proposals would have seven main effects on my constituency: extra flights, new flight paths overhead, noise pollution, air pollution, safety implications, night flights and the impact of a larger Heathrow on public and private transport in west London. On extra flights, the case has already been made. There is talk of an increase to 480,000 or 500,000, or perhaps to 700,000.</p> <p pid="c.727.0/6">On new flight paths, in Fulham, where both flight paths go over, the loss of runway alternation on the two existing runways would mean aircraft coming in overhead for a much longer part of the day, as there would be no changeover at 3 pm. Aircraft could join the new approach flight path for the third runway over Fulham. Because of the reduced length of the third runway, it is likely that most of the bigger, noisier planes would come in over Fulham using the existing full-length runways. In Hammersmith, which is not currently directly under either flight path, the approach to the third runway would add hugely to noise there, with perhaps an aircraft every 90 seconds or so. That would impact on people who generally are not directly affected by aircraft noise. The ending of runway alternation together with the addition of the third runway, or even their separate use, would be a total disaster for my constituents. Families living below would endure noise for 18 hours a day rather than nine, as at present.</p> <p pid="c.727.0/7">On noise pollution, an estimated 1 million people live, work and go to school in west London and the Heathrow area, and they are already exposed to noise levels that are above the limits for annoyance laid down by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organisation">World Health Organisation</a>. Research shows that noise pollution from planes dominates areas up to 13 miles away from Heathrow, which would include Hammersmith and Fulham.</p> <p pid="c.727.0/8">We have already heard that Government are in breach of the air quality <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> and have been threatened with fines by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=234" title="The European Commission is the politically independent institution that..." class="glossary">European Commission</a>. Indeed, there was an article in today's edition of the <i> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evening_Standard">Evening Standard</a></i> about the Commission becoming active and interested in the subject again.</p> <p pid="c.727.0/9">I am genuinely worried for my children, and my constituents' children, who have to live in an environment where the air quality is as poor as it is in London. London has the highest annual average level of nitrogen dioxide of any capital city, not only in western Europe, but eastern Europe as well. An increase in air movement would inevitably be disastrous for our air quality.</p> <p pid="c.727.0/10">The Government say that extra aircraft and road traffic will not necessarily prevent them from meeting their air quality targets around the airport. But that is because they have assumed that a new generation of aircraft will be cleaner than those currently flying and that road vehicles will be far less polluting. If technological improvements in engine design and fuels are not as successful as the Government hope, pollution levels will be higher in the immediate vicinity of the airport, and further afield, including in Hammersmith and Fulham. If the Government are wrong, the health and life expectancy of people all over west London will suffer.</p> <p pid="c.727.0/11">Heathrow has a very good safety record, but increasing the number of take-offs and landings over such densely populated areas can only increase the risk of a serious accident, especially when London already has some of the most complex airspace in the world. It is a bizarre system that has thousands of planes flying directly over this country's largest conurbation and some of its most densely populated areas.</p> <p pid="c.727.0/12">The issue of night flights is ongoing, despite the Government having agreed to extend the cap until 2012. My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1771" title="Our page on Justine Greening - 'the Member for Putney (Justine Greening)'">Justine Greening</a> and I had a meeting with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways">British Airways</a> a couple of years ago, where it tried to explain why it needed night flights. It all related to the convenience of passengers, particularly those boarding planes in places such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> and Singapore, who had to board a plane before midnight. If they could not arrive at 4, 5 or 6 am, they would have to arrive at 7 or 8 am, which would mean boarding a plane in Singapore or Hong Kong after midnight. That is clearly an inconvenience, but we are talking about having a sense of balance and proportion. We have to weigh up the convenience of those few hundred thousand passengers who board planes in Hong Kong or Singapore against the convenience of the millions of people under flight paths in west London or places such as Windsor. The Government have got it entirely wrong.</p> <p pid="c.727.0/13">On public and private transport in west London, it seems incredible that the Government might be proposing an increase in capacity at Heathrow without considering an increase in capacity in our public transport links. Earlier this year, I had a meeting with the managers of the Piccadilly line in which I tried to lobby them to have the line stop at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenscourt_Park">Ravenscourt Park</a> and/or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Brook">Stamford Brook</a> in my constituency. I was persuaded that there was a strong argument against my proposal, partly because of capacity on the Piccadilly line, the usage of which has gone up enormously since the millennium&#8212;about a 50 per cent. increase, with the line now running at 97 per cent. of capacity. That has occurred despite the introduction of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Express">Heathrow Express</a>, which might have been expected to relieve the Piccadilly line to some extent. We have to do something about public and private transport provision because there will be a detrimental impact on the working lives of my constituents who are trying to board the Piccadilly line if it is already full. I represent more tube passengers than any other <a href="/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a>.</p> <p pid="c.727.0/14">Finally, on some of the solutions, I agree with the approach of considering high-speed rail. Every year or so I buy the "Thomas Cook European Railway Timetable". That is not because I am a trainspotter, but because I genuinely love going by rail. Every year I see in the map at the front of the book the expanding network of high-speed rail lines going through other countries, such as France, Spain and Germany. High-speed rail is very much the future for this country. I commend our policy on that, and I am very much opposed to the proposals on Heathrow expansion.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.730.0/1">To revert to an earlier theme, I am not embarrassed to represent my constituents on the matter that we are discussing. Indeed, I would be embarrassed not to do so. More than 1,000 of my constituents in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W4">W4</a> attended a meeting in Chiswick earlier this year to protest as part of the consultation, and more than 800 of my current and prospective constituents in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W12">W12</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W6">W6</a> attended a meeting at Hammersmith town hall, at which I spoke.</p> <p pid="c.730.0/2">I have received literally thousands of e-mails and letters on the subject and I cannot recall one of them being in favour of the expansion of Heathrow&#8212;and, with the exception of correspondence from the Mayor of London, I cannot recall one of them calling for the closure of Heathrow. Although those people are angry, their requests are reasonable and I hope that the Government will listen to them. They essentially ask the Government to think again about the proposal to expand Heathrow and, before making a decision, to reconsider the out-of-date and unreliable information on which they currently propose to act.</p> <p pid="c.730.0/3">As for the Government, little appears to have changed since the 2003 <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> on the subject, yet, on the ground, almost everything has changed. Environmental concerns and policy, and planning policy have changed, the ownership of the London airports is in the process of changing and, thanks to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_Commission">Competition Commission</a> report, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a> monopoly will be broken. Not only the economic climate, but the challenges to the economic case for Heathrow expansion have changed. Politics has also changed. By that, I do not simply mean the Conservative party's volte face, which, although welcome as far as it goes, is expressed in shallow and rather questionable terms. Like my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1624" title="Our page on John McDonnell - 'the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)'">John McDonnell</a>, I mean the absolute groundswell across not only west London but a much wider area, and a coalition of interest that has not been seen previously, which challenges Government policy on the matter.</p> <p pid="c.730.0/4">Given the time available, I hope that I shall not repeat points that have already been made, but I will make a couple of points about the harm that the proposal would cause my constituents and others in west London. A good article in <i> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist">The Economist</a> </i>last week stated that,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.730.0/5">"Heathrow makes more people miserable than just about any other big developed-country airport."</p> <p pid="c.730.0/6">That is true not just because of air quality and noise, which have been covered at length. Thousands of people in Chiswick, Hammersmith and Shepherd's Bush have not experienced those problems to a great extent, but will suffer from them significantly and continually if the third runway is built.</p> <p pid="c.730.0/7">The Piccadilly line has been mentioned. I recently had a meeting with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground">London Underground</a>, after it wrote to me about reconfiguring its services on the Piccadilly line. We all know what that means. As it explained to me, it means longer gaps between trains to fulfil timetable commitments. On interrogation, it became clear that that is partly due to the current expansion of Heathrow&#8212;too many people already use the Piccadilly line. Yet we read in one of the briefings that was sent to us today that, although capacity on the Piccadilly line will increase by 20 per cent. by 2015, the consultation document on Heathrow claims that expansion requires a 39 per cent. increase on the London underground, making the current position untenable.</p> <p pid="c.730.0/8">My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1774" title="Our page on Martin Salter - 'the Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter)'">Martin Salter</a> spoke about the problems of surface access. That is true of not only the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4">M4</a> but local road networks across west London. Anybody who tries to drive around Shepherd's Bush following the opening of the Westfield shopping centre will find that there is no room for major infrastructure developments on the current road network in west London. Contrary to what my local councillors seem to think, with their grandiose schemes for commercial development, the capacity simply does not exist in that area.</p> <p pid="c.730.0/9">Alternatives to Heathrow have not been properly examined. We have heard that growth in aircraft size will effectively expand the capacity within existing planning constraints by 30 per cent. by 2030, yet that does not appear to be enough for BAA, BA and other large airlines. A broad coalition includes people from extreme unrepentant environmentalists to those who would be perfectly prepared to countenance airport expansion, but believe that, if airports in the south-east are to be expanded, Heathrow is the last airport one would consider for such expansion. Again, I quote the article in <i> The Economist</i>:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.730.0/10">"Expanding Gatwick is not without difficulties, but these are trivial compared with those at Heathrow."</p> <p pid="c.730.0/11">Why on earth would we look to Heathrow for the major expansion of airport provision in the south-east, given its position and the misery that it causes in a predominantly built-up area?</p> <p pid="c.730.0/12">There is some capacity in high-speed rail, but the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> do themselves a disservice by saying that their plan to build a high-speed link to Leeds-Bradford would solve the problems of Heathrow expansion, when it would in fact take no more than 3 per cent. of current capacity out of the equation. Let us try to be realistic. We should work in a cross-party fashion, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington suggested, but that is simply not happening.</p> <p pid="c.730.0/13">London is a five-airport city that, on current planning constraints, has the potential to go from 137 million passengers to 210 million by 2030 without the planned additional runway. The comparisons that the Government have made with hub airports on the continent do not stack up. There is no airport in a similar location to Heathrow or with the same number of charter and low-cost flights, which could be more appropriately directed elsewhere. I do not believe that the argument about transfer passengers stands up to scrutiny in the long term either, when so many people prefer to take direct flights from regional or other London airports.</p> <p pid="c.730.0/14">This has been a good debate, with the exception, I am afraid to say, of the contributions from those on the Government and official <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Front Benches. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conservatives">The Conservatives</a> have performed an extraordinary volte-face over the past couple of months, standing the policy that they have supported for so long on its head. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I see Opposition Members shaking their heads, but exactly a year ago <a href="/mp/?m=1500" title="Our page on Theresa Villiers - 'the hon.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.732.0/1">I gather that <a href="/mp/?m=1559" title="Our page on Andrew Slaughter - 'the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter)'">Mr. Slaughter</a> is a regular sparring partner of my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1610" title="Our page on Greg Hands - 'the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands)'">Mr. Hands</a>, who spoke before him. The hon. Gentleman led <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammersmith_and_Fulham">Hammersmith and Fulham</a> council and my hon. Friend led the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a>, but such is the proposal that the Government are likely to table that they are now making common cause. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> is to be congratulated on bringing together this Molotov-Ribbentrop-style pact across the Chamber against his proposal. What is motivating this atmosphere of reconciliation in the House? First, I sense that there is an atmosphere of betrayal&#8212;that is a theme that I draw out of the debate. Betrayals have happened over many years, but it is now a betrayal over alternative runways and the third runway at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Heathrow">London Heathrow</a>. That is where I come into the debate.</p> <p pid="c.732.0/2">As a callow youth in the early 1980s, just down from university, I was elected to Matching parish council during the public inquiry on Stansted. The outcome was that we were promised a cap of 15 million passengers per year. As time has passed, that assurance has been betrayed, just like all the other assurances that Governments of both parties have ever made about airports policy in the south-east, to comfort their way through the planning process. We are now looking at the prospect of 35 million passengers a year&#8212;or even 65 million passengers a year&#8212;and not one but two runways at Stansted.</p> <p pid="c.732.0/3">This is the story that colours the development of London airports. An extraordinary industry has been built up successfully, but from cottage industry airports dotted unsatisfactorily around London. The Government now confront extraordinary choices if they wish to continue with the present policy.</p> <p pid="c.732.0/4">Now, as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a> for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Essex">North Essex</a>, I represent <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedham_Vale">Dedham Vale</a>, which is already suffering the depredations of overflying from Stansted. There has already been a substantial legal case involving moving the overflights to a different part of the country, but I fear for Dedham Vale, which has been designated an area of outstanding natural beauty particularly because of its tranquillity. If Stansted is allowed to expand, the noise pollution in Dedham Vale will continue.</p> <p pid="c.732.0/5">The second theme of the debate that comes over strongly is that, if we had the choice, we would not start from here, and London's major hub international airport would not be where it is today. I commend the tremendous speech by <a href="/mp/?m=1602" title="Our page on Nick Raynsford - 'the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)'">Mr. Raynsford</a>. I do not need to repeat in the limited time available many of the things that he rightly said about the merits of reopening the consideration of a Thames estuary airport. Let me say that the debate is not necessarily about continuing the expansion of capacity, but about the creation of viable capacity and asking whether we are going to expand capacity.</p> <p pid="c.732.0/6"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mayor_of_London">The Mayor of London</a>'s proposal has invited a certain amount of derision from some quarters in the Chamber this evening. However, I believe that he is absolutely right to help to reopen the consideration of a Thames estuary airport. He is taking the matter extremely seriously. He has done what the Government failed to do, namely to appoint a proper person to investigate the viability of the proposal. I have a copy of the Government's consideration of Thames estuary airports for the 2003 <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>. It consists of one report, on a mere 22 pages, that considers five or six different sites. It was clearly a desktop exercise. There has never been proper consideration of many of the sites that should now be in play.</p> <p pid="c.732.0/7">The Mayor has appointed Doug Oakervee to conduct a preliminary inquiry. As the Secretary of State knows, he is chairman of the Crossrail consortium. He also has an unrivalled record in airport construction. He is a civil engineer and, believe it or not, he was the project manager for the construction of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> international airport, which is on an offshore island. That was a British project. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_British">The British</a> built Hong Kong international airport, yet the Secretary of State says that it is impossible for us to build our own island airport. Mr. Oakervee will consider all the issues, not least the possibility of a new north-south link between Kent and Essex; the opportunity to re-orient the whole development of London to the east, which successive Governments have tried for many years to do, for example through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Gateway">Thames Gateway</a>; and enabling 24-hour operation without overflying a single residence. Just think about that&#8212;not a single home will be disturbed by overflying to or from a Thames estuary airport. We should compare that to the absolute lunacy of disturbing millions of people every night as planes overfly so many residential homes near the various London airports.</p> <p pid="c.732.0/8">I invite the House to reflect on one final theme. What we have heard in tonight's debate is enough to confirm that the third runway at Heathrow will never happen. We have heard about the falsification of evidence designed to get the project to comply with already crumbling environmental requirements, which shows that this is nothing more than the Government parading their pro-business credentials in a very aggressive way to curry favour with certain quarters in the business community. This project will never happen.</p> <p pid="c.732.0/9">I see the Secretary of State <a href="/glossary/?gl=145" title="Of a male MP, sitting on his regular seat in the House. For females, &quot;in..." class="glossary">in his place</a>; he must be regretting the tone he struck in his most unfortunate speech earlier this afternoon. He must be thinking that he will not be here to see this third runway opening; he will not be where he is sitting today and he will not have the responsibilities he has now. He will not even see the first sod of earth turned on this new project, which is miles down the track. This is a pre-election exercise. My goodness, if <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson">Boris Johnson</a>'s proposal was window-dressing, what is this in comparison? I doubt that it will happen.</p> <p pid="c.732.0/10">Once the nail has finally been driven through the heart of this proposal and once it becomes clear that constraints on the expansion of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted are fixed by public opinion, which does not want airport capacity so close to where people live, the proposal for a Thames estuary airport so ably floated by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich&#8212;and, perhaps not so ably, but just as vehemently by me&#8212;will move rapidly up the agenda as the only viable alternative, providing a real hub international airport to the east of London. That will be to the benefit of this country and, I believe, the whole of Europe.</p>            </div>

I understand that he has not had time to be fully briefed on all the weaknesses in the Government's position on noise, but his reply to the perfectly reasonable interjection by <a href="/mp/?m=1709" title="Our page on Robert Marshall-Andrews - 'the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews)'">Mr. Marshall-Andrews</a> was astonishing. He suggested that he was going to apply the same criteria to the possibility of ending runway alternation as he was going to apply to the prospect for a third runway. That was truly astonishing, as one issue is about levels of noise and the other is about the crucial matter of timing: they are completely different.</p> <p pid="c.734.0/3"><a href="/mp/?m=1624" title="Our page on John McDonnell - 'The hon.

Not only is it our fifth biggest industry; it provides opportunities for businesses and ordinary families of which our grandparents never dreamt. The second proposition is that we all want to make Heathrow a successful airport of which we can be proud. Where we disagree is on the question of how to balance the case for extra capacity presented by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a> and a number of airlines&#8212;and still, for a little bit longer, it seems, by the Government&#8212;against the huge environmental price to be paid by the local area, the wider region and the globe. The hints that we have been given by the Secretary of State in the media recently and what was said at the BAA conference&#8212;welcome as those comments are&#8212;suggest that the Government are suddenly warming to the idea of high-speed rail, but they also seem to involve a degree of selective amnesia.</p> <p pid="c.734.0/10">We have argued that high-speed rail could replace a significant chunk of Heathrow flights. The Government and BAA now respond by saying that we should have both, but that was not the position even a few months ago. As recently as March <a href="/mp/?m=1990" title="Our page on Tom Harris - 'the hon. Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris)'">Mr. Harris</a>, the then Under-<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Transport">Secretary of State for Transport</a>, confirmed that not a single official in the Department was working on high-speed rail proposals. Indeed, until a few months ago, BAA was still committed to a programme of redevelopment of its terminals 1 to 4 and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth">Queen Elizabeth</a> building which, had it gone ahead as planned, would have involved the Airtrack route through Feltham&#8212;which has pluses and minuses&#8212;but would have ruled out for a generation the proper construction of the Heathrow hub that is at the heart of our proposal.</p> <p pid="c.734.0/11">Today, passengers at Heathrow can take a train directly to very few major United Kingdom destinations. Either they must climb on to a frequently crowded underground train to reach a station where they can change to a train that can take them somewhere, or they must take the purpose-built <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Express">Heathrow Express</a> route to Paddington. Then, to reach most destinations, they must take an underground train or taxi to another terminus from which they can travel to their eventual destination. We say that that they should be able, in the terminal, to climb straight on to a high-speed train to the north of England or to Europe, or directly access the rail system to the west&#8212;including, Cardiff, for which the right hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynon_Valley">Cynon Valley</a> made such a strong case, and, indeed, Reading.</p> <p pid="c.734.0/12"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State has made hints. If he wants to intervene, he is welcome to do so. So far he has been remarkably reluctant to challenge any of the attacks made on his alleged facts. The Government are welcome to move to our view on high-speed rail, but it is incredible for them to pretend that it was their policy a few months ago or even that they were looking at it seriously.</p> <p pid="c.734.0/13">It is very sad that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association">International Air Transport Association</a> report of 2008 picked out Heathrow alone of all airports in the world for special mention for overcharging. Some of its problems are undoubtedly related to runway overcrowding, but not one of the issues for which BAA plc was slated by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Authority">Civil Aviation Authority</a> a fortnight ago was related to runway capacity. They ranged from lack of lounge seating to slow provision of disembarkation piers to dirty facilities, strengthening the case for the break-up of BAA, to which a number of Members have alluded.</p> <p pid="c.734.0/14">Another area that needs to be addressed to make the airport better is security. My noble Friend Baroness Neville-Jones is carrying out a comprehensive study on security, which, by learning lessons from best practice abroad, should both improve security and reduce unnecessarily burdensome queues. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAA">CAA</a> has rightly highlighted that and threatened fines over it.</p> <p pid="c.734.0/15">The Government have been unwilling to focus on the issues affecting either local or global environments. Locally, people face serious problems with nitrogen dioxide, noise and mounting road congestion, which in turn feeds back into still further NOx problems. The Secretary of State has confirmed that NOx readings in excess of those set by the EU for 2010 have already been taken, and that is with existing levels. They are outlined in a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs">Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</a> document published last year, and the Environment Agency has pointed to:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.734.0/16">"The potential for increased morbidity and mortality over a dense local population."</p> <p pid="c.734.0/17">It took a Greenpeace freedom of information request for this information to be dug out.</p> <p pid="c.734.0/18">As my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1500" title="Our page on Theresa Villiers - 'the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers)'">Mrs. Villiers</a> pointed out, both the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4">M4</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M25">M25</a> suffer from severe congestion, as do many of the lesser roads in west London. Congestion is bad for drivers and bad for business, and, of course, it contributes to NOx. I ask Members to imagine adding the equivalent of Gatwick to the existing Heathrow operation, and then let us remember how much bigger aircraft are getting. Many extra passengers will be arriving, a high proportion of them by car&#8212;more than 60 per cent. if present patterns continue.</p> <p pid="c.734.0/19">Time does not permit me to rehearse all the arguments made about noise, but my hon. Friend presented a devastating case. There is the brushing aside of the ANASE&#8212;Attitudes to Noise from Aviation Sources in England&#8212;study, and the fictitious aircraft that nobody is planning to build that plays such a big role in the profiling. Let me add one point. BAA has not helped itself by the stinginess of its insulation scheme. Boeing operates a useful website comparing the performance of various airports in this regard, and it shows Heathrow to have one of the stingiest arrangements in the world. Indeed, if Heathrow were to adopt tomorrow the approach voluntarily adopted by City airport, it would be insulating buildings as far away as Kensington. However, insulation is not the main issue. The plan for this scale of expansion, combined with the threat of an end to runway alternation, represents a potentially devastating blow to the peace and enjoyment of hundreds of thousands of people.</p> <p pid="c.734.0/20">There is not sufficient time to go back over the arguments on climate change, and after several excellent contributions, particularly that of my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal, I do not think I need to do so. We cannot on the one hand say, "We want to lead globally on this"&#8212;which all the main parties agree on&#8212;and then on the other hand say, "We are going to build this extra runway." The arguments on the other side are twofold. First, it is said that the aviation industry requires this expansion if Heathrow is to remain a world-class airport. It is certainly true that Heathrow has lost a small number of its thinnest routes in the past decade, but it remains connected to 180 airports, and eliminating some short-haul connections&#8212;not just the 3 per cent. to Manchester and Leeds, but also those to Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam as the high-speed rail link kicks in&#8212;will release some spare capacity. When slots are changing hands for tens of millions of pounds, nobody will persuade me that Heathrow is close to the edge.</p>            </div>

Friend.</p> <p pid="c.737.1/2">The wider issue that is constantly put forward is of a threat to the British economy. Let us remember that a recent presentation from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Matters">Flying Matters</a> conceded that only 36 per cent. of passengers are business passengers.

We have to make that decision against a background of climate change.</p> <p pid="c.737.1/3">Through a high-speed rail alternative, our plans offer some of the growth that the economists want, a much better connected journey for passengers, a railway system fit for the modern era, protection of the local environment and a worthwhile step on climate change.

Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> said that he was well aware that the topic of Heathrow would arouse strong opinions in today's debate, and clearly he was not wrong. Heathrow plays a key role in the country's economy, as was made clear in the 2003 <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> and in the Eddington study, and its importance has been reinforced again today. The economic arguments demonstrate that the capacity of the airport requires the level of attention and scrutiny that is rightly being given to the issue in this debate, and in the many steps that have brought us to this point. I acknowledge that a number of contributions have challenged the Government's economic case, and I shall return to that. However, it is our stated position that Heathrow is vital, as the UK's only hub airport, not only to the economy of London or of the south-east alone, but to the country as a whole. Aviation in the UK delivers &#163;11 billion of economic benefits, employing 200,000 people directly; Heathrow employs 100,000 directly and indirectly.</p> <p pid="c.738.0/2">With regard to Heathrow, we must consider the serious questions of environmental impact. It is right that any decision we make on Heathrow must take into account all our responsibilities as a Government, including those we owe to the environment and to the people who live and work around the airport.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.738.2/1">I have less than 15 minutes to respond to a six-hour debate, so if I have time at the end, I will come back to my hon. Friend.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/2">To that end, I hope that the House accepts that we are making great efforts to involve as many people and organisations as possible, at every level, in what has been a lengthy and exhaustive consultative exercise. We have been clear that any development would depend on the strict environmental criteria being met; again, a huge amount of work has been carried out in that area.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/3">I turn to some of the points raised in the debate. <a href="/mp/?m=1500" title="Our page on Theresa Villiers - 'The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers)'">Mrs. Villiers</a> claims that we are scrapping alternation. I am sure that she knows we are consulting on that, as we are on the Cranford agreement and westerly preference, as well as on the crucial question of the third runway. She says that we have no plans on surface access, but my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> mentioned Crossrail, the improved Piccadilly line and Airtrack, to name just a few. On her allegations of collusion and reverse engineering, she knows, because we have discussed this before, that we need to lay down restrictions within which the airport must operate.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/4">The 2003 <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> clearly stated that the airport operator, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a>, should work with the Government, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Authority">Civil Aviation Authority</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATS">NATS</a> to develop proposals consistent with conditions laid down by the Government. It would not have been sensible or possible to attempt that work without the technical and operational expertise of the airport operator. BAA was therefore asked to advise on how operations at the airport might need to be adjusted or aircraft movement numbers lowered to help meet environmental constraints.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/5">The hon. Lady also claimed that the Government invented the 450-seater plane to meet the Heathrow challenge. The aircraft in question was assumed to be a stretched version of an existing aircraft, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_777">Boeing 777</a>-300, and to be due to enter service some time after 2020. It is a fairly standard approach by manufacturers to extend the life of an original design by upgrading it in this fashion over time.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/6">The hon. Lady said that the forecasts for 2003 were not still valid. In 2007, revised air traffic forecasts were published alongside the consultation. Further updates will be provided at the time of the decision later this year.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/7">On the economic arguments, the hon. Lady claimed a negative impact on local prosperity and housing prices. However, that was disputed by other Conservative Members. She also claimed that there would be no effect on Heathrow if present levels were continued, but my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State clearly spelt out both the reduced number of destinations being served by Heathrow, the increasing number of UK residents flying to the continent to connect, and the reduction in access from regional airports.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/8">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-29">29 September</phrase> that a full high-speed rail network could add &#163;60 billion to the UK's wealth, with &#163;5.2 billion for Birmingham. Earlier this year, Atkins estimated benefits of just over &#163;60 billion over a 60-year period for a full network of high-speed lines at a cost of approximately &#163;30 billion&#8212;not the benefits associated with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a>' scheme.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/9"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Opposition">The Opposition</a> also claim that a high-speed rail link could replace up to 66,500 flights a year and free almost a third of the capacity that would be provided by a third runway. The total number of flights from Manchester and Leeds-Bradford was less than 3 per cent. of Heathrow's total flights&#8212;approximately 13,000 over the past 12 months. Even if the capacity of every flight from Manchester and Leeds-Bradford were transferred to a new high-speed rail line, Heathrow would still be operating at 97 per cent. capacity.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/10">My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1624" title="Our page on John McDonnell - 'the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)'">John McDonnell</a> said that this decision was about BAA's profit margin, but my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State pointed out that it was about the economic case for UK plc, not for BAA. My hon. Friend asked about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Commission">Sustainable Development Commission</a> and said that the Government should revise their aviation policy. If I may advise him, I can tell him that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDC">SDC</a>'s views ignore the extensive consultation before the White Paper and our thorough and detailed analysis. He also stated that the consultation said nothing about land and compensation costs. I can assure him that the impact assessment, published last November, did assess compensation costs and impacts in terms of land take, heritage, green belt and other matters.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/11"><a href="/mp/?m=1680" title="Our page on Norman Baker - 'The hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)'">Norman Baker</a> raised the question of collusion. I intervened on him to refute that, and I covered the point a moment ago. He suggested that the emissions trading scheme would stifle flights. It may have an impact, but it is designed to deal with the predicted increase in aviation in the years ahead to ensure that the industry pays for the increase expected, not to strangle it and kill it off. We have laid down our targets in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change_Bill">Climate Change Bill</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETS">ETS</a> for aviation will play its part. He also raised the question of NOx, but my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State outlined how we intend to comply with the directive.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/12">My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1688" title="Our page on Louise Ellman - 'the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman)'">Mrs. Ellman</a>, the Chair of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Committee">Transport Committee</a>, recalled its conclusions about the difficulties of passengers at Heathrow in 2003 and outlined why it agreed in principle with the Government's position. However, she also raised important issues including alternative fuels, the impact of the economic climate and, especially now, the importance of Heathrow as an international hub.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/13"><a href="/mp/?m=1832" title="Our page on David Wilshire - 'The hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire)'">Mr. Wilshire</a> explained that he was in a dilemma about whether to support those on his <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>. As a former Whip, that must have indeed taxed him. However, he explained the arguments that persuaded him. He said that he wanted a better Heathrow, not just a bigger one, and used terminal 5 to illustrate his point. He expressed his confidence in and experience of improved noise and emissions, but explained that the environmental impacts and protections were still critical for him.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/14">My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1584" title="Our page on Alan Keen - 'the Member for Feltham and Heston (Alan Keen)'">Alan Keen</a> expressed concern about the ending of alternation and, as I have said, the Secretary of State covered that as part of the consultation. My hon. Friend mentioned that he would be flying to Teesside for a Boro game soon&#8212;I wish him a safe trip, if not the three points, especially if they are playing <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham">West Ham</a>. I am sure that he is right to say that the world economic situation will have an effect on aviation, but that may be short term, and it remains to be seen how great that effect will be.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/15">The hon. comrade for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) complimented the speeches of his neighbours and put his own views strongly, as he has done on several occasions. He also referred to his Whip's dilemma and the conclusion that he reached, which was to oppose the third runway.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/16">My hon. Friend&#8212;and former ministerial colleague&#8212;<a href="/mp/?m=1990" title="Our page on Tom Harris - 'the Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris)'">Mr. Harris</a> outlined his belief in an economic impact if Heathrow does not improve, and said that the business community would give up on Heathrow over delays, stacking and poor service. He expressed concern about the delivery of the Crossrail project if additional capacity at Heathrow did not proceed.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/17"><a href="/mp/?m=1929" title="Our page on Adam Afriyie - 'The hon. Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie)'">Adam Afriyie</a> mentioned the quality of the passenger experience at Heathrow and cited terminal 5 as a good example of the way forward. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_3">Terminal 3</a> has had its facelift, terminal 4's refurbishment should be finished next year, and terminals 1 and 2 will be replaced by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_East">Heathrow East</a>&#8212;a change scheduled for 2012. That is a multi-billion pound investment, which I am sure that he would welcome. He asked for evidence about the negative impacts on Heathrow. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State outlined in his speech that they would include fewer destinations, reduced access for UK airports and more citizens moving to Europe.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/18">My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1525" title="Our page on Ann Clwyd - 'the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)'">Ann Clwyd</a> made a strong plea for more use of regional airports. She argued for the development of airports such as Cardiff. She is right, of course. The 2003 White Paper supported the development of UK airports, including Cardiff, and they have grown significantly in the years since then. The Government are keen that regional airports should grow to support local demand, as well as to reduce demand at Heathrow, but they will not do that at the levels that could reduce the need for expansion at Heathrow.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/19"><a href="/mp/?m=1783" title="Our page on Susan Kramer - 'The hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)'">Susan Kramer</a> raised the subject of alternation. She also asked me to secure a meeting with my noble Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> responsible for railways. I will ensure that he is aware of her request. She raised the subject of schools. A third runway would impact on 25 schools and nurseries, and mixed mode would impact on 43, not the 20,000 that she mentioned.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/20">My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1602" title="Our page on Nick Raynsford - 'the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)'">Mr. Raynsford</a> mentioned continuous descent approach. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDA">CDA</a> would be reduced, in all probability, by mixed mode, but the benefits of CDA are largely outside the 57 dB noise contour. I am advised that there would not be a huge increase in noise, as alleged. He also mentioned noise impacts in terminal 5, as raised by Roy Vandermeer <a href="/glossary/?gl=139" title="A barrister appointed to senior rank by the Lord Chancellor. When the..." class="glossary">QC</a>. The precautionary principle led Roy Vandermeer to recommend a noise contour of 145 sq km at 57 dB by 2016. The area is now about 120 sq km, and it is important to acknowledge the improvement in the noise climate that has already been delivered. We are committed to not exceeding the 127 sq km contour in the future.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/21">My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1774" title="Our page on Martin Salter - 'the Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter)'">Martin Salter</a> raised the question of conflict between noise and safety, and the potential impact of added capacity. My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1753" title="Our page on Michael Meacher - 'the Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher)'">Mr. Meacher</a> outlined why he is not convinced. He unfairly said that the Secretary of State was not concerned with environmental targets, when the Secretary of State had clearly covered the point in his <a href="/glossary/?gl=30" title="The Opening Speech is the first speech in a debate. The MP who has moved,..." class="glossary">opening speech</a>.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/22">My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West raised the problems with Thames valley surface access to Heathrow. He quoted liberally from the Labour party briefing, which amused right hon. and hon. Members in the Opposition but stated the case: no decision has been taken, and environmental protections must be met.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/23">My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1704" title="Our page on Graham Stringer - 'the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)'">Graham Stringer</a> expressed some discomfort about supporting additional capacity as a north-west MP, but explained how he arrived at his conclusion. In a thoughtful speech, he explained how his experience at Manchester airport helped his conclusions.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/24"><a href="/mp/?m=1771" title="Our page on Justine Greening - 'The hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening)'">Justine Greening</a>, who has been consistently opposed to any increased capacity, raised the ANASE report, public transport and surface access, access to information, joined-up government&#8212;or what she saw as a lack of it&#8212;and the risks as she sees them.</p> <p pid="c.738.2/25">I apologise to <a href="/mp/?m=1792" title="Our page on Nick Hurd - 'the hon.
