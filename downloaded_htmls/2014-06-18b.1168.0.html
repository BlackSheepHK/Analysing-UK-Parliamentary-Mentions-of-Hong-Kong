It is unfair on British citizens across the country who have been asked to pay more money in order that they can go on holiday simply because of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a>&#8217;s incompetence. Carla McGillivary and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Anderson">Dean Anderson</a> applied for a passport for Dean more than six weeks ago. He cannot get an urgent upgrade because his is a first-time adult application. They paid for their holiday to Portugal out of Carla&#8217;s redundancy pay. Her new job is a zero-hours contract, so she does not know when she will be able to book a holiday again. They have been looking forward to this holiday, even arranging for their son to go swimming with dolphins. They fear now that they will have to cancel their holiday or risk losing all the money&#8212;they are supposed to pay the remainder of the deposit today. They have not got Dean&#8217;s passport and they do not know when it will arrive. Carla said:</p> <p pid="b.1123.4/2">&#8220;This is our first family holiday. I have no idea when we will be able to go on holiday again. I just don&#8217;t know what to do.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1123.4/3">One family had to leave their young son behind with his grandparents, because his passport did not come in time. One man missed his brother&#8217;s wedding in Greece because his passport did not come in time, despite his applying weeks in advance. People have saved up, worked hard and looked forward to a precious holiday for months. People have weddings, funerals, family events abroad, business trips, conferences, meetings and deals to make. Some people who are living abroad are keen to come home or just want to make sure that their visas are still valid.</p> <p pid="b.1123.4/4">Today we need to know whether the Home Secretary yet has control of the problem, whether she knows when things will be back to normal and whether she understands what went wrong in the first place. We also want to debate the new policies that she has announced. Are they working and are they enough to solve the problem? So far we have had little reassurance that the Home Secretary has been on top of the problem. Just last week she and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Security and Immigration were saying that there was no backlog. Now we know that it is hundreds of thousands. Last week the Home Secretary said how pleased she was that the Passport Office was meeting the service standards and that 99% of passports were being sent out within four weeks. Yesterday we learnt from the Passport Office chief executive that tens of thousands of passports every week are missing those service standards.</p>            </div>

Friends.</p> <p pid="b.1125.3/2">We do not even know whether the Home Secretary has got to the bottom of why she is in this mess in the first place. Why was the increase in passport applications such a surprise to the Government? Ministers tell us that demand is up by 300,000 compared to last year, and the Passport Office chief executive said it may be 500,000 higher over the course of the year. Why were they so surprised by that? Last year already saw a big increase, with applications going up by 400,000 compared to the year before. Was it really beyond the wit of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> to ensure that it had plans in place in case the number went up again, especially when Ministers&#8217; own decisions were pushing up demand?</p> <p pid="b.1125.3/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> agreed to close the international offices and bring passport applications for overseas residents back home this year. She did not make sure there was enough capacity to cope. According to the Passport Office chief executive, that decision alone has led to an increase of 400,000 more applications to the Passport Office this year. Those cases have seen some of the longest delays of all. It used to take 15 days to sort those passports out&#8212;that is what it says in the Foreign Office annual report&#8212;but now some of those families are being told it could take nine or 10 weeks. That is affecting everyone else&#8217;s applications, too. This is what one mother from Liverpool was told when she tried to chase her son&#8217;s passport application. She said:</p> <p pid="b.1125.3/4">&#8220;I called the Liverpool office again. A lady said they were much busier than normal as they are now processing passports for all over the world not just for the UK and passports are taking 6 to 8 weeks to process.&#8221;</p>            </div>

She is choosing Canadian citizenship for their child over being a British subject because the passport will be given solely on the basis of the father&#8217;s birth certificate, as opposed to sending passports away to a passport office in another country. The passport application process is done far more easily in Canada in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost.

The problem is not just the delay in itself. As she said, my constituent, Mr Martin Griffin, had to drive up to Durham, after paying extra money, the night before the holiday.

While his wife was trying to care for their little baby son, they were very anxious about their holiday. Day in, day out they were told different things. There is no excuse for the delay, but there is no excuse for all that confusion either.</p>            </div>

Why did the Home Secretary not act in January when the Passport Office says it first realised there was a problem? Why did she not act in February when applications kept going up? My right hon.

Why did she not act then? <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> sits on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> and says that she did act. How come so many people are still waiting so long for their passports, when they have paid so much extra to get them on time? Why did the Home Secretary not do enough in April, when more and more MPs&#8217; complaints started coming in? Why did she not act in May, when diplomats warned her the system was not working? Why, even in June, did she spend days denying there was a backlog, denying there was a problem and boasting about meeting all the targets?</p> <p pid="b.1127.5/3">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> claimed last week that the Home Office has been on it since January. On what? It certainly was not on it even last week. The Home Secretary did not have her eye on the ball. She was too busy dealing with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Secretary">Education Secretary</a>&#8217;s hissy fits and too busy blaming everyone else. She said last week it was the seasonal upsurge. How British&#8212;it really must be the weather to blame! She then said that the problem was an unprecedented increase in demand&#8212;the Home Secretary blames the passport crisis on people wanting passports. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> blamed identity cards. Conservative <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Benchers">Back Benchers</a> even claimed it was a crisis manufactured by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a>. With this Home Secretary, it is always someone else&#8217;s fault. She blames the weather, the holidaymakers, the economy, the Labour party, the civil service and even the Education Secretary&#8212;we will join her in that, but round in circles they go. We have known for some time that the Government are not going anywhere, but now no one else is going anywhere.</p> <p pid="b.1127.5/4">When will the crisis be over? Two weeks ago, the Home Secretary said that 98% of targets were being met. This week, the Passport Office chief executive said that 90% were being met. It is getting worse, not better. How many months will it take to have the system back on track? What difference will the new measures make now? The Home Secretary has said that there will be 250 extra staff. It is clear from the Passport Office chief executive that many of them are still being trained. In addition, they are coming from other parts of the Home Office, including borders. Just as this is a busy time for the Passport Office, it is an increasingly busy time at our borders. We know that customs checks are not being done, so what else is being put at risk? Is the Home Secretary confident that she now has enough staff in place to clear the backlog? If she has enough, surely she can give us a timetable on when applications and processing will be back to normal, and when families can be reassured that they will not face delays.</p>            </div>

Friend is exactly right that we need a time scale.</p> <p pid="b.1128.3/2">We need to know how long this piece of string is. Is it a short piece of string or a long one? Are we talking about a few weeks or a few months, or about this time next year? People who have holidays in September or business trips in October need to know how far in advance they should plan and whether they should be worried. Ministers are not giving us answers on how long it will take.</p> <p pid="b.1128.3/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> has said that there will be 650 extra staff on the telephone helpline, which means more extra staff for the helpline than for clearing passports. How much does she think that will help? Currently, most people&#8217;s experience of the helpline is that people take messages and promise that someone else will call back. The person who is supposed to call back does not do so, and the people on the helpline do not know the answers.</p> <p pid="b.1128.3/4">That system is doing people&#8217;s heads in. We heard from Ria Runsewe and her family in Bromley. On <phrase class="date" code="2014-05-05">5 May</phrase>, they applied for a passport for their 10-week-old son, and then heard nothing. She said:</p> <p pid="b.1128.3/5">&#8220;I called the helpline to check its progress&#8230;I was told someone would call me back within 48 hours, but I missed the call while I was changing my son&#8217;s nappy. Ten minutes later, I called back&#8212;only to be told that I had gone to the bottom of the queue and would have to wait another 48 hours.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1128.3/6">She eventually got through to someone and asked to upgrade to the premium service, and spent two more weeks chasing before someone else called her back to take payment and promise that the passport would be there the following day.</p> <p pid="b.1128.3/7">Another family gave us this account of their conversation on the helpline. Passport Office: &#8220;We can&#8217;t guarantee when your passport will be sent or when you will receive it.&#8221; Me: &#8220;What can I do?&#8221; Him: &#8220;You can&#8217;t do anything?&#8221; Me: &#8220;Can&#8217;t I pay to upgrade?&#8221; Him: &#8220;We can&#8217;t talk about that. You have to ring another number.&#8221; Me: &#8220;But that is your number.&#8221; Him: &#8220;We can&#8217;t talk about it until you mention it.&#8221; Me: &#8220;Okay. I&#8217;m mentioning it, and, in fact, I can categorically say I want it.&#8221; Him: &#8220;We can&#8217;t guarantee that they will do anything and they may not respond to you, but you can apply again for an urgent upgrade after that, and you may be lucky that time.&#8221; That is not even Kafkaesque; it is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python">Monty Python</a>. We do not need a system that simply has more staff to take messages. We need staff in place to clear passports and ensure that constituents throughout the country are told what is going on.</p>            </div>

Again, that is welcome, but even that is causing problems. One family who drove to Durham told us:</p> <p pid="b.1131.1/3">&#8220;My husband queried the fee and they said it&#8217;s not true about the fee waiver and it was just a rumour.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1131.1/4">Another was told that if they wanted to fast-track, they would have to cancel their existing application and that that would take 14 days. People who submitted their application online are being told that they cannot get a free upgrade. Even for a fast track, people have to make an appointment. One family were told that the only appointment in the next three weeks was in Durham.</p> <p pid="b.1131.1/5">According to the helpline today, the soonest that anyone can get an appointment anywhere in the country is Friday in Durham or Sunday in London, and even then it could take them an extra week to get their passport. Anyone who wants the premium service&#8212;to get their passport the next day, because they are about to travel urgently&#8212;will still have to pay. According to the Home Secretary, only the fast-track upgrade is free, not the premium service, despite the fact that some people applied for their passports many weeks ago and are now right up against the line.</p>            </div>

No backlog.&#8221; Yet that is not the experience of families across the country.</p> <p pid="b.1131.3/2">What about those who have paid already, one of the key issues in our motion? Martin Cook from Ipswich, who applied many weeks ago, before the three-week deadline, has now had to pay &#163;65 to upgrade, so that he and his wife can go on a romantic break to Prague. Audrey Strong&#8217;s 94-year-old mother&#8212;whom my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40122" title="Our page on Kerry McCarthy - 'the Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy)'">Kerry McCarthy</a>mentioned&#8212;has paid the extra to upgrade so that she can go on her cruise. She feels like she is being held to ransom. After weeks of delay, Anne Dannerolle from Hull paid for the upgrade to next-day delivery. Her passport still did not come and she had to drive a 200-mile round trip just hours before her flight. Roy Pattison, a security guard from Worcester, applied seven weeks ago, before his holiday to Turkey. Finally, on Friday he paid to upgrade to the fast-track service, but his passport still did not arrive on time.</p> <p pid="b.1131.3/4">The Passport Office has made money out of those families. Too early to get the Home Secretary&#8217;s fast-track offer, but too late to wait any longer before they travel, they have been forced to pay out. I therefore urge the Home Secretary to agree today that those families who have already had to pay out because of her delays should also be refunded the cost of their fast-track service.</p> <p pid="b.1131.3/5">We still do not know when things will be back to normal. Families still do not know how long they can expect to wait. We still do not know whether the Home Office has a grip, but families want answers now. We want to know when things will be back to normal. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> should look again at the system for processing overseas passports, because it is not working. She should look again at the staffing, to ensure that she has enough staff in place to get the backlog down fast. She should look again at other measures to get through the summer, such as more support for check and send to reduce errors at this difficult time. She should look again at the fast-track and premium services, because they do not seem to be working well enough. She should also look again at compensating people who have paid extra fees through no fault of their own.</p> <p pid="b.1131.3/6">Would it be too much to ask for a little bit of humility from the Home Secretary when she stands up today, given the holidays she has put at risk? Yesterday the chief executive of the Passport Office gave an apology; last week the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> gave an apology; so can we have an apology from the Home Secretary, as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> in charge of it all? Why doesn&#8217;t she begin her speech with that apology to those families now?</p>            </div>

I would like to say to anybody who is unable to travel because of a delay in processing their passport application that I am sorry and the Government are sorry for the inconvenience they have suffered, and we are doing all we can to put things right.</p>            </div>

I never think it is helpful; indeed, it is the worst thing imaginable to say to people, &#8220;Other people are all right. Sorry about you.&#8221; Will the Home Secretary say now whether my constituent, Mr Martin Griffin, whom I mentioned earlier, can be refunded for having to pay extra and drive up to Durham after weeks and weeks of stress for his wife&#8212;who is trying to look after their small baby&#8212;over whether that child would get its first passport?

Ever since this increase in applications became apparent back in January, HMPO has been putting in place measures to meet the demand. Some 250 additional staff have been transferred from back-office roles to front-line operations, while 650 additional staff have been provided to work on HMPO&#8217;s customer helpline. HMPO has been operating seven days a week since March and couriers are delivering passports within 24 hours of them being produced. On Monday, new office space was opened in Liverpool to provide the Passport Office with additional capacity. As I said to the House last week, however, even with those additional resources, HMPO is still not able to process every application it receives within the three-week waiting time for straightforward cases.</p>            </div>

First, as I said earlier, when people have an urgent need to travel and their applications have been with the Passport Office for longer than three weeks through no fault of their own, the Passport Office will fast-track them without charge. To qualify, they must have booked to travel in the next seven days, and they will need to provide proof of their travel plans. The upgrade will be available until further notice, and I can tell the House that since its introduction, 800 customers have used it to ensure that they receive their passports.</p>            </div>

The hon. Lady mentioned a particular issue about emergency travel documents. We have been very clear that they are for children who need to travel to the United Kingdom, and there is obviously no question but that those will be recognised here. As I have made clear, we must ensure that it is possible to provide proof of the relationship with children and the parenthood&#8212;in this case the surrogate parenthood&#8212;of individuals with children, because we want to make sure that we are looking securely at cases that may relate to child protection. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Foreign_Office">The Foreign Office</a> is talking to some other countries about these issues, however. These are not new documents that are suddenly being issued. The emergency travel documents are issued in other, normal circumstances, where it is necessary for somebody to have a document to travel, perhaps for compassionate reasons. So it is not the case that any different approach should be taken to them in the current situation. Again, however, the hon. Lady has raised a particular issue, and I will ensure that she gets an answer in respect of India. As I have said, there are complications in terms of surrogacy; these applications are not straightforward. I am sure she will understand the reasons why I say that.</p>            </div>

I have heard of numerous cases where HMPO staff have been praised for their helpfulness and professionalism and the compassion they have shown to people in difficult circumstances. I have met staff at the HMPO office in Peterborough and spoken to HMPO staff in several offices, and I would like to place on the record my gratitude for the extra lengths to which those staff are going in order to fix the problem, meet the demand and continue to serve the public.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.1142.4/1">My hon. Friend is right. When I was at the passport office in Peterborough, staff told me that a number of people, on hearing the publicity, had been contacting them about what was happening. These were people who would be getting their passports within the time frame, but their anxieties had been raised by what they had been hearing about the Passport Office. As I said, we must be clear that while some people have not been getting their passports within the normal time frame and while some people have been having difficulties in relation to their travel&#8212;we have been taking steps to alleviate that, as I announced last week&#8212;the vast <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> are still receiving their passports within the three-week period. It is important that we provide that reassurance to people.</p> <p pid="b.1142.4/3">Before I deal with some of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a>&#8217;s claims about what is behind the surge in demand for passport applications, I should emphasise that it is clear that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMPO">HMPO</a>&#8217;s modelling failed, and we will need to address that. Likewise, there will undoubtedly be measures that we will need to take to improve the productivity and efficiency of the organisation in future. I have already said that I am considering removing HMPO&#8217;s agency status so that it can be made directly accountable to Ministers. I want to correct some of the claims that have been made in the past week or so. First, it is not true that this happened as a direct result of the decision to move the processing of overseas passport applications to the UK. HMPO and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> estimated that demand for overseas passport applications would be between 350,000 and 400,000 per year. Coincidentally, the surge in demand for passports represents about 350,000 more applications than last year. The vast majority of the surge is caused by domestic applications.</p> <p pid="b.1142.4/4">Secondly, it is not true that the delay in processing applications was caused by staff reductions. In fact, over the past couple of years, staff numbers in HMPO have risen, not fallen. On <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-31">31 March</phrase> this year, HMPO had 3,444 full-time equivalent staff, up from 3,260 in 2013 and 3,104 in 2012.</p>            </div>

It is usual during peak periods for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMPO">HMPO</a> to operate with high numbers of passport applications in the system at any one time. This is normal work in progress. There can be 350,000 to 400,000 applications being processed at any given time. The overwhelming <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament.

Around 480,000 applications are currently being dealt with, compared with 350,000 to 450,000 in normal circumstances. The figure will vary from week to week depending on passports issued, applications withdrawn and applications received. I should be clear about the figures. The right hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford said that there was a backlog of hundreds of thousands, but there is no backlog of 480,000 cases. That number represents the total number of cases in HMPO&#8217;s system at present.</p> <p pid="b.1144.1/4">As the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> told the House last week, there is a number of straightforward cases that would ordinarily have been processed within the three-week service time that are not being processed quickly enough.

It is the case that sometimes passport applications are being dealt with by other offices, but that is only when those offices have some flexibility within their system to be able to deal with those cases. This is about trying to ensure that we are dealing with the applications so that people get their passports. I am sure that that is exactly what hon.

As I understand it, she said that the Passport Office is experiencing 150,000 domestic applications and 9,000 overseas applications. Given the figures that she has also given us about the 2.95 million last year and the 3.3 million this year, those figures suggest that the overseas applications account for at least half the increase in applications that we have seen. Can she say whether that is the case, and will she take one final opportunity to tell us whether she will refund the extra fees that people have paid in order to get their passports on time? They have already paid the fee. Will she refund it?</p>            </div>

Member for Forest of Dean (Mr Harper)'">Mr Harper</a>, described the passport service as gold-plated, but it has gone from being a swan to an ugly duckling in just 12 months. After the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs_Committee">Home Affairs Committee</a> took evidence from the chief executive of the Passport Office, there is no denying that there is a crisis. I welcome what the Home Secretary has done during the last seven days. These are important measures that I hope will alleviate the real distress that many of our constituents have suffered during the last few months. I wish those measures had been put in place much earlier, but it is far too early to judge what Ministers did or did not do at the relevant time. Suffice it to say that it is important that we deal with the crisis as quickly as possible.</p> <p pid="b.1147.0/2"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> is right: 493,289 cases represent work in progress. But the word &#8220;backlog&#8221; is used quite a lot. One of the problems is that those in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> regard a backlog as being everything outside service standard times. They also define a service standard time. For many years, the Home Affairs Committee, in our reports, has not accepted the use of that phrase. We have looked at the amount of work in progress; what the public want is to be able to submit a passport application, pay a fee and get good value for money. We should not have to praise the Passport Office and say it is doing a good job because we can ring to have complaints dealt with. Frankly, that is what it should be doing all the time.</p> <p pid="b.1147.0/3">We must remind ourselves, Madam <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>&#8212;I congratulate you on your appointment as a dame&#8212;that we should not need to wait for facts and figures. I want to spend the very short time that I have, which is getting even shorter, on the evidence given by the chief executive of the Passport Office. I was hugely disappointed by what Mr Paul Pugh had to say; he is, after all, being paid more than the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Security_and_Immigration">Minister for Security and Immigration</a>. I would have expected the chief executive of an agency of the Crown to be able to judge the huge increase in passport applications that began earlier this year.</p> <p pid="b.1147.0/4">The Select Committee asked for the facts and figures that the Home Secretary was unable to give us today&#8212;she clearly does not have them all with her&#8212;to be delivered to it before the evidence session. At 2.45 yesterday afternoon, when the session began, and by implication the entire staff would have been present at the hearing, we received an e-mail saying that the figures had not been verified. These are normal statistics that should be on the desk of Ministers every week.</p> <p pid="b.1147.0/5">It is a long time since I have been a Minister, but when I had responsibility for entry clearance, I demanded on a weekly basis the number of cases that were going to appeal, partly because of the letters I received from my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40387" title="Our page on Gerald Kaufman - 'the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)'">Sir Gerald Kaufman</a>, to make sure that the backlog was brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible.</p> <p pid="b.1147.0/6">The Home Secretary was right to visit Peterborough. I visited the Passport Office in London last Friday and I agree with her&#8212;there are some extremely hard-working staff there who are putting in a lot of hours. Many of them are working overtime, but many are very new. Of the four members of staff I spoke to on reception at Globe house, all had been appointed in the past fortnight. I am not sure whether they have the necessary training. They were all very pleasant and courteous and were doing their best, but it looks a bit like management by panic, as my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40424" title="Our page on Paul Flynn - 'the Member for Newport West (Paul Flynn)'">Paul Flynn</a> said yesterday during the session. We do not expect that of an agency with the kind of reputation that the Passport Office has.</p>            </div>

In the hour and a half I have been sitting in the Chamber, nobody has answered the question why there has been such unprecedented additional demand.

I agree&#8212;it is important that we learn from previous experiences. The Passport Office currently has a considerable number of applications to process, but 15 years ago, under the previous Administration, the number was not 480,000, but 565,000 at the height of the 1999 crisis. But the most important figure is that of the 480,000 cases currently in progress&#8212;just 30,000, or six in every hundred, are being dealt with outside the normal three-week waiting time.</p>            </div>

Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)'">Sir Gerald Kaufman</a> said earlier, I shall carry on.</p> <p pid="b.1149.1/2">More than 500 people missed their travel dates in 1999, and the Government then paid out over &#163;124,000 in compensation for missed holidays, honeymoons and business trips. More than half of all calls failed to get through to the agency. The emergency measures put in place by the then Government cost a total of &#163;12.6 million, including &#163;16,000 spent on umbrellas for people queuing in the rain for hours.</p> <p pid="b.1149.1/3">It is important that today we reflect on what happened 15 years ago. It took the Government five months to get a grip of the problem and to put emergency measures in place, in stark contrast to what we have seen from this Home Secretary and this Government. The Government are not simply throwing extra resources at the difficulties; they are taking proportionate steps to reallocate 250 staff and add 650 staff to customer helplines. That action was taken quickly. The wider concerns that have been generated have increased unnecessary calls, leading to an extra administrative burden on the Passport Office. Let us put the situation in context. Between January and May, 99% of passports were issued within four weeks. That is a pretty impressive outcome.</p> <p pid="b.1149.1/4">As I said earlier, four constituents contacted me. One of them had to delay his holiday by one day, which is incredibly significant for him and his wife. I very much hope the Government will make it clear how compensation in such circumstances can be gained and the best way to approach that. I also hope that this afternoon&#8217;s debate is an opportunity for the Government to outline once again the considerable and sensible steps they have taken to ensure that people can receive their passports as soon as possible.</p> <p pid="b.1149.1/5">My councillor, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McLennan">Ian McLennan</a>, a tenacious Labour councillor, was hoping to depart on a cruise with his wife but unfortunately the passport reached them one day late. He is the only constituent of mine who has experienced any meaningful problems. I see no reason why my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> should be any different from any other.

Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>, as we have seen today. There she goes, useless and arrogant. This week, she announced a new priority visitor visa system for tourists from China&#8212;a country that carries out executions and torture, imprisons without trial and gags free speech, while British citizens are harassed, delayed and fended off by an unresponsive lack of a system bizarrely called a &#8220;responder hub&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b.1150.1/2">I get an incessant flow of passport cases; the pile I have here has arrived since Thursday. Time and again constituents tell me what they are going through. Here is one example:</p> <p pid="b.1150.1/3">&#8220;I am making myself ill with worry&#8230;I continue to be fobbed off by the 0300 helpline. I am so frustrated as I cannot even discuss this with anyone as they will not even give me a direct number for the Liverpool office!&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1150.1/4">Here is another:</p> <p pid="b.1150.1/5">&#8220;We have been wasting time and money running after solicitors and the British embassy, who are not helping us or guiding us about the process.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1150.1/6">Here is another:</p> <p pid="b.1150.1/7">&#8220;I will now need to take 2 days off work and also pay the last-minute travel costs to get from Manchester to London and back (twice) in order to apply for a visa&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b.1150.1/8">Another:</p> <p pid="b.1150.1/9">&#8220;The main advice line for the passport office constantly gives incorrect information, which leads to a phone call every day as we are now panicking and worried sick&#8230; I suffer with anxiety and panic disorder and this is causing me so much stress each and every day.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1150.1/10">Yet another:</p> <p pid="b.1150.1/11">&#8220;I applied for a renewal passport on May the seventh 2014 and today still have received nothing. If I do not go on 20th, I will have to lose a lot of money.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1150.1/12">I could read many more.</p> <p pid="b.1150.1/13">The situation is a scandal caused by a lack of concern and interest not lower down the organisation&#8212;those people do as they are told&#8212;but at the very top. It was typical of the Home Secretary to scoot out of here after listening to only two Back-Bench speeches; she goes off to do a job that she is incapable of doing anyhow. I have been a Member of this House for 44 years, and in that time there have been 18 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretaries">Home Secretaries</a>&#8212;10 <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> and eight Labour. They have varied in quality, but every single one of them, Tory and Labour, made themselves accessible to me as a Labour <a href="/glossary/?gl=47" title="A Backbencher is a Member who holds no official position in government or..." class="glossary">Back Bencher</a>. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hurd">Douglas Hurd</a> would invite me to his office to discuss immigration and deportation cases, and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Whitelaw">William Whitelaw</a> was a serious Home Secretary.</p> <p pid="b.1150.1/14">I do not know what elevated ideas this Home Secretary has about her quality and personality. All I can say is that this coming Saturday&#8212;my birthday, since I am talking about anniversaries&#8212;she will become the longest serving Home Secretary of all the 18 I have known in this House, yet she has done less than any other because, unlike them, she will not touch an individual case. Douglas Hurd, William Whitelaw, David Waddington and all the rest did, but she does not. I simply cannot understand why she thinks that she is too good for the rest of us. That is the attitude she is taking in this situation. She is not accessible in any way.</p> <p pid="b.1150.1/15">If the Home Secretary dealt with cases, she would know the problems of administration and understand what is going on, but she is at a distance. We have to drag her here, as my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40427" title="Our page on Yvette Cooper - 'the Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)'">Yvette Cooper</a> did last week, to get anything out of her. She has done nothing to sort this out. She can babble on as much as she likes about identity cards, but four years and one month later that has nothing whatever to do with it. This mess is the Home Secretary&#8217;s personal responsibility, and our constituents will remember that.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.1151.0/1">I normally like to say that it is a pleasure to follow a Member who has just spoken, but I am afraid that I cannot do so on this occasion. <a href="/mp/?m=40387" title="Our page on Gerald Kaufman - 'The right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)'">Sir Gerald Kaufman</a> should be ashamed of himself. Having listened to his diatribe, I hope that he has tried to contact the Home Secretary, because if he has not he should explain that to the House.</p> <p pid="b.1151.0/2">I want to start by congratulating the Home Secretary. There will always be issues, crises and developments in Departments such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a>, as we all know on both sides of the House, so it is not the avoiding of a problem that is the measure of a Home Secretary; it is how they deal with it when it arises. How has the Home Secretary dealt with this problem? She has done so in an exemplary fashion. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty">Her Majesty</a>&#8217;s Passport Office has been responding since the start of this year, not at the height of the season, during the summer months, because staff were brought in to respond to extra demand in January.</p> <p pid="b.1151.0/3">We must ask ourselves why there has been this substantial increase in demand, the biggest intake at this time of year for 12 years. Perhaps it is something to do with the improving economy under this Government. The economy is up because the long-term economic plan is working, so more business people need passports to travel and more people are going on holiday. How else could one account for the enormous increase in the millions of applications? To deal with that, 200 staff have been redeployed from office roles to front-line operations, the passport helpline now has 1,000 staff dealing with the situation, and the Passport Office is open from 7 am to midnight seven days a week. That has resulted in a considerable improvement in the number of straightforward passport applications being dealt with within the stipulated time frame.</p> <p pid="b.1151.0/4">However, between January and May more than 97% of straightforward passport renewals and child applications were processed within the three weeks advertised on the website&#8212;by the way, the website gives three weeks as a recommended time frame, not a guarantee&#8212;and</p> <p pid="b.1151.0/5">99% have been processed within four weeks. As it happens, I do not think that we can say that is good enough, because even 1% represents a large number of people who have been seriously inconvenienced.</p> <p pid="b.1151.0/6">We should not allow the message to be transmitted that somehow this service is completely collapsing, as the Labour <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> are trying to do, to the detriment of Passport Office staff across the country who are working extremely hard, as we can see, for many hours of the day and night to get the job done. Let us give them credit and accept that a 97% success rate for any branch of government is extremely impressive. If we could arrest 97% of burglars or stop 97% of fires, we would be doing rather well. However, I accept that even 3% or 1% is too large and that we always have to do better. That is why the Home Secretary has put in place the resources that we have heard described in detail today.</p> <p pid="b.1151.0/7">We have again heard allegations that this situation is the result of job cuts, but the contrary is actually the case. On <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-31">31 March</phrase> the Passport Office had 3,444 full-time equivalent staff, which is more than in 2013 and 2012. Comparisons are inaccurately drawn with 2010. As has already been explained, in 2010 this Government rightly scrapped Labour&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID">ID</a> cards policy, so the Passport Office, as it is now constituted, is dealing with different things. Staff numbers have gone up.</p> <p pid="b.1151.0/8">We must also bear in mind the paramount importance of security. This country has a gold-standard passport service, and our passports are considered to be the gold standard by other countries, including those in the European Union. Other countries respect the fact that a British passport is a document they can trust, because they know and acknowledge that a vast array of security checks are done before a passport is issued. We must ensure that there is no circumvention of those checks, because they are of paramount importance. There will be complex cases, because we have a very cosmopolitan society and people want passports from around the world, and sometimes the checks take a while to complete, particularly because the other countries have their own time frames.</p> <p pid="b.1151.0/9">I acknowledge that there is a problem, but we have to bear in mind the points I have raised: resources are being put into this; the figures are improving; and the number of staff has increased. The so-called backlog is a misapprehension. We cannot count those figures that we would normally expect to see&#8212;150,000 a week&#8212;as a backlog. The figures for the past three weeks amount to a vast number, and they will continue to increase.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.1152.0/1">I first want to thank and congratulate the front-office staff in passport offices. Someone said that they are only doing their job, and asked why we should thank them. I think that to have worked under the pressure that they have worked under, to have had angry people on the phone every time they pick it up and to have been badgered by MPs is to have done a tremendous job. I have had nothing but kindness, patience and tolerance when I have been in touch with staff in Belfast, Liverpool and, above all, Durham. I just think that they are worth more than the money that the Government are paying them, and I hope that they remember that.</p> <p pid="b.1152.0/2">However, I cannot say the same for the parliamentary hotline. Too often it has rung out&#8212;nobody has answered. The only job staff seem to do is to pass complaints to the passport office. Now that we have discovered a line that gets us through to Durham, we in Leeds have found that it is easier to speak to the ordinary staff: it gets the job done quicker, and we can speak to staff who have more knowledge. I expect more from a parliamentary hotline.</p> <p pid="b.1152.0/3">While I am getting out all my bad temper, I must say that I cannot understand what has happened to the invisible management. Normally, when we get through to an office, if the poor person who answers cannot deal with the problem, we ask to speak to a supervisor or a member of the management. It is impossible to speak to such a person. I have, however, noted that we can speak to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Security and Immigration, and that will be marvellous when we cannot get any answers.</p> <p pid="b.1152.0/4">I agree with what has been said about its being too soon to judge. For the people involved who are watching this, it will be quite painful to see Members from the two sides battling over figures, times and numbers, and over who is to blame. The dust will settle, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs_Committee">Home Affairs Committee</a> and other places will find out the facts and agree a sensible way forward.</p> <p pid="b.1152.0/5"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> has put some stuff on the table that we hope will work. <a href="/mp/?m=40456" title="Our page on Michael Ellis - 'The hon. Member for Northampton North (Michael Ellis)'">Michael Ellis</a> said that we should congratulate her. The jury is still out, but she has not satisfied the minority who are bruised, harmed and out of pocket, or who have had real stress and worry about the whole exercise. Members are upset about the minority who have had to cancel holidays and to pay for delayed holidays, or who have been told by a passport office that they could have their passport if they paid an upgrade, which sounds terribly like blackmail. It sticks in the craw when we are told, &#8220;Look, things happen.&#8221; As the hon. Gentleman said, this is about how we react to what happens.</p> <p pid="b.1152.0/6">Ordinary people have gone through a terrible time. I have a story about an individual who put in for four passports before time: one came through, but the other three did not, and he had to pay about &#163;180 to get them, and to travel 70 miles to Durham to pick them up. All that I and many Members in the Chamber wanted to hear from the Home Secretary was an acceptance that we all make mistakes, as do Governments of all hues. What should a Government do when they make a mistake that hurts someone? If they have caused distress or cost a family &#163;180 to pay for another flight, it is not enough to say sorry. If this was a private firm, the Government and Members would be up in arms, saying, &#8220;Give people recompense. You&#8217;ve let them down.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1152.0/7">The point is that the Government knew for five months that they were running into trouble. Did they alert anyone to that fact? The answer is no. They did not change the website, and people put in for passports&#8212;putting their holidays in danger&#8212;because the Government did not come clean. My view is that they should kill the argument by saying, &#8220;We will give recompense. We will review every case put forward for recompense, and we will look at the individual circumstances.&#8221; That would have settled the matter. People have been hurt and mistakes have been made but, however those mistakes happened, we cannot let ordinary people suffer because of incompetence or such mistakes.</p> <p pid="b.1152.0/9">Finally, when I raised the issue with the Home Secretary last week, she did not answer my point about retrospective recompense, but she said that such a service would be free in future. That is confirmed by a document from the Library, but it points out that the free upgrade</p> <p pid="b.1152.0/10">&#8220;is only available to first time passport applicants if there are valid compassionate circumstances.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1152.0/11">That is the sort of nonsensical, empty phrase&#8212;with too many qualifications&#8212;that does this House no good. I genuinely hope that the Home Secretary has done her arithmetic, because that may be the problem. Arithmetic is nothing, however; we as politicians must keep our faith with ordinary people, which means that when we make a mistake or do something that hurts them, we put it right.</p>            </div>

Like my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40518" title="Our page on John Glen - 'the Member for Salisbury (John Glen)'">John Glen</a>, I want to put on the record the number of my constituents affected. So far, we have taken up nine cases with the passport office in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, and those cases have been dealt with. We have three more outstanding cases, but we are waiting for information from the constituents concerned. The processes that have been put in place are therefore working.

Gentleman is so confident about independence, I have no need to answer that question.</p> <p pid="b.1154.2/2">During my wonderful time in Liverpool, earning a bit of money to get myself through my university years, the staff did a good job. Many of the staff are still there, although there have been a number of reorganisations. One key thing is that there were backlogs in those days. My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury made the key point that, between January and May, 99% of passports were processed in four weeks. I can tell hon. Members that that was not the case when I worked in the passport office in Liverpool. It took a lot longer than that, and we used to look at the passport applications, wondering why it had taken so long for them to reach us to be printed.</p> <p pid="b.1154.2/4">My brother and sister also worked in that passport office in Liverpool. There are many of us, and such things are often family affairs in the great city that I come from. They had different roles. My brother was one of the examiners responsible for identifying whether somebody had the status to be given a British passport.</p> <p pid="b.1154.2/5">Hon. Members may not appreciate that once somebody gets a British passport, they can use it as a gateway document to enable them to access a variety of benefits and services within the United Kingdom, so it is incredibly important. One issue with delays for a specific passport is that we may have to be very careful about the security of the application to ensure that the person who will get the passport has a right to services in the United Kingdom. Failure to do so or a knee-jerk reaction&#8212;</p>            </div>

My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury gave the important statistic that there were 565,000 documents in 1999. I should like to discuss my experience, because hon. Members will be shocked to discover that I was actually there when the work of the Passport Office was outsourced by the previous Government. In 1998, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> outsourced me to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_Business_Services">Siemens Business Services</a>, which wanted to replace my dot-matrix computer with 125 passports on it with some high-falutin&#8217; laser printer based in Manchester. We would examine the passports in Liverpool, and when we pressed &#8220;print&#8221; on our computers, they would be sent off to Manchester to be printed.</p> <p pid="b.1155.1/3">People will be shocked to discover that, during that period, there was complete and utter chaos. The roll-out was so poor that it was actually delayed in all the other passport offices in the United Kingdom. We had spoken to the unions, and to the Ministers involved, and they had been warned for more than 12 months that there would be utter chaos. I left the Passport Office in March 1999, and after it lost my services, there just happened to be a passport crisis that summer. I have no idea why that happened. I was beavering away doing the best I could, and when I left, there were problems.</p> <p pid="b.1155.1/4">There were huge problems in 1999. My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury has mentioned the fact that &#163;12.6 million was paid out. My brother and sister were working in the passport office at the time, and they remember that angry people from all over the country, with their umbrellas, were forming huge queues round the India buildings. They were having to pay out, and it was a huge problem. Every one of those cases was a personal tragedy.</p> <p pid="b.1155.1/5">I find it upsetting that some <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members have tried to suggest that the situation today is similar. What has happened over the past few months has been difficult for the individuals involved, but it is nothing like what it was then. I worked there; I experienced it and I can assure every Member that the word &#8220;chaos&#8221; does not do it justice. Towards the end of 1998, it was so bad that I was paid treble time to work on Sundays, with an extra &#163;10 an hour just to turn up to work. I left university with no debts as a result of that, for which I am grateful to the previous Government. I took advantage of that overtime as much as I could. The reality was, however, that there were huge problems. What the Home Secretary has done over the past few months has resulted in a huge step forward from what I experienced when I was there some years ago.</p> <p pid="b.1155.1/7">I would like to put on record my gratitude to the staff in the Passport Office who have helped me and my constituents to get the nine passports that we have contacted the office about over the past few weeks. I give the Passport Office warning now on the Floor of the House that I shall be contacting it in the next few hours about a further three cases, when I have received further details from my constituents, and I hope that they will be processed just as fast.</p> <p pid="b.1155.1/8">We have to remember that there are human beings involved, and that the staff who are doing the examining and the printing are all doing the best they can. I was a little disappointed that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> Home Secretary saw fit to mock someone who was working on the advice line. I have been in that position myself, and it was very difficult when people were ringing from different countries and I was constantly fielding their concerns. That person will no doubt be disappointed to hear what she said. I want to put on record my thanks to the Home Secretary for her action to try to deal with the situation.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.1156.2/1">Thank you, Madam <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>. I congratulate you on your honour.</p> <p pid="b.1156.2/2">The Government are evading two fundamental questions, and if we do not get answers to them today, we shall go on pressing for them, because we are rightly being relentlessly pursued for answers by our constituents. The first question is: why are we in this crisis, and why is there such a shambles in the Department? We have not had an answer from the Government that makes any sense. They have tried to blame the massive increase on new people applying for passports, but their figures do not show that to be the case.</p> <p pid="b.1156.2/3">I have written a letter to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Security and Immigration, <a href="/mp/?m=40466" title="Our page on James Brokenshire - 'the hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (James Brokenshire)'">James Brokenshire</a>, but he has not yet replied to it. I have not even had an acknowledgement, let alone an invitation to meet him. I have been received by many of his predecessors, as has my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40387" title="Our page on Gerald Kaufman - 'the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)'">Sir Gerald Kaufman</a>, who has referred to Mr Waddington in particular. Those Ministers met constituents when there was a problem.</p> <p pid="b.1156.2/4">That course of action worked well, and I would recommend it to the Minister who is now in charge, even though he does not seem to be terribly interested in what I am saying.</p> <p pid="b.1156.2/5">The Government have increased the manpower. The crisis blew up during the January to May period and the Home Secretary has stood at the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> and announced crisis measures to deal with it. What remains unclear is whether holidays for which flights and hotels have been booked will qualify as urgent business. I have not heard a clear answer from the Government on that yet.</p> <p pid="b.1156.2/6">This takes me to the main question. The Government have said that they are sorry, but if they say sorry, they have to mean it. Saying sorry means making amends; otherwise, it does not mean anything. It is just a word without a meaning. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> has evaded the question three times when we have put it to her, but the Government must tell us what they are going to do in the cases where our constituents had done everything correctly and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMPO">HMPO</a> was at fault, resulting in them not getting their passports in time. Many of those people have lost money just trying to get their passports, never mind losing money on holiday bookings. The Government have to give us an answer to that question.</p> <p pid="b.1156.2/7">We need to know who took the decision to bring all the overseas passport work into the Department at the very time we were having a seasonal surge. I think it must have been the Home Secretary because she went out of her way to defend it today. However, she could not give us the basic statistics. If the relevant figure is 6% of 3.3 million, that equates to about 175,000, which is a good half of the 350,000 extra cases that came in this year. So it was clearly a bad&#8212;indeed, almost idiotic&#8212;management decision to take in the overseas passport work at that time.</p> <p pid="b.1156.2/8">I want to mention the case of Mrs Joanna Hughes. She applied online on <phrase class="date" code="2014-04-23">23 April</phrase> to renew her daughter Ella&#8217;s passport, which she would need for a trip to Belgium for the world war one centenary celebrations on <phrase class="date" code="2014-06-19">19 June</phrase>. The Passport Office advised her that the application would take up to three weeks to complete. About three weeks later, on <phrase class="date" code="2014-05-10">10 May</phrase>, she received a letter from HMPO to tell her that the passport and photos had been lost within the passport department. It advised her to forward a new application form and photographs, which she did on <phrase class="date" code="2014-05-12">12 May</phrase>. There was no delay there; she got on to it straight away. She sent the documents to the Glasgow priority handling office via <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mail">Royal Mail</a> special delivery. She told me:</p> <p pid="b.1156.2/9">&#8220;I finally received a call back on <phrase class="date" code="2014-05-29">29 May</phrase> to be told that my application was with an examiner in Belfast, not Glasgow as previously advised.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1156.2/10">We can already see that there was a muddle in the department. There were a lot of people working on the application, but if there is criticism to be made, it is not of the people working on the process but of the organisation, of the ministerial decisions and of Mr Pugh himself. The problem lies with the organisation of the department itself.</p> <p pid="b.1156.2/11">Mrs Hughes continued:</p> <p pid="b.1156.2/12">&#8220;I was advised to send a Lost and Stolen form with a covering letter to Priority Handling Belfast which I had to download online to advise the very department who had lost the passport! Another special delivery was posted that day.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1156.2/13">I agree with her conclusion:</p> <p pid="b.1156.2/14">&#8220;I would like to receive a full apology and investigation into why my daughter&#8217;s old passport and photos were lost in a Government office and I want to receive full compensation for all the further expenditure I have had to make&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b.1156.2/15">She gives details of the expenditure, which comes to the best part of &#163;153. The Government are responsible for that. What are they going to do&#8212;</p>            </div>

Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40423" title="Our page on Jessica Morden - 'the Member for Newport East (Jessica Morden)'">Jessica Morden</a>. It was a tragedy from which the city has never recovered. It took the passport office out of the heart of the city. We now have half a passport office service there. The decision was taken for managerial reasons, and authorised by a civil servant. I am sure that her career will have prospered. However, the lives of 150 people in Newport were devastated by the change.</p> <p pid="b.1158.1/2">It is nonsense to say that the closures did not lead to this crisis; of course they played an important part. There would be 150 trained, skilled people working there to keep the backlog down if it had not been closed. When the Government start to restore the emaciated passport service that is left, they have an obligation to put the jobs back into the places from which they were so cruelly torn away in 2011.</p> <p pid="b.1158.1/3">I believe that this foul-up will become one of the signature foul-ups of this Government. They will be rejected by the public not because of Europe or any other great issue, but because they are guilty of creating an ineptocracy. Virtually nothing that they have done has worked. What has happened with Atos, Capita, G4S and the rest of those great enterprises that have been set up&#8212;with the mountain of complaints, hurt and anger from the public&#8212;will be the reason why the Government are rejected.</p> <p pid="b.1158.1/4">The Government&#8217;s reaction to the crisis has followed the usual pattern. First, they say that there is no crisis and ignore it, thinking that it will go away. They deny that the crisis is taking place. When it becomes a national scandal, as this one has in the past fortnight, their response is panic. There is management by panic. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> came to the House and introduced half a dozen new measures. That is no way to run the place, when the whole crisis was predictable and, indeed, predicted. There is then a refusal to take responsibility and to accept blame. I asked the Home Secretary last week whether she had the humility and common sense to apologise. She did not.</p> <p pid="b.1158.1/5">Paul Pugh did apologise yesterday, but he then put forward the preposterous argument that, having been responsible for the foul-up, which he admits, he is the only person who is qualified to put it right. That is like saying that the greatest criminal is the best person to run the police service. It is an extraordinary argument. There would be great satisfaction among the many people who have been badly treated by this Government and Mr Pugh if he resigned. It would please those people and it would be no loss to the country.</p> <p pid="b.1158.1/6">We look forward to seeing what can be done with the passport service. It is a service with a great history. I have represented passport workers since 1972. The passport office came to Newport in 1967. I was a local councillor at that time and I know the service well. The last crisis that everyone made a big fuss about was a computer disaster. We virtually had two passport staffs&#8212;one employed by Siemens and one employed by the passport service&#8212;running in parallel.</p> <p pid="b.1158.1/7">That crisis was nowhere near as bad as this one. At no time has there been such a sense of anxiety and of being betrayed, with trips being made to places so far away. It is unprecedented. The public will not forget this and will not forgive the Government for it. When the reckoning is made, we will find that the costs have been enormous. The Government are not coming up with any figures at the moment, but they are compensating people here and there for lost holidays and all the rest of it. The huge amount of compensation will dwarf any savings that the Government made through their cruel cuts in 2011. The people of Newport will remember that and I am sure that they will do the right thing when they vote next year.</p> <p pid="b.1158.1/8">This is a Government of incompetence who have created an ineptocracy. That will be their political doom.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.1159.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>. It was a good point, well made. I am sure that the same is true of the cases in my office.</p> <p pid="b.1159.2/2">Like other hon. Members, I will outline the cases of a couple of my constituents whose travel plans have been put in jeopardy. One woman applied for her son&#8217;s passport at the beginning of April, believing that she had plenty of time. According to the website, it would take three weeks. Eight weeks later, after numerous interventions, she was finally one of the lucky ones and received the passport. However, that was only after she had paid for the fast-track service and been told to go for an interview in Durham, which is 290 miles away. After we intervened, she did not have to go to Durham. However, by that stage, she had spent &#163;42 on the initial application, &#163;87 on the one-week fast track, &#163;15 on a replacement birth certificate and &#163;95 on a flight to Durham that she did not need. I know that the Home Secretary has offered some concessions, but we need many more and they need to be backdated.</p> <p pid="b.1159.2/4">Another family, after an intervention from the office of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Security and Immigration, received their passport by courier. Finally, after contacting the helplines repeatedly, they got the passport specially delivered from London four hours before they were due to get on the plane at 11 o&#8217;clock. Like other hon. Members, I thank the Minister for the effort that he put into that case, but that is hardly the way people should receive a passport.</p> <p pid="b.1159.2/5">In the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of the cases that have been dealt with by my office, people have effectively been forced to pay for the upgrade. The message seems to be, &#8220;If you can afford to pay for the upgrade, you can get your passport; if you can&#8217;t afford it, that&#8217;s tough.&#8221; It would be interesting to know how much money the Government have made from upgrades over the past few months.</p> <p pid="b.1159.2/6">As my hon. Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_West">Newport West</a> said, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> tried to close the Newport passport office in 2010, which would have meant the loss of 300 jobs. After a strong campaign by the staff, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCS">PCS</a> union and the <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Wales_Argus">South Wales Argus</a></i>, which had the support of local politicians, the office remained open, but lost the postal processing service. It retained the counter service and the customer complaints service. Some 150 people lost their jobs, which was a huge hit to the local economy. I believe that it also caused the biggest hit of any of the cuts at that time to the service across the UK.</p> <p pid="b.1159.2/7">The then <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Immigration">Minister for Immigration</a>, <a href="/mp/?m=40049" title="Our page on Damian Green - 'the right hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green)'">Damian Green</a>, talked repeatedly in our debates about excess staff in the service. Today, the Home Secretary talked about excess office space. However, almost immediately after the redundancies, overtime was offered in other offices around the service. The staff felt that that added insult to injury.</p> <p pid="b.1159.2/8">As the unions and hon. Members have pointed out repeatedly to Ministers, after the postal work was taken out of Newport, management had to close customer counters early or for one day a week to deal with the backlog. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_and_Passport_Service">Identity and Passport Service</a> filled the gaps with staff from other departments and agency staff. Higher grade staff were working overtime to deal with straightforward applications, which is four grades below their normal work.</p> <p pid="b.1159.2/9">In April 2012, we wrote to the Minister to ask why, a month after the staff in Newport were made redundant, the agency announced that recruitment was necessary. That showed a complete disregard for the staff who had lost their jobs.</p> <p pid="b.1159.2/10">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Affairs_Committee">Welsh Affairs Committee</a> warned in its report in 2010:</p> <p pid="b.1159.2/11">&#8220;The Newport Passport Office has a reputation for excellent customer care. The closure of the Newport Passport Application Processing Centre would result in the loss to the service of skilled people with significant experience&#8230; The Government must guarantee that the same high level of service will continue to be provided&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b.1159.2/12">Clearly, that has not happened.</p> <p pid="b.1159.2/13">I do not understand why the current delays have come as a surprise to the Home Office. The signs have been there for years, but it has insisted on pursuing the cuts, with little regard for the effect that they are having on customer service and on the staff who do a great job in Newport and at other offices, and who are under immense stress. As the Government try to solve the problem, they should look to restore the 150 jobs that were lost in Newport. We have the space and the experience for that to happen. That is important if customers are to get the experience that is advertised to them, and it is important to our city.</p>            </div>

Before I say anything else, in case I run out of time, I would like to add my compliments to the staff who are working so hard and to my own office staff, who have put in a great deal of work on the matter and dealt with some very distressed people over the past wee while. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Foreign_Office">The Foreign Office</a> warned nearly six months ago that closing overseas passport offices would lead to passport delays. In January this year, we on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a> were informed of that by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> officials. We all know now that the Government&#8217;s decision to shut down seven overseas offices has been identified as a key reason for the passport delays affecting thousands of our constituents, whatever the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> says. Control of overseas applications for passports by British expats has been handed over to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a>, and that decision has meant that since January, British passport offices have had to deal with an extra 350,000 applications for travel documents.</p>            </div>

Friend does not mind, so that other people can get in.</p> <p pid="b.1161.2/2">Hon. Members may be aware that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a> is currently holding an inquiry into consular services. One of the most fundamental matters that expats expect, quite rightly, of the Government is an efficient and timely passport service. On passport applications, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCO">FCO</a> told the Committee:</p> <p pid="b.1161.2/3">&#8220;For most overseas customers the timescales for passport applications remain the same: four weeks for renewals and six weeks for first time applicants. In some countries this may take longer owing to the need for additional time required to complete checking procedures.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1161.2/4">Not surprisingly, it takes longer for officials in the UK to check details on applications from Britons overseas.</p> <p pid="b.1161.2/5">When former diplomats Sir Michael Arthur, former ambassador to Germany, and Mr Giles Paxman, former British ambassador to Spain and Mexico, gave public evidence to the Committee, I asked them whether the decision to transfer responsibility to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> had been a good one. If people think that it is hard to get a straight answer to a straight question from a politician, they should try getting one from a diplomat. In typical diplomatic language, Sir Michael Arthur said:</p> <p pid="b.1161.2/6">&#8220;It was unpopular in Germany where it was felt that the distance made it more difficult to get a passport.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1161.2/7">Mr Paxman stated the obvious, saying:</p> <p pid="b.1161.2/8">&#8220;The need to transport the application back to the UK and then the final transport back out again is bound to add a little bit of time.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1161.2/9">That is an understatement, at best. However tactfully they put it, it was clear that they were acknowledging that the decision to transfer responsibility to the Home Office had led to a deterioration in service.</p> <p pid="b.1161.2/10">Does the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> think that the transfer was a good decision, and why was no account seemingly taken of the totally predictable delays that it would cause? Are applications from people who live in Britain being delayed because of the need to process applications from expats? As late as <phrase class="date" code="2014-06-09">9 June</phrase>, Mr Pugh stated that delays were due to an exceptional early summer demand for passports because of the improving economy and a rise in holiday bookings. That is not the case in Scotland, where it has been in the news this week that people are staying at home this year for their holidays.</p> <p pid="b.1161.2/11"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> did not even mention the key problem that has been caused by the change in the system. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has accused the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a> of trying to frighten people, but he does not need to do so because they are already terrified. Like so many other Members, I and my office staff have dealt with several tragic cases in the past few weeks, and I would like to highlight one. A constituent wrote to me:</p> <p pid="b.1161.2/12">&#8220;I am writing in tears and in desperation, both my son and I are waiting for our passports. I have tried for days to get information and find someone who can help us. My son is 18 and is now applying for his first passport, he was previously on my passport so I sent our applications away together on <phrase class="date" code="2014-05-13">13 May</phrase>.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1161.2/13">They are having all sorts of problems getting their passports, and the woman has already put out &#163;400 to get her son insured because he has a very serious illness that could cause sudden death. That is only part of the extra expense that they have incurred. I think we should all be ashamed that in this day and age, this is happening in our country. It brings shame on our country and on the Government.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.1162.0/1">I echo what my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40052" title="Our page on Sandra Osborne - 'the Member for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock (Sandra Osborne)'">Sandra Osborne</a> has said. I praise those who are working extremely hard to try to help people who are suffering as a result of this fiasco, namely the staff in passport offices up and down the country. I particularly want to place on record my respect for Farooq Belai from the MPs hotline, who has been very helpful, even when I have called him from home at the weekend. My <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> staff, James, David, Pat, Emma and Darren, have also worked extremely hard alongside me during the past few weeks to try to help my constituents. I will pick out a couple of cases to highlight the stress under which this problem has placed my constituents and use those cases to illustrate some of the points that the Home Secretary did not address in her opening statement. I hope that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will address them in his closing remarks.</p> <p pid="b.1162.0/2">First, however, I want to come back on a couple of points made by Government Members. The whole speech made by <a href="/mp/?m=40456" title="Our page on Michael Ellis - 'the hon. Member for Northampton North (Michael Ellis)'">Michael Ellis</a>, who is no longer <a href="/glossary/?gl=145" title="Of a male MP, sitting on his regular seat in the House. For females, &quot;in..." class="glossary">in his place</a>, was based on the assertion that there is a 97% success rate and the situation is getting better. He must have heard a different speech from the one I heard from the Home Secretary, because she was clear that the success rate is 89%, so it is getting worse. I appreciate that <a href="/mp/?m=40518" title="Our page on John Glen - 'the hon. Member for Salisbury (John Glen)'">John Glen</a> said that he had only had four cases and that he had also worked to try to help his constituents, but I feel he was trying to imply that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> were making a mountain out of a molehill. I have 30 cases at the moment, and even the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>&#8217;s figures show that, on average, there are 46 cases in each constituency, so I have not got as many cases as some hon. Members.</p> <p pid="b.1162.0/4">The first case that I would like to highlight is that of Emma Goldie. She applied on <phrase class="date" code="2014-04-24">24 April</phrase> so that she could go on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> with Caldervale high school in my constituency, and her family saved up to pay the &#163;1,200 that she needed to go. I have been fighting with the Passport Office for the past few days to get her a passport, because she has not heard anything. I was told last night that the staff would try to get her an interview in Glasgow today. Unfortunately, she got a phone call this morning to say that her passport would not be ready for weeks. I apologise for the fact that I have been doing a lot of texting and emailing while I have been sitting in the Chamber, but we have managed to get her an interview in Glasgow.</p> <p pid="b.1162.0/5">That case raises two points. First, I tried to contact the Durham office, which is dealing with our case, through the MPs hotline yesterday, and I was told that it is no longer picking up the phone not only to inquiries from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a>, but to the MPs hotline itself. I asked for that to be confirmed in writing, by e-mail, and I was told that the gentleman I spoke to was not authorised to do that. However, he sent me his contact details, so I can pass them to the Minister if that is helpful.</p> <p pid="b.1162.0/6">Secondly, my constituent was repeatedly put off because her travel date was not until this <phrase class="date" code="2014-06-20">Friday, 20 June</phrase>. I understand that the Passport Office is dealing with cases in order of travel date, and I can see the logic in that when we are in such a crisis, but the date of travel is not always the date on which someone needs their passport. If someone has to apply for a visa, for instance&#8212;or, if they are travelling to America, an electronic system for travel authorisation visa waiver, which was the case for my constituent&#8212;they will need their passport before the date on which they travel. Will the Minister take on board the fact that the date on which the passport is needed is not necessarily the same as the date of travel? Will the Passport Office look at that, ask applicants for the date on which their passport will be needed and change the order of applications to reflect that?</p> <p pid="b.1162.0/7">The other case I want to raise is that of a gentleman who missed his first day in a new job abroad this week. He and his family are now terrified that he has lost the job, and I am supporting them and hoping that that is not the case. That happened through no fault of his own, because he applied for the passport a while ago. The same gentleman and his wife have also been saving for three years to take their children to Disneyland later this week, but he still does not have his passport. He has been asked to go to Peterborough for an interview. Why are Scottish people not being given interviews at Glasgow passport office? We are fighting for that, but I have had constituents going to Durham and Peterborough. All Scots should be going to Glasgow.</p> <p pid="b.1162.0/8">Finally, I reiterate the points that have been made about compensation. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> has said that the success of the economy has led to the influx of passport applications. If those applications are from people who have not been able to afford a holiday until now, I suggest that those people will be the least able to afford the extra costs that they have incurred as a result of this situation, and I ask for them to be compensated fully.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.1164.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40038" title="Our page on Pamela Nash - 'the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (Pamela Nash)'">Pamela Nash</a>, who aptly outlined the serious consequences of some of these cases for people&#8217;s lives. I have seen very many similar cases myself. I add my thanks to the many staff with whom my office have been dealing. I thank my own staff, who have been dealing with people in great distress about the consequences of not being able to get passports or travel documents in time, for all sorts of reasons, and in many countries around the world as well as here in the UK.</p> <p pid="b.1164.0/2">I particularly thank the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8217;s office for dealing with a couple of the most extreme cases. However, this exemplifies the whole problem. Why am I and other Members having to speak to the Minister&#8217;s office late on a Friday evening and put those staff under additional pressure to deal with people who are clearly under a lot of pressure themselves? The fact that we have arrived at that situation exemplifies the problems that have been experienced all over the country. Among many of the constituents to whom I have spoken, there is a real loss of confidence in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a>&#8217;s ability to deliver one of its most basic functions and one of our most basic rights&#8212;that of being able to prove our citizenship and to travel freely around the world as a result.</p> <p pid="b.1164.0/3">One case of which the Minister will be aware involved a couple and their child in China who were being threatened not only with fines for not having a passport for their child but, potentially, deportation or even jail if they did not get their passport, causing them great difficulties. When we are supposed to be promoting constituents trading and engaging in commerce all around the world and expanding Britain&#8217;s links with countries such as China, it is terrible for them to have to go through that experience and potentially have to leave China, with great consequences for their business there.</p> <p pid="b.1164.0/4">One of the other key concerns, sadly, has been about the service that several people have received when they have tried to get in contact with the Passport Office by phone. That is not in any way to denigrate the efforts of the staff, who are under an awful amount of stress and clearly have not been given the resources and backing to be able to do their jobs. Some people have been told that they are going to be called back within 48 hours but that has not happened. Others have called from countries where phone calls back to the UK are very expensive, been put on hold for ages and then told to phone back because the computer systems had broken down or told that they would be phoned back when the computer systems were working, but that has not happened. A constituent told me about a case that arose only yesterday. She says:</p> <p pid="b.1164.0/5">&#8220;I had a call back from the passport office today who said that despite me being told I was going to be fast tracked&#8230;I have delayed this process more by calling them&#8221; to find out how the application is progressing. She continues:</p> <p pid="b.1164.0/7">&#8220;Every time I ring it logs my call and then they have 2 working days after my call to respond. So I now I should not hear from them until Friday. Surely this can&#8217;t be how the process works?&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1164.0/8">The sense of absolute exasperation that people are feeling shows the serious problems that we are facing.</p> <p pid="b.1164.0/9">There is a lack of clarity from the Home Secretary about several issues, particularly refunds. Another issue is the contradictory or unclear information that we have been receiving. We have heard a lot about the state of the information on the website, and I have experienced that myself. As regards the information that is being provided, or not provided, to our posts overseas&#8212;to embassies and high commissions&#8212;the system is not working. I mentioned Qatar, but I am aware of other places where officials are clearly not being empowered to be able to support our constituents. It is a shame that we do not have a Foreign Office Minister here. I hope that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Minister">Immigration Minister</a> and the Home Secretary will be in regular contact with Foreign Office officials to make sure that these issues are dealt with swiftly. Unfortunately, this situation represents a much wider problem at the Home Office in terms of information that is provided on websites and to constituents. I repeatedly deal with cases of people getting false information about processing times, guidance on visa applications, and all sorts of other things. There needs to be a deep and radical look at what is happening about the information that is provided to the public.</p> <p pid="b.1164.0/10">Having heard today&#8217;s speeches, I am left in no doubt about the causes of this situation. I fully associate myself with the comments by my hon. Friends the Members for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_West">Newport West</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Flynn">Paul Flynn</a>) and for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_East">Newport East</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Morden">Jessica Morden</a>) about the cutbacks in the service in Wales, as well as the comments by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_and_Commercial_Services_Union">Public and Commercial Services Union</a> about the overall cuts to the service. The changes to overseas applications have had a massive impact. There has been a lack of serious oversight and management of the issue at senior levels within the Home Office. That goes to the heart of the matter. I hope that the Minister will be able to outline some of the costs to the system as a whole as a result of this&#8212;not only in terms of diversion of staff time, overtime costs, and other costs to the Home Office, but the costs to staff through the additional stress they have been put under. Sadly, I have a list of six or seven cases that we have yet to resolve in addition to the existing caseload of nearly 30. I will share those with the Minister&#8217;s office, and I very much hope that he can help in addressing these concerns.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.1166.1/1">I will not, because I understand that a number of Members want to speak and we are going to have the closing speeches shortly. I would not want to take time away from someone who has been waiting here all afternoon to speak.</p> <p pid="b.1166.1/2">When the Conservative Government were elected, they introduced a policy of closing passport offices throughout the country. They closed 22 passport offices and one processing centre. There has been outsourcing of work, and it is feared that there will be more. That is very significant in this context, not only because of the numbers of staff who have been lost but because of the reorganisations that have been taking place, which, in themselves, cause a great deal of concern.</p> <p pid="b.1166.1/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> spoke about the additional staff she has been bringing in to do this work over the past few days and weeks, perhaps longer. Those staff have been transferred from other parts of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a>, particularly the immigration and visa sections. It would usually take at least six weeks to train up a member of staff to do such work, but the people being transferred are being trained over the weekend, or in a few days, to do jobs that are incredibly important for the security of this country. It is vital that this work is done properly.</p> <p pid="b.1166.1/4">The other way in which the Government have been dealing with this issue over the past few months is to allow staff overtime&#8212;not only staff who usually do these jobs but those on far higher grades with far higher salaries who do not usually do this kind of work and, frankly, are not best equipped to do it. We have to learn the lessons of similar crises in the past. We must ensure that we have sufficient, properly trained permanent passport staff in place to deal with work that needs to be done at every point in the year.</p> <p pid="b.1166.1/5">In the last financial year, the Passport Office made profits of &#163;70 million, so it is not a sector of Government that should be affected by the austerity cuts. The Government have treated it like other Departments by insisting that there should be cuts in staffing, but people pay for this service, and there is an obligation on Government to make sure that they get an efficient service.</p> <p pid="b.1166.1/6">My constituents, like others, are travelling all round the country to try to get a passport. Over the past few days, I have heard from constituents who have been going from Ayrshire on the west coast of Scotland to Durham, Liverpool and other parts of the country. Some have been asked to go to Belfast, although I think we have managed to make sure that they have not been required to cross the Irish sea to get their problems sorted out. We need to review the idea that closing the network of passport offices has been a success, and I hope that this debate will take that forward.</p> <p pid="b.1166.1/7">A number of constituents have already lost their holidays as a result of what is happening. I would like to raise one case of the many cases that have been raised with me. My constituent, who had lost her passport, went from Ayrshire to the Liverpool passport office on</p> <p pid="b.1166.1/8"><phrase class="date" code="2014-06-10">10 June</phrase>. She was due to fly out of the country on <phrase class="date" code="2014-06-16">Monday 16 June</phrase> but has still has not done so. She is hoping that if she could fly out tomorrow or later this week, she could at least have some of her holiday. If I give the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> the details of that case, will he look into it?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.1167.0/1">As we have heard, the Government&#8217;s own passport advice website clearly states:</p> <p pid="b.1167.0/2">&#8220;It should take 3 weeks to get the passport&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b.1167.0/3">It still said that the last time I looked at it, despite the crisis outlined in detail today. One of the first things the Home Secretary could have done was update the website in order not to give people the expectation of a three-week wait. Constituents started contacting me eight weeks ago about the delays and problems they were experiencing in getting passports. As I have said, the Scottish holidays come that bit earlier and the traditional holiday period in Inverclyde means that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of people plan to go on a two-week holiday at the very start of July. I have seen this problem coming for some time.</p> <p pid="b.1167.0/4">The problems that people come to my office to tell me about focus largely on first-time passports for adults and children and, of course, name changes. Some of my constituents who have needed to update their passports have even been asked to travel to Liverpool. That means travelling some distance, and we can only imagine the expenses they will incur to go there and get a passport.</p> <p pid="b.1167.0/5">The delays have caused widespread misery and panic for many of my constituents who want to go on holiday or need a passport for identity purposes, including getting a job. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> referred to the courier service, which my constituents have experienced; it has not been delivering during out-of-office hours, including the weekend, so it has been a restricted service. I hope the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will be able to confirm that that will not continue.</p> <p pid="b.1167.0/6">The Passport Office said in its defence that there was no backlog and the Home Secretary backed it up, but a leaked e-mail from its interim chief executive said that there was trouble. Newspapers have reported that requests for passports are up by some 300,000 on the previous year, and the Passport Office has been advising some holidaymakers to pay a fast-track fee up front, to make sure they get their passports in time. As I said, even those of my constituents who have received their passports have been told they must drive to other passport offices to collect them.</p> <p pid="b.1167.0/7">During the second week of June, the unions claimed that the backlog in passport applications was surging above 500,000, despite the emergency plans that had been put in place at the time. The unions made it clear that the agency was in crisis due to job cuts and office closures. The Passport Office, however, was not short of money. It recorded a surplus of &#163;72 million in 2012-13, so why has it been cutting staff? While the Home Secretary has been focusing on arguments with her colleagues, she has taken her eye off the ball and let this crisis get out of hand. I welcome the fact that she has apologised today.</p> <p pid="b.1167.0/8">As I said, my office has been speaking about constituents with the passport service for many weeks. I thank the passport service for the work it has done and my office staff for the many hours they have put in to make sure that my constituents will be able to go on holiday. My office are still dealing with requests for passports. One of my constituents was due to go on holiday but had waited until the last minute. Last week, he paid the premium and finally got his passport on Friday the 13th. He was due to fly that weekend, so the date was not unlucky for him. My <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> office is still being inundated with cases, so Members can imagine the panic and upset the situation is causing.</p> <p pid="b.1167.0/10">The Home Secretary has said that fees for the premium service will be waived. I welcome that, but it is too little, too late for my constituents, because they have had to put their hands in their pockets and stump up the premium payment to get their passport so that they can travel. Many have scrimped and saved all year round to be able to afford a family holiday, which is not easy at a time of a cost of living crisis. They deserve at the very least to be reimbursed.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.1168.0/1">I would love to talk in detail about the 21 families who have contacted my office and discuss the run-around they have been given, the call-backs they never get and their wasted trips to Liverpool and Durham. I would like to talk about the work time I have lost and the difficulties that Mathew, my fantastic case worker, has had with the parliamentary line. He has waited on the line for 90 minutes; he has not been able to get through at all at other times. It takes 24 hours to get a reply to a complaint and he cannot ring back the person dealing with the case. Furthermore, the tracking line is constantly engaged.</p> <p pid="b.1168.0/2">In the short time I have, however, I want to talk about my most dire case. After nearly 12 years of trying for a baby, my constituents Kiran and Bina took the brave decision to use a specialist surrogacy clinic in India. After five attempts, they have been blessed with twins, who were born on <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-03">3 March</phrase>. The babies were very premature and had a very low birth weight of under 3 lbs. The couple got citizenship for their babies within a week and were told they would get their passports within six weeks. Before the cuts, those applications would have been dealt with in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, but now their documents have been sent to Liverpool and they have been told that the process will take 16 weeks. They were promised calls back from the Passport Office, but they never materialised. E-mails have not been received and they are desperate. I have contacted the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and, although there is some movement, there is still no resolution.</p> <p pid="b.1168.0/3">Kiran and Bina tell me that they and their tiny babies are literally prisoners in their hotel room because of the 45 degree heat. They are not staying in the Ritz; it is a cheap hotel with very basic amenities and terrible air conditioning. They are running out of money; Kiran is now on unpaid leave and they are worried about their mortgage and <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">bills</a> at home. He is worried that he may lose his job and, with the onset of the rainy season, they are terrified that their babies will get malaria.</p> <p pid="b.1168.0/4">Kiran and Bina are the proud parents of premature twins and are desperate to bring them home to meet the rest of their family and friends, to be close to medical care and to start their dream life as mum and dad. Instead, they have already wasted three precious months of their babies&#8217; lives stuck in a hot, uncomfortable hotel room with peeling wall paper.</p> <p pid="b.1168.0/5">They are just one family out of many. Mr and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs_Patel">Mrs Patel</a>&#8217;s baby was born in January. Mr Patel is on unpaid leave and they are also running out money; their health is suffering because they cannot afford to eat properly. Their baby has spent six months stuck in a hotel room. What is the cost on his development?</p> <p pid="b.1168.0/6">Of course, it is not just new parents and babies who are suffering. The daughter of the Patels&#8217; surrogate cannot start school because her papers are with the Passport Office. Why cannot there be an expedited system for passports for surrogate children, as is the case with citizenship? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> said earlier that these situations are complex, so why is there not a specialist team dealing with these cases?</p> <p pid="b.1168.0/7">This is not just about the awful conditions these families are in. They have to apply for parental orders in the UK within six months of the birth of their children. Their visas are running out and they have been told that emergency travel documents are not the answer, because they would have to withdraw their applications for passports and retrieve their documentation before they could get them. In addition, an exit visa is required for all newborns to be able to leave India, but it cannot be obtained without a passport. The Indian high commission continues to say that, as first-time applicants, these babies cannot travel on emergency documentation.</p> <p pid="b.1168.0/8">I am pleading with the Home Secretary to help these families and directly intervene: please help Kiran and Bina and the other families to bring their babies home.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.1169.0/1">I echo the concerns raised by many hon. and right hon. Members about the problems that delays in issuing passports are causing constituents. The situation is distressing for many of them. I have witnessed that with regard to not only my own constituents, but the many people from across the country who have had to travel to Durham to sort out issues with the Passport Office and have ended up in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> office. Overseas citizens have also made representations to my office. I say to <a href="/mp/?m=40518" title="Our page on John Glen - 'the hon. Member for Salisbury (John Glen)'">John Glen</a> that if he thinks that <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members are in some way concocting the problem, he should try being a member of staff at my constituency office.</p> <p pid="b.1169.0/2">I want to focus on the impact the debacle is having on Passport Office staff. It has an office in my constituency and I know how hard the staff have been working in recent weeks and months to try to alleviate the crisis. We need to thank them, because if so many of them had not gone the extra mile, the situation would be worse than the one we are facing today.</p> <p pid="b.1169.0/3">Let us be clear: responsibility for this dreadful situation rests with the Home Secretary&#8212;I am glad she is back <a href="/glossary/?gl=144" title="Of a female MP, sitting on her regular seat in the House. For males, &quot;in..." class="glossary">in her place</a>&#8212;and her Government. The Government have inadequately resourced the Passport Office, despite the fact that it is paid for by users of the service. We heard from my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> Home Secretary, who gave an excellent speech, that the Home Secretary will blame anyone but her Government for this shambles. I want the Home Secretary to take responsibility for this issue and answer some of my questions so that I can better understand why my constituents who need to use or work in the Passport Office, are currently experiencing such a stressful situation.</p> <p pid="b.1169.0/4">When and why was the decision taken to transfer responsibility for issuing passports to citizens living overseas to the UK, without any proper assessment of the additional strain that that would put on the system here? I have heard that in Durham alone that means processing a few hundred thousand extra passports. If those on the Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> dispute those figures, they need to give me the accurate figures as I have not been able to obtain them from the Department. When did the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> realise that there was a problem in trying to process applications from citizens living overseas, and when did it move experienced staff from other areas to that section, thereby growing the backlog in other areas?</p> <p pid="b.1169.0/5">What is the situation regarding the reduction in staff numbers? The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_and_Commercial_Services_Union">Public and Commercial Services Union</a> has stated that 600 fewer staff are now working in the Passport Office than in 2010, and today we heard that that was because of the withdrawal of identity cards. I understand that most identity card work was carried out in the Durham office, and in 2010 the Home Office told me that that meant a reduction of 68 staff, not 600. We need clarity on that.</p> <p pid="b.1169.0/6">Why has there been a delay in paying overtime to staff? Those staff earn between &#163;7 and &#163;9 per hour for processing work and checking passport applications. Apparently, they have to process about 17 passports every hour, yet only in June were they given double time for working additional hours&#8212;a very laggardly response from the Government. Is the Home Secretary satisfied that overall staffing levels and levels of remuneration are correct, given the sensitive nature of the job? Staff are now dealing with very frustrated and often distressed and angry people. What training have they been given to enable them to work in that situation? Sometimes people manning the call centre have more than 100 calls waiting. I hope the Home Secretary will tell the House what she will do to compensate staff who are dealing with that dreadful situation. They have not done anything to create this situation, but they are doing their utmost to help sort it out.</p>            </div>

Lady.</p> <p pid="b.1170.2/2">I had one case where, unfortunately, someone was not able to get their passport in time. That was not a straightforward case, as the Home Secretary set out&#8212;it was a first- time passport for a child, and travel plans had been made in a hurry because of a family situation, so the trip had not been planned for long. I am sorry that my constituent was not able to get the support they needed, but in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> that has been the only such case so far.</p> <p pid="b.1170.2/3">There has clearly been enormous demand for passports. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> spoke about a 12-year high in the number of applications, and any organisation would find its resources strained by such a large increase in demand. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_10">A 10</a>% increase in passport applications on the previous year will clearly put strain on the system. Quite properly, the debate is about whether the Passport Office should have anticipated that extra level of demand and put resources in place to cope with it. I am interested in the Passport Office&#8217;s recruitment levels, and whether such planning took place.</p> <p pid="b.1170.2/4">We said there was a 10% increase in applications, and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> Home Secretary asked&#8212;quite properly&#8212;whether that surge was due to applications from overseas, and what proportion of that 10% were overseas applications. The Home Secretary said that overseas applications made up less than half of applications, and we are waiting for further information on that. It may not be as straightforward as it seems, however, because some people previously living abroad may have applied for a passport in the UK, rather than through an overseas office, and the data may not be quite as straightforward.</p> <p pid="b.1170.2/5">Let us say for argument&#8217;s sake that around half of the increase in passport applications has come from overseas. I note that Passport Office staffing levels have risen by about 10% over the past two years, and are about 6% up on last year. If there was an increase in staff of about 6% from 2013-14, and if an uplift in overseas applications of about 5% was anticipated, it seems that reasonable preparation in terms of staffing levels was made. Therefore, the pressure has come not from the change in how passports are issued from the UK instead of from overseas, but because of an unanticipated level of normal applications. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_6">The 6</a>% increase in staffing levels year on year in the Passport Office shows that preparations were made and put in place for anticipated extra demand, but that demand went far beyond what could have been reasonably expected.</p> <p pid="b.1170.2/6">I was pleased when the Home Secretary said that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=179" title="A Permanent Secretary is a top civil servant- there is a permanent..." class="glossary">permanent secretary</a> is conducting a review into the workings of the Passport Office to see what lessons can be learned. There is clearly an issue this year that the Home Secretary and her team are working hard to address, and we do not want to be in this position in the future.</p> <p pid="b.1170.2/7">What drivers of passport applications should be fed into the system? Should we give more consideration to the impact of an economic uplift, which may lead to more travel? Should we look at birth rates, or at renewal rates so that we can more easily anticipate when extra passports are likely to be applied for and ensure that that is factored in? As <a href="/mp/?m=40174" title="Our page on Roberta Blackman-Woods - 'the hon. Member for City of Durham (Roberta Blackman-Woods)'">Roberta Blackman-Woods</a> said, users are paying for this system; passports are not issued for free and people pay for them. It is, therefore, reasonable to expect the Passport Office to put in place the resources it needs to anticipate demand. Could we be cleverer at working out ways to anticipate demand?</p> <p pid="b.1170.2/8">As I said earlier, looking at the year-on-year figures and at the increase in recruitment to the Passport Office in the past year, it would certainly have coped with extra demand placed on it from overseas applications. We must ensure that we are ready for next year if there is a further surge in passport applications, particularly if that is driven by the economic confidence coming from the growing economy.</p>            </div>

Members across the House in thanking the hard-pressed Passport Office staff, the people working on the helpline and, dare I say, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8217;s office for the efforts that they are making for constituents who have received their passports following the interventions of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a>. My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40038" title="Our page on Pamela Nash - 'the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (Pamela Nash)'">Pamela Nash</a>&#8212;and my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40174" title="Our page on Roberta Blackman-Woods - 'the Member for City of Durham (Roberta Blackman-Woods)'">Roberta Blackman-Woods</a>, who has a passport office in her <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>&#8212;have made that point. Indeed, <a href="/mp/?m=40576" title="Our page on Stephen McPartland - 'the hon. Member for Stevenage (Stephen McPartland)'">Stephen McPartland</a> also made that point, although I cannot compete with him in making my own passport as he said he did in a former career. He would probably need a passport to go back to Liverpool now, given his current political affiliations.</p> <p pid="b.1172.0/2">I have no quibble with the hard work, dedication or efforts of passport staff, especially on last-minute cases, to ensure that people have their holidays. But I must echo the point made by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40692" title="Our page on Stephen Doughty - 'the Member for Cardiff South and Penarth (Stephen Doughty)'">Stephen Doughty</a> when he said that constituents should not have to involve Members of Parliament to get their passports on time. People are paying for the service, which made a &#163;73 million surplus last year. <a href="/mp/?m=40456" title="Our page on Michael Ellis - 'The hon.

For females, &quot;in..." class="glossary">in his place</a>, was in denial about the impact of the problems on constituents across the country.</p> <p pid="b.1172.0/3">Clearly, despite the efforts of the staff, there is something wrong with the delivery of passport services at the moment. The motion makes three points. First, it expresses the frustration of Members of Parliament about the experiences of their constituents who have applied for passports, including lengthy delays and the consequential cancellation of holidays, business trips and visits. My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40354" title="Our page on George Mudie - 'the Member for Leeds East (Mr Mudie)'">Mr Mudie</a> made great play of his concerns about the number of individuals he has had to deal with.</p> <p pid="b.1172.0/4">Secondly, the motion points out how the Government have failed to plan properly to meet the level of demand this year. Thirdly, and crucially, it calls on the Government to expand their emergency measures and to look at compensating passport applicants who have had to pay for urgent upgrades. I shall consider each issue in turn to scrutinise the Government&#8217;s record.</p>            </div>

I understand the reasons behind that decision&#8212;Ministers are concerned about consistency and security&#8212;but we need to review whether those are concerns in all cases. We also need to review the procedures that have been used to repatriate the process, because they have not worked, in my view. There were discussions yesterday and today about the issue, and I would welcome the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8217;s comments.</p> <p pid="b.1173.0/2">As my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40688" title="Our page on Iain McKenzie - 'the Member for Inverclyde (Mr McKenzie)'">Mr McKenzie</a> said, the passport website still has a three-week web promise for passport delivery. I would like to know from the Minister whether that is still the norm for delivery of passports. Will the Minister commit today to maintaining the three-week delivery time? The Passport Office chief executive has said that we had a 16% under-forecast of demand. We initially thought that the extra demand was 350,000 applications, but the chief executive confirmed yesterday&#8212;in response to my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40358" title="Our page on Keith Vaz - 'the Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)'">Keith Vaz</a>&#8212;that it is 400,000. The Passport Office has now ordered an independent review of forecasting. Yesterday, the chief executive said that 493,289 passport applications were &#8220;in progress&#8221;. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> does not use the words &#8220;delay&#8221; or &#8220;backlog&#8221;: everything is &#8220;work in progress&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b.1173.0/3">My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40427" title="Our page on Yvette Cooper - 'the Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)'">Yvette Cooper</a> tested the Home Secretary on the figures before the House today. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> said that applications this year are 3.3 million, up from 2.95 million last year&#8212;an increase of 350,000. She also said that 6% of the 3.3 million applications were from overseas, and that is 200,000 applications. Last year, those 200,000 applications were dealt with by the Foreign Office, so&#8212;as my right hon. Friend said&#8212;200,000 of the 350,000 increase came from overseas. I hope that the Minister will tell us what has caused the increase in demand.</p> <p pid="b.1173.0/4">My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40186" title="Our page on Geoffrey Robinson - 'the Member for Coventry North West (Mr Robinson)'">Mr Robinson</a> asked that question. Is it because of the repatriation of dealing with overseas residents&#8217; passports&#8212;about which my hon.

I also welcome the Home Secretary&#8217;s apology, but an apology is not enough. We need a clear exposition on what has caused this problem.

Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40387" title="Our page on Gerald Kaufman - 'the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)'">Sir Gerald Kaufman</a>. May I just note in passing that he celebrates 44 years in the House today? The human cost was also mentioned by my hon.

The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMPO">HMPO</a> annual report last year stated that there would be approximately 350,000 additional customers worldwide annually, so why did the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> not act?

If this was a problem in January, why is that the case? The issues of training and recruitment could all have been anticipated by the Government. What has been the impact of moving fraud staff and others on to passports? Confidence in the measures announced by the Home Secretary has not been clear from Members here today.</p> <p pid="b.1174.0/6">In the one minute I have left I will turn to compensation. Will the Minister tell me, either today or at a future date, how many extra payments have been made by people to ensure they receive their passports on time? Why is the offer applicable only from Thursday to a limited section of people? Will the Minister commit himself to looking at the number of people who have been hit by the extra charge for fast-tracking and say whether he will repay them? Will he look at the issue of the date, rather than the date of travel, for the reasons set out by my hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts?</p> <p pid="b.1174.0/7">It is clear that the problem was known. It is clear that inadequate action was taken. It is clear that there is still a problem now. It is clear that Ministers were not on top of the job and not on top of their work. It is clear that they failed the public who pay for this service. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> probably needs to take a holiday.

Members across the House have sought to bring to Ministers&#8217; attention a number of individual cases? That is precisely what <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a> are for&#8212;to represent their constituents. I understand why they have sought to use this debate to do that. This debate has underlined the work of the Passport Office in seeking to respond to and address the concerns that have been flagged. Like other right hon. and hon. Members, I pay tribute to the hard work, dedication and professionalism of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMPO">HMPO</a> staff who are working to process applications and respond to individual customer and MP inquiries. We recognise the need to service MPs&#8217; individual requests. That is why, from the start of this week, the MP team was strengthened to ensure that a service is provided to deal with those individual cases.</p> <p pid="b.1175.0/2">I note the number of individual cases and circumstances that have been flagged. Sadly, in the time available, I will not be able to respond to each of them, but a careful note is being taken of a number of them. A note is also being taken of some of the points that have been made, for example on the courier services. I have heard that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DX">DX</a> is working late evenings, but we will look at each case. We will also look at each point that has been flagged on individual countries.</p> <p pid="b.1175.0/3">I underline our commitment to focus on those individual circumstances that have been flagged, but I also underline the Home Secretary&#8217;s message. We apologise to anyone who has been affected by their passport not being delivered when expected through no fault of their own. I understand the concerns that have been flagged and the individual cases that have been raised. I understand the concerns of <a href="/mp/?m=40387" title="Our page on Gerald Kaufman - 'the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)'">Sir Gerald Kaufman</a> and his desire to raise individual cases, but I say to him in careful terms that the tone and nature of his contribution did not fit the debate.</p> <p pid="b.1175.0/4">I should like to underline some of the individual actions we have taken to address the current high volume of passport applications. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty">Her Majesty</a>&#8217;s Passport Office issued 3.3 million passports in the first five months of the year, compared with 2.95 million in the same period last year.<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140707/corrtext/140707c0001.htm#column_2MC"><i><big>[This section has been corrected on 7 July 2014, column 2MC &mdash; read correction]</big></i></a> We have had an additional 350,000 applications compared with last year, and the highest demand for passports in 12 years.</p> <p pid="b.1175.0/5">I stress to <a href="/mp/?m=40199" title="Our page on David Hanson - 'the right hon. Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson)'">Mr Hanson</a> that our actions have not just happened in recent weeks. Since January, HMPO has put in place measures to deal with the increase, and the vast <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of customers have received their passports on time and straightforward renewals of passports within the three-week period. I stress to him that the website advises:</p> <p pid="b.1175.0/6">&#8220;It should take 3 weeks to get the passport - use a different service if you need the passport urgently&#8230;It can take longer if more information is needed or your application hasn&#8217;t been filled out correctly.&#8221;</p>            </div>

Obviously Ministers receive regular updates from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMPO">HMPO</a>, which indicated that additional measures were being put in place to deal with demand.</p> <p pid="b.1177.0/2">As the right hon. Gentleman will know, HMPO&#8217;s performance figures up to May show that 97% of straightforward applications were dealt with within three weeks and 99% within four weeks. When it comes to claims of a backlog, it is important to note that there are approximately 480,000 active applications currently being processed. It is not unusual during peak periods for HMPO to operate with high numbers of applications in the system at any one time, with this year seeing the highest level for 12 years&#8212;as I have indicated, some of the inflow and outflow gives a sense of that. HMPO is a fast-moving, demand-led business. It receives up to 150,000 domestic applications and around 9,000 overseas applications in any given week. Those applications are necessarily at different stages of the examination process, on what we might describe as a production line, and they have to be scrutinised carefully, for the reasons that have been underlined&#8212;security and to ensure that the gold standard of the British passport is maintained.</p> <p pid="b.1177.0/3">Hon. Members raised the issue of the Newport passport office, which continues to operate as a customer service centre, offering face-to-face passport applications for premium and fast-track customers, with 150 full-time equivalent posts.</p>            </div>

To address the point made earlier, we are also in close contact with the Glasgow office on the availability of individual appointments. On the staffing point, I again underline what the Home Secretary said&#8212;and, indeed, the point my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40456" title="Our page on Michael Ellis - 'the Member for Northampton North (Michael Ellis)'">Michael Ellis</a> made&#8212;about the increase in numbers since 2012. We now have 3,444 full-time equivalent staff.</p> <p pid="b.1177.2/3">However, we recognise how important passports are, as well as securing people&#8217;s renewals in as short a time as possible. Passports are not just dry official documents; they are the key to eagerly anticipated holidays and facilitating international business travel. We recognise the need to review what has happened, which is why it is right that the Home Secretary has commissioned the reviews that she has. On the overseas transfer, that change was made to ensure greater scrutiny and security, ensuring that the gold standard of the British passport is maintained and securing greater continuity of service between all the different parts of the service.</p>            </div>

We are carefully monitoring the availability of appointments at the counter in all our offices, and we are specifically focused on Glasgow, given the understandable desire for people to get passports for their holidays. As for individual foreign cases, we have set out the guidance on the seven-day period for providing information on airline bookings and other details. I recognise the importance to each individual and each family of receiving their passports. That is why our focus remains on delivering a high-quality passport service for the benefit of the public.
