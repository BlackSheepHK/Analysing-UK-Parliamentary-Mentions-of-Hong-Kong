Copies are available in the Vote Office. He has asked me to pass on his apologies to the House for the fact that he is not present in the Chamber, as he is attending the conference on Afghanistan this afternoon.</p> <p pid="b.167.1/2">In April 2004, the Government decided to publish the first in a series of reports intended to stimulate the closer and deeper involvement of Members of both Houses in EU affairs. Today's White Paper is the fifth such report. It looks at future challenges and provides a detailed report on our presidency, set against the objectives that we set ourselves in the White Paper, published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June 2005</phrase> and relayed in a statement to the House on the same day by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary.</p> <p pid="b.167.1/3">Notwithstanding the EU's historical achievements, it has faced the pressing challenge in recent years of adapting to an increasingly globalised political and economic environment and of reconnecting as an institution to its citizens. That need was highlighted graphically last spring, when two member states rejected the constitutional treaty and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council">European Council</a> failed to agree a deal for the next financial perspective&#8212;the European budget.</p> <p pid="b.167.1/4">So when the United Kingdom took over the reins of the presidency in July, we were faced with three tasks. The first task was to follow through on Europe's promise to open accession negotiations with Turkey, against a backdrop of growing uncertainty in some parts of the EU about that aspect of future enlargement. The second task was to agree a deal for the coming financial perspective, and the third task was to begin the process of better preparing the EU for the globalised world.</p> <p pid="b.167.1/5">First, I turn to enlargement. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-03">3 October</phrase>, we opened accession talks with Turkey&#8212;that decision was welcomed on, and supported by, both sides of the House. That has the potential to bring huge economic and political benefits to Turkey, Britain and the European Union, not least through the Union's relationship with the wider Islamic world. At the same time, and in a welcome sign of how far the western Balkans has come in recent years, we opened accession negotiations with Croatia, began stabilisation and association agreement negotiations with Bosnia and Serbia and Montenegro, and granted candidate status to Macedonia.</p> <p pid="b.167.1/6">On the budget, we brokered a deal that will shift spending towards the economic development of the newer, poorer member states and also mean that similar sized economies such as France and Italy will finally be making payments roughly on a par with the United Kingdom. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Council">The Council</a> also agreed a full, wide-ranging review covering all aspects of EU spending, including the common agricultural policy, to report in 2008&#8211;09.</p> <p pid="b.167.1/7">Finally, we took practical steps to strengthen economic reform within the European Union. Along with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=234" title="The European Commission is the politically independent institution that..." class="glossary">European Commission</a>, we agreed better ways of assessing the effects of proposed regulation on business. We also reached agreement on the capital requirements directive, which will help the European banking sector to remain competitive, and agreed the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals&#8212;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REACH">REACH</a>&#8212;regulation. In two other areas directly related to the competitiveness agenda&#8212;the services directive and the working time directive&#8212;we made some progress during our presidency, and we will work to ensure that that is built on over the coming months.</p> <p pid="b.167.1/8">Alongside those practical measures, we also began a broader debate on the future of Europe. The special summit of European leaders here in the United Kingdom at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Court">Hampton Court</a> in October has already led to detailed work on areas such as improving European universities, increasing support for research and development and establishing a common European energy policy.</p> <p pid="b.167.1/9">The issues of Turkish accession and the European budget and the debate on the future direction of Europe set the context of our Presidency, but so, too, did other international challenges. As the White Paper reflects, development was a key priority for both the EU and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8">G8</a>. The European Union agreed, for the first time, a common vision and set out common objectives and principles for development work, as well as a comprehensive strategy on Africa. That will be backed up by the more and better development aid agreed by European member states last year, with aid doubled to $80 billion a year by 2010 and commitments on achieving the UN 0.7 per cent. gross national income target by 2015. The international finance facility for immunisation that we launched in September has the potential to prevent 5 million children from dying over the next 10 years. The deal on sugar reform will reduce trade distortion and, at the same time, save European Union consumers between $3.5 billion and $4 billion a year from 2010.</p> <p pid="b.167.1/10">Another key area of work was the increasing role of the European Union outside its direct borders. During our presidency, we oversaw the launch of European security and defence policy missions, notably to monitor the Rafah border crossing and the peace agreement in Aceh in Indonesia. The EU worked closely with partners to support Israeli disengagement from Gaza and provided policing and electoral support in Iraq. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3">E3</a> continued to lead the ongoing and complex negotiations on Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p> <p pid="b.167.1/11">During our presidency, the EU also engaged in dialogue with Russia, Ukraine, China and India and agreed a comprehensive work programme for economic co-operation with the United States of America. At the UN climate change negotiations in Montreal, against expectations, it was agreed, with European support, to begin UN talks on long-term action to address climate change and launch a process for agreeing targets beyond 2012.</p> <p pid="b.167.1/12">We had always planned to ensure that counter-terrorism efforts would be a feature of our presidency. Those efforts inevitably gained far wider currency after the tragic events of <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-07">7 July</phrase> here in London. During our presidency, the EU endorsed a new counter-terrorism strategy, agreed that phone and internet data from across Europe will be stored for use in criminal and terrorist investigations and set out an action plan to tackle radicalisation and the recruitment of terrorists.</p> <p pid="b.167.1/13">We thus handed over to the Austrians a European Union that was stronger and more confident in the future than the one that we inherited back in July. Just as we inherited an agenda from the Luxembourg presidency, there are a number of areas of work that the Austrians are charged with taking forward. Over the coming year, enlargement will continue to be high on the European agenda. We are confident that Bulgaria and Romania will be ready to join in 2007, but only if they take urgent and vigorous action to address the main areas of concern recently identified by the European Commission. We will continue to provide significant bilateral assistance to help them to achieve that goal.</p> <p pid="b.167.1/14">We expect both Turkey and Croatia to be ready to open accession negotiations on some individual chapters early in 2006. During his visit to Turkey and Cyprus last week, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary reiterated the need for Turkey to ratify and implement the protocol to the Ankara agreement. We are committed, too, to ending the isolation of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Cypriot">Turkish Cypriot</a> community and finding a way in which it can trade with European Union member states. I am sure that all members of the House would agree on the importance of achieving a successful and ambitious outcome to the Doha development round of world trade talks. We want to build on the frankly disappointing outcome of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> ministerial meeting in December, and we will continue to do all that we can to enable the round to be concluded this year.</p> <p pid="b.167.1/15">That means committing to significantly increased market access for developing countries, particularly in agriculture; substantial reductions in all trade-distorting subsidies, including the elimination of export subsidies, as agreed at Hong Kong; and effective special and differential treatment for developing countries. In the first half of this year, the European Union will take stock of the "period of reflection" agreed by the European Council last June. Among other things, that means evaluating the status of the constitutional treaty. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Kingdom">The United Kingdom</a> has always made it very clear that the priority in this period of reflection and, indeed, for the European Union more generally is economic reform and a determined effort to advance work that actually makes a difference to the lives of Europeans.</p> <p pid="b.167.1/16">That view was endorsed only this month by the President of the Commission, Jos&#233; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Barroso">Manuel Barroso</a>, who said that we should</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.167.1/17">"avoid a new <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">division</a> in Europe about institutions. The most important concern now of EU citizens is not institutional problems, but jobs and growth."</p> <p pid="b.167.1/18">The focus of the spring European Council will therefore be economic. An important part of that agenda will be the work that the European Union will take forward on the six priority areas agreed at Hampton Court in October: research and development, universities, energy, demographics, security and immigration, and the common foreign and security policy. Finally, the future financial arrangements for the Union, agreed at December's Council, now have to be agreed with the European Parliament through a new inter-institutional agreement on budgetary discipline, which will provide the necessary formal basis for EU spending for the period 2007&#8211;13.</p> <p pid="b.167.1/19">I have set out for the House the key features of the United Kingdom presidency as well as priority areas of work for the European Union over the coming six months. The fuller details in the White Paper published this morning give some sense of the depth of the business done and that which is left to do. As the White Paper makes clear, the Government are convinced that Britain's national interest is best served as a strong, active and influential member of the European Union, and I commend it to the House.</p>            </div>

We send our best wishes to the soldiers who were injured.</p> <p pid="b.170.0/2">I thank the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for giving me advance sight of the statement, and for informing the House about the Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>. Having read and heard the statement, however, many of us regard it as a non-event, to say the least. It is a curious time and place to make a statement but, nevertheless, it raises a number of interesting questions, not least because more than two thirds of the statement was retrospective and did not look at prospects for the EU in 2006.</p> <p pid="b.170.0/3">The coming year may not be as dramatic as the last for the European Union, but we should be in no doubt of its importance for the EU's future. It will be the time for the   EU to reflect on the constitution's rejection and the    long-term strategic issues that it faces on competitiveness, security and its own future as an institution in the 21st century. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> stated the Government's position with his usual confidence, but does he remember that when the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> introduced a similar statement last year, he went into detail about the Government's position on the EU budget? He told the House that the Government were working</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.170.0/4">"to ensure that future EU budgets are limited to 1 per cent. of Europe's economic output and that that money is spent where it most adds value."&#8212;[<a href="/search/?pop=1&s=date:20050203+column:994+section:debates"><i>Hansard</i>, 3 February 2005; Vol. 430, c. 994</a>.]</p> <p pid="b.170.0/5">However, the Government ended up agreeing a rise in the EU budget to 1.045 per cent., which is an increase of &#163;25 billion, but they obtained no guarantee of further common agricultural policy reform. The Foreign Secretary assured the House that Britain's rebate "remains fully justified" and reminded hon. Members that Britain had a veto. We all know what happened next&#8212;the rebate was cut by &#163;7 billion for the budget period. Does the Minister understand that hon. Members are suspicious whether what the Government say will match what the Government actually achieve?</p> <p pid="b.170.0/6"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Paper">The White Paper</a> rightly underlines the need for economic reform. Does the Minister agree that the services directive is essential in achieving a more competitive Europe? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_European_Parliament">The European Parliament</a> will vote on the directive in a fortnight. Does the Minister agree that the main aim for member states is to reach a political agreement in the Council by the March economic summit? Does he agree that there has already been extensive consultation with social partners? It would be unacceptable if further consultation became an excuse for yet more delay. Does he agree that the European Parliament's internal market and consumer protection committee has produced a balanced text to ensure the freedom to provide services, and that it should be our common goal to maintain it, particularly with regard to article 16?</p> <p pid="b.170.0/7">Turning to trade, many hon. Members on both sides of the House were disturbed to hear Commissioner Mandelson say two or three weeks ago that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=99" title="The chancellor of the exchequer is the government's chief financial..." class="glossary">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> had not spoken to him recently&#8212;it appears that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> of the Exchequer has been ignoring him&#8212;which is causing much upset on the Government Benches. I understand that the Minister is a prot&#233;g&#233; of both Commissioner Mandelson and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, which means that he is caught between a rock and a hard place. Nevertheless, will he use his good offices to get them talking? It is good to talk, but on such a crucial issue, it is vital.</p> <p pid="b.170.0/8">Does the Minister agree that Britain's opt-out from the working time directive is vital to our competitiveness in a globalised marketplace? Will the Government ensure that our opt-out is maintained in its entirety and that it will not be negotiated away in any form?</p> <p pid="b.170.0/9">Paragraph 143 of the White Paper rightly emphasises the importance of energy security. Does the Minister agree that recent events in Ukraine and Georgia prove the need for secure and diverse supplies? Will the Minister outline in more concrete terms how the Government plan to achieve that?</p> <p pid="b.170.0/10">All hon. Members agree that Europe's greatest achievement over the past two decades has been the spread of democracy throughout the continent. In March, a presidential election will be held in Europe's last remaining authoritarian state, Belarus. Why does the White Paper not mention that election? What steps will the Government and our European partners take to ensure that that election is free and fair?</p> <p pid="b.170.0/11">The middle east is a vital area for our security and for the cause of peace in the world, so Hamas's election victory must be a matter of the deepest concern. Will the Minister tell the House the criteria by which the continued funding of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority">Palestinian Authority</a> by the EU will be judged? Is it not essential that Europe and America hold a united position in dealing with Hamas? Does he agree that if a Hamas-led Palestinian Authority remains wedded to terror, it should not receive EU funding?</p> <p pid="b.170.0/12">One of the most important questions for the European Union concerns how it can modernise itself to meet the demands of the 21st century. The constitution's defeat in last year's referendums proves that the old model of integration is failing Europe and alienating its people. Does the Minister agree that a British vision of an open, flexible Europe has never been more relevant? Is not that the issue for British leadership? Will the Minister explain why no British Minister attended last week's important Sounds of Europe conference in Salzburg? How do the Government expect to influence the debate, if they do not participate?</p> <p pid="b.170.0/13">We all agree that the EU needs to be more open and accountable. To that end, what steps are the Government taking to achieve open voting in the Council and a stronger say&#8212;the so-called yellow-card procedure&#8212;on subsidiarity for national Parliaments? Some member states and EU commissioners still insist that the EU constitution will soon be ripe for revival. This month, the Foreign Secretary told us that</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.170.0/14">"it is difficult to argue that the constitution is not dead."&#8212;[<a href="/search/?pop=1&s=date:20060110+column:147+section:debates"><i>Hansard</i>, 10 January 2006; Vol. 441, c. 147</a>.]</p> <p pid="b.170.0/15">The dead parrot syndrome. Should not a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a>, leading in Europe, have a clearer view than "perhaps yes" or "perhaps no"?</p> <p pid="b.170.0/16">Britain's last presidency was marked by the contrast between the hype in the last paper presented to Parliament, and a failure to deliver fully in many areas. Over the next year, we will support the Government where they take practical steps to reform the EU to meet its long-term challenges. But it is now time for the Government to outline a British vision of Europe that can meet those challenges, rather than merely parroting what the EU requires.</p>            </div>

Gentleman the detailed figures on the proportion of European gross national income accounted for in the agreement reached at the December <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council">European Council</a>, but my recollection is that by the end of the financial period, the percentage of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNI">GNI</a> taken in the European Union's budget will be as low as that achieved in any one of the past 20 years. That is a clear victory for those of us who have argued in recent years for greater EU budgetary discipline. Indeed, comparing the agreement reached at the December European Council with the figures proposed six months earlier by the Luxembourg presidency, or with those previously proposed by the Commission, shows how effectively we argued for taking a lower percentage of European GNI within the EU's budget.</p> <p pid="b.172.0/3">The hon. Gentleman asked about the services directive, and we continue to regard it as important. An unfortunate delay on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Reading">First Reading</a> prohibited us from reaching a conclusion to our discussions during our presidency, but we want progress to be made during the Austrian presidency. It might assist the House if I make clear the issues that we came close to resolving, but which are still on the table: the directive's scope; whether it should apply to labour law, given that that was never the intention, even according to the original wording of the Bolkestein directive; and the country-of-origin principle. Discussions will continue on each of those issues, but I share the ambition of reaching a conclusion that will result in an effective services directive that can guarantee a much more open market in services. Such a market will directly benefit not just the European Union but, I am convinced, many British companies.</p> <p pid="b.172.0/4">The hon. Gentleman also asked about our discussions with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Commissioner">Trade Commissioner</a> Mandelson. Commissioner Mandelson reported the latest position on the EU to an informal meeting of trade Ministers in Brussels on Sunday evening, and another report was made yesterday to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Affairs_Council">General Affairs Council</a>, which the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> and I attended. A further ministerial discussion took place at the margins of the Davos conference, which took place in Switzerland this weekend. So I can assure the hon. Gentleman that a great deal of discussion is taking place at all levels of government, and not just with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=234" title="The European Commission is the politically independent institution that..." class="glossary">European Commission</a>. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman asks about the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> from a <a href="/glossary/?gl=128" title="In the process of debate, members of parliament need to stand up in order..." class="glossary">sedentary position</a>. There is little doubt that the Chancellor has made clear his position concerning an ambitious and balanced outcome for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, be it in speeches to the Labour party conference, in recent radio interviews, or in countless speeches made in the cause of achieving greater debt relief, aid assistance and trade justice in the years to come.</p> <p pid="b.172.0/5">Retaining the opt-out continues to be the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a>'s position, and we discussed this issue with our colleagues during the British presidency. Not only was there a blocking minority to any proposed change to the opt-out; we are increasingly winning the argument for the need for flexibility in the development of the European economy in years to come.</p> <p pid="b.172.0/6">The hon. Gentleman also asked about energy supplies in the light of developments in Ukraine and Russia. Such developments partly explain why we had what was widely judged to be an effective and helpful meeting with the Russians&#8212;an EU-Russia summit&#8212;during our presidency; why one feature of that summit was discussing the need for a structured dialogue on energy; and why at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Court">Hampton Court</a>, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> showed real prescience in identifying the need for a common approach to energy issues, ahead of the difficult negotiations that took place between Russia and Ukraine at the turn of the year. Taking forward that work on energy policy, we are examining ways of making sure that there is a genuinely open market within the European Union. Issues relating to energy security have been on many people's minds in recent weeks and months, and there is also the pressing matter of diversity of supply. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we will continue the work identified at Hampton Court and now being taken forward.</p> <p pid="b.172.0/7">I was asked about the omission from the White Paper of reference to Belarus. Only yesterday a leading politician from one of the principal <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> coalitions in Belarus met a range of delegations in Brussels, at the margins of the General Affairs Council, as well as Javier Solana, the high representative. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that in the discussions that took place, Belarus was very much in people's minds, not least as we anticipate the elections coming up in March.</p> <p pid="b.172.0/8">Next, the hon. Gentleman turned to funding for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority">Palestinian Authority</a>. There is little that I can usefully add to the contribution to the debate that has been made by our Foreign Secretary and by others in recent days, since the Palestinian Authority elections. Suffice to say that the policy remains as stated. In relation to specific British aid, I recollect that approximately half of that aid is in direct budgetary support, although that is suspended at present&#8212;indeed, it was suspended prior to the elections&#8212;because of our concerns about corruption in the Authority. The overwhelming additional resource is provided through the auspices of the United Nations. This is a subject to which I am sure the House will return in the weeks and months ahead, during which we will see the formation of a Government within the Palestinian Authority.</p> <p pid="b.172.0/9">I was questioned about the Sounds of Europe conference that took place in Salzburg this weekend, where we were capably and effectively represented by our ambassador to Vienna, Ambassador Macgregor. The conference did not invite all 25 members of the European Union to address the conference. Rather, there was a round-table series of discussions involving academics and members of think tanks. There were contributions from some politicians, and of course British delegates were present at that conference. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we will not lose any opportunity in the months ahead, whether from public platforms or in private discussions with the Austrian presidency, to continue to press the case for the kind of open Europe that we believe makes sense in a globalised world.</p> <p pid="b.172.0/10">On subsidiarity, the Sharing Power in Europe conference, which was jointly hosted with the Dutch during our presidency, specifically considered engaging national Parliaments more effectively. It was rather curious for the hon. Gentleman to begin by expressing surprise at Parliament being involved in European Union discussions, and later in the same speech arguing for greater involvement of national Parliaments in the affairs of the European Union. We regard that as an important step that needs to be taken by the EU. That is why we hosted the conference with the Dutch.</p> <p pid="b.172.0/11">I hope that that addresses each of the points that the hon. Gentleman raised, but no doubt other hon. Members will have questions for me in due course.</p>            </div>

There is much in the statement and in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> with which we do not disagree. Some of the achievements of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> presidency are rightly underlined as important achievements, notably the very significant agreement to launch accession negotiations for Turkey's eventual membership of the European Union&#8212;a decision of enormous long-term significance for the future evolution of the EU.</p> <p pid="b.174.2/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Paper">The White Paper</a> and the statement are characterised by the now time-honoured hyperbole that occurs at the end of presidencies. It is a familiar routine that whoever has occupied the presidency for six months then hypes up its achievements, almost suggesting that any presidency that preceded it or might succeed it could never reach such heights of achievement. Hyperbole aside, much in the White Paper recommends itself. I should like to ask the Minister some questions that might help us to understand whether the decisions taken in the six months of the UK presidency will stand the test of time and be durable decisions that make the difference that is claimed.</p> <p pid="b.174.2/4">On the famous, or infamous, budget deal, part of that deal includes a commitment that there should be a review of the common agricultural policy some time midway through the next budgetary period. Will that review be conducted by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=234" title="The European Commission is the politically independent institution that..." class="glossary">European Commission</a>? If so, what pressure, if any, will be brought to bear on member states to adhere to any of its recommendations? There is a legitimate concern that a review by the Commission, even were it to advocate the kind of agricultural reform that many people in this House wish for, could summarily be ignored if it was not placed on a more forceful footing. Will the review include proposals for co-financing, which Members on both sides of the House have raised as a possible future solution to the financing of the common agricultural policy?</p> <p pid="b.174.2/5"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> made much of the summit at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Court">Hampton Court</a> at which six areas of work were identified as       meriting further investigation&#8212;research and development, universities, energy, demographics, security and immigration, and the common foreign and security policy. Can the Minister give us any detail about what occurred at that summit, or subsequently, materially to affect the way in which those policies are being conducted in the European Union? It appeared then, and still appears, to have been a catch-all list of policy areas, ranging from foreign policy through to research and development, which might not contain the substance that he implied in his statement.</p> <p pid="b.174.2/6">The Minister said that the priority for this period of reflection about the fate of the constitutional treaty, and indeed the European Union more generally, must be on economic reform. That is a sentiment that many Liberal Democrat Members share. But does he think that there is no merit in any debate about the constitutional and institutional future of the European Union? Surely it is impossible to deny that in an enlarged European Union the arrangements that were in place for a much smaller club need some re-examination. Some highly positive reforms are suggested in the constitution, including greater Council openness, rearrangements of the way in which the European Union organises its common foreign and security policy, and the involvement of this House and other national Parliaments in examining EU legislation. Can the Minister assure us that while the emphasis is rightly on economic reform, such crucial constitutional and institutional issues will not be forgotten? They cannot be ignored in a club that has expanded so dramatically in recent months.</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a>, which <a href="/mp/?m=1812" title="Our page on Nicholas Clegg - 'the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg)'">Mr. Clegg</a> mentioned. He is right that the Commission will undertake a review clause, but it will ultimately be for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council">European Council</a> to decide whether to implement the changes. They could be effected in the coming financial perspective, which runs until 2013.</p> <p pid="b.176.0/3">I do not want to prejudge the review's outcome on co-financing. It is right to acknowledge that the matter has been raised on the Floor of the House several times. Other European Governments have also raised it and I suspect that it may well feature in the discussions. However, I cannot prejudge the review's outcome.</p> <p pid="b.176.0/4">The hon. Gentleman asked about progress on the priorities that were identified at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Court">Hampton Court</a> meeting in October. The six workstreams were subsequently divided into those that high representative Javier Solana would take forward and those that the Commission would tackle. If I recollect correctly, an initial progress report was made to the December European Council.</p> <p pid="b.176.0/5">Another point merits the House's consideration. The notion of the Hampton Court priorities is already entering the lexicon of European policy making. I have been encouraged by the Austrian presidency's willingness to commit time and resources to taking forward the work that we initiated in Hampton Court. If I were to identify one matter that takes special precedence, it would be the recognition in October of the importance of finding a way forward on energy security and supply and a genuinely more open energy market.</p> <p pid="b.176.0/6">The hon. Gentleman asked about institutional change. Labour Members have never denied the need for important and sensible institutional changes. Indeed, in the course of our presidency, following the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s reply to questions in one of his appearances before the European Parliament, we made progress on the transparency of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=205" title="An informal reference to the Council of the European Union." class="glossary">Council of Ministers</a>. However, it is right to reiterate that we perceive the key priorities for the coming months to be, as Jos&#233; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Barroso">Manuel Barroso</a> said, jobs and growth in the European Union and the economic reform that that requires.</p>            </div>

On diplomatic representation in Podgorica, I cannot anticipate the outcome of the referendum that is scheduled to take place later this year in Serbia and Montenegro. My understanding of the constitutional provision is that Serbia and Montenegro is entitled to hold that referendum after February this year, and that it will be held a little while after that. I can assure my hon. Friend that I will take the point that he has raised to the relevant individual in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a>.</p> <p pid="b.177.1/2">My hon. Friend also asked about Belarus. It is important to emphasise, because this bears more widely on the question of enlargement, that for certain new member states in the European Union of 25 members, Belarus is not a distant country but a near neighbour. We want to see significant change in the approach taken by the regime in Belarus to date, and we should therefore welcome the greater influence that could be brought to bear by those new member states of the European Union taking a full and active role in the development of policy towards that country.</p>            </div>

The significance of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3">E3</a> process speaks to the effective joint working between ourselves, the French and the Germans. It is no secret that there have been disagreements in the past between ourselves and one if not both of those countries on specific issues of concern in the European Union. Notwithstanding whatever challenges we may have faced bilaterally, however, I am heartened by the effective way in which we have worked directly with Berlin and Paris on this issue.</p> <p pid="b.178.2/2">My hon. Friend's question also raises the broader issue of the effectiveness of the United Nations. We have <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan">Kofi Annan</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General">Secretary-General</a> of the United Nations, here with us in London today. I was particularly encouraged by some of the conclusions that were reached at the millennium review summit in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> in September. I had the opportunity to represent the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a> the following week at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a> and to take part in meetings on behalf of the European Union during the course of that week. It was made very clear to me by the permanent representative of this Government that, had it not been for the significant steps taken by European nations in particular, prior to that summit, we would not have been able to secure the commitments either on development or on United Nations reform that many of us welcomed at the conclusion of the summit.</p>            </div>

That is why I said in my statement that we are keen to ensure that we reach an ambitious and balanced outcome in 2006 to allow sufficient authority for the President to be able to use the fast-track procedure in 2007, before it expires.</p> <p pid="b.179.0/2">On the substance of the right hon. Gentleman's point, I can assure him that we are in discussion with our other European partners&#8212;and, indeed with other countries&#8212;on how we might secure the sequenced changes to the trade rules that we were unable to secure ahead of December. The European Union has a role to play, but most observers recognise that, increasingly, Brazil and India, and certainly the United States, also have a role to play. That was, in part, the substance of the discussions that took place in the margins of the Davos conference this weekend.</p>            </div>

That is a matter of record. I fully accept, and want, further progress on agriculture, and specifically on agricultural subsidies. I was heartened in December that we managed to secure agreement on agricultural export subsidies, albeit for the later date of 2013. It is a manifesto commitment for us that we would have liked agricultural export subsidies to be phased out by 2010. None the less, there is some progress on which we can build in the months ahead.</p> <p pid="b.179.5/2">It also has to be acknowledged that as well as the EU making offers in relation to agriculture, which preceded the December <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> talks, there is an increasing responsibility that needs to be borne by other key partners in those trade talks. This is partly, not solely, an issue of agriculture. There is also the key issue of non-agricultural market access, which is why it is important that, in the weeks to come, we should talk to other partners&#8212;principally Brazil and India, but also the United States&#8212;to see whether we can secure the sequenced series of offers that would allow real progress, which eluded us all in Hong Kong.</p>            </div>

On the one hand, there is no doubt that the terms of the original Bolkestein directive did not find favour with many European partners. In that sense, I would fully expect changes to the terms of the original directive. On the other hand, the Government continue to believe as a matter of principle, and on the basis of the evidence available to us, that there is much for the European Union to gain by having an effective services directive. If one considers, for example, the progress made in prosperity and growth as a consequence of the original establishment of the single market, it ill behoves others to criticise the prospect of a genuinely single market in services. It is right, however, to have due consideration for the concerns raised, for example, in relation to labour law, as it was never the intention of those who designed the services directive to change the position fundamentally on labour law. That is why we welcome the ongoing discussions, but we would be keen to see a resolution so that we can secure the very jobs and growth about which Jos&#233; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Barroso">Manuel Barroso</a> spoke only a few weeks ago.</p>            </div>

It is very likely to be vetoed through either parliamentary vote or referendum by one of the existing member states in some years' time, and that would create a major long-term crisis in our relations with Turkey. Would it not be better to talk in terms of a special relationship that does not involve full accession?</p>            </div>

Gentleman can always be relied on to ensure that consensus does not break out absolutely in the House. I pay tribute to his long-standing interest in these issues. As for the idea of some kind of privileged partnership, Turkey has had that with the European Union for a number of years. A customs union&#8212;the Ankara protocol, which I have mentioned&#8212;applies to the original EU Fifteen, and the prospect of EU membership has been held out to Turkey for 42 years.The debate has been well rehearsed, especially the hon. Gentleman's argument about the non-recognition of an EU member state. Such issues can, of course, be addressed during the accession talks.</p> <p pid="b.182.2/2">I find common ground with the hon. Gentleman, however, on the need for fundamental reform in the Turkish economy and, indeed, in Turkish society more generally. Labour Members are convinced that those of us who share an interest in a more democratic and effective Turkey would best serve the interests of that goal by seeing Turkey join the EU, if it adheres to the rigorous thresholds of accessibility that are set out for all candidate countries.</p> <p pid="b.182.2/3">I genuinely believe, in relation to, for instance, the case of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orhan_Pamuk">Orhan Pamuk</a>&#8212;who, incidentally, said that he did not wish his trial to be seen as a bar to EU membership for Turkey&#8212;that those of us who continue to be concerned about human rights have a great deal to gain from the high level of scrutiny that will take place on civil and human rights issues relating to Turkey, given the accession process that is now under way. There is a long way to go, but continuing the accession process gives us the best guarantee we can have that the scrutiny will continue.</p>            </div>

I understood from them that the matter was raised by the European Parliament rather than the Commission. The suggestion in many British newspapers that there is a devilish plot by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=234" title="The European Commission is the politically independent institution that..." class="glossary">European Commission</a> against the great British pint is simply untrue. There is no recommendation that we should see the end of, for example, the pint of beer or the pint of milk. On the other hand, the Commission is responsible for ensuring that there can be common measures across the EU&#8212;[Hon. Members: "Ah!"] Let me answer the question. Those common measures are to guarantee the degree of transparency that is necessary to ensure that suppliers of products are not able to hoodwink consumers. If my hon. Friend opposes greater transparency in pricing, that might be of direct concern to her constituents.</p>            </div>

On the issue of economic reform, not only was there progress on the better regulation agenda, but we set down a course that will, I believe, yield results. Better regulation, whether in <a href="/glossary/?gl=101" title="Whitehall is a wide road that runs through the heart of Westminster,..." class="glossary">Whitehall</a> or Brussels, involves not just process changes&#8212;for example, regulatory impact assessments&#8212;but cultural change. I was heartened in particular by the comment of Commissioner Verheugen during the British presidency that he now regards better regulation as a key priority, not simply for the presidency of the European Union for six months, but for the Commission.</p> <p pid="b.183.4/2">On the hon. Gentleman's point about the common agricultural policy, we continue to argue for fundamental reform. We set out our position in the Government paper that was published in December. We have secured the 2008&#8211;09 review, of which I spoke in my statement and which was mentioned in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>. That will be the means by which we can secure further reform of how Europe spends its money.</p> <p pid="b.183.4/3">As for whether it was worth having the White Paper or, indeed, the statement, the Conservative party cannot have it both ways. It argues that national Parliaments are being disregarded in European policy-making, but when there is an opportunity seriously to discuss European issues, it chooses to indulge in arguments that are not entirely convincing.</p> <p pid="b.183.4/4">With your permission, Mr. <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, I will also address the other point that was put to me by my hon.
