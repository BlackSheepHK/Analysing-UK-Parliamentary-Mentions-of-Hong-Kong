                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I thank the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a> for that information. In view of the misleading remark that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=91" title="The office of Deputy Prime Minister is one that has only existed..." class="glossary">Deputy Prime Minister</a> made at <a href="/glossary/?gl=25" title="Question Time is an opportunity for MPs and Members of the House of Lords..." class="glossary">Question Time</a>, may I first ask the Leader of the House to confirm that today's debate on the civil service will take place not in <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> time but on a Government motion for the <a href="/glossary/?gl=118" title="An adjournment is a break in the course of parliamentary business.    The..." class="glossary">Adjournment of the House</a>? The record should be put straight.</p> <p>
I understand why on this occasion the right hon. Gentleman cannot give us full details of the second week's business, as he often does these days. We understand the need to be flexible at this time of year, just before the recess. However, I hope that, during the last few days before the House rises, it will be possible to have a debate on the code of conduct. I think that hon. Members would appreciate the opportunity to deal with that before the summer recess.</p> <p>
Can the Leader of the House give any information about the expected length of the overspill session in October? It would also be helpful for Members on both sides of the House if we had an early idea of the expected date of the Queen's Speech.</p> <p>
On next week's business, may I express my concern about the fact that the Lords amendments to the Nursery Education and Grant-Maintained Schools Bill will be dealt with so late on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wednesday">Wednesday</a> evening? Do the Government intend to reverse the sensible <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> on evaluation of nursery vouchers? When I asked the Leader of the House about that matter a few weeks ago, he said that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_and_Employment">Education and Employment</a> was taking careful note of the amendment.</p> <p>
Given that that statement was made several weeks ago, what does it now mean? In view of the late hour at which the amendments will be debated, are we entitled to conclude that the timing of that part of our proceedings has been arranged because the Government wish to


minimise the public attention that will be drawn to the flawed idea of nursery vouchers? It is unusual for such a controversial measure to be taken so late in the evening.</p> <p>
On a totally different matter, may I ask the Leader of the House to use his good offices to arrange for the publication of a full transcript of today's events in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Hall">Westminster Hall</a>, including the <a href="/glossary/?gl=263" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Chancellor" class="glossary">Lord Chancellor</a>'s remarks, President Mandela's moving and historic address and, of course, the outstanding response that you, Madam <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, made on behalf of us all?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>It is a pleasure to take those points in reverse order, and to echo without reserve the hon. Lady's warm words about your remarks in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Hall">Westminster Hall</a> today, Madam <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, which seemed to us all to suit the occasion, and Mr. Mandela, absolutely perfectly.</p> <p>
On the hon. Lady's rather more aggressive penultimate question, she will know that proceedings on the Nursery Education and Grant-Maintained Schools Bill have not yet been completed in <a href="/glossary/?gl=112" title="During a debate members of the House of Commons traditionally refer to the..." class="glossary">another place</a>, and that it is customary for the Government to wait for the completion of such proceedings before making comments about what they intend to do about the outcome of any part of them. As for our taking such a measure late, that may be unusual now, but it is not so long since it would have been highly usual. The reason for the timing, as I have said several times recently, is simply that, unless the House wants to sit into August, we shall have to have one or two days that are longer than those to which the House has become accustomed in recent years. There is no question of our trying to hide anything.</p> <p>
I cannot yet give an exact measure for the length of the overspill, but I expect it to be significantly shorter than in recent years; that has certainly been my aim. I shall of course do my best to ensure that a date for the Queen's Speech is given as soon as it reasonably can be.</p> <p>
The question of flexibility over business interrelates in a way with what I was saying about the Nursery Education and Grant-Maintained Schools Bill. I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her understanding of the need for flexibility. Of course, if we can release the code of conduct that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> agreed two nights ago, I very much hope to be able to provide time to debate it before the recess.</p> <p>
Lastly, on today's debate on training in the civil service, I am quite sure that my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=91" title="The office of Deputy Prime Minister is one that has only existed..." class="glossary">Deputy Prime Minister</a> had no intention of misleading the House, and I confirm that it is a debate in Government time.</p>            </div>

Is that necessary, or can we support the view of most people across the political spectrum&#8212;that we do not want seal or whale products, and that marine mammals should be able to rove the oceans without being persecuted?</p>            </div>

To date, this year we have been unable to obtain such a debate, and this is our last opportunity to request one.</p>            </div>

If it is me, I shall try to ensure its production, and if it is not, I shall try to ensure that whoever is responsible ensures it.</p>            </div>

I know that the chairman has not done so and that he has not got the kind of portfolio which, apparently, enables him to do so, but I would like him to answer this question. Why, after only two years, was the Tory party &#163;19 million in the red, and then, apparently, &#163;26 million in the black? We are all anxious to find out where the money has come from. I would like the

I make no apology for raising again this week the issue that I raised last week: benefit for ex-miners for chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The right hon. Gentleman has taken the matter up but, given that there are only two weeks before the summer recess, will he give an undertaking that it will be dealt with and the costs estimated? Will he ensure that the new arrangements go ahead without anything having to come back to the House? If further approval from the House is needed, will he make sure that that is in hand before the summer recess? Ex-miners deserve that.</p>            </div>

Separately, may I ask for a debate next week on housing?

Can the Leader of the House assure us that he will take that matter up with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSRB">SSRB</a> and that, if my suspicions are correct, he will find time to correct the error?</p>            </div>

[<i>That this House expresses profound concern about the fate of Mr. Robert Hussein following the judgments of a religious court in Kuwait that he is an apostate and therefore subject to a death penalty; calls on Her Majesty's Government to continue to press the Kuwait Government to adhere to international legal norms; and calls on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Kuwait">Government of Kuwait</a> to protect Mr. Hussein, his wife, children and property and to ensure that his religious freedom is fully and effectively guaranteed and protected according to the constitution. </i>]</p> <p>
Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is quite intolerable that someone should be threatened with death simply because of his religious beliefs? My right hon. Friend will remember that Kuwait was liberated, five years ago, by people of all religions and none. It is therefore wrong for fundamentalist Muslims to threaten to kill someone because he has been converted to Christianity.</p>            </div>

As someone who was arrested twice outside South Africa house, I cannot wait to see that. It will perhaps be even more moving than the speeches this morning.</p> <p>
As we had a statement from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> about the transfer of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_of_Scone">Stone of Scone</a> back to Scotland, could we please have a debate on that matter? There is considerable controversy among academics and people responsible for artefacts of great historic importance in this country about the significance of the stone to the coronation chair and its position in Westminster abbey. If we are to start moving around objects of that significance, could we not discuss the possibility of transferring the Parthenon marbles back to Greece? They are far more significant to Greece than to Britain, whereas the coronation chair and the Stone of Scone are of great significance to England.</p>            </div>

Another was a telephone call to a business colleague and friend, which was so odd that he telephoned me about it. As my right hon.

Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) about the Parthenon marbles? I am reminded of being in the peculiar situation a couple of weeks ago of doing a live interview down the line about the marbles and going straight across to Millbank to do an interview about slaughterhouses. It is about slaughterhouses that I wish to question the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a>.</p> <p>
Is it possible to arrange for the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to come to the House to make a statement and answer questions about an aspect of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy crisis that has never been adequately dealt with in the House, that is, the


operation of the 30-month slaughter scheme? It is scandalous that less than one fifth of the slaughterhouses in the country have been given 100 per cent. of the business in relation to the cull and that, of those, one quarter have 80 per cent. of the business.</p> <p>
There has been no competitive tendering and, even worse, those who are fortunate enough to have been selected for the scheme have negotiated a price per head which seems to be three or four times the market rate that could be achieved by competitive tendering. Not only is that a gross abuse of taxpayers' money, but the distortion of costs is likely to have a disruptive and destructive effect on the meat industry.</p>            </div>
