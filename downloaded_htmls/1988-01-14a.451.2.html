I congratulate him on his additional appointment, although I am sure that all hon. Members will regret the reason why that additional office had been thrust upon him.</p> <p>
Now that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services">Social Services</a> has conceded to the presidents of the royal colleges that it is necessary to increase "total resources", to use the Secretary of State's words, and the efficiency of their use in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service">National Health Service</a>, can we look forward to further candour from the right hon. Gentleman during the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> day on the Health Service next week? Can we look forward to, for instance, the announcement of further funds which are essential if hospitals are to clear the &#163;70 million-worth of deficits which still remain in this financial year and which must be lifted if the next financial year is not to begin with another under-funding crisis in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a>?</p> <p>
Yesterday the Secretary of State for the Environment confirmed in a written answer that he had asked the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Conservancy_Council">Nature Conservancy Council</a> to examine the scope for the privatisation of the nation's natural reserves. May we now have an urgent debate on the Government's intentions towards conservation and the future of the national heritage? Clearly, nothing is safe from the Government's predatory instincts, not even our countryside.</p> <p>
Given that this week we have seen yet a further erosion of the Government's support for firms involved in high

technology, may we have a statement on policy for industrial research and development which will explain exactly how the Government propose that withdrawing assistance from innovation will somehow advance those industries on which our future as a nation depends, especially when our competitors are doing the opposite and giving more support to their advanced industries?</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> will have noticed the gravity of the threat posed by the massive increase in illegal imports of cocaine. May we have a statement on what the Government intend to do about this and whether they will recruit the 500 extra customs staff that are estimated to be necessary to deal with this murderous traffic?</p> <p>
Finally, will the Leader of the House now tell us when the House will have an opportunity to debate the televising of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>? Can he also tell us whether he is willing to cast off his coyness and join those of us who want this change and want it quickly?</p>            </div>

We all wish him a continued and speedy recovery, which is going on at present. [HoN. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."]</p> <p>
With regard to the other matters that the right hon. Gentleman raised, of course the debate next week will enable my right hon. Friend to make quite clear the position regarding funding of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service">National Health Service</a>. As I understand it, the meeting with senior medical gentlemen that took place yesterday was to discuss the way that the increase in funding that had already been announced was going to assist the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a> and continually improve its record.</p> <p>
With regard to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Conservancy_Council">Nature Conservancy Council</a>, as I understand it too&#8212;but I will check the matter with my right hon. Friend &#8212; a period of consultation and discussion is still going on, but I will see when is the most appropriate time to have a debate. It is obviously a very important matter that we shall have to come to in the House.</p> <p>
With regard to research and development plans, it is not right for a statement to be given at the moment, but many of the issues raised are just the sort of issues, subject to you, Mr. <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, that could well be part of the debate on the Regional Development Grants (Termination) Bill that will take place on 25 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January">January</a>.</p> <p>
On the question of cocaine and drugs generally, I will certainly refer the matter to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, but I have nothing to say at the moment.</p> <p>
I am sorry that I have not been able to announce today the date of the televising debate, as I had intended to do; but I can undertake to announce a date in my next business statement next week. I am anxious to have a debate at the time I said&#8212;around the end of the month. I think that the right hon. Gentleman will have to wait, if it is of any concern to him, for the views that I shall express on that day.</p>            </div>

Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Worcestershire">Mid-Worcestershire</a> (Mr. Forth), may I make a strong demand of my right hon. Friend that we should have a debate on that subject? My right hon. Friend will be aware that, on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday">Monday</a>, a hitherto totally unknown Member of the House, whom no one had clapped eyes on

before, managed by appalling behaviour to get himself ejected from the premises and projected immediately on to our television screens.</p> <p>
This bad behaviour is increasing. Surely, if someone wants to be a martyr, there should be at least a little penalty; a little risk; a little bit of pain. If people want to be burnt at the stake on the Floor of the House, would not my right hon. Friend agree that at least they should pay for the faggots, or even a box of matches? If anyone is suspended from the House in future, surely he should lose his pay at the time when he is suspended.</p>            </div>

In relation to what was said to my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling), may I record that some of us have had nothing but courtesy from four Conservative Secretaries of State: Michael Noble, Jack Maclay, Gordon Campbell and, indeed, the right hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger)? However, times have changed in Scotland, and Ministers now brutally throw people off health boards and other Government committees for the Secretary of State, which has never happened before&#8212;good Labour people who have served well.</p> <p>
That is partly the reason why&#8212;uncharacteristically, perhaps&#8212;for the first time ever, I have been asking questions about one of the right hon. Gentleman's colleagues, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under-Secretary_of_State_for_Scotland">Under-Secretary of State for Scotland</a>&#8212;the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_James_Douglas-Hamilton">Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</a>)&#8212;who, absolutely without precedent, announced that he had an interest in a very controversial and contentious Bill: the Housing (Scotland) Bill. I asked whether, on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday">Monday</a> of next week, it would be proper for a statement to be made from the Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> &#8212;as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_Committee">Selection Committee</a> has put the ball in the Government's court&#8212;clarifying the role on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=248" title="In a normal session there are up to ten standing committees on bills. Each..." class="glossary">Standing Committee</a> of a Minister who declares an interest in highly contentious legislation.</p> <p>
Is it proper that such a Minister should lead on, and be a major force in, such a controversial Bill? If it is considered that he should remain on the Committee, could we have a statement on whether etiquette, and, I believe. Government rules, have changed? This has never happened before in my 25 years in the House.</p>            </div>
