                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>If the Bill is passed without the Amendments I seek to insert, the

effect will be that the Government will have power to hold men who are at present serving for a further six months, they will have power to recall to the Colours National Service men who have completed their service, and they will not be required to account to the House for the circumstances in which they exercise those powers, the number of men involved, or the nature of their purpose.</p> <p>
Our proceeding have been held up somewhat this afternoon by a discussion on the Mace. A great captain-general once had some comments to make about the Mace. He exercised his authority through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_the_Crown">Armed Forces of the Crown</a>, and he came here with a posse and suggested that the Parliament of the time should do with the Mace something other than was suggested for it this afternoon. One of the results of this conflict is that over the last three centuries the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> has required the Executive to account to the House in detail for their administration of the Armed Forces.</p> <p>
Until comparatively recently we had the annual Army Bill, by which the numbers were closely controlled. Indeed, the doctrine itself by which that control is exercised arose because the King sought to expend money to pay that was voted for rations, and thereby increase his power by raising the number of men called in. I am not suggesting that the Government are seeking to do that. They are seeking to do something far worse. They are seeking to take measures without telling the House of Commons or the country the real reason why they seek these measures, or the purposes for which they are seeking them.</p> <p>
4.30 p.m.</p> <p>
I turn to the speech of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> during the <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> debate. He told us that at the moment there are about 50,000 National Service men. He said that of that number 25,000 would not be required&#8212;that is to say, men due for release before 1st April. After that time, he said, he would have to hold some of them; probably all the men who were in Germany, no numbers being given. He said that some of the men serving in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_East">Far East</a> or other theatres might be discharged in the early stages, but others would certainly be fetched back to this country


and then sent to <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a> of the Rhine. No numbers were given.</p> <p>
This is very interesting. I am sure that the Secretary of State regards himself and his staff as ultra recruiting sergeants. They are engaged in getting recruits wherever they can&#8212;from Fiji, from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies">West Indies</a>, and from similar places. It is interesting to see what their view of the Army is. When dealing with the measures undertaken with great courage by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> in 1950 the Secretary of State, then in <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a>, rejected the theory of sharing equal misery.</p> <p>
That does not help anyone. I would describe service in the Armed Forces of the Crown, whether Regular or National Service, as a privilege. I would not have thought that it helped recruiting to tell our young men that they were going to suffer equal misery and that service in the Armed Forces was so utterly miserable that we would not ask more people to do it than was absolutely necessary. I would have thought that a Secretary of State who was really charged with a sense of purpose and who was proud of the Service for which he spoke in the House would have said to young men, "We are helping you to do your duty. It is your privilege, in a democracy, to serve your country." To talk about it as a sharing of equal misery is a kind of Freudian slip, which explains many of the Secretary of State's other actions.</p> <p>
We understand from the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscount_Lambton">Viscount Lambton</a>) that the right hon. Gentleman has decorated his <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Office">War Office</a> room in a pastel shade. I would have thought that in view of some of the proposals in the Bill he might have inserted a stained glass window, in which would be contained a picture of the late <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Karno">Fred Karno</a>, sitting suitably with a soda water bottle by his side.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>It was a wonderful record. I am merely saying that the present Army is an Army of bits and pieces, without a pattern. I am putting the matter in a light and frivolous way because it is my view that at some point

the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> must tell us the number of men he wants, when he wants them, and the purpose for which he wants them. Above all, he must tell us what the targets are.</p> <p>
I do not want to weary the Committee by going over once again all the arguments about the targets. It is crystal clear that the right target is 182,000. If there is any doubt about that, quite apart from anything that the present <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Commonwealth_Relations">Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations</a> may have said, we can discover the truth of the situation by reading an article in the <i>Soldier,</i> published last week. This is an Army publication, paid for by the Secretary of State and with an editorial board appointed by him. Its leading article presumably produces the official doctrine for the consumption of the men in the ranks.</p> <p>
What that article contains is very different from what has been said in ministerial speeches or in official publications. It says, in justification of the Government's policy:
<q><a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">The Army</a> must have at least 182,000 officers and men to meet all its commitments, although even at this level there will still be some shortages.</q>
So we know that 182,000 men are wanted. During the <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> debate I asked the Government what number they hoped to get in December of next year. I was not given an answer. I know, broadly speaking, that it will be about 165,000 Regulars. It may be a few thousand short of that. On the other hand, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s searches in the Fijis and in other parts of the Commonwealth may enable him to reach that figure. He will also be holding back some National Service men, but we do not know how many, and we should be told.</p> <p>
The figure at which the Government are aiming is between 170,000 and 182,000. We should be told what it is now, because if the statement made in the <i>Soldier</i> is right, any figure below 182,000 will mean a shortage which must find reflection in units which are serving at the moment, and must also result in a weakening of the commitments which they are required to carry out.</p> <p>
But this is not the only document which the Minister has published. Another document was sent out last week, marked "Confidential". It was a circular sent to commands and senior


officers. Why it was marked "Confidential" I do not know. It merely consisted of a hand-out from the Minister's speeches. But it contained some proposals which the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> has never been told about. I learnt with great pleasure that the Government propose to initiate immediate talks with employers and <a href="/glossary/?gl=226" title="A group of workers who have united to promote their common interests." class="glossary">trade union</a> leaders, in order to enlist their help in making a success of the new "Ever-readies" scheme.</p>            </div>

Without giving a date, it says that the Government hope to get a minimum target of 165,000, rising to 182,000. But the Government know full well that 182,000 is the correct figure.</p> <p>
The document also says that in the last resort the Government might contemplate a return to some form of compulsory service. We have never had an admission from them in those terms before, but it is contained in one document, sent out confidentially, and in another document which has been circulated among the troops.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>The figures have been mentioned many times. But if the hon. Member wonders why I follow up this question in some detail I can tell him that it is because Ministers are not always consistent. I can quote statements from the present <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Commonwealth Relations repudiating the figure of 182,000. In a Press handout a year ago he asked what all the worry was about, and said that there had never been any question of 182,000.

I make this point because we must get right out of our minds the figure of 165,000.</p> <p>
I believe that the statement contained in the <i>Soldier</i> is right; that the target is 182,000 and that, as the <i>Soldier</i> says, even if that target is attained there will he some shortages. Anything short of 182,000 next December will represent a very grave situation. Therefore, the Government should not be allowed simply to go on until next April and then, by administrative action, do what they want to do in the conditions in which they find themselves. When they have arrived at a firm decision about the date on which they are going to hold men back under Clauses 1 and 2, they should tell the House what the date will be, how many men are involved, how many men will be retained and how they propose to deal with the situation of undoubted weakness which must exist if there is a gap&#8212;perhaps a large gap&#8212;between the combined figure of National Service men and Regulars which they have succeeded in obtaining and the figure of 182,000. I, for one, am not prepared to give the Government <i>carte blanche.</i> They have not shown themselves worthy of confidence. They have left the decision until the very last moment.</p> <p>
One of the arguments they now produce, I admit it is a powerful one, cuts right to the heart of my own personal dilemma. They say that now we have got into the position in which we are, what alternative is there to the step which the Government are now proposing? Indeed, in the article in <i>Soldier</i> they produce just that argument. They charge hon. Members in this side of the Committee and the newspapers with failing to produce any alternative to the Government proposals. I admit frankly that that is my dilemma.</p> <p>
I am absolutely dead against the provisions of <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 1, which I regard as a breach of faith with the men who are serving and who by the accident of circumstances will be affected. I consider it a cowardly breach of faith. If there is any substance in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s case that the circumstances have come about only because of the Berlin situation he ought to remember, as the political head of <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a>, that he is dealing with soldiers and that whether


they be National Service men or Regulars they should be treated alike.</p> <p>
If the right hon. Gentleman decided to hold National Service men. he should have done what the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> did in 1950, and never mind about the gospel of equal misery. He should have held both. He does not hold the Regulars which he could do under <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_9">Section 9</a>&#8212;does the hon.

He should give the House the fullest possible information. Perhaps at a later stage he should give exactly the same information in relation to Clause 2. His failure to so involves the House in giving him a blank cheque which the right hon. Gentleman can then please himself about how he uses.</p> <p>
It is my submission that one of the arguments which he has advanced for the Bill was there is no alternative, and the second argument is it is not tied up with the crisis in which the Government find themselves now. That is not something for which they are responsible, because this Government would never find themselves in such a difficult situation. It arises from the Berlin situation. If the situation gets worse and the right hon. Gentleman can prove that some other crisis is at the root of the trouble all he has to do is to come to the House. He has enormous powers if he cares to use them.</p> <p>
The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> of 1950 acted in a different way. They acted fairly. They made no distinction between Regular soldiers and National Service men. In his heart of hearts the Secretary of State knows that the cause of the trouble in which the Government

now find themselves is basically because of a crisis created by the international situation and that it is his duty to hold Regulars as well as National Service men because his need for trained men is of overwhelming importance. It goes without saying that Regulars are better than National Service men in the sense that they are better trained. The reason he does not do that is it would cause great administrative difficulties. It would strike at the heart of the confidence of the Regular soldier and that would affect the efforts of the right hon. Gentleman to raise the Regular recruiting figures.</p> <p>

National Service men are expendable. The Government are allowing their National Service policy to run down. So it is possible to talk to the National Service man, not in terms of duty or privilege, but in terms of equal misery. It is possible to break faith with the National Service man and to cause the greatest uncertainty in his life because for this purpose a National Service man is expendable.</p> <p>
I do not think that this is right. The Government have not shown any reason why they should be given an unlimited amount of trust. I think that they should be called to account for every one of their actions. I make this demand, not because I am passionately interested in the subject&#8212;although I am&#8212;but on the same basis as any other hon. Member; because this affects every hon. Member who will have in his <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> some people who are doing their National Service or have an obligation to carry out reserve service. They will all be affected by the terms of the Bill.</p> <p>
We have been told over and over again&#8212;indeed it is the main argument used against a number of hon. Members opposite who put country before party and a few of us on this side of the Committee who share that view of our duty&#8212;that what we want is conscription. If there is no better argument people must fall back on that argument. I repudiate it in my own case. Not only has it been said that we want conscription, but, also, that we want selective service. Let us see where we have got ourselves, and this, again, is why I demand that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> should keep control


at every stage. Let us see in terms of a time-table. In November, 1959, the right hon. Gentleman who was then <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of Labour and National Service, announced out of the blue that he was not calling up 60,000 men not because we did not need them, but because the defence budget would not bear it. That related to 60,000 men, and we excluded the miners, agricultural workers, the mercantile marine&#8212;</p>            </div>

We are told that this is a fair Measure and has nothing to do with selective service. The Government have poured scorn on the idea of selective service, but they come forward with a Measure based on no principle, and thought of at the last moment because of pressure from America, to face a manpower situation of their own creation which has nothing to do with Germany at all. They have poured scorn on those who advocated selective service, but they introduce a selective system which is the most unfair, unjust and militarily inefficient which it is possible for a human mind to devise.</p> <p>
In those circumstances, I cannot give the Government <i>carte blanche.</i> They should account at every stage for their actions. I ask the Committee to say that Parliament regretfully considers that under <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 2 they may have the powers required because they have got themselves into a mess. It is not only the Government but the country and <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a> which is in a mess. The Army must be given the men to get it out of the mess, but the number of men required, and when they are wanted, must be the subject of an affirmative Order so that the Government will be brought to account.</p>            </div>

Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg) in moving the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a>, and in many ways I am very sympathetic with it, because all of us, whatever may be our views about selective service, continuing conscription in general, or trying to confine ourselves

to a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_Army">Regular Army</a> only built up by voluntary recruiting, know full well that there will be cases of individual hardship which we would be only too anxious to avoid if we possibly could. At least we are all agreed on that.</p> <p>
I want to give two quotations from my right hon. Friends speech on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>. The first quotation deals with <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 1 and it should be borne in mind in this discussion:
<q>I have already said that we shall keep back men only for strictly military reasons. So, after April we shall need to hold virtually all National Service men serving in B.A.O.R. In the early release groups after April we should be able to let those serving in other theatres go at their normal times. Later in the year, when there are fewer National Service men available, we shall probably have to keep back the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of men wherever they are serving and transfer them to B.A.O.R.</q>
All of us agree that the situation in Berlin is all too susceptible of becoming electric at any moment. I ask the Committee to consider the wisdom of accepting the Amendment. However much we may be sympathetic with the individual cases of hardship involved, do we believe that it would be wise to compel the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for War to come to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> and state exactly how many men he intends to retain, when the mere act of doing so may very well add to the tension which the men's retention is designed to reduce? This is the vital factor, certainly on Clause 1.</p> <p>
The second quotation concerns Clause 2:
<q>While it is possible, in certain circumstances, that we might have to use the power under this Clause"&#8212;</q>
that is, Clause 2&#8212;
<q>to call certain National Service men back next year, it seems that that situation, if it were to arise, would probably mean that we would have to declare a state of emergency and call out reserves generally. I do not therefore think it likely that we should need to use the powers under Clause 2 until 1963. By that time there will be rather more than 100,000 part-time National Service men eligible for recall, but in the sort of circumstances we envisage we should only need to call on a fraction of this total."&#8212;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 27th November, 1961; Vol 650, c. 47, 49 and 50.]</q>
None of us can foresee what is likely to be the context in which we would have to operate Clause 2. It may be Berlin. It may be in a quite different part of the world. It may be in Persia,


for example. Perhaps that is not so unlikely as some people may think today. Wherever it is, I suggest that the Committee must be very careful before asking the Government to accept a machinery for implementing either of these Clauses which, by its very nature, would tend to increase the tension rather than reduce it.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I appreciate the force of the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument. There is something to be said for making such action subject to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Secrets_Act">Official Secrets Act</a>, but for the very reason which the hon. Member for Dudley has advanced, namely, that there definitely will be cases of individual hardship, which we would all like to avoid, we ought not to do that.</p> <p>
If we go the whole way with the hon. Member for Dudley, we shall create a machinery which will at once ensure that it hits the headlines, whereas under the machinery proposed by my right hon. Friend we can at least ensure that every individual case is dealt with as effectively as possible on its merits. Many of them&#8212;indeed, the vast <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of them&#8212;will be dealt with quite quietly without any public fuss. Each case will vary. Cases of hardship are bound to vary considerably depending on whether the man is married or single, etc.</p> <p>
I hope that my action in supporting the <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> as it stands and not being prepared to support the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> will not lead anyone to think that I do not realise that there will be many cases of personal hardship. I do realise that. However, if the purpose for which we are asking these men to serve is to help the country to play its part in keeping

the peace, it would not be very wise in retaining these men to use machinery which is bound to increase the tension which they are trying to reduce.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I always listen to the hon. Member for the Isle of Ely (Sir H. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legge-Bourke">Legge-Bourke</a>) with respect, because he always speaks with courage and sincerity. It is not often that I find myself so much in disagreement with him as I do today, because the reasons which he has just given are reasons to which I find myself diametrically opposed. The important thing about the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> is that it raises the whole question of the increasing habit of passing skeleton <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> and giving Ministers wide powers&#8212;powers which Parliaments of years ago would never have tolerated&#8212;to be exercised by one <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> without consultation, but without giving any details as to how the powers are to be exercised.</p> <p>
Time after time in the past few years Ministers have come to the House with a permissive Bill and vague promises that they will exercise it with moderation, discretion and consideration. Indeed, I have no doubt that they intended to keep their promises. But all power corrupts. Under the pressure of cricumstances a Minister is very easily convinced that on the whole the situation is not the same as it was when he made his first speech or when he gave the undertakings or assurances. A careful re-reading of his speech will nearly always disclose to him that, after all, the assurances did not mean very much and that they were qualified very considerably.</p> <p>
I have always had very friendly relations with the present <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for War. He has always considered my individual cases with courtesy, and, I think, with generosity in the circumstances. He gave an almost blank assurance which supported the <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a>. He said, "At present I do not think that it will be necessary at all to call up anyone whose term of service is due to expire on or before 1st April of next year". Then, being a Minister and realising that <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> Ministers who make definite statements on anything nearly always finish up as involuntary occupants of <a href="/glossary/?gl=112" title="During a debate members of the House of Commons traditionally refer to the..." class="glossary">another place</a>, he made a qualification which deprives the Clause of its meaning. He said, "Provided that the


international situation does not get worse".</p> <p>
The hon. Member for the Isle of Ely, who I am sure spoke with sincerity, thinks that the international situation is worse. He says that the situation in Berlin is one which might become serious at any moment. I suppose it is. It has always been such a situation since it was first established. I am horribly afraid it always will be until some alteration is made.</p> <p>
I ought to declare my interest, I suppose. I call myself a pacifist, without being quite sure what the term means in modern days, because I never feel the urge to have a row with the police in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_Square">Trafalgar Square</a> on their day off or anything like that. I am a sort of theoretical pacifist who tries to face some of the realistic implications of the existing situation and who does not feel that the fact that he is a pacifist absolves him from the need to look after those of his constituents who have military obligations. Indeed, I also combine with my pacifism a vague theory, which I share with my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, that on the whole military service is a jolly good thing for youngsters, and that, a little bit of collective service&#8212;I would rather have it collective service for peace; and one day we may have a peace army doing service in Africa&#8212;would do nobody any harm. I cannot think of a better training. Most of us found a good deal of comradeship in <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a>, a sense of sacrifice and so on.</p> <p>
5.0 p.m.</p> <p>
On the other hand, I think the hon. Member for Dudley put his case a little high. All of us watched with admiration the courage and self-sacrifice of the troops in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War">First World War</a>, but there was another aspect to it. A famous poet wrote:
<q>Although we obey the moral law,</q><q>and although we know our quarrel just;</q><q>Were I permitted to withdraw,</q><q>You would not see my&#8212;back&#8212;for dust.</q>
It is a view that could be held, if not expressed. I do not know what the position is at the moment, but my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley quite fairly did not say it is a tough job, but a happy job. Let us say, then, that they are to share the collective happiness of six months' further service.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I was talking of my feet. I would not have thought, Sir Norman, that they were as far away from the subject as all that. The point I was going to put&#8212;and I will put the point first and the argument second&#8212;is that we may find ourselves in a crisis in which the obvious first thing to do is to call for volunteers and say, "Look here, we have got to 'nobble' some of you blokes, and some of you like it and some of you don't. Some have great obligations and some have not. Some are single men with not a care in the world, but with a lass down the street, and others have wives in Oldham who are expecting babies, very nervous and alone. There is the situation, and here is a great privilege which at the same time confers on some people a great deal of hardship."</p> <p>
If we can get those who do not have to face hardship to volunteer, we shall have got at the root of our problem and met the situation in a way which I should have thought would have been the first appeal that would be made. If it is regarded so much of a privilege, one would have expected a great response, but it is only fair that I should add that my correspondence from the troops in Germany has not contained a letter from any one who desires to volunteer. On the other hand, it has contained some extremely moving and genuinely serious letters, and, as the right hon. Gentleman said on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>, very great hardship will be imposed on some.</p> <p>
There is the second technical difficulty about it. The right hon. Gentleman knows that we have raised cases of personal hardship, and sometimes the right hon. Gentleman has been moved to take steps to remedy it. In one or two cases which I have put to him I think he has behaved with great generosity and consideration, and it is only right that that should be acknowledged. There are other cases in which it is said, "Well, a man has served 12 months already and has not long to go now. We cannot have a compassionate posting" when he is leaving in a certain time and all these things raised again if he has to serve for an extended period of six months.</p> <p>
Is not this <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> the first measure of protection, for the Amendment provides that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> shall come to the House with a Statutory Instrument and say, "You gave me these powers conditionally and a situation has now arisen when I say to the House that the recruiting figures which looked so promising a few weeks ago have not been maintained," or "the international situation is not quite so promising," or "other obligations have come about." At the moment, the Committee is being asked to accord an open cheque to the Secretary of State, with no figures filled in, to be presented when he likes and without any further reference to the House.</p> <p>
I suggest that there is nothing in the situation which makes that necessary. This is too serious a matter for me to make points which are not serious, but the hon. Member for the Isle of Ely took a much more serious view of the Berlin situation than did the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> in his famous remark&#8212;which I do not criticise, because it gave a good deal of reassurance to the public generally&#8212;made on the 17th green that this was not a matter which was ever going to be a <i>casus belli</i> or words to that effect. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State said that if he came to the House with a Statutory Instrument, that might produce a headline, but that is not an argument for giving him this Bill at all. In a situation which is altering rapidly, this is the sort of measure which in an emergency could be passed very rapidly indeed. In an emergency, a Bill could be passed much more quickly than a Statutory Instrument,

because the right hon. Gentleman has to have a Bill to enable a Statutory Instrument to be passed in less than 28 days. During the war, we all know that in an emergency <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> have been passed through both Houses very rapidly, in a matter of hours, when a real emergency occurred.</p> <p>
I suggest that my hon. Friend's Amendment is a reasonable precaution and permits the House to keep control of the matter, while giving some assurance to those who are desperately worried and want some information about their situation. I therefore hope that the Committee will consider that it is an Amendment that could be carried.</p>            </div>

The hon. Member for Dudley put particular stress on the number of men required in <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a>. I submit that what we need is some degree of flexibility so that the Minister himself can regulate the exact numbers required at any one time. It may well be that a situation could arise either in Berlin or another country in which forces are required, and this method gives the flexibility which I think is generally required. The second <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment_I">Amendment I</a> am sure was put down in the interests of the Army, but, quite honestly, I cannot possibly see who will be the arbitrator as to what men are called up.

That is the Amendment which deals with <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 1, and I have another Amendment which deals with Clause 2.</p>            </div>

It is true that there may be publicity in the circulation of notices, but I do not think it would be as great as the publicity and alarm caused by an Order made in this House.</p> <p>
I wish to make another point to my right hon. Friend. On <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> he promised that before anyone was called up he would seriously look at the possibility of a review of the exact number of troops required with a view to possibly greater mobility and a reduction of numbers. I am sure that he will carry that out, but I ask him one other thing. Before there is any call-up under this provision, will he look into the question of simplicity of accounting, which could save Army manpower? Also, is it correct that when there are call-ups they are made before any men in the Emergency Reserve or the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Army">Territorial Army</a> Reserve are called up? I should like that point to be made quite clear.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I wish to revert for a moment to something which was said by the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Hale). He may be a pacifist but, apart from his very rare flights of fancy, he is certainly a realist. He said that Parliaments of years ago would not tolerate what we are now doing. Whether they would or would not, the fact is that times have changed very considerably.</p> <p>
I do not say that the emergencies which we face today are any less or any greater than those faced leading up to


the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, but things move so swiftly today that plans for emergency measures of this sort of nature must be well laid beforehand. That is one of the things this Bill attempts to do. It is a gap-bridging Measure and we hope that it will not be permanent. That brings me to the point that if it were to be a permanency and if this were to be an active Measure on the Statute Book for many years or even centuries to come, I would say that undoubtedly there is force in the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg). That, however, is not the case.</p> <p>
The hon. Member has stated that the object of the proposed new subsection is, first, to make the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> come to the House to give two things&#8212;the date of the requirement and the number of men to be required. The subsection as drafted does not do that. It would provide the date, but it would not provide any number of men. I do not say that this will happen, but it could happen that the Secretary of State could come to the House one night in order to support the Statutory Instrument and say to hon. Members, "I am sorry, but it is not in the public interest for me to divulge the number of men involved." Naturally, all of us on both sides of the Committee would have to accept that. The subsection does not do what it purports to do.</p> <p>
The hon. Member for Dudley is an old soldier. He and his friends on both sides of the House talk much about selective service. Surely he must realise that what <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a> requires under this Measure is not the raw material of National Service men which would be provided by a form of selective service which he advocates, but a number of trained men to bridge a gap for a certain duration of time. If we did what he keeps suggesting we should do, the Army would be overburdened with raw recruits which the Army does not want and cannot do with at this time. What we want to do here is to extend the service for as short a period as possible of certain trained men. That is what the Bill is trying to do. I cannot see why hon. Members on either side of the House cannot understand that. They keep arguing about selective service, but that would get us absolutely nowhere in meeting the present shortage.</p>            </div>

I suppose it can be called selective service, but selective service of a very specialised type, not what he and his hon. Friends mean when they talk about selective service. What he and his Friends have frequently advocated in this House is either selective service linked to some sort of ballot, or selective service linked to such dire medical, physical and other standards that all but the very top men will be kept out.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I find it rather difficult to understand the logic of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Wells (Commander Maydon). I thought, from his remarks earlier in his speech, that he thought it to be absolutely necessary for plans to be laid well in advance. If so, I cannot understand his objection to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> being able to come to the House, laying an Order and explaining to hon. Members what he proposes to do.</p> <p>
I support the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> because it seeks to amend a <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> which, if un-amended, will represent a breach of faith; it will mean that large numbers of young men who were called up on the understanding that they were to serve for a certain period will find that that period has been extended. That sort of action is extremely unfair to these men. If one is considering any form of selective service, this kind of selection is certainly the worst possible&#8212;even worse than wholesale conscription.</p> <p>
I have carefully studied the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg), and I cannot see what possible objection can be raised to the Minister laying an Order before the House. Naturally, I do not know about the figures. Figures do not worry me unduly, and while the figures might not be supplied there is no reason why, should the Minister find it necessary to give notice that he intends to call up a number of men, he should not be obliged to come to the House and say so.</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman made a number of speeches&#8212;some of them in the country&#8212;and I gathered from what he said&#8212;and if I am wrong perhaps he will correct me&#8212;that he may not, in fact, put the provisions of the Bill into operation. I got the impression that he was merely seeking a power and that he hoped that the situation would not necessitate him putting those powers into action. I hope I am right.</p>            </div>

After all, it has been part of the British way of life that compulsion in time of peace should never be. The Bill as at present drafted constitutes a compulsion, and I object to it. It is a compulsion of the worst kind and for that reason the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> should be prepared to say that, if he thinks the situation demands him bringing his powers into operation, he should also be prepared to come to the House and say so.</p> <p>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I have listened with interest to the discussion so far, especially to the speech of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Hale). I wonder if it will help the hon. Gentleman if I refer to some writings of a previous hon. Member. I quote a few sentences from "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decline_and_Fall">The Decline and Fall</a>", which would seem particularly relevant to our discussion.
<q>&#8230; but the timid and luxurious inhabitants of a &#8230; empire must be allured into the service by the hopes of profit, or compelled by the dread of punishment. The resources of the Roman treasury were exhausted by the increase of pay, by the repetition of donatives, and by the invention of new emoluments and indulgences, which, in the opinion of the provincial youth, might compensate the hardships and dangers of a military life.</q>
It is probably significant that at the present time, with the welfare state, we have to have a compulsory service of some form because there has been a complete failure to get the requested number of recruits.</p> <p>
I support the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> because this House has always been very jealous of the rights of raising the Armed Forces. It is essential that such control as is practicable can be forced on any Government and that some form of control should be exercised in the raising of forces both in the number and in their compensation.</p> <p>
5.30 p.m.</p> <p>
To suggest that there will be a panic when it is actually announced by my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> that the troops are to be called up is ridiculous. If he is not capable at this stage of forecasting the number of men he will want to raise under the Bill, then the time has come for him to find somebody who can do the arithmetic for him. This is not a Bill just to deal with the Berlin crisis. I support my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> who said that we shall have to live with this sort of thing for a generation. It is quite simple to forecast what is required in the Armed Forces. My right hon. Friend has only to read the magazines published by his own Department, as the hon. Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg) did. Here is the sentence next following the quotation which the hon. Gentleman made:
<q>Yet, at present, it seems unlikely that by the end of 1962, when National Service is due to end, <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a> will have more than 165,000

&#8212;and this at a time when more and more men are needed to achieve a balanced force capable of dealing with any emergency.</q>
If my right hon. Friend were to deal with that figure and the figure in the sentence which the hon. Member for Dudley read, he would find roughly what his deficiency was. Also, he will find from some of the figures which are published by his Department that he can reach certain conclusions. He will find more from some of the figures which are not published. I appeal to him now to consider whether it might be possible for some of the recruiting figures which he could lay under the order we are considering or other orders to have more detail in them so that those of us who follow what he is doing may have better information.</p> <p>
The present information about monthly recruiting figures issued by the Department is not very informative. One cannot follow the drops in the number of National Service men, the number of National Service men who have re-engaged, the number of Regulars who have re-engaged, and a variety of other matters which I cannot believe would be affected by considerations of security. I should be very grateful if my right hon. Friend would consider increasing the information which is made available in the documents.</p> <p>
Returning to the specific point of the Amendment, it should be quite easy, as I have said, to forecast what troops will need to be retained during the next 12 months. If there is any difficulty, the hon. Member for Dudley will, I am sure, offer his assistance in doing the necessary calculations. With those figures, it should be quite possible to lay an order and keep the House informed from time to time. Then we should know where we stood. Parliament would have a chance of supervising the number of people in the Armed Forces and when they were likely to be called up. The traditional watch over the Armed Services would be maintained.</p> <p>
This is not a Bill to deal with the Berlin situation. It is a Bill to bridge a gap created because, unfortunately&#8212;I say "unfortunately" with all the emphasis I can muster&#8212;voluntary recruiting has not succeeded, nor will it succeed, in providing adequate forces to deal with the commitments which the country has.</p>            </div>

I entirely go with him on the question of what forces need to be retained. Now, however, under the terms of the Bill, it is quite clear that a number of people who might ordinarily leave the Service may change their minds. If they are to receive different emoluments and different rates of pay, they may consider that. Therefore, the figures which would normally be available to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Office">War Office</a> as to the number which would need to be retained may be substantially different when the men now have to apply their minds to that factor.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I support the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> because it is based on a simple fact, namely, that matters of significance and importance should be subject to Parliamentary approval. I think that nothing is of greater significance or greater importance than the retention of a young man in <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a>, involving the deprivation of his normal civic rights, the inconvenience to which he and his family are put, the interruption of his studies, and matters of that kind. All that we ask in this Amendment is that matters of quite fundamental importance in the lives of the citizens of our country should come before Parliament to be discussed and approved by Parliament.</p> <p>
The provisions of the Bill are significant on three grounds: first, domestically, secondly, to our military allies, and, thirdly, to our military enemies. On the first of those grounds, this last weekend I interviewed a young man in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>. He may not fall within the provisions of the Bill, but he is already sufficiently alarmed to write to me and to ask to see me because of his domestic situation&#8212;his wife's illness, and all kinds of reasons.</p> <p>
It would be unfortunate if debates of this kind revolved around statistics, although I agree that statistics are

important. It would be unfortunate if they revolved around the convenience or inconvenience of the planners and the generals or of ourselves in calling up or discharging men. Debates of this kind must, to a certain extent, revolve around the personal problems of our constituents and the inconvenience to which they are subjected. We have sufficient evidence in our postbags to know that, of all the <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> before this Parliament, this very closely concerns many people. On the ground of its domestic significance and on the ground of its significance to young men in our constituencies, Parliament should have the right to discuss and approve matters, as laid down in the Amendment.</p> <p>
My second point is important. I do not see how the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> loses by periodic discussion of decisions to strengthen our Army. This heartens our allies. They know that we are doing something important and radical. On this score, I do not see the need to avoid discussion or approval by Parliament. Our military enemies, whoever they may be, at whatever time we are discussing, should also be suitably impressed by the fact that Parliament is discussing a Measure of this kind.</p> <p>
I cannot accept the arguments of the hon. Member for Clapham (Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Glyn">Alan Glyn</a>), whose views on this subject I respect&#8212;he knows what he is talking about&#8212;but I simply cannot accept his proposition that there are questions of secrecy involved. If the situation has reached the point at which the Minister has to call up more men, clearly that derives from international happenings. Presumably there is no secrecy about international happenings, which appear in all the newspapers. In any case, as has been said, individual call-up papers, however individual, do not take very long to reach wider circulation in the newspapers.</p> <p>
I therefore consider that on all these grounds&#8212;the importance of the Bill to our citizens and to our allies and its significance to our enemies&#8212;I can see no reason for resisting the Amendment.</p> <p>
The hon. Member for Maldon (Mr. B. Harrison) referred to the Bill's provisions in what I thought was a rather casual way. He said that this was just a gap to be bridged. But there are always gaps to be bridged, particularly in the matters of defence and international


policy. We shall not be surprised when they occur this year, next year, and the year after. We should not get into the habit of a casual stopping of gaps by provisions which intimately affect the lives of our citizens. We are here concerned with matters sufficiently important to be subjected to the debate and approval of this Committee. I hope that the Minister will think again and will accept the Amendment.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>During our discussions on this subject, I have often found myself in agreement with the hon. Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg), but I do not propose today to support his <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a>. My reason is not that I like the Bill or the <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> as it stands. It is that I consider that the Bill as such is not capable of Amendment, and I should be very sorry to do anything which implied that I thought that it was or that this Committee should do anything with it except reject it.</p> <p>
My right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for War would be entitled to ask why, after 4&#189; years of calling for some measure of selective service, I then object to a Measure of selective service, however garbled, when he introduces it. I will tell him. The Government fixed the figure of 165,000 men in 1957, when they decided to do away with conscription. We were told at that time that 165,000 was the right figure. We have been told ever since that 165,000 was the figure that we should get, that 165,000 men would be enough, and that anyone who said anything else was plain unpatriotic.</p> <p>
What has happened? We now stand within 12 months or so of the time when, without the provisions of the Bill, the last National Service men will leave <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a>. What are the prospects? I have never gone in for crystal gazing to the same extent as the hon. Member for Dudley, but it seems to me that the Government will get very nearly 165,000 men&#8212;not very many short of it. After all that has been said, one might have expected a certain amount of self-congratulation on the part of the Government. We are told that recruiting is going well; and so it is. It seems to

be going better than ever. In spite of that, we do not get self-congratulation.</p> <p>
What de we get? We get this miserable Measure. What it amounts to is that the Government have at last been forced by pressure of events, and I suspect, by pressure from their allies to admit&#8212;</p>            </div>

The Clause does not provide for the retention of Regulars. That is one aspect of its unfairness. Apart from being unfair, it is also wasteful and ineffective. What I am most reproachful about is the fact that it is a temporary stopgap Measure Under the Clause, men are to be retained in the forces for a further six months. The Clause has validity only for another 12 months, because after that time there will not be any conscripts available to retain.</p> <p>
One will be told that under Clause 2. it is possible to retain&#8212;</p>            </div>

Member who has spoken before me. I refer to the temporary nature of this whole Measure. That is an all-embracing characteristic and I emphasise, as has been emphasised by other hon. Members, on both sides, that it may be a temporary Measure, but that the crisis which it is designed to meet is not temporary in character and is likely to continue in one form or another for the rest of our lives.</p> <p>
Therefore, what we need&#8212;and this is a subject which is dealt with in every line of the Bill&#8212;is men on the ground to prevent a worsening of the present crisis and the crisis which will face us, no doubt, in five or ten years' time, when the Bill will have ceased to have any validity unless, as one hopes, it is replaced by something more realistic.</p> <p>
The hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Hale) has told us that he is not a realist. In this respect, I am a realist. The only thing which I see about this whole Measure to recommend it is the fact that it has been described as a stopgap. I hope that it may act as a stopgap whilst the Government think again and finally bring in a measure of true selective service which will give them the men we need. Meanwhile, until they do that, I cannot support them in this present Measure.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I could not but agree with the hon. Member for Bute and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ayrshire">North Ayrshire</a> (Sir F. Maclean) in saying that this is a miserable and, indeed, an unjust Bill. I say so as one who has spent two years undergoing this form of National Service. To have what I regard is nothing less than selective service in its worst possible form by catching a few men who happen to be in a certain spot at a particular time and holding them, or, as to others, calling them back simply because they happen to be in a classification covered by <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 2, is something with which I cannot agree.</p> <p>
This series of Amendments seeks to give to Parliament the chance to look at


the matter again. Parliament should be very jealous of granting to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for War what is undoubtedly a blank cheque. Where the liberty of individuals is affected, we should not discuss the Clause and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> in terms of round figures of 165,000 or 182,000, but we should consider the matter every time from the viewpoint of the young man who will be retained in the Armed Forces.</p> <p>
Having regard to the control that Parliament has exercised over the Armed Forces and having regard to the feelings and views of each and every one of the individuals who will be retained, the Amendment should be accepted and Parliament should have the opportunity, when the time comes, of considering the needs of the Secretary of State and we should be able to debate them.</p> <p>
All sorts of fears have been expressed in the debate. Before hon. Members speak further, it would be advisable for some of them to look at the terms of the Amendment. It merely states that the Secretary of State should lay an Order before Parliament. It does not specify what the Order shall contain. That is an important consideration and should quell some of the fears of hon. Members who have spoken against the Amendment.</p> <p>
The hon. Member for Clapham (Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Glyn">Alan Glyn</a>) stated that if there were discussion of an Order of that nature, when introduced into Parliament, it would cause great public alarm throughout the country and, indeed, throughout the world. The hon. Member seemed, however, to be shutting his eyes to the obvious fact of what will happen when the Secretary of State has to issue the individual notices, to which he referred on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>, to the men who will have to serve again. The right hon. Gentleman said that:

It is because of the obvious need that will arise after next April. I should have thought that it would have been far preferable to have this issue, which will undoubtedly concern every hon.

I cannot see how this Order of itself if it were accepted and provision for it were inserted in the Bill would create any greater amount of alarm and panic than the issue of notices without the Order. Undoubtedly there will be panic and alarm when the notices are issued, and I cannot see that ordinary Parliamentary procedure will add to that alarm. The hon.

The <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>The hon. Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) says that the Bill is unfair. Of course it is. Any system which calls up one person and not another is unfair within the meaning of the word as the Committee is using it today. But the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> does nothing to remove unfairness. All it does is to permit us to discuss under an Order what the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> have been saying will be discussed anyway, Order or no, in the House. So I do not think that we are being carried any further in discussing unfairness.</p> <p>
My hon. Friend the Member for Maldon (Mr. B. Harrison) seems to have misunderstood the purpose of the Bill. He asked my right hon. Friend to be able to calculate in advance the very large numbers of men he would find necessary to call up in various categories. He entirely overlooked that the number of Regulars which <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a> will have will never be static. We cannot know, even month by month, what the number will be, nor what categories they will be in. We do not know the requirement to be made up by men caught by Clauses 1 and 2.</p> <p>
Various methods are being employed to increase the number of Regulars, We do not know what the response will be, or what the international situation will be. Changes in the international situation have important reflections in recruiting. Therefore, it would be idle for my right hon. Friend to say that over the next

six months he wants 10,000 drivers, 6,000 signallers and 5,000 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Corps">Medical Corps</a> men. He would certainly be wrong and it would be an exercise in guesswork which would not be for the profit of this Committee.</p> <p>
The need is not to retain large blocks of people in each command but to retain men in certain categories in order to meet the deficiencies in those categories. Let us imagine, for instance, that there is need to keep a gunner regiment in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, but that a number of its signallers are due for discharge on the same day. Unfortunately and unfairly&#8212;we might as well admit it&#8212;the need is to keep back a proportion or all of those signallers until they can be replaced by other Regulars from home.</p>            </div>

Surely the hon. Gentleman should know that the Secretary of State has never suggested that it is his intention to


say, "We want half a dozen signallers in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>. Let us issue a directive about that", and then to wait for the situation to alter in Germany, and say, "We are short of drivers in Berlin. Lei us issue a directive about that."</p> <p>
The hon.

So far, we have never yet been given the Reserve figures, and we are discussing this matter in a vaccuum.</p> <p>
All the Amendment does is to ask the right hon. Gentleman to exercise power under Clauses 1 or 2 to come to the House for approval. This is the same procedure followed in the old days after mobilisation, when, if the Secretary of State called up reserves, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> needed to be told that they were being called up.

there is no offence to our Parliamentary traditions, but he is enabled to call up either the maximum of the 100,000 whom he said would become eligible, or the much smaller number which he expects to call up.</p>            </div>

hon. Members from both sides could take part. If there is to be only an occasional Question about Sapper Snooks and so on, that is not good enough. We will get a situation in which every hon.

The sort of men we want in <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a> to bridge that temporary gap after the last National Service man would otherwise have left are trained men. It would not be to <a href="/glossary/?gl=247" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_interest" class="glossary">the national interest</a> to call up large numbers of people and give them nine months' training to keep them for what we hope would be a short time while the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_Army">Regular Army</a> was built up to the necessary numbers. The fact that the Bill is temporary should recommend it to good democrats. The fact that it is temporary and has a good military reason behind it should also commend it. The argument that it is a temporary solution to a permanent problem turns upon itself and is not valid.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I am convinced that the reason why there have been so many interjections in the past 15 or 20 minutes is partly a conspiracy to prevent me from making a speech. I have been trying to catch your eye during that period, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William">Sir William</a>. I have


found all the ideas which have been engendered in my head gradually disappearing because of those interjections, but there are still one or two items to which I find it possible to address myself.</p> <p>
The first thing to say to the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Kershaw) and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for War is that if the right hon. Gentleman had originally drafted a Bill which specified categorically that on a certain date, say, 1st April&#8212;an appropriate date&#8212;he intended to call up 60,000 men, we should have understood it and he would have saved himself the need for debating the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a>. We should then have known exactly where we stood.</p> <p>
That is not what he did. He was not sure what he wanted and he is not sure yet. It depends on the circumstances. He may call up 10,000 men. He may call up none. He is very vague and nebulous and the whole position is confused. It is precisely because of the confusion that we want to pin him down on one issue and ensure that before he calls up a group of men, whatever their categories, he will give the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> the reason why. That is a sound proposition to put before the Committee.</p> <p>
All we are arguing is that when the right hon. Gentleman, on the advice he receives from <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a> Council, or whoever now advises him, decides that he wants to step up the number of men for a particular purpose, for example, in order to increase the number of units in B.A.O.R. or anything of the sort, we should be told explicitly and without any vagueness, so that not only hon. Members, but the country and the men concerned, know why they are being called up. That is fair enough.</p> <p>
I do not believe that the right hon. Gentleman needs the men at all and I said so on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>. The Government do not produce one scintilla of evidence that the men are required. I know what has happened and other hon. Members must be aware of it. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americans">The Americans</a> decided to step up the number of units in Germany and we had to follow their lead. What is to happen to those men? What are they to do? What is the purpose of sending more men to Germany? We cannot afford to pay for the men already there. We are having difficulties with the West German Government about costs. We are not

sending them there to engage in fighting, so what is the purpose? Is it as a deterrent? Does anyone believe that sending another 10,000 men&#8212;</p>            </div>

If and when the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> requires the men he can say, not that he wants <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Jones">Jack Jones</a>, or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smith">John Smith</a>, or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Brown">Andrew Brown</a>, or whoever it may be, to stay in for another six months&#8212;nobody expects that; let us not be stupid about this&#8212;but that he wants 10,000 men. I am not saying that he should specify the categories. I am not saying that he should say, "Out of the 10,000 men I want 50 signallers because we are short of them, or so many men for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_Corps">Pay Corps</a> because we are short of them"&#8212;not that that would matter anyhow. It is not that at all. But if the Secretary of State says that he wants 10,000 men, we are entitled to ask why he wants them. I am not sure that hon. Gentlemen opposite would


not ask Questions about the purpose of calling up these men.</p> <p>
Is there anything secret about it? If the Secretary of State retained 10,000 men without asking the House to consent to his doing this, the whole country would know that these men had been retained, because the men themselves would make a song and dance about it and there would be any amount of publicity.</p> <p>
I trust the right hon. Gentleman. I am not suggesting that he is unworthy of our trust. I am not saying that he is unrealiable, or anything of the sort. I am not making any accusations, but I do know the generals better than he does. I have had a lot of experience of them. I know that they can absorb men. They lap them up. If they have 20 men, they want 25; but when they get 25 they want 50. If they get eighteen months National Service they want it to be extended to two years, only to discover that two years is not long enough in which to train a man. I have gone through all this.</p> <p>
It may be suggested that I do not trust the generals. I trust them all right. They are quite good generals, but I do not trust them to make political decisions, and this is a political decision. It is not a military matter. Sending another 10,000 men to the B.A.O.R. will make little difference, except to satisfy the Americans and to satisfy our <i>amour-propre,</i> or our vanity. It is no good. We must be practical about this. Do we really need these men? If we do, when do we need them, and how many do we want? The right hon. Gentleman should tell us that before calling up these men.</p> <p>
The hon. Member for Stroud made a useful admission. He admitted that there was an unfairness about the Bill. There certainly is a distinct unfairness about it. It is bound to be unfair in its operation if it means selecting one man instead of another.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>Field Marshal Lord Harding is an able man. I have a high regard for his ability and his judgment, but I should not be surprised if he said, "I do not suppose that there is anything else we can do, because the Government have never taken sound advice about building up our military organisation". Consider the various Defence White Papers. We have had a succession of White Papers ringing the


changes all the time. That is our trouble.</p> <p>
I was going to say something else before the hon. Gentleman interrupted me, but I have forgotten what it was. No doubt it was extremely important, and I am doing my best to recall what it was.</p> <p>
It comes to this, that the right hon. Gentleman, finding himself faced with this difficulty, has to retain men for a certain period. I do not believe that it will make any difference to our position. Why does not he take the advice that I gave him on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> and train the Territorials effectively, pay them properly, give them a proper bounty, call them up for weekends or every month, and give them proper training and build up a proper reserve in this country?</p> <p>
I remember now what I was going to say. If we are going to retain men, why not keep them in this country? If that were done, I should not object quite so much. Do not send them to Germany. They will not be of any value there. In fact, we ought to withdraw men from Germany and bring them home. They will be just as effective here as they are there.</p> <p>
I beg the right hon. Gentleman to understand that if he is not prepared to accept the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a>, if he wants this blank cheque, if he wants suddenly to announce that he intends to call up or retain a number of men, and we are reduced to merely asking Questions in the House, he will be in for a warm and rough time because we will be fortified by the criticism, discontent and disquiet among the young men and their families, and this will do no good to <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a>.</p> <p>
The hon. Member for Stroud referred to my actions in the past, when in 1950&#8211;51 I retained men in the Army. It was done for the specific purpose of enabling this country to make its contribution to a brigade to be sent to Korea. That was a different proposition. I retained the Regulars for twelve months, as I was entitled to do. I prevented men from going out, but, as I say, that was for a definite purpose, and at the time a very worthy purpose. When one is acting in an emergency and protecting national interests, the position is

different. Does the hon. Gentleman appreciate what the position was then? We were faced with tension in Europe, the possibility of aggression from Russia, and at the same time trouble in Korea. We had to do what we did. I do not apologise for what I did then, but the situation now is different.</p> <p>
I want to make it clear that I am not against the building up of our Army by Regular forces, but I am convinced that National Service is no longer of any value. I am sorry to disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg), with whom I have worked all along on these matters, but I cannot believe that it is of any further value. I want a Regular force. I want it efficiently trained, highly mobile, with effective striking power which can be used if necessary. I want an efficient Army, but I do not believe that this is the right way to get it. I believe that this method is inimical to Regular recruitment. I do not think that it is a good thing. Therefore, I ask the right hon. Gentleman to think twice before he decides to reject the Amendment.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I have listened for nearly 2&#189; hours to hon. Members speaking to this group of Amendments, and it may now be for the convenience of the Committee if I intervene. I have sufficiently collected the views of a large number of hon. Members, and my speaking now will not inhibit any other hon. Member from speaking afterwards.</p> <p>
I waited purposely until after the right hon. Member for Easington (Mr. Shin-well) had spoken. Towards the end of his speech he said that when he was in office and took the decision to retain certain National Service men&#8212;for which I do not criticise him in any way&#8212;he did so in order to be able to carry out a commitment to our allies in a crisis. Although it is a different situation today, it is precisely for that reason that I am seeking powers in the Bill.</p> <p>
I have been asked why I am taking this action. It is in order that I may have power to retain a number of National Service men to maintain our contribution towards our alliance in Europe. This situation is certainly different from that which existed at the time of the Korean war, but it is comparable to some degree, and that is the


broad reason for my seeking this power under the <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a>.</p> <p>
I well appreciate the reasons that motivated the hon. Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg) and other hon. Members who have spoken to the Amendments. I understand their point of view, but I must try to explain to the Committee the problems which these Amendments would raise. There has been much talk about calling up and retaining men, but I am not sure that every hon. Member is quite clear about what we are trying to do, and I want to make it clearer. Clause 2 contains a permissive power to recall, under certain circumstances; but this Clause is a "once only" operation.</p> <p>
The hon. Member for Dudley asked how this necessity arises, and I think that my hon. Friend the Member for the Isle of Ely (Sir H. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legge-Bourke">Legge-Bourke</a>) answered his question. It arises from a need for more trained men of certain categories in B.A.O.R. next year. This is what I must try to produce. Let the Committee criticise the way in which it thinks we have gone wrong in the past, but this is the problem with which the Government are faced at present. In the <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> debate I said that those men in B.A.O.R. whose release fell on or after 1st April, 1962, must assume that they would be retained. Some hon. Members said that that was not precise enough. I will be as precise as I can.</p> <p>
We may or we may not need these people. I have tried to be precise, and I have said that unless the crisis gets worse&#8212;in which case we may have to take action earlier&#8212;we can refrain from retaining people until 1st April, 1962. When I spoke about "equal misery for all" I was meaning&#8212;and every hon. Member who has received letters from serving soldiers knows this&#8212;that men are not happy about being retained. These people have their civilian lives, and conscription is only an incident in their lives. In this case, we have tried to ensure that we hold back no more men than we need. Of course, when the right hon. Member faced this problem he held on to the whole lot. We have not considered it necessary to hold on to the lot in this case. We have determined to hold only the number com-

mensurate with the problem on hand. with which we have to deal under the Clause.</p> <p>
6.45 p.m.</p> <p>
I want to emphasise that the people we are going to keep will be of certain categories, in which shortages now exist in B.A.O.R. That is why I cannot be as precise as I would like. I shall try to be a little more precise later on in my speech. My hon. Friend the Member for Clapham (Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Glyn">Alan Glyn</a>) asked whether this action would precede any recall under Clause 2, or any calling up of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Army">Territorial Army</a> Emergency Reserve, if we formed it. I can give him an undertaking that this provision concerns the retention only of a number of people in certain categories for service in B.A.O.R., and nothing more.</p> <p>
As the hon. Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) has told the Committee, I have given an assurance that as much notice as possible will be given, and that most of the men to be retained will receive more than two months' notice. This, again, is an attempt to help people who may have to make emergency plans because of this change in their lives. To give effect to my undertaking it will be necessary to operate the powers provided under the Clause immediately the Bill becomes law. If we are to help those people who will be held back in the earlier categories after April, we must give them as much personal notice as we can so as to put them on warning.</p> <p>
If we are to give them two months' notice we are going to be hard pushed. At this moment it looks unlikely that we shall obtain the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Assent">Royal Assent</a> in time for me to give everybody two months' notice, and therefore I am considering the possibility of warning certain men in the early release groups, before the Bill becomes law, that we shall have to retain them if Parliament grants the necessary power. I am taking advice on this point, but the only way to be fair to these people will be to act immediately the Bill becomes law, or to warn them individually, even before the Bill becomes law, that they may be held.</p>            </div>

Time is getting fairly short, and if I am to give people an accurate warning I must give them notice as far ahead as possible. For that I need the immediate operation of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a>. The delay involved if the affirmative Resolution procedure were followed would be unacceptable in the situation that we have to face, and I cannot see what could be gained by a further discussion after the debates that take place during the passage of the Bill and before next April.</p> <p>
I do not see how the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> could benefit by having a further discussion in that short time. The circumstances which require the retention of men exist now, and if they still exist in April we will need to take action at once. If they do not exist, and things get a great deal better, I have already said that we will not use this power. I have assured the House that we shall not retain one more man than is required for strictly military purposes.</p> <p>
The hon. Member for Dudley said that when this action was taken before, under the aegis of the right hon. Member for Easington, Regular soldiers were also retained. He made the point that it would be fairer if we were to retain Regulars as well as National Service men. I see the point about fairness. But the situation is different from what it was then. There was then a war on. The right hon. Gentleman has told us about the emergency, and we were operating under emergency powers. Therefore he could retain Regular soldiers although, in effect, it was breaking the commitment which they had entered into voluntarily. Today the situation is different, and I take the view that it would be "welshing" on the Regular soldier who had voluntarily entered into a commitment&#8212;</p>            </div>

My hon. Friend the Member for Maldon (Mr. B. Harrison) made a suggestion about the form in which monthly recruiting figures are issued, and I recognise the tie-up between the number of people we are to get and the number of people we should have to keep back. It seems to me that there is substance in his suggestion and that there is likely to be room for improvement. I will give an undertaking to raise this matter with my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of Defence to see whether we can achieve a form which is absolutely clear and not open to any misinterpretation.</p>            </div>

I have been asked how many men we are likely to wish to retain. I have been


asked whether it is possible to give some indication of the number of people whom I am likely to wish to retain. This is perfectly reasonable and is one of the things which if we accepted the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> the Committee would be entitled to know at the time when we discussed an Order. I think we shall have to retain something like 15,000 men all told, the whole way through the next six months. That is the best guess which I can give. It depends to a certain extent on how the Regular recruiting goes, and so on. But in order to stop the figures of B.A.O.R. from running down, and, therefore, to make our contribution in this way to the crisis in Europe, I reckon that we shall have to hold about 15,000.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>No. The point is that on the very worst figures we can possibly find, and even with recruiting going far worse than at present, these are the sort of figures. It shows the danger of trying to give figures because everyone makes his own deductions. Had I desired not to give the figures I should not have done so, but I am anxious to ensure that this Committee,

the House and the country are properly informed. But it is easy for everyone to make their own deductions, including statisticians&#8212;and I have some statisticians helping me too. We get all sorts of different answers. But I thought that the Committee was entitled to have some idea of the figures.</p> <p>
I wish now to discuss the application of <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 2. I have been asked to say again how many men I shall be likely to want to call back, but it is impossible to tell, quite impossible. I have already told the Committee that the conditions under which we should possibly want to recall X National Service men are conditions of mounting tension, probably after 1963, and during the period when the Regular forces are still mounting to the 180,000 level. I cannot tell. How can I tell at any moment what would be the shortage in any category which would make it necessary to call up men? I cannot in advance give the numbers required, but I repeat that they would be a fraction of the total number available to us at the time.</p> <p>
I cannot accept the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> referring to Clause 2 for those reasons. It is impossible, because it would nullify the whole cause for having Clause 2 if the House were not sitting and I had accepted that I must lay an Order before we could call back any men. With tension mounting quickly, we could not use the provisions of Clause 2 for the purpose for which we need it. It would not be possible as I have said. Hon. Members will find that in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause_4">Clause 4</a> (4) it states:
<q>The <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> shall from time to time report to Parliament with respect to the exercise of his powers to recall persons under section two or call out persons under section three of this Act, and any such report may be made, as the Secretary of State thinks fit, either with respect to any use made or with respect of any use proposed to be made, of those powers.</q>
It is drawn up in that way because we wish Parliament to be informed. If there were a Recess at the time, we should still have to take action and we should have to report to Parliament as soon as possible afterwards.</p> <p>
This goes a long way to meet the hon. Gentleman. He will see that the intention is that we should keep Parliament informed. We shall give all the information possible. The only thing I cannot


accept it that I should be tied by an obligation to lay a Statutory Instrument before I take power to do this at the beginning of next year. I wish to give as much notice as possible of when we shall have to use these powers. I cannot possibly accept a condition which might modify the call-up under Clause 2 and I hope that the Committee will realise why I cannot accept the Amendment.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>The right hon. Gentleman said that if there were mounting tension and this <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> were accepted he would not be able to call up men immediately, or almost immediately, because of the terms of the Amendment.</p> <p>
I take the point made by my right hon. Friend. If there were mounting tension and we were faced with such a situation at the present time I should vote against the Amendment. If the country were in such a situation that a call-up was necessary in order to meet an emergency&#8212;the right hon. Gentleman has told us that this is the <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> with which he is concerned&#8212;and if we were faced with the kind of emergency which the right hon. Gentleman has in mind we should be facing what would amount almost to a state of war. Every one of us capable of carrying arms might be called up into <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a>. It is not a valid argument to say that we should be harming the right hon. Gentleman's desires for call-up in an emergency if we passed the Amendment.</p> <p>
7.0 p.m.</p> <p>
Everyone admits that the Clause will operate unfairly. The right hon. Gentleman has argued that in some way it would be even more unfair to Regular soldiers than it will be to the young men called up to do their National Service. The Government could never convince a National Service man that he was not being unfairly treated by being kept in the Army for another six months. Every National Service man clearly understood that he would serve for only two years. They have all made their commitments. Each one of them thought that he knew

the date of his discharge. Now suddenly in some haphazard fashion individuals are to be told that they are to be retained for another six months. It is a very unfair system.</p> <p>
I do not understand why the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> objects to Parliament being told the numbers and to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> discussing it. I can imagine nothing more democratic. If he decides to call up 15,000 men, there is no reason why he should not lay an Order before Parliament at the earliest opportunity and say why he needs the men and in what arms he needs them. I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Easington (Mr. Shinwell) that there is no secret about it. He might well be able to say that the Army needs so many signallers and so many engineers. If he told the House of Commons the numbers required and the reasons he would probably carry everyone with him.</p> <p>
This is the first time for a long time that I have spoken in an Army debate. I am one of those who believe in adequate defence forces, but I strongly object to the Bill. I would have supported a Bill&#8212;here I may be going out on a limb&#8212;providing for conscription as a whole or the continuation of it, if the state of the country showed that it was necessary. I certainly believe that the principle of conscription is right. I have always believed that, when the state of the country justifies it.</p> <p>
But any form of selective service is bad. It can never be justified. As <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a> we shall have an appallingly difficult job trying to explain to any constituent who writes to us why he in particular should be called up again or retained. I do not come from a <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> where the people are mad about the Army, but I go on record as saying that one thing of which the British people can be convinced is the fairness of applying the call-up to everyone&#8212;the rich man's son and the poor man's son. They understand such an argument, but what is being done by the Bill is absolutely criminal.</p> <p>
The Bill will apply to the B.A.O.R. troops. It is a little hard on a National Service boy who happened to be sent over to Germany because that was the luck of the draw. He is to be retained. A boy who has not been over to Germany and has been one of the lucky ones may be all right. In the last war


there were many lucky ones who never left the country and never fired a shot in their lives. However, they still carry certain ranks. If someone is the sort of soldier who stays at home and comes out all right in the draw, he will not be affected; he will not be called up for six months. However, if he is serving in B.A.O.R. he will be retained for another six months. Not only will he have served eighteen months away from home, with the usual difficulties associated with service overseas: he will have to serve another six months away from home.</p> <p>
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg) on tabling the Amendment. My hon. Friends and I think that the House of Commons should discuss any question of injustice to any of these people. I do not understand why hon. Members opposite do not welcome it. We must not be fobbed off with the argument that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Office">War Office</a> will be restricted. Are we to be seriously told that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army">British Army</a> is in such a state that the extension of service of 15,000 men by six months is a matter of major importance? I do not believe it. I cannot believe it.</p> <p>
I do not think that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> dealt with the points adequately. The only valid argument he tried to advance was that if the Amendment were carried it might delay call-up. That is not true, and he knows it. He should have a better opinion of the House of Commons than that. If there were an emergency which demanded the recall of men to the Army or the retention of men in the Army and Parliament were in recess, the Minister would merely have to contact Mr. <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a> and Parliament could be recalled immediately. We would all return and give him support, if he could convince the House of Commons that the foreign affairs situation justified what he was asking for.</p> <p>
We are in this state because of indecision by the Government in their policy and outlook. I believe in conscription as a principle. It is right. If the Government can prove conclusively that there are not enough Regulars to make the Army efficient, I go on record as saying that conscription is right and I would support it. However, I stress that it must always be proved that there

are not enough Regulars to meet the need. That is the grave doubt, because at no time have I heard the right hon. Gentleman or any one in the Government justify what they are asking for. If the right hon. Gentleman could justify his statement that more men are required, it should apply to all and not only to some. As the Bill is framed, it will be selective.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State can forget Members of Parliament and keep them out of the argument, but he is under a duty to the men involved to stand at the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> and make a great speech explaining why they are to be called up. He should make a speech that they can understand, because at the end of the day he will be left with soldiers who will absolutely loathe the Army. The Army does not want men in that state of mind. There is a certain percentage of conscripts now who are in the Army against their will. If it is done on this basis, there will be a section of men in the Army who will resent being there and will loathe the Army. What sort of efficiency shall we get from that?</p> <p>
I served in the Army for six years during the last war, so I know a little bit about it. I had the privilege, for what it was worth, of going through every rank in the British Army up to major. I do not shout much about it, but I know a little bit about the Army. I can honestly say that I could not get out of it quick enough. That was understandable. My hon. Friend the Member for Dudley was perfectly right in his argument on conscription. There will always be only a certain percentage of men who like the Army. It is exactly the same with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Force">Police Force</a> and any other service. Even if I were tall enough, which I am not, I could not do a policeman's job for &#163;50 a week. There are certain jobs which only a certain type of person can do.</p> <p>
I am one of those who believe that the Minister's whole approach has not been realistic. The selective basis is the worst compromise he could have thought of. If he had had any courage, he would have proved his case for conscription as a whole. But he has not done that. He has tried to compromise. My bet is that at the end of the day we shall have full conscription. This is a party political issue. My hon. Friend


the Member for Dudley may need a little support in this. He has been arguing this on his own for some time. The Government under-estimate the British people. If they tell them the truth and convince them that conscription as such is necessary, they will win the day. But if they do what they are trying to do in the Bill they will not get anything except contempt. They will end up with 15,000 men who, even if they like the Army at the moment, will come to hate it.</p> <p>
I can assure the Minister that when these men receive their gentle warning letters from the War Office telling them that they are to be retained in Germany for another six months, the sparks will begin to fly. I can imagine the scene in the barrack rooms. One soldier will say to another, "Have you got one of these letters?" The reply will be, "No, I have not got one. I am all right. I am going home next Wednesday week." The first soldier will say. "I have got one. What are they keeping me for?" The soldier will have no right of appeal. There is to be no independent tribunal. I can understand this, because there must be discipline in the Army. Whatever the orders from above are, they must be obeyed. I do not know why they are obeyed, but they are. There must be discipline in the Army.</p> <p>
I disagree with the Bill in its entirety. Parliament should be able to discuss this point which is so unfair to a certain section of men. Of course Parliament will approve it if the Minister lays an Order. He will gang up all his crowd behind him, and that will be that. We have seen that sort of thing many times during the last eleven years. He will get his Order. I do not understand why he wants to deny Parliament the opportunity of having a full discussion on matters of this kind.</p> <p>
I say this with great respect to you, Mr. Hynd. Hon. Members will have noticed that the Minister went wide of the Amendment and discussed the whole subject matter of the Clause. In fact, I thought that he was making a speech more appropriate to the question, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill". Other hon. Members may well have to do the same at a later stage in our discussion on this Amendment and on others.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I wish to reinforce what my hon. Friend the Member for Bermondsey (Mr. Mellish) said by going back to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s speech. Reflecting upon it, I found myself thinking that it was not necessarily true that if we have a small dirty thing the best thing to do is to cover it up with volubility. The longer the right hon. Gentleman talked about the <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> and the wider he went in defending it the more awkward it was and the greater were the difficulties it raised in my mind. I had not thought of the significance of these things until he spoke, and I was reflecting on what was the right hon. Gentleman's justification for his speech.</p> <p>
He tells us now that the whole justification for it is an emergency, a crisis. I do not believe a word of it. As my hon. Friend said, if there was a crisis the right hon. Gentleman should take desperate measures. There is no crisis in Berlin which makes the Bill necessary. There is a crisis which the Government knew was coming. For months, they have been told this in debate. It was a crisis due to the fact that they had


welshed on their figures, because they needed 180,000 men and they have got only 165,000. We know the kind of crisis they had.</p> <p>
I am told by people who know the Press that a conference was held only two days before the Queen's Speech at which it was stated that there would not be a Bill of this sort mentioned in the Queen's Speech. That was off the record. After that, it was spatchcocked into the Queen's Speech. This explains the kind of Bill before us.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I think we shall want to know a little more from the right hon. Gentleman. I was told by a friend I trust that only a few days before they were expressly told that there would be no Bill of this kind.</p> <p>
I understand that sometimes the Government have to alter the Queen's Speech because of the requirements of politics&#8212;Atlantic politcs&#8212;and that it is often convenient to insert something. What he said about the emergency is true, to this extent&#8212;in order to look as though we were doing something about Berlin and were increasing our

conventional forces, and it was convenient to have this Bill. We should be clear about what the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> means, because, Berlin or no Berlin he would still have needed to find the men. What he is doing now&#8212;I repeat what I said on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> in order to justify the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> of my hon. Friend&#8212;is that he is introducing a counterfeit selective draft in order to conceal the fact that he is short on the figures.</p> <p>
What we are now discussing is a kind of penalty the British public should pay to cover this call-up. The Government do not want too much publicity. They reckon that the 20,000 people concerned will know nothing about it and everybody else will keep quiet. Therefore, the right hon. Gentleman does not want to have another debate, and what we are asking for is a day's debate on an affirmative Order, and a discussion of this matter in order that the British people may see what is being done. I want people to understand the exact nature of what he is doing. My impression is that the Minister thinks it is a tremendous problem to get people to understand because of the nature of the call-up and he wants only a few people to know and not the general public in the country to know anything about it. The more the general public reflect on the nature of the call-up and the more they consider the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bermondsey in his speech, the angrier they will get, but when I go to my constituents I find that I have constantly to tell them because they do not know that we have a selective call-up of a special sort introduced in this dirty little Bill; I have to tell them about it. What are their reactions when I explain these things to them? They are not enthusiastic about the Bill, but they show a certain interest in the sort of things of which my hon. Friend the Member for Bermondsey was saying with a certain indignation. I appreciate the Minister saying why should we go on debating it in public, but we want very much the British people to know what the Government are doing, because if they knew it would put a stop to it.</p> <p>
Perhaps the worst thing of all in the Minister's speech was what he said about an emergency. He showed a scandalous tardiness in carrying this thing out. If


that is true, then to find oneself in a crisis, a grave emergency, having to pass <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a>, of this sort, is probably the worst defence that one could make&#8212;and, indeed, it is a defence, as so often happens, which makes the crime considerably worse. I am hoping for more interventions from the Minister to justify the crime, because each will illuminate more clearly the nature of the crime, and the nature of the crime is continual makeshift, continually avoiding facing the problem of the 1956 <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>, continually avoiding facing the fact that, having abolished National Service before he had got the minimum number of men, he falls back on this Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Bermondsey was frank over this problem. I share his view. I would rather have National Service than put ourselves in this desperate situation in which we are dependent on nuclear weapons and unable to play our role. I believe that the British public would rather have what we had in 1956 than what we have in 1961&#8211;62, as a result of five years delay. Now the Minister says that we have to do this because of the emergency in Berlin. He said that there was a threat to N.A.T.O. If there is a threat to N.A.T.O. on account of the British contribution, it has been there for the last five years.</p> <p>
It is absolutely clear. Year after year in this House in annual defence debates it has been pointed out from below the Gangway on both sides and no notice has been taken of it. Suddenly, at the last moment, we have to have this miserable makeshift Measure, this worst kind of selective draft, because there is nothing else that the Minister can think of to do about it. All he is doing is postponing for three years taking a decision. I wonder if the Minister will ask for another postponement. The reason why I am supporting with such energy my hon. Friend's Amendment is because of the demand for another full day's debate in order to impress upon the British public what is being done. I admit that in that debate we could not do more than find what was going on.</p> <p>
I hope that every debate on every Amendment will be as intense and thorough as this one. If we debate this matter for several days we may get the public to understand what is going on. I think some of us are determined about

that. We are glad to have the assistance of hon. Members on the back benches opposite. We are grateful to the Minister for ensuring that this <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> is seen against the whole complex military and diplomatic background. He plunged in and said, in effect, "I cannot let you have another debate." He did not quite say that. I think he said that he could not spare the time, but let us have a full discussion. There was a reference to the Minister discussing the matter with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>, but he did not guarantee to have a day for such discussion before next April.</p> <p>
All we are asking is that there should be an extra day for discussion of the affirmative Order. Then the right hon. Gentleman could save much time. If he were prepared to have an extra days' debate for that he need not waste time in discussing this Amendment. He is resisting this Amendment because he does not want to give a day's debate on an affirmative Order, and says that it is impossible. He gave many other reasons for resisting the Amendment, but why should it be impossible to devote one day to this matter and again to discuss it on the affirmative Order? It is not impossible, but only undesirable for the Minister's prestige in the mind of the public.</p> <p>
We should like the Minister once again to elaborate on why he wants the Bill, why he wants the call-up and why this extra day's debate should not come in due course when the matter is brought before Parliament again. If he does not tell us why, we shall know the reason. The reason will be that the Government are afraid of another discussion. That is the sole reason why they are opposing this Amendment. If that is not so, let the right hon. Gentleman give a single reason why, after his speech, he should not explain once again&#8212;with that brilliant lucidity he shows&#8212;the nature of the crisis and the tremendous emergency in N.A.T.O. The more we hear of this the more interested we get. I should like to hear another variation of it. Of course there will be a new excuse next spring. There will always be a new excuse for doing the same thing and covering it up.</p> <p>
Other hon. Members on this side of the Committee will want to put their reasons why we should carry this


Amendment before we go on to further discussions.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>One of the good things about the debate on this subject is that we have got away from the usual cosy discussion between a group of gentlemen who, with the greatest respect to them, are ex-<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_Army">Regular Army</a> officers with a considerable knowledge of everything in <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a> except the practical effects of post-war, peace-time conscription.</p> <p>
It is a good thing that we should discuss this Bill, because in the view of many people this is something which is intolerable in peace-time, unless the Government can say to the country that, not only is there a crisis&#8212;and, as many hon. Members have said, we are bound to live in a state of crisis for a long time to come&#8212;but a serious and immediate crisis, and if that were the case I think we should need something much larger than is provided for in this Bill. Two of my hon. Friends have said that they would prefer a form of conscription to this particular Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, East (Mr. Crossman) said that. One can see the arguments for that.</p>            </div>

I give my purely personal point of view as one who is not a defence expert but spent a gallant two and a half years in <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a> in which one of my main achievements was to lead a successful concert party. I do not talk to generals using their Christian names or engage in barrack room gossip from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Office">War Office</a>. One of the ideas I have about conscription is that, even if we have any tolerable form of conscription, the belief that that would enable us to fight a pause in Europe and to avoid nuclear conflict is highly dangerous and completely unjustified by the facts. The position is that with any form of conscription which was tolerable, the best which this country&#8212;</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I am grateful to you, Mr. Hynd, but the point I am making is very much tied up with these Amendments. The whole purpose of the argument behind these Amendments is that it is the job of the Government to justify this particular type of Measure when they want to introduce it.</p> <p>
It has been suggested that there are better ways of doing it than by this type of Measure. Obviously it would be out of order to pursue that point for very long, but I make the point on these Amendments that the idea that peacetime conscription of any type meets the problems which face this country and Europe at present is a highly dangerous idea. It is possible that a pause might be held with conventional forces, but I think that it is highly unlikely. I should have thought that in the intervening period the weight of numbers on the other side would be such and the devastation would be such that in a democracy we could not stop at that stage even if Parliament wanted to do so. The damage to men and women would be so considerable that we could not draw back and say that we had changed our minds.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amendments">The Amendments</a> we are considering raise a very important point. They ask that before those who are in the process of serving a national engagement&#8212;or who have completed their national engagement&#8212;are required to go beyond the original contract, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> should come to the House and justify his action and tell us how large the inroad should be. I should have thought that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would agree that if we are to embark on any changes in conscription in peace time it is reasonable for Parliament to discuss them at the time in relation to the specific incidents which arise and make them necessary.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> gave us a number of reasons why he could not accept these Amendments. He said, first, that the whole purpose of this exercise was that we have to maintain our commitment with our allies in this period of crisis. He went on to say&#8212;he will correct me if I am wrong&#8212;that he was thinking in


terms of extension of engagement for 15,000 men. I should have thought that 15,000 men would not enable us to meet our commitments in Europe. He went on to refer to a point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Easington (Mr. Shinwell) and compared this situation with what happened over the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War">Korean War</a>. If we were facing a position similar to that which my right hon. Friend faced at the time of Korea one could understand that the emergency is immediate, the demand clear and the crisis upon us.</p>            </div>

Members have tended to attach less importance to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s statements than was the case hitherto. The statement to which my hon.

Gentleman's best, anyway.</p> <p>
If, in fact, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> does not require these men with whom the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> is concerned for the crisis in Berlin we are entitled to ask for what crisis he requires them. If he requires them for the general crisis which exists in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East-West">East-West</a> relations, in B.A.O.R. and in Europe in general, the Bill does not meet or solve the problem. Hon. Members with considerable experience of these matters, on both sides of the Committee, who dislike this nasty little Bill intensely do so mostly because it does not meet the purposes which the Minister claims it is intended to cover. I should have thought that the Amendment calls for a very simple procedure.</p>            </div>

If there is a genuine crisis in Berlin that is so serious that we need more troops, is it not right that the Government should spell out that crisis in such a way that it convinces the nation that conscription is necessary? Would not that be better than applying their present argument which attempts to justify the retaining of merely a handful of men? Either we have a crisis which needs a lot of soldiers or we do not have a crisis and we do not need that great number of soldiers.</p>            </div>

I am merely pointing out that if there is a crisis at the moment which can be met by the Bill the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> is correct on the points he has made. But if such a crisis does not exist now, but the Bill exists in order to meet a crisis which may or may not arise at some unspecified date in the future, the Amendment&#8212;which calls for a debate to take place in the House on any action the Minister is to take at such a time to meet such a crisis&#8212;seems perfectly reasonable.</p> <p>
If the crisis is current now and the Government wish to hold on to 15,000 men next year to avoid this country being faced with a serious threat, then obviously there is no need for the Amendment. I should have thought that if that was the case we should be having not this Bill but one calling for general conscription. The whole point of my argument is that we are being asked to bring into being a Measure for indiscriminate conscription which will have no effect.</p>            </div>

Members that the purpose of the Bill&#8212;and the reason why he could not accept the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a>&#8212;was that he might need to

recall men in a period of rapidly increasing tension. I am suggesting that if this Measure meets an existing period of tension and that 15,000 men next year will meet that current problem, the Minister has made his case. He is therefore, perfectly justified in rejecting the Amendment. But if the period of crisis is not with us now, but might arise at some unspecified time in the future, the case for the Amendment is made because it is at such a time that Parliament would like to discuss the measures which the Minister would like to introduce. I should have thought it essential that Parliament should have an opportunity, on such an occasion, to discuss exactly what the Minister is doing.</p> <p>
Why should there be any <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> to the Amendment? A series of reasons have been offered, and the hon. Gentleman the Member for Clapham (Dr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Glyn">Alan Glyn</a>) said earlier that if Parliament met specially to discuss this selective call-up it would add to the international tension.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>One of the arguments against the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> is that we should keep this sort of thing quiet, just between ourselves, because we do not want Parliament to meet to discuss the matter. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> has said that he might want to recall these men in a period of rapidly increasing tension when Parliament was not in session. If this House gets into the position where a Minister can recall thousands of men to the Colours without Parliament being


recalled to discuss the matter, I do not know what will be the result. Are we really expected to believe that only at the end of the Summer Recess are we to hear, or read, that the Minister has done this off his own bat? I am increasingly amazed at this Government as we hear more of their arguments against what would appear to be a perfectly reasoned Amendment. In fact, one becomes increasingly more amazed at this Government&#8212;full stop.</p> <p>
Again, I was surprised when the Minister, in attempting to justify the application of this Measure to National Service men without Parliament having the opportunity of debating it beforehand on a special occasion, used an argument which, for precisely the same reason, I should have thought would lead to the conclusion that it should not apply to National Service men. The Regular is a volunteer who has consciously taken a decision to commit himself to military service. The conscript is a man who, to everyone's regret, has been called into <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a> without any choice at all. When the Minister has to make the choice, he chooses the conscript to do the additional service, in spite of the fact that he is a man who never wanted to do it in the first place, rather than the Regular who has consciously and willingly decided to undertake a military engagement for a period of years.</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman chooses to extend the military service of people who have already undertaken a burden which they did not want, which they did not undertake for its career prospects, which they did not undertake because of the financial emoluments and advantages held out to them by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Office">War Office</a>, which they did not undertake because they were attracted by glossy advertisements in magazines, but which they did undertake solely as an enforced contribution for them&#8212;quite rightly, as persons within a democratic society&#8212;in the service of their country. I should have thought that it was intolerable and likely to arouse very little sympathy indeed that the Minister should try to justify extending the contribution which those men have made without having to justify to the House at the particular time whether their service should be extended or not.</p> <p>
We are asking for something very simple. The debate and discussion we have had on this Measure so far are insufficient. The fact that we have had a <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> debate does not meet the point precisely because we on this side of the Committee, and a number of hon. Gentlemen opposite, believe that the Bill is not a Bill to meet the existing crisis at the present time but it is, in fact, to meet a crisis which has taken the Government by surprise. My hon. Friend the Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg) has been drawing attention to that crisis ever since I have been in the House. I can speak for only the past two years, but that surely should have been time enough for the Government to have some idea that events would work out in this way. This is, in fact, a shabby attempt by the Government to duck out of the political difficulties into which they have put themselves, regardless of the hardship which their action imposes upon people who have already made their contribution in the service of the country.</p> <p>
If the Minister wants the men to meet any particular crisis, the House and the British people will give him authority, as they have given Ministers authority in the past. What the House and the country want is the Minister's evidence that the crisis exists at the time. He has made out no case that this Measure is necessary to meet such a crisis. He has given no reasons justifying it at the present time. The least he should agree to do is to say that, when he wants the men and has to ask for them, he will come to the House and ask the House to consider whether a serious situation then exists to justify their recall.</p> <p>
It is not just a matter of individual hardship. Hon. Members have referred to the individual cases about which they are hearing through their <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> post-bags. The hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Kershaw) said that the fact that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Smith">Jimmy Smith</a> would lose his apprenticeship or job in industry, or the fact that he had a wife and three children, would enable us to discuss the problem at <a href="/glossary/?gl=25" title="Question Time is an opportunity for MPs and Members of the House of Lords..." class="glossary">Question Time</a>. That is not enough. What the House and the country will wish to consider at the time is the effect which such a move might have on the individual, the events which have led to it and the causes in the Government's handling of our


defence affairs. It will wish to consider also the far-reaching effect of these things on the nation's economy.</p> <p>
I support the Amendments because I regard them as the only safeguard at this stage to ensure that the House will have an opportunity of considering those matters. I think it is essential that we should bring every effort to bear on ensuring that people generally understand that what they are being asked to do and what their sons are being asked to do under this Bill&#8212;is not to meet a military crisis but to pay the price of bungling incompetence in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence">Ministry of Defence</a> and this <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> Government as a whole.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>This group of Amendments covers a fairly narrow point on which we have had quite a wide debate. I shall stray from the narrow scope of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> only a little in answer to a point which was discussed at some length by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>, namely, the crisis which has made all this necessary.</p> <p>
The argument all depends upon what one means by the word "crisis". If one means a crisis in our foreign affairs, it is nonsense, of course. This is the first time since the war when we have had no state of emergency existing anywhere within our own Commonwealth. It is the first time since the war when we have had nobody anywhere serving on active service. In Germany we are doing little more than half what we are obligated to do by treaty and what we were obligated to do by treaty in 1957 when the original policy was adopted.</p> <p>
On the other hand, if one means "crisis" in the sense in which the word is used by doctors, when someone has taken an infection or taken poison and at a certain point the consequences of the infection or poison reach the point of disaster, it may well be that we have a crisis on our hands. But it is a crisis which has arisen with a sense of inevitability, not as a result of anything unforeseen but with everything foreseen as a result of the Government's own policy. That is the only form of crisis with which we are dealing.</p> <p>
I turn now to the narrow meaning of the Amendment. It is strictly a procedural Amendment and nothing else. The

<a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> wants two kinds of power. Both are contingent powers. He wants neither immediately. Under <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 1, he wants a contingent power which he expects he will probably need in April. He says that, if he were surprised by something unforeseeable, he might need it before April. On the other hand, he has led us to hope that if he were surprised by a <i>d&#233;tente</i> which made things easier, he would not need it at all. That is the position with regard to retention.</p> <p>
It is at least very usual for a Minister who comes to the House to ask for a contingent power which he may or may not want to say, "If I do want it, I will ask for an Order to bring it into operation". That is both a usual and very convenient method.</p> <p>
If that is the case under Clause 1, how much more is it the case under Clause 2? Under Clause 2, the contingent power for which the right hon. Gentleman asks is not required until the end of 1963, and even then he has said that he will be very disappointed&#8212;disappointed with his "Ever-readies"&#8212;if that power is needed at all. If it is needed, surely the convenient method, the tidy method and the best method is to do it by Order. It is certainly a very usual way to do it.</p> <p>
What are the reasons put against doing it by Order? The first is that, if we needed this power, it might be because of a tricky situation in Europe and that an Order might cause alarm and despondency either within the Armed Forces, or among our allies or the people of Europe, or among our enemies, and it might make them nervous, like orders for mobilisation. On examination, that reason does not stand up for a moment. The fact that the matter was done by Order would not bring about any more publicity. Suppose that it were done by individual notice. Everyone gets the notice and everyone starts moaning about the notice. The newspapers pick up the story and those who get the notice write to their <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a>. Questions are tabled in Parliament. Every criticism is directed at the Government before they have had a chance to reply.</p> <p>
The matter does not get any less publicity if it is done in the way proposed by the Government. There is only publicity in the worst possible form. Surely if the Government want the Bill to be a success and the things that they


do to be a success&#8212;and here we are dealing with a matter in which morale is all important&#8212;the important thing is that the Government should have the opportunity to be able to tell the people straight away why they want it, and then they will get the response. Surely the laying of an Order which gives the Government the opportunity to explain publicly why they want the Bill is the best way from the Government's point of view to get their case in first and to get it over to the people instead of having it disseminated and built up into a moan, which is the form that the publicity takes. What could be more demoralising?</p> <p>
The second reason, which, again, I do not think stands up for a moment is that it is necessary to give people warning for their own convenience.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>With great respect, I should have thought that exactly the opposite was the case. Consider the situation. "Joe" gets a call-up notice. The news goes round the factory, the pubs, the clubs and the whole town. Everyone says, "Good lord, recall notice is coming. What will happen?" If the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> comes here and lays an Order and says, "I am going to recall a certain number of men. The recall notices are in the post and will be received tomorrow morning. No one who does no: receive it need worry, because

I am calling up only these men", what better opportunity would the right hon. Gentleman have for putting his case and for justifying it and for setting the limits? I cannot think of a more convenient or better way to do it.</p> <p>
As the Secretary of State said, warning is needed. We shall have immediately to start giving warning to the people whom we expect&#8212;we are not certain about it&#8212;to retain. Of course, the right hon. Gentleman himself provided the answer to that. He said, "I am already doing it before I have the Bill". He can equally do it before he has the order. There would be no difficulty in saying, "The probability is that we shall have to bring this measure into operation by 1st April, and you are one of the people we shall have to retain. You had better make your arrangements". We cannot do more than that anyway, because, unless it is sheer bluff when the right hon. Gentleman says, "If things turn very much for the better, I would not even need it in April", it must remain contingent. Whether the right hon. Gentleman has the Bill or not, he is giving a warning which he hopes will not materialise. The position about warning is the same whether we adopt the Government's procedure or not. As I have said, whatever way the matter is dealt with will not affect the volume of publicity, but it is possible to get the publicity into a much better and realistic form, with the Government having the first word in saying what they want.</p> <p>
Finally, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg) said, it is a very ancient principle of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> that Parliament controls the numbers in the Armed Forces. We have always sought to stick to that as closely as possible. We have machinery that keeps in Parliament's hands as effectively as possible control of the numbers in the Armed Forces. For that constitutional reason, we should adopt the method that we suggest unless there is a really conclusive reason of convenience against it. The Government have not produced the slightest reason of convenience against it. Publicity has broken down and warning has broken down. Therefore, when there is no case in convenience, in need or in urgency, would it be right for Parliament to surrender its control of the numbers in the Forces,


which is amongst its most fundamental ancient and important constitutional rights.</p> <p>
8.0 p.m.</p> <p>
I certainly suggest that my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, although I do not think that he needs much suggestion from me, should force the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> to a <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">Division</a> and I would ask all my hon. Friends to go into the Lobby in support of it. We have had an extremely good debate and whilst, obviously, the Committee would be interested in hearing anything which my hon. Friend wished to say in winding up, this is a Bill which, much as we dislike it, we are not trying to obstruct in any kind of way. There are a large number of highly important Amendments which require consideration and adequate discussion. I hope that the Government will change their minds and accept the Amendment, which would add to the convenience of the working of the Bill. It is a small one, a procedural one and, I believe, a right one.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>Before my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg) winds up, as he is entitled to do, may we not appeal to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> to reply to the powerful speeches which have been made by the last five or six speakers from this side of the Committee, and particularly the speech to which we have just listened from my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget) from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State made a preliminary but what appeared to be a superficial case for resisting the Amendments, since when the searching light of criticism has been cast upon his attitude. I hope that if I may give him a few moments of reflection, he will consider that the Committee is entitled to his reply to the case which my hon. Friends have put.</p> <p>
We know that the Executive and the bureaucracy always have a natural resistance to Parliamentary scrutiny. The first point that is felt widely, not only on this side of the Committee, is that, as one hon. Member opposite said, the Bill is admitted to be grossly unfair. That is indisputable. This Measure victimises a small number of men who are, in a sense, being double-crossed.</p> <p>
They were taken on for two years' conscription but are to be made liable to be held on to for a further period at the will of the Government.</p> <p>
It is agreed on both sides that this is a selective injustice that is being imposed. Some argue that it is necessary and inevitable in the circumstances of the case, but simply because it is admitted to be grossly unfair to a small number of citizens who happen to be National Service men or on the Reserve emphasises our duty to ensure the maximum Parliamentary scrutiny of the way in which the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> uses his powers under this Measure.</p> <p>
The second point to which, I hope, the Secretary of State will direct his attention&#8212;I did not think he was being deliberately ambiguous or indulging in duplicity in his speech&#8212;is why this Measure is needed at all and why he requires a blank cheque. Why should the Secretary of State have a blank cheque? Why should he not have to make orders that would be the subject of discussion in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>? Part of the Minister's speech tried to suggest that tension in international affairs and in Europe was such an emergency operation that it justified the Minister's having a blank cheque to do what he liked under the powers given by Parliament in the Bill. None of his hon. Friends has tried to justify that view. Nobody accepts it, because we all know that in relaxing international tension the Bill is neither here not there. Had it been the result of international tension, much greater powers would have been taken. Much larger measures would have been brought forward by the Government, Parliament would have been recalled in the middle of the summer and then, had the situation justified it, we should have been only too willing to give Ministers a blank cheque.</p> <p>
The crisis, from which arises these two Clauses which we are trying to amend, is the crisis in Government policy because of the difficulty in reconciling the commitments which the Government have undertaken in Europe and the failure of their recruiting policy to match up to them. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> has failed so far to admit that.</p> <p>
We want to see the Secretary of State at the Box coming clean about the reasons for the Bill. This Measure


has to be produced because the Government have undertaken certain commitments for military forces. The Government decided to abolish conscription and their gamble in their recruiting policy has not matched the commitments which they have undertaken.</p>            </div>

mentary scrutiny in detail. It makes a great deal of difference.</p> <p>
If it was due to some enormous international crisis, that could be a reason for saying that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> should be voted a blank cheque because emergency action has to be taken. If, however, the nature of the crisis is the incompetence of the Minister in failing to recruit sufficient Regular forces or his miscalculation of the relation between those forces and commitments abroad, that is why the Minister at every stage should be forced to justify his Measure to Parliament. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will now reply to the searching and serious criticisms which have been made in the course of this discussion.</p>            </div>

Members who added their names to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> and for the support we have had from all quarters of the Committee. I shall shortly accept the advice of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget), in view of the very important Amendments on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=5" title="The order paper is issued daily and lists the business which will be dealt..." class="glossary">Order Paper</a> still to be dealt with, and ask my hon. Friends now to come to a decision. It seems to me the right and proper thing to do. The debate has been worthwhile and it has elicited a number of points.</p> <p>
The first point was the admission that what the Government wanted was a blank cheque and what anyone who has pinched somebody else's chequebook wants is that somebody else shall honour it. This was an admission from the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Kershaw) who has held high office in the party opposite. Then we had the admission of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for War. He made a point of some substance against me when he said that on <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 1 he would be in grave administrative difficulty if he were called upon to present an Order


to the House&#8212;because he would not have the time.</p> <p>
This is a final admission of failure on a Measure, the influence of which goes to every home in the country and every regiment in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles">British Isles</a>. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_War">Secretary of State for War</a> says, "We have left this so long that I cannot even carry out for administrative reasons the undertakings which I gave on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>. Therefore I cannot meet your arguments". It is a powerful argument against me, but it seems to me a tremendous admission of failure on the part of the Government.</p> <p>
Then, later, the right hon. Gentleman said, "On Clause 2 I shall be in difficulties if I am required to come to the House, perhaps in a state of emergency." It is not until 1963 that he even contemplates using these powers. Is he then saying that again in 1963 he will wait once more until after 12 o'clock before he takes action? That is the implication of what he says. He says in effect, "Because we know that the next step will be even more unpopular, like Mr. Micawber we shall hope that something will turn up and then we shall come along with a stopgap Measure and say that we cannot do anything but what we are now doing because we have left it too late." I hope that, for that reason if for no other, hon. Members opposite will join with us in going into the <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">Division</a> Lobby.</p>            </div>

Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield,_Brightside">Sheffield, Brightside</a> (Mr. Winterbottom) has just made. He made the fair point that there are some National Service men who have done more than two years' service and therefore it makes it all the more necessary that if under the <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> some of these boys are to be asked to serve a further six months the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg) should be passed by the Committee to ensure that the injustice already done to some of these boys should not continue to be done for a further six months. This, therefore, adds weight to the argument that we should have the right in this Chamber to decide whether these people should be called up for an extra six months.</p> <p>
I should like to make an appeal to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>. He was asked a question by the noble Lord the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscount_Lambton">Viscount Lambton</a>) the answer to which would help us to complete discussion on the Bill and the various Amendments associated with it. Is it now agreed, by the


Secretary of State that we are discussing selective conscription? Can we have some statement from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>? We shall get into an awful tangle later on if we cannot have that made clear as soon as maybe. It is relevant to the Amendment. Will the right hon. Gentleman answer?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>We have had a most interesting and useful discussion on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> which was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg), who is to be congratulated on moving an Amendment which apparently covered only a narrow issue but which enabled speeches which were interesting and comprehensive to be made.</p> <p>
We now turn to a more substantial Amendment which I hope the right hon. Gentleman will accept, although I admit that it profoundly changes the whole nature of the Bill. The Amendment raises the whole question of the relationship of different parts of the Bill to each other, and we shall ask the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for a good deal of clarification. The simple point is that the Minister should not have power to conscript men under <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 1 or Clause 2 while volunteers of similar qualifications are available under the "Ever-ready" scheme in Clause 3. If the Minister means what he has said about preferring a voluntary system and hoping for success for the "Ever-ready" scheme, these are Amendments which he can accept. So far, however, his intentions about the

"Ever-ready" scheme have not been altogether clear.</p> <p>
We know that he wants those affected by Clause 2 to be able to volunteer for the "Ever-ready" scheme. We know that he wants those National Service men on part-time service to be able to volunteer for the "Ever-ready" reserve. He said so on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>. On the other hand, he prohibits those covered by Clause 1 from volunteering for the Emergency Reserve.</p> <p>
I would like the Committee to consider the implications of the fact that in certain circumstances the Minister would wish to conscript men under Clause I and Clause 2 even though similarly qualified men were available under Clause 3. That is the position he has to defend if he resists the Amendments. I ask hon. Members to imagine that the Emergency Reserve is a great success, the "Ever-ready" scheme is a great success and that volunteers come forward in considerable numbers. There is a big reserve of people qualified to volunteer for the new reserve. First, there are about 100,000 volunteer members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Army">Territorial Army</a>. Under Clause 3, all of those can apply to become "Ever-readies." In addition, there are 200,000 part-time National Service men who can volunteer for the new reserve. In a year's time there will be fewer&#8212;the Minister says that about 100,000 National Service men will be able to volunteer&#8212;but today there are 300,000 possible volunteers. At the end of next year there will be 200,000 possible volunteers, and probably in the middle of the year about 250,000 possible volunteers.</p> <p>
Now suppose that the appeal for volunteers is successful. Surely, as we have argued already, it may make totally unnecessary the conscription of men either under Clause 1 or under Clause 2? Many of these volunteers will, after all, be equally. well trained. A high proportion of these volunteers under the "Ever-ready" scheme, both in the middle, and


at the end, of next year will be at least as well trained as the men whom the Minister proposes to conscript under Clause 1 and Clause 2.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> cannot say that his preference for conscription under Clause 1 and Clause 2 is based on the fact that these men are trained, because, on the assumptions that I am making a proportion of the "Ever-ready" volunteers will have lone their National Service and be equally well trained. Indeed, on my assumption a high proportion of these volunteers in the Reserve will be better qualified. They will have been selected under the provisions of the "Ever-ready" scheme from a number of volunteers, and for that reason we can assume that their standard as soldiers will, on the whole, be higher than the standard of those whom the Minister demands power to conscript under Clause 1 and Clause 2. Therefore, there are two solid reasons for preferring to take his men from the "Ever-ready" scheme voluntarily, instead of conscripting them.</p> <p>
Here are two further reasons for pressing the Minister to do this. First, because the men he will be accepting under the "Ever-ready" scheme, will not, by definition, be hardship cases. They will be volunteers, and we have been told by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for War that it is his aim to avoid as much as possible inevitable hardship involved in the application of this Bill. We shall be able to deal with this problem in a number of subsequent Amendments. I make this third point in favour of accepting these volunteers, that there will be no hardship involved, unlike in the case of conscripts.</p> <p>
Finally, we shall be able to get men through the "Ever-ready" scheme who will probably not be obsessed by a powerful and justifiable sense of grievance about the way they have been brought into <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a>, because, as we on this side of the Committee have said time and again, one enormous disadvantage, or drawback, of Clause 1 and Clause 2 is that a small number of men who are retained in this way, or called back in this way, will, inevitably, have a powerful and well-justified sense of grievance, and a handful of these men in a unit of volunteers may make a great deal of difference.</p> <p>
I speak from personal experience. During the war I had the experience of serving both in a completely voluntary unit and in an almost wholly conscript unit. There is undoubtedly a tremendous difference in spirit, particularly where a group of volunteer soldiers is mixed with a small nucleus of conscripts. That is a profoundly unhappy situation, and one which this Bill will greatly increase.</p> <p>
For these four reasons I ask the Minister to consider the advantages of taking men from the "Ever-ready" pool instead of taking them under Clause 1 or Clause 2. First, no hardship is involved. Secondly, because the men, being volunteers, have no sense of grievance. Thirdly, because he will be able to choose the National Service men of equally good training, and, fourthly, because they will be better qualified and of a higher standard than the men he proposes to conscript under Clause l and Clause 2.</p> <p>
I should have thought that that was a fairly self-evident fact, and all that our Amendment says is that while there are enough volunteers of similar qualifications the Minister shall not be allowed to conscript men under Clause 1 and Clause 2.</p> <p>
I should have thought that the Minister might find this acceptable. I cannot see any reason why he should not. He has often told us that he believes in the voluntary system, and he has talked in the same way as I am talking about the disadvantage of conscript soldiers. He has made elaborate speeches about his worries on the score of hardship, about which we shall press him later, and he has already said that he hopes to get enough Clause 2 conscript volunteers to avoid conscription.</p> <p>
I should like to quote his remarks on this point. In the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Reading">Second Reading</a> debate he said:
<q>It is possible that we shall never have to operate this second measure"&#8212;</q>
that is, the Clause 2 scheme&#8212;
<q>which is solely designed as an insurance against national need during the period of transition from conscription while the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_Army">Regular Army</a> will be at low strength. I have good reason for saying this, because of the provisions of Clause 3, which is designed to create a new form of volunteer Reserve within the Territorial Army."&#8212;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 27th November, 1961; Vol. 650, c. 51.]</q>


The "Ever-ready" scheme is a long term plan, and so far as the scheme meets with success it will obviously help to reduce the possible need to recall part-time National Service men, because this voluntary force would be called upon first. That is the Minister's position. We ask him to go a little further in a totally logical direction and to say that he will not conscript men when volunteers are available.</p> <p>
I am not sure what his objections are. In practice, he may say, "I shall not have in the 'Ever-ready' reserve men of similar qualifications." On the contrary, if the scheme is any success I think that he will have a large number of men with similar or better qualifications than he will get under Clauses 1 and 2. But if he does not get enough men with similar qualifications the Amendment in no way ties his hands. We are concerned only that he should be impelled to make sure that no volunteers are available first.</p> <p>
He may say that the training of the "Ever-ready" reserve will not be good enough. As I have already said, many will he National Service men, and will be well-trained. That does not mean that hon. Members on this side are satisfied with the training likely to be given to the volunteers in the "Ever-ready" scheme. We feel that there is a strong case for the Minister's looking into the possibility of special courses of training for volunteers in that scheme. But even as it is, on the assumptions that I am making there should be a sufficient number of former National Service men, part time&#8212;if the scheme works at all&#8212;to provide the men he needs.</p> <p>
He said that he will give priority to volunteers, and I accept that. He is going to give them priority over the Clause 2 men. But I want to tie him down a little. It is much easier for him to take a man under Clause 2 than under the "Ever-ready" scheme. To begin with, it is much cheaper. If he takes a man under Clause 2, all he has to pay him is a bounty of &#163;20, but if he accepts a volunteer under the "Ever-ready" scheme the figure is &#163;150 a year for the volunteer's making himself available, and a bounty of &#163;50. There is a considerable financial inducement for the Government to conscript men under Clause 2&#8212;let alone under Clause 1, in

respect of which there is no bounty&#8212;rather than to take volunteers under Clause 3.</p>            </div>

Here the point is&#8212;this runs through a lot of what the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> has been telling us about the Bill&#8212;that the right hon. Gentleman has in mind that these men referred to in <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 1 and, to some extent, in Clause 2, are already soldiers. The right hon. Gentleman thinks of them as already being his bodies. During the <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> debate when we talked about the procedure for appeal against this extra six months, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> said that they would continue with the old arrangements that were already in existence for


compassionate release. There will be Amendments moved later on that point.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State has in mind that these are men who belong to him and that if they wish to be released on grounds of hardship, they should apply for a release, and they must apply in the ordinary way for compassionate release. That is a totally wrong way to look at it. These men are not the Secretary of State's bodies. They are men whom the Secretary of State will call up. They are not asking for release. The Secretary of State is asking to vary a contract so that they will serve another six months after a period of two years. To go on for another six months a man needs to be compensated much more than by the wages of a Regular soldier. He needs to be compensated for all the arrangements he has made in his private life; for the arrangements he has made in respect of a job; for the home life that will be lost and for not being in Britain when he wanted to be. Compensation for these men should go far beyond the amount of pay given to a Regular soldier. The Regular soldier volunteered for the job. These men did not volunteer and they deserve far better than is provided for the Regular soldier.</p> <p>
These men deserve far better treatment than the National Service man who stood his chance like everybody else and was conscripted at the right age like everybody else. But these men will have done their National Service. Already they will have served a longer period of National Service than anyone else in the Western countries and so they deserve more consideration than the Regular soldier or the National Service man.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I cannot recall the precise arrangements made by my right

hon. Friend, but I would certainly say that when the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> has produced a contract which admittedly is embodied on the Statute Book, for a period of two years, and then breaks the contract to make the period two-and-a-half years, contrary to the wishes of the man concerned, serious compensation should be paid to the man for that loss. I am certain that is right.</p> <p>
I have wandered a little from the point to which I was seeking a reply from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, the simple point why he should conscript men against their will when similar volunteers are available to him? If we do not tie down the right hon. Gentleman by means of this <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> he will attempt to do that because it is cheaper for him to conscript men under the provisions of Clauses 1 and 2 and also because it is more convenient. If we are to judge whether to retain a man or to call him up on the basis of his personal position and hardship it is a much more burdensome business administratively than simply to take the men required for military reasons.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> said on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> that he proposed that almost all the men in B.A.O.R. who would be affected should be retained under <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 1 in April. This means that he will retain men under Clauses 1 and 2 not in accordance with their own personal individual positions. The right hon. Gentleman does not mind if they are married men with children, or if they are single, or if they have financial responsibilities. What matters to him is where they are posted. That is his criterion for the retention of these men.</p> <p>
We on this side say that we can mitigate the injustice of this Measure, bad as it is, by insisting that men are not retained if they have personal hardship grounds for exemption. This goes against the convenience of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Office">War Office</a> planners and of the Minister. It is easier and cheaper for him to conscript under Clauses 1 and 2. Therefore, we seek to tie his hands by the Amendment.</p> <p>
I do not know what the Minister's grounds will be for resisting the Amendment or even if he will resist it. I shall wait to hear what he proposes to do. I hope that he will not say, "I must keep my powers to conscript under Clause 2,


because while I have powers to conscript under Clause 2 all the National Service men who may be affected will volunteer for the ' Ever-ready' scheme". There was a hint of that in his <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Reading">Second Reading</a> speech. His argument is that he can persuade volunteers into the "Ever-ready" scheme by threatening them with conscription under Clause 2.</p> <p>
This is a funny kind of volunteering. It is a typical army volunteering. Hon. Members know the story&#8212;"I want volunteers for the cookhouse&#8212;you, you, and you". That is an old Army method of volunteering. Is the Minister insisting on his powers under Clause 2 with the fact in mind that this will encourage those who may be affected to volunteer instead under the "Ever-ready" scheme? The kind of volunteer he will then get for the "Ever-ready" scheme will not be a genuine volunteer. It will spoil the whole conception of the Reserve and he will be accepting as volunteers those who are being pressured by him to volunteer.</p> <p>
I hope that I have made the meaning of these Amendment clear to the Committee. I hope that my hon. Friends will support me in making this simple point clear to the Minister. If he believes in a voluntary system, this is his chance to show that he means it. He should simply say to the Committee, "I agree. If I can get these men by voluntary methods under the Reserve I will not conscript them under Clauses 1 and 2".</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>After April of next year, the period for which he will be able to retain men in <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the army</a> under <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 1 will amount to a very few months and will not last long. Under Clause 2, he will be able to retain men until the summer of 1966, and after that, he will be entirely dependent on the "Ever-readies", which ought to suit the hon. Gentleman. It is a nice idea to have "Ever-readies", but even if volunteers come forward, and I am sure that we all hope they will, how much use are they likely to be?</p> <p>
At worst, the Army may well find itself dependent upon men who have had one fortnight's camp and a few evening drills, but what use is a man like that likely to be if he is sent for six months, which is a very short period, and has not time to get settled in? He is sent off by himself for a period of six months to a strange unit, because there is no question of these men going by units or sub-units. It will be a single man who has had one fortnight's camp and a few evening drills who is to be sent off to fill a gap in an existing unit. How much use is that likely to be?</p> <p>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that at the present time there is a large pool of men who have done their National Service and who are in effect trained soldiers already. One hopes that they will volunteer, but in 1966 my right hon. Friend will get very few indeed, and that is the period I am worried about.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>This Bill is an outrage against personal liberty. I believe that not a single conscript should be required to do the extra six months while there is a single "Ever-ready" available. This is an offence against our sense of fair play and justice. It is wrong for the Government to use compulsion when voluntary methods are available to them.</p> <p>
The Government are evidently unaware just how obnoxious this business is. This evening, there have been hon. Members who have defended general conscription, but I agree with the founder-father of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party">Labour Party</a>&#8212;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Hardie">Keir Hardie</a>&#8212;who said that conscription is the mark of the slave, and he was


speaking about conscription in war time. How much more intolerable is conscription in peace time.</p> <p>
In some units at this moment, officers are explaining to their men who are likely to be retained, and the indignation and bitterness has been tremendous. I share these men's feelings. The Government say that they are terribly sorry for the National Service men whom they are having to call up for an extra six months, but, nevertheless, they are continuing with that calling up. What hypocrisy. It is like a gang of thugs who waylay an old age pensioner and say that they are terribly sorry for her, but they must take her purse. The Government are saying in the same way to the National Service man that they are terribly sorry for him, but they must take his manpower.</p> <p>
9.0 p.m.</p> <p>
There are 430,000 in the Armed Forces. There has been too much talk of 165,000 and 180,000. <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">The Army</a> has a shrinking number compared with the other two Forces. The total at which the Government are aiming is 430,000 and they think they will get 410,000. If we cannot meet our commitments with 410,000 voluntary men plus the "Ever-readies", we shall have to cut our commitments. If it is asked where we should cut our commitments, the answer will be found in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> debate&#8212;in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, Singapore and other parts of the world.</p> <p>
On <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Reading">Second Reading</a> the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> said that he had had favourable discussions with the T.U.C. I suggest that although the T.U.C. may have said that it had no objection to the "Ever-readies" the T.U.C. gave no support at all to conscripting men for an extra six months. I should like to know from the Secretary of State exactly what the T.U.C. did view with favour.</p> <p>
If an individual person is unjustly fined or imprisoned there is a tremendous outcry, and rightly so, but here the Government are doing a great injustice, not to an individual, but to perhaps 15,000, 20,000 or 25,000 men. This is not a light matter. It is not like a &#163;2 fine, yet we have had debates in this House over the unjust imposition of a &#163;2 fine.</p> <p>
Now we are to compel men to serve an extra six months, taking a large chunk out of their lives.</p> <p>
The defence made by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> has always been that of military necessity. I object to this Committee considering only military necessity. Are there not other necessities? Is there not the need of the young wife or mother to have her husband in the home to look after herself and her baby? Is there not a need for a young man to pursue his career without this gratuitous interference. Is there not need in industry for these men? I believe they would be doing a far better job there than in the Forces.</p> <p>
In my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> I have had a number of cases of men who, because of hardship, have been granted release. I must pay tribute to the Under-Secretary in this respect. All those cases which come to me&#8212;and I am sure they come to other hon. Members&#8212;have been about National Service men. Volunteers, the Regulars, are less dissatisfied. They have thought these things over before they joined up, but for the poor National Service men this is where the injustice lies: they have no choice. It is unjust to them and not much good to the Army either.</p> <p>
The last batch of National Service men have had an extremely raw deal. It is a matter of whether they were born a week before or after a certain date. I understand that in all these cases a line has to be drawn somewhere, but it seemed to me that this last batch of men might be given a reduced period of service. Instead, the Government say that they are to have an increased period of service. This is indeed a double injustice.</p> <p>
Reverting to the point about interference with careers which will take place unless this <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> is carried, I wish to read from a letter I received this week from a retired naval lieut.-commander. He writes:
<q>I wonder if you could mention the anxiety of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Medical_Association">British Medical Association</a> over the retention of doctors within the National Service? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Association">The Association</a> contends that this is going to create hardship for these young doctors, of whom there is already a shortage. The doctors also wonder if the B.M.A. was consulted before the decision was reached to retain doctors in National Service.</q>
That is very relevant to the Amendment. If young doctors want to volunteer for


the Army that is their business, but to conscript even one of them is utterly wrong when "Ever-readies" are available.</p> <p>
Although I once asked the Minister if a National Service man with a wife and child would be exempted, I received no reply. I know from my constituency experience in Salford that tens of thousands of National Service men who are now serving are married and, in many cases, have children. It is entirely wrong&#8212;and if the Secretary of State has any fairness in him he will realise that it is wrong&#8212;that in 1961, in peace time, a married man with young children should be forced to serve in the Armed Forces.</p> <p>
Some of these married men with children, I believe, are to be asked to serve an additional six months. Surely the least the Minister can do is to exempt them. I do not believe that the right hon. Gentleman is going to do so and I therefore hope that my hon. Friends will press the Amendment. Again I pay tribute to the Under-Secretary, because I know that where exceptional hardship can be proven, compassionate discharge is allowed. But there must be exceptional hardship in all these cases. Discharge should be granted without any further proof. There should, for example, be automatic discharge for any National Service man who has a wife and one or more children.</p> <p>
If that is right, how much stronger is the case for exempting them from a further six months' service? This brings me back to the Amendment, which says that there should be no call up of National Service men while "Ever-readies" are available. The number of married men with children in the last batch to be called up who may have to serve the extra six months will be higher than ever before, for many of these men had completed apprenticeships before going into National Service. Thousands of them will be 23 years old before leaving the Armed Forces. If these men are not to be automatically exempted I maintain that the only alternative is to say that no National Service man should have to serve an additional six months while a single "Ever-ready" is available.</p>            </div>

The hon. Gentleman the Member for Woolwich, East (Mr. Mayhew) put his finger on the point when he explained that if we made these changes&#8212;and if I accepted the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a>&#8212;it would make a profound difference to the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hall">John Hall</a>) made a point on which I think I should elaborate, because a number of speeches have been made asking me to accept the Amendment in order to avoid special hardship being caused to those who might be held next year in the interests of keeping B.A.O.R. up to strength.</p> <p>
I must point out that, when a similar sort of thing happened under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> and a lot of National Service men had to be kept, there was no arrangement then for any sort of recompense in the form of a bounty, and in regard to those National Service men who were kept&#8212;there must have been many cases like this where there was hardship to be dealt with&#8212;there was no question of men coming forward and saying, "You must show why we should be kept on". Exactly the same procedure as we are thinking of now was adopted then, namely, that the hardship cases came up and were reviewed in exactly the same way as for any other person who was a National Service man. That is the way it worked then.</p>            </div>

Gentleman will read my speech if he was not, perhaps, able to be here at the time&#8212;the reasons why we have had to take powers under the Bill. I am anxious to keep this matter narrow. It ought not to be enlarged.</p> <p>
I turn now to the point at issue. The main objection to the first of these two Amendments is simply that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Army">Territorial Army</a> Emergency Reserve is intended&#8212;I have made this plain, too, and the hon. Gentleman stressed it himself &#8212;as a long-term concept. It is designed specifically to provide a voluntary force right from the start. Therefore, liability must, I submit, be a liability for a possibility, not a certainty. In other words, when somebody joins up in the "Ever-readies", the Territorial Army Emergency Reserve, he takes his bounty and he takes his chance not of the certainty but of the possibility that he might have to be recalled for six months in the particular year for which he takes on. It would be a certainty if, the moment a man was enrolled as an "Ever-ready", he was immediately called up and swapped over for a National Service man serving at the time. That would be quite a different thing.</p> <p>
If the Government had decided to rely on what one might call a voluntary

system of selective service, they would have gone about the Bill in a completely different way. The requirement is for men who are already trained, and we came to the conclusion that the best way of effecting what we needed was to retain men now actually serving. In the circumstances, for the purposes for which we want them, they must be better than any Territorial soldier recalled, however good he may be, because these other people are in their right categories, and many of them are serving in the B.A.O.R.. at the moment.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I would urge the hon. Gentleman to listen to the whole case. I know that he is very eager to make his point. If when I have finished he has any doubt about the matter, perhaps I can help him further.</p> <p>
The main objection to the first <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a>, which concerns the question of using the "Ever-readies" instead of the men we are retaining, not the recalled men, is that this is a voluntary force that we are seeking to create for the long term. Therefore, it must rest on a liability of a possibility of recall. It would be futile to start a voluntary reserve for people who at the moment that they joined would have to serve. That would be a completely different concept.</p> <p>
Another equally important point is this. The success of this new long-term concept depends, and must depend, very


largely on the co-operation on both sides of industry, whatever we in Parliament do. It was in this context that I mentioned on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> that we had discussions with the T.U.C. and with the representatives of the employers. They were favourable discussions and they were confidential discussions. We found that there was a general feeling of co-operation in trying to make the scheme a success.</p> <p>
In my view, if an employer is asked to accept the possibility of one of his employees being called up for six months during any one year of engagement, that is one matter. But if we ask him to accept the certainty that the moment that one of his employees has joined as an "Ever-ready" he is bound to be called up, because there is a National Service man being retained for whom he must be swapped, that is another matter. Employers will not agree to a form of voluntary service which means that some of their best men are paid &#163;150 and immediately taken from them.</p> <p>
There are two distinct phases in this matter. <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 1 deals with the retention, which has been done before and is not new, of a certain number of National Service men for a period. During that time, we intend to try to build up a new voluntary force, but it will be really voluntary, men volunteering against the possibility of being recalled later. In my opinion, from the point of view of the volunteers and the employers, we can get this force which we regard as a long-term necessity only if we do it in this way.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>The point has been made that some men who became "Ever-readies" might well have just stopped doing their National Service and could be regarded as pretty well trained. I see my hon. Friend's point. The main point is that we cannot build a force of this nature on a really voluntary basis if the moment a man is recruited to the "Ever-readies" he is put straight back into <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a>. That is not the purpose of this new long-term reserve.</p> <p>
I made it plain on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> that it would he the intention of the Government to call out <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_Army">Territorial Army</a> Emergency Reservists before recalling National Service men under <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 2. I have made it plain and will make it plain again, in spite of the hon. Member's attempt to suggest that we were trying to get the men we want on the cheap and, because it would be cheaper, we should call up the part-time National Service men liable under Clause 2.</p> <p>
If the hon. Member does a calculation, he will find that there is only about &#163;30 difference. Once we have a Territorial Army Emergency Reserve, we are bound to pay the bounty of &#163;150 a year whether or not we call up the men. We should, therefore, be committed to the &#163;150 and we should not save it by calling up part-time National Service men. The difference in the gratuity would be between &#163;20 in one case and &#163;50 in the other. No Government would be skinflint to the extent of saying that although they paid those men &#163;150 bounty, they would call up the other less well-trained men in order to save &#163;30 per man. To do so would be ridiculous.</p> <p>
I have made the point that we would call up the "Ever-readies" in preference to part-time National Service men. What I cannot do is to guarantee this. I do not want to make it a statutory obligation, because it could lead to inflexibility, and considerable difficulty might arise even by the use of the words "similar qualifications" in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a>. In circumstances such as would envisage who would say what were or were not "similar qualifications"? However much hon. Members might like to do something of that sort, I cannot put the legislation in jeopardy in that way.</p> <p>
I cannot take on a statutory obligation, but I give an absolute undertaking, which is bound to be carried out, because from the Government's point of view it is far better to call up the "Ever-readies", that we will call them in priority to anybody under Clause 2. I cannot, however, he hound by statutory obligations. I hope the Committee will understand concerning Clause 1 that it would make nonsense and would throttle this new Reserve at birth if the moment we enrolled the men in it, we were to call them up and put them into the Army instead of the retained National Service men.</p> <p>
For that reason, I am unable to accept the Amendments.</p>            </div>

I submit it because, with the application of <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 1, we shall have a very limited extension of conscription, especially when the concessions under the hardship Clauses are taken into account. Therefore, we shall have serving a longer period in <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a> people who have a growing sense of dissatisfaction. I call the right hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that those who are in the Army at the moment are those National Service men who were the last to be called to the service, perhaps because time and circumstances were against them at that moment.</p> <p>
They resented the fact that they had to go and that some others were not called to the Colours. All kinds of prevention happened whereby a man cannot be called under Clause 2 of the Bill and will not serve under Clause 1, yet a man with equal claims to exemption from National Service on hardship ground may be serving at the moment.</p> <p>
I should like to give one or two illustrations. Just before the final intake of men into National Service a man asked me how he could avoid it. I pointed to the hardship tribunal. I do not believe that if he had gone before that tribunal he would have suceeded in his claim to periodic exemption. I believe that the tribunal would have said, "You ought to go into the Forces now. Your case of hardship is not fully justified." But before he reached the hardship tribunal the intake was stopped. Yet a man older than himself with more responsibilities had already gone into the Forces and is still there and under Clause 1, will be called upon to serve an extra six months.</p> <p>
I should like to illustrate this argument by quoting the case of a famous personality in this country, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Richard">Cliff Richard</a>, who was one month short of being called to the Forces.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Richard">Cliff Richard</a> is just over 21 years of age. I would say, subject to physical fitness, that in the normal circumstances of conscription he would be serving in the Colours today. He was a month too young to be called up, but a man who was a month older and who was called up can serve more than two years plus anything that may now be imposed upon him by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>.</p> <p>
9.30 p.m.</p> <p>
The fact is that two years is not the maximum which is now being served. Many National Service men are already

serving for longer. Many of those brought home from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_East">Far East</a> do not get back to this country until their two years' service has been exceeded. When the period of leave is added to their service, it works out at almost two years and two months. Now, on top of that, these men are to serve an extra six months.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State is trying to secure through National Service men what he has failed to get by an intake of Regulars. He may think that this is creditable, but it will cause a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst the men in the Forces who feel that they have been discriminated against and that they are getting a raw deal. Indeed, they feel that the Secretary of State has broken faith with them after the promises which were made. It is because of that that I support the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a>.</p> <p>
If the Secretary of State can get an "Ever-ready" brigade by voluntary means, it will be far better to have in it the type of man who has already had his training as a National Service man or as a Regular. It would be far better to have such men in the Forces than the remains of the National Service scheme, with dissatisfied men having to stay on, feeling aggrieved in spite of the fact that their pay has been raised to the level of the Regular soldier's.</p> <p>
Most of these men now in the Forces are 21 years of age and over, and in ordinary civil life would be receiving, in many cases, a journeyman's rate of pay. There are men now receiving the ordinary infantryman's rate who, if they came back to my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> to work in a steel factory, would be getting &#163;20 or &#163;25 a week. Yet the Secretary of State is asking such men to sacrifice, at a cheap rate, the heritage they have worked for.</p> <p>
The Government are making a big mistake, which is the result of their inefficiency and inability either to read the signs of <a href="/glossary/?gl=49" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/" class="glossary">the times</a> or to prepare adequate defence of this country. Because they have failed they want to thrust the responsibility upon Parliament by this Bill&#8212;responsibility for what is, in peace time, a system that can only be likened to the slave labour of times gone by.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I listened carefully to the speech


of the right hon. Gentleman the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for War and that of the hon. and gallant Member for Bute and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ayrshire">North Ayrshire</a> (Sir F. Maclean) in an endeavour to discover whether there was a substantial answer to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a>. I am bound to say that I failed to see even an outline of one. The right hon. Gentleman invited us to think that we had disregarded what he described as the long-term concept of the "Ever-readies". I do not think that any disregard of that kind is implicit in the Amendment.</p> <p>
What is fundamental to the concept of the "Ever-readies" is surely the fact that they are to be a voluntary force and that they become "Ever-readies" by entering voluntarily into written agreements. It is not the fact that they do not know when they are to be called up that makes them "Ever-readies". That is not the basic characteristic of the force. The basic characteristic of the force is that its members are volunteers. There is nothing in the Amendment which runs counter to that.</p> <p>
There was the same fault in the reasoning of the hon. and gallant Member. He suggested that hon. Members on this side of the Committee were overoptimistic in their expectation of the numbers of "Ever-readies" who would be forthcoming and over-confident about <a href="/glossary/?gl=49" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/" class="glossary">the times</a> at which they would be forthcoming. That again does not seem to answer the arguments which we have presented.</p> <p>
After all, what the Amendment is is a logical conclusion of a proposition which, I would have thought, all hon. Members could agree was perfectly reasonable, namely, that the number of men who are to be retained under <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 1 should be affected, at least in some measure, by the number of volunteers available under Clause 3. That is what we are asking for. It is true that our Amendment carries it to its logical conclusion, but that is what we are asking for.</p> <p>
Of course it is an inflexible proposal, and an unsatisfactory proposal because it is inflexible, that the number of men to be retained under Clause 1 may not be affected by the number of volunteers coming forward under Clause 3. The

Committee is entitled to expect and ask for a much more thorough and complete answer to the arguments which have been presented than it has hitherto received.</p> <p>
What strikes me about the proposal in Clause 1 is that it will be generally agreed by all hon. Members that the retention of men under Clause 1 may and in many instances will cause considerable hardship. Everyone recognises that there is an arbitrary element in the selection of men under Clause 1. The matter was very clearly put by my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark (Mr. Gunter) who pointed out that these men coming at the end of National Service, who might have expected to receive somewhat less severe treatment than their predecessors, are being called upon to give longer service than they did</p> <p>
Earlier this afternoon, my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Hale) adumbrated the hardship which is occurring in cases of men who have put in applications for compassionate release. Although it is recognised that these cases are often generously treated by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Office">War Office</a>, in certain cases the applications may have been turned down because the War Office felt, not wholly unreasonably, that because the man did not have much longer to serve, the hardship could not be regarded as so severe as to come within the expression "exceptional hardship".</p> <p>
For a man who has had his application for release perhaps rather narrowly rejected because of considerations of that kind to be retained for the additional six months is, of course, a very considerable hardship indeed.</p>            </div>

That being so, it is clearly desirable, on the assumption that additional forces are needed, that they should if possible


be taken from elements who want to serve and not from elements which may include the cases of greater hardship to which I have referred.</p> <p>
Our <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> seeks merely to make the machinery proposed under the Bill less inflexible. It is an endeavour to ensure that the number of men to be retained under <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 1 will be more explicitly affected by the number of "Ever-readies" available under Clause 3. To us on this side of the Committee this seems a difficult proposition to answer.</p> <p>
At an earlier stage the Committee rejected an Amendment which aimed at interpolating an Order by way of Statutory Instrument between the coming into force of this Bill and the exercise of the powers contained in it. The fact that the Committee has rejected the proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg) makes it the more desirable that it should take this opportunity of spelling into the Bill a degree of flexibility which it lacks at the moment.</p> <p>
The more we are deprived, after this Bill has become law, of the opportunity in the course of debates on Orders and things of that kind of raising matters, the more desirable it is to take the opportunity now to spell into the Bill a degree of flexibility, and to ensure, as the Amendment seeks to do, that as a matter of Statute Law the number of men to be retained under Clause 1 shall necessarily be affected by the number of volunteers coming forward under Clause 3.</p> <p>
That is what the Amendment asks for, and it is no answer to say, as has been said, that that point of view disregards the character of the proposed voluntary reserve. That is not so. In fact, far from that being so the foundation of this Amendment is the fact that the proposed Clause 3 reserve is a voluntary one, and we desire that relatively greater claims should be made on that element than on the element referred to in Clause 1, where a considerable number of cases of hardship may be expected to be found.</p>            </div>

All I wanted to say about that was that conditions are now quite different from what they were in 1950. We happened to be at war in 1950. I suggest that even if the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> were wrong in what they did at the time that is no reason why we should not try to do the right thing now.</p>            </div>

It is quite flattering to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> for the Tories always to compare what they are now doing with what the Labour Government did. We are glad that the Tories think that what we did was so good that it should form a standard by which to test the activities of the Tories. But even I do not go as far as to say that


what the Labour Government did was as wonderful as all that. I am prepared to support them, but I do not think that what they did was perfect. All I want to say is that whether it was good or bad, right or wrong. we are now considering this proposal, and our job is to ask ourselves whether, in the circumstances of today, what is being done by the Government is right. We are not being asked to judge what the Labour Government did earlier.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>The man whose ideas never develop over a period of ten years is not a man at all. He does not think. We happen to be rather different.</p> <p>
The hon. Member for Bute and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ayrshire">North Ayrshire</a> (Sir F. Maclean) did not answer the case made by my hon. Friend. He said, first, that we might not have a sufficient number of "Ever-readies" to fill the gap that at present exists and, secondly, that they might not be trained. Both points are covered by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a>. It is a proviso. It says:
<q>provided there is no person of similar qualifications&#8230;".</q>
In other words, if there were not enough "Ever-readies" we would take men under <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 1.</p> <p>
I now turn to the case made by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> against the Amendment. I will adhere strictly to the case made. In the first place, his case was that he was willing to give a solemn undertaking that what we are asking him to do in connection with Clause 2, he would do; but he could not put it into the Bill. I do not wish to question the integrity of the right hon. Gentleman, but I must point out that his most solemn undertaking means nothing unless it is incorporated in the Bill. Any Secretary of State taking office after the right hon. Gentleman would be able to do as he wished. I suggest that a test of his solemn pledge would be for the right hon. Gentleman to try to find words to incorporate into Clause 2 the principle which we are advocating.</p> <p>
With regard to Clause I the argument of the right hon. Gentleman against the

use of the "Ever-readies" in place of retaining the National Service man for an extra six months was that he was trying to build up a Territorial emergency reserve which was a long-term concept. He said it was impossible to build this if there was a certainty that the men might be called up. He could build it up only if there were simply a possibility that they might be called up. To me this seems a rather strange argument. Who is to determine what is a certainty or a possibility? Surely the difference between these two concepts depends on the international situation at a given moment and this might well change within a period of three or six months. I could not follow the logic of that argument.</p> <p>
Nor could I follow the argument of the right hon. Gentleman that it was quite wrong to be able to expect to build up a force if the people joining did so in the knowledge and certainty that they had to do six months in the Service. I put it to the right hon. Gentleman that a man who is to volunteer under the provisions of Clause 3 will get a gratuity or payment of &#163;150 a year. If he is called up for six months he gets that on top of his pay. I can easily visualise that a man might be tempted to do six months' service if, in addition to the fuller rates of pay, he could get &#163;150 for that service. That amounts to something like &#163;6 a week over and above his Regular soldier's pay. Does the right hon. Gentleman really suggest, or does the Under-Secretary suggest, that some men will not be prepared to join if they can get &#163;6 a week extra? I suggest that a number of men might be attracted by an additional &#163;6 over and above, not the pay of a National Service man, but that of a Regular soldier.</p>            </div>

The late <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Maxton">Jimmy Maxton</a> told us at one time that a man had to be able to ride two horses to be in this circus. I do not know which argument the right hon. Gentleman backed. Both arguments seemed to be fallacious, because in connection with the argument about the employer if the international situation worsened&#8212;and only today the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> told us that it was critical&#8212;the employer would lose the man. How can an employer be given the certainty that this situation will not worsen next year? I do not know, and I do not think that the Under-Secretary does.</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman's arguments are difficult to accept. They apply mainly to <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 1 and not to Clause 2. As they are difficult to accept, the principle advocated in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> is still a sound one, namely that if people can be obtained voluntarily they should be used in preference to conscripts. My hon. Friend the Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg) made a very good case based on four sound arguments, none of which was answered. Before we vote on this Amendment, as I hope that we shall, I want to hear the Government's answer to my hon. Friend's speech. I also want an answer to the points I have raised.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>This argument falls into two compartments&#8212;first, the immediate necessity of calling up men, and, secondly, the very long-term view of forming an efficient good reserve. In order to form such a reserve, a reasonable amount of time must be allowed so that the men can be properly selected. It is no good trying to get together a scratch reserve in a short time. This is a long process. With the best will in the world, my right hon. Friend will not be able to get this reserve in working order for at least six months. In the meantime, it is obvious that men must be retained under <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 1.</p> <p>
Consultations have already taken place and both unions and employers are

agreeable to co-operating with the reserve, which has a possible liability but not a certainty. In six months or a year's time we shall have a very efficient and reliable reserve, but we should not have it if we tried to get it working immediately.</p>            </div>

Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) put forcibly but which has not yet been replied to. Another reason is that I see that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for War has. returned.</p> <p>
I want to place on record the fact that, although I always listen to my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Bright-side (Mr. Winterbottom), my former constituent, with respectful attention, and nearly always with agreement, I do not think that his argument about the hardship to higher paid workers was the sort of argument which should be advanced. I have always taken the view that, on the whole, we are here to protect the poor and the weak rather than the rich and the strong, whether they are workers or whether they are not.</p> <p>
I recall that when I was stationed at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton-on-Tees">Norton-on-Tees</a> during the war and when my income was insufficient to buy beer of the strength which was then being brewed for puddlers at the price at which it was being brewed, a puddler stood me a pint and told me that we were to land at Cherbourg and knock Hitler off the map. I invited him to go further and tell me whether he was going to do it or whether I was. I gather that he got me designated for the purpose. Not for the first time I was afflicted with a sense of my own unsuitability for tests for which I was designated.</p> <p>
I want to put what is surely a question which may be put to the Secretary of State. He used this observation&#8212;I hope I am quoting him from memory correctly&#8212;"I cannot be bound by a statutory definition".</p>            </div>
