                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a1742.4/1">My Lords, I am going to do two things that the Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=8" title="The government chief whip, whose official title is parliamentary secretary..." class="glossary">Chief Whip</a> does not like. First, I am going to take a little time over my remarks in moving this <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>. Secondly, I am going to read my speech, because these are very complicated matters in Clauses 29 to 36 and I want to be sure that I am covering what are quite dense political points. What we are doing at the moment is not just a question of opining on an issue of the day; we are actually analysing crucial legal provisions in a piece of legislation so I do not apologise.</p> <p pid="a1742.4/2">I shall speak once in a single contribution covering my <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> stand part on every clause in this section of the Bill and my Amendments 98ZA and 98EA to Clauses 29 and 35 respectively. The clauses are extremely important and, in my view, regrettable provisions. They are pernicious in depriving refugees who ever met the four conditions in Clause 2 of any chance, long term, of integrating into and contributing to our society by denying them any prospect of settlement or citizenship, with few exceptions. British citizenship enables a person to live and work in the UK permanently, vote, hold public office and participate fully in British life in a way that no other type of status allows.</p> <p pid="a1742.4/3">The amendments in the names of the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Moylan">Lord Moylan</a>, and the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, focus specifically on those entitled to various kinds of British citizenship who need to register to secure recognition of that, and I pay tribute to their work on this, which I know has a particular focus on children.</p> <p pid="a1742.4/4">I am taking a global view of the operation of this section of the Bill, whether on entry, leave to remain or any kind of citizenship, whether by registration or naturalisation, because the issues are interrelated. The clauses impose lifelong prohibitions on lawful re-entry or gaining leave to remain in the UK and on grants of citizenship, as opposed to the maximum 10-year re-entry ban under the current <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Rules">Immigration Rules</a>. They are an extension of the whole deterrence agenda and are in conflict with several international obligations. The clauses breach Article 8 of the ECHR and the right to private and family life because they are axiomatically disproportionate. A blanket ban allows for no individual consideration whatever, such as in no possible circumstances could you ever be granted status. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> has, for instance, certain positive obligations under Article 8 to allow family reunification, such that failure to allow a relevant individual to reunite with their family members by entering or settling in the UK could breach those obligations. The breach of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_8_ECHR">Article 8 ECHR</a> could even escalate to a breach of Article 3, which bans torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. It is also unclear, as a practical matter, where the Home Secretary has determined that a human rights claim or asylum claim is inadmissible by virtue of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause_4">Clause 4</a>, how an individual could apply to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for an exception to be made in their case. Perhaps the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> could put me right on that point.</p> <p pid="a1742.4/5">The Bill is in a multitude of ways incompatible with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child">UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>, which protects the right of children to a nationality, prohibits discrimination and requires that the child&#8217;s best interests are counted as a primary consideration in actions concerning them. The Bill is also incompatible with current UK law, such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_Act_1989">Children Act 1989</a>.</p> <p pid="a1742.4/6">The JCHR, which I thank for its excellent report published yesterday&#8212;in which, as I am no longer on the committee, I had no part&#8212;highlights the legal problems with the Home Secretary&#8217;s discretionary exception-making powers. Giving her discretion to act in accordance with the UK&#8217;s international obligations also means giving her power to act in breach of them, and a refusal to exercise discretion may not be capable of an effective challenge. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR">UNHCR</a> says:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a1742.4/7">&#8220;In order to bring this section of the Bill into line with the UK&#8217;s obligations under international law, the exceptions to the ineligibility for all forms of leave and for citizenship should be based on compliance &#8230; with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a> and other international agreements and those decisions should not be left to the discretion of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a>&#8221;.</p> <p pid="a1742.4/8">Where a breach of the UK&#8217;s international obligations would otherwise occur, the Home Secretary should surely be under a duty to make an exception, rather than have a discretion to do so. If a person entered the UK by irregular means but could not, for whatever reason, be removed, Clause 29 in conjunction with Clause 4 would prevent them from regularising their stay in the UK, leaving them in perpetual immigration limbo and would of course be the prelude to their having no chance of access to citizenship. Depending on the length of the delay and the private and family ties they have generated during that delay, this could violate the UK&#8217;s positive obligations under Article 8 of the ECHR, the refugee convention, the convention against statelessness and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to name but the most obvious ones.</p> <p pid="a1742.4/9">UNHCR comments that, as at present the UK is effectively unable to remove asylum seekers to third countries:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a1742.4/10">&#8220;It is entirely foreseeable&#8212;and in Clause 29-36, expressly foreseen&#8212;that many refugees and stateless people who will be ineligible for any form of leave to remain will nonetheless remain in the UK for extended periods of time, if not indefinitely, trapped &#8216;on the margins&#8217; of society&#8221;.</p> <p pid="a1742.4/11">Throughout proceedings on the Bill, beginning with <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>, many of us have raised this worry about people being left in limbo. Because we lack the impact assessment from the Government, we all have to go on the one from the refugee commissioner, which estimates that there could be 200,000 people within three years, marginalised, in limbo, destitute&#8212;really healthy for our society.</p> <p pid="a1742.4/12">Even if the Home Secretary exercised her discretion to grant some form of leave eventually, anyone who had ever been subject to the removal duty would be permanently ineligible from becoming a British citizen through several of the main routes available under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Nationality_Act_1981">British Nationality Act 1981</a>. However, Article 34 of the refugee convention requires contracting states as far as possible to</p> <p class="indent" pid="a1742.4/13">&#8220;facilitate the assimilation and naturalization of refugees&#8221;.</p> <p pid="a1742.4/14">The impact on children of a lifelong prohibition on re-entry or gaining leave to remain could be particularly severe and is difficult to reconcile with the UK&#8217;s international and domestic obligations. Consideration of the best interests of an individual child is absent from Clause 29, but how can a blanket ban be in the best interests of a child for the purposes of either Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child or, domestically, the Children Act 1989 or Section 55 of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borders,_Citizenship_and_Immigration_Act_2009">Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009</a>?</p> <p pid="a1742.4/15">The Government have acknowledged that children affected by this Bill</p> <p class="indent" pid="a1742.4/16">&#8220;will rarely qualify for citizenship&#8221; if they or a relevant family member are subject to Clause 2. The JCHR considers that this seems to contravene <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_2">Article 2</a> of the UN Convention on the  Rights of the Child, which prohibits the discrimination or punishment of a child on the basis of the status of or activities of their parents or guardians. Where the child, as will of course be the case, will have had no control over their parents or the decisions which led to them arriving in the UK irregularly, the automatic imposition of a lifelong ban which they then have to convince the Home Secretary to reverse seems to fall within the definition of a punishment. Can the Minister tell me how Clause 29 is compliant with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court">Supreme Court</a> case of Zoumbas and subsequent case law on the issues concerning children&#8217;s best interests in an immigration context? How can routine application to children of a blanket ban on entry and leave to remain without consideration of their particular circumstances possibly be lawful?</p> <p pid="a1742.4/18">I am on my last page. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a>&#8217;s discretion under Clause 29 when deciding whether to lift a ban on limited leave to remain has to be exercised so as to avoid a breach of the ECHR or any other international agreement to which the UK is a party but, in a similar situation with regard to a grant of indefinite leave, only conformity with the ECHR is said to be relevant. Perhaps the Minister can explain the contrast between those two situations in Clause 29, because I have not managed to pin down the rationale. My Amendment 98ZA in any case adds in other international agreements so as to align the two legs of Clause 29 on leave to remain.</p> <p pid="a1742.4/19">Many children, either because they arrived unaccompanied as a small child or because removal has not been possible in practice, may be born or spend their entire childhood here and have a solely British identity. The Bill would mean previously acceptable routes to citizenship, such as the discretionary route or the settled route, being either blocked or fundamentally altered. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_10">The 10</a>-year route would be possible in theory but, for children whose parents were irregular entrants, those parents could be prohibited from obtaining leave to remain, citizenship and employment, thus creating instability and poverty in the child&#8217;s life.</p> <p pid="a1742.4/20">The Bill would also put stateless children at significant risk. If a relevant family member was an irregular entrant subject to Clause 2, they and the stateless child would be subject to mandatory removal, jeopardising the child&#8217;s years of residency and potentially condemning the child to a lifetime without citizenship. Clause 35 as originally introduced would in fact have allowed the Home Secretary to make an exception and grant nationality if there were compelling circumstances or it was necessary to comply with the UK&#8217;s obligations under not just the ECHR but any other international agreement to which the UK is a party. However, unaccountably, that latter part has been removed, risking the UK being in breach of its legal obligations under those other international agreements.</p> <p pid="a1742.4/21">Even if ECHR grounds are not established, the UK&#8217;s legal obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child may be breached under the prohibition of discrimination or punishment of a child on the basis of the activities of their parents; I have referred to this. This backwards redrafting appears to have eliminated an avenue for stateless people, refugees and others to obtain British nationality in reliance on the refugee convention, the statelessness  conventions and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Can the Minister explain, therefore, why the Government have narrowed the available exceptions between the original draft of the Bill, as considered in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>, and the Bill as it came to this House? I hope that, unless a convincing answer can be given, this House will see fit at a later stage to seek to restore the grounds for making exceptions under Clause 35  to the version introduced in the other place; namely, on the grounds of both the ECHR and any other international agreement.</p> <p pid="a1742.4/22">I hope that I have explained sufficiently why these Benches have tabled amendments and clause stand part notices, which would remove all the clauses in this part of the Bill and at least bring the Home Secretary&#8217;s exercise of discretion in line with international law. I beg to move.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a1746.0/1">My Lords, I rise to speak to a number of amendments in this group in my name; namely, Amendments 98A to 98H. I also oppose Clauses 33 and 34 standing part; those notices stand in the name of the noble Baroness, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Ludford">Lady Ludford</a>, and I have added my name to them. I am grateful for the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Lister of Burtersett, for each of my amendments and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> stand part notices. This is a coherent suite of amendments: they do one thing but are necessary to do that thing throughout a whole section of the Bill that, in essence, covers Clauses 30 to 36, which stand together as a form of deprivation. I am grateful to Amnesty for its assistance in drafting these amendments; I should also say right at the outset that I am grateful to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Murray">Lord Murray</a>, for the time he gave to a meeting in advance for us to discuss them.</p> <p pid="a1746.0/2">The essence of what is happening is that the Bill has a two-step deterrence mechanism. It is frankly and openly deterrent, designed to deter people from setting off on a certain course. The first step in that deterrence, and to my mind a very powerful one, is the prospect of rapid removal from the United Kingdom to another country. Coming on top of the money that people have paid, as they have in many cases, to cross the channel or for whatever their mode of arrival, I would have thought that the prospect of immediate removal is a very significant deterrent indeed.</p> <p pid="a1746.0/3">However, the Bill does not stop at that. In Clauses 30 to 36 it adds a further level of deterrence. That is a denial of&#8212;a ban on&#8212;acquiring UK citizenship. That ban falls into two distinct parts: one is a ban on acquiring citizenship by way of naturalisation and the other is a ban on acquiring citizenship by way of registration. While the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, spoke in broad terms about these clauses&#8212;equivalent to taking a mallet to them&#8212;noble Lords will realise that I am getting narrower and narrower. Perhaps I am approaching this more with a scalpel, because I am concerned with the question not of naturalisation but of registration.</p> <p pid="a1746.0/4">The first reason is that naturalisation is a concession granted by the state to foreign nationals to allow them to become British. Except in very limited circumstances, we have no international obligation to grant naturalisation  to people; it is entirely a matter for our Parliament and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> that we make. It is inevitable that Parliament will impose conditions on who it allows to be naturalised; indeed, we already impose conditions, such as passing examinations, going through certain procedures, residence requirements, and so on. It is inevitable that Parliament will impose conditions on naturalisation and, if Parliament chooses to impose this condition, whether we like it or not, one might object to it politically, but it is not a great constitutional matter. Noble Lords will have noticed that my <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> does nothing to limit the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>&#8217;s power&#8212;indeed, duty&#8212;to remove persons from the jurisdiction who qualify under the four criteria set out in Clause 2.</p> <p pid="a1746.0/5">This brings us down narrowly to the question of registration. Registration is not a concession granted by the state. It is a process that was, in fact, introduced shortly after the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War">Second World War</a> by the Attlee Government to allow people who are already British to register that nationality because it is not patent or obvious on the surface. The laws of citizenship are complex; people fall between the cracks. The history of Empire and Commonwealth means that people sometimes have difficulty demonstrating their British nationality or their UK citizenship because they have been born in other countries or documents are not always available. It is an evidence-based process, so it is a matter of showing the evidence, proving the descent and providing a certain level of documentation. Then it is for the authorities to make a decision based on that evidence, on a balance in some cases, on whether the person in question is entitled to British citizenship&#8212;not whether they may apply for it, not whether it may be given to them as a concession, but whether they are already British. It is this process that the Bill wishes to see people banned from pursuing.</p> <p pid="a1746.0/6">Not all routes to the registration of British citizenship are eliminated by the Bill but four routes are specified. Each has its own clause, which is why a number of amendments are necessary to separate them out. They relate to British citizenship, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Overseas_Territory">British Overseas Territory</a> citizenship, British overseas citizenship, and a very small group, if it exists at all, known as British subjects. It is impossible to say how many people would fall into these categories; it probably is not a very large number, but we know that a large percentage of them are likely to be children. I am not going to dwell on that further at the moment because I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Lister of Burtersett, is going to make some comments in that regard.</p> <p pid="a1746.0/7">This raises a paradox and a question of principle. The paradox is that we will have deported from this country people who might, at a later stage, be able to demonstrate that they had a right of access to this country. We are depriving them of the ability to demonstrate that they had that right of access, though they may not have known it&#8212;documents and evidence may not have been available&#8212;at the time that they were deported. Therefore, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> would have been wholly excused in not knowing it either&#8212;why would the Secretary of State have known it if the person did not know it? It is a very odd paradox that it works reflexively, so to speak, but does not allow a correction of that reflexive punishment.</p> <p pid="a1746.0/8">I hope I anticipate correctly that one of the things my noble friend the Minister might say is, &#8220;Do we really want, as British citizens, people who would behave in such an indecent way as to turn up on Dover beach in a small boat? Surely they should have applied in the correct and appropriate way&#8221;. But that goes to the heart of the principle: that time and again we find this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> mentality that British citizenship to which one is entitled is a reward for good behaviour. It is not. British citizenship to which one is entitled can never be a reward for good behaviour.</p> <p pid="a1746.0/9">My argument is fairly straightforward. These provisions are unnecessary because the deterrent effect of deportation seems to me sufficient. Not only are they unnecessary but they are paradoxical in a slightly bizarre way, because they prevent someone acquiring something that they are entitled to but which, in so acquiring, would have nullified the original sin, so to speak. Just as much, the provisions cheapen through their mentality British citizenship. If something to which one is entitled is little better than a library ticket or a voucher for sweeties then what really are we saying about British citizenship?</p> <p pid="a1746.0/10">If the Government wanted to accommodate some of the concerns raised in your Lordships&#8217; Committee over the past few days, this would be the perfect item for my noble friend to accommodate. It would have no detrimental effect on the operation of the Bill, it would strengthen notions of British citizenship as something valuable, enduring and an entitlement, and it would please many noble Lords in the Committee.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a1748.0/1">My Lords, I have tabled <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> 98I on the status of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kongers">Hong Kongers</a> with British national (overseas) status. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, who cannot be <a href="/glossary/?gl=145" title="Of a male MP, sitting on his regular seat in the House.

I particularly thank the Hong Kongers who have talked to us, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International">Amnesty International</a> and the Project for the Registration of Children as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Citizens">British Citizens</a> for their assistance. In the spirit of co-operation, I wrote to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> last week setting out the problem that many <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> passport holders face to give him advanced notice.</p> <p pid="a1748.0/2">The noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Moylan">Lord Moylan</a>, talked about the amendments that he and the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, have tabled as focusing right down. I am going even further down to one highly specific group where a problem has emerged which seems to breach the British Nationality Act. I hope to be proved wrong and that the Minister can give us some assurances, but the experience of these BNO nationals who have had children born in the UK recently, most of whom are under five years old, is that they are being told by government officials and staff that their children must apply to Chinese diplomatic missions for Chinese travel documents as they are not entitled to any other form of travel document provided in the UK because their parents are not yet full British citizens, even though they are BNO nationals who are waiting to complete the necessary time before applying for settled status  and thereafter, as is their right under the law, becoming full UK citizens. Even if that were not the case&#8212;if for any reason their parents did not go for that&#8212;these children, because they are born here, would be entitled to apply for UK citizenship after being here for 10 years. One official told a Hong Konger parent that their child would have to take the UK citizenship test.</p> <p pid="a1748.0/3">That is clearly mad. Whatever <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Force">Border Force</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> immigration officials are saying, it is utterly confusing. This is a small community who relied on the United Kingdom, which ran their country for many years and allowed the status of BNO to signify that we accepted that status, with everything else that follows from it, including the right to settled status and, in the slightly longer term, the right to UK citizenship.</p> <p pid="a1748.0/4">To be clear, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_1">Section 1</a>(3) of the British Nationality Act provides the child with the right to be registered as a British citizen if either parent becomes settled or a British citizen. To be generous, perhaps this is confusion among officials about the gap before the parents are recognised as being settled. However, that application must be made before the child turns 18. Section 1(4) provides the child with the right to be registered as a British citizen if the child remains resident in the UK until the age of 10. Some absences during those first 10 years are permitted. I am saying that because the officials are also telling these parents that if their children leave the UK, they will not be entitled to anything, which is contrary to the British Nationality Act.</p> <p pid="a1748.0/5">Registration under either of these is by right. It is not for the Home Secretary&#8217;s discretion. If the requirement is to exercise that the rights are met, the Home Secretary is required to register the child as a British citizen. Can the Minister confirm the earliest point at which a child born in the UK to a BNO national en route to settlement can expect to be able to secure their own connection to the UK, and by what means? Surely  the answer is in Section 1(3) of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Nationality_Act_1981">British Nationality Act 1981</a>.</p> <p pid="a1748.0/6">There is another related matter. There are dependents of those with BNO passports who arrived with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKSAR">HKSAR</a> passports before the current BNO scheme was fully devised. For some, their passports are likely to expire before they achieve their five-year route to settlement. At the moment, they are getting the same response from immigration officials as parents with newborn children regarding their status&#8212;that they should approach the Chinese authorities for travel documents. It seems that for dependents with HKSAR passports there is another gap in the system. Quite often these are vulnerable people, sometimes elderly dependents or parents who have come with their children. They are not expecting to return to Hong Kong now.</p> <p pid="a1748.0/7">There is another important point. Many of the Hong Kongers who have arrived here under this status are here because they are perceived as dissidents in Hong Kong under the new regime. Yesterday, in Southampton, two Hong Kongers were attacked by three pro-<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party">Chinese Communist Party</a> men, allegedly Chinese students at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southampton">University of Southampton</a>, where this happened.</p> <p pid="a1748.0/8">We know, because of the behaviour of the Chinese consulate in Manchester some months ago, that these people are at real risk of attack. For any UK official to tell them to go and get documents from the Chinese is the most extraordinary thing I have ever heard. So I am looking forward to hearing from the Minister and hope that officials need to be briefed. If that is not the case, perhaps he could set out exactly why not. But most importantly, I wonder whether the Minister will meet with me, other signatories to my amendment and some BNO passport holders to further discuss this issue, so that the Home Office understands what is going on.</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> stand part debates, to which I was pleased to add my name. He has made the case so clearly and powerfully that I need say only a few words, but I do want to emphasise the significance of these amendments, from the perspective of both citizenship&#8212;the practical and symbolic importance of which we debated last year during the passage of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality_and_Borders_Bill">Nationality and Borders Bill</a>&#8212;and of children, who are, as we have heard, the main victims of these clauses that deny citizenship rights in perpetuity.</p> <p pid="a1750.0/2">As the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Hale of Richmond, said in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court">Supreme Court</a>, the &#8220;intrinsic importance of citizenship&#8221; should never be played down. I thus agree with the Project for the Registration of Children as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Citizens">British Citizens</a>, of which I am a patron, and Amnesty that the provisions are &#8220;profoundly misconceived and harmful&#8221;. A theme running through our proceedings has been the Bill&#8217;s failure to give primary consideration to the best interests of children, as required by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_convention">UN convention</a> and Section 55 of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borders,_Citizenship_and_Immigration_Act_2009">Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009</a>. The Bill&#8217;s citizenship provisions, which really have no place in a Bill focused on irregular migration, target children in a way that is both discriminatory and punitive. Not surprisingly, this is of profound concern to the Refugee and Migrant Children&#8217;s Consortium, which advises that this is a</p> <p class="indent" pid="a1750.0/3">&#8220;fundamentally discriminatory approach to citizenship acquisition&#8221; and potentially, as we have already heard, in breach of Articles 8 and 14 of the ECHR. Babies and children will be subject to a &#8220;harsh and life-determining penalty&#8221; for an immigration breach when they were minors.</p> <p pid="a1750.0/5">Of course, it is deemed to be immaterial that the breach was due to their parents&#8217; rather than their own actions. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Human_Rights_Commission">Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission</a> warns that the provisions risk discriminating against a child for the actions of a parent, contrary to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_2">Article 2</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNCRC">UNCRC</a>&#8212;a warning echoed in the JCHR report. I also congratulate the JCHR on getting this out so quickly, especially as the Home Secretary apparently did not answer until the last second. In fact, we had already started in Committee before the committee received her reply to its questions, sent some time ago, I believe.</p> <p pid="a1750.0/6">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR">UNHCR</a> makes a similar point in arguing that punishing a child for the actions of a parent in this way runs counter to Article 34 of the refugee convention,  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_32">Article 32</a> of the 1954 convention, and Articles 3 and 7 of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child">UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>. It is an example of how the Bill puts at risk the safety and welfare of children.</p> <p pid="a1750.0/7">I will just give an example&#8212;a hypothetical example of how it might work&#8212;from the Project and Amnesty. Thomas is brought to the UK as a child. He is so neglected or abused by his parents that the local authority is compelled to apply for, and is granted, a full care order. He is now growing up in the care of the UK state, and his future properly now lies here, meaning that he may be registered as a British citizen under <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_3">Section 3</a>(1). However, if his entry to the UK was without permission, he will be permanently excluded from his citizenship rights by Clause 31(2). You can hardly blame the child for what has happened.</p> <p pid="a1750.0/8">Both the UNHCR and the JCHR argue that Clause 35 &#8212;which, as we heard, gives the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> the power not to treat a person as ineligible for British citizenship if this is necessary to comply with the ECHR&#8212;should be not discretionary but based on compliance or otherwise with the ECHR. The PRCBC and Amnesty argue that the link here is inappropriate &#8212;they may well be right&#8212;but, if it is going to be made, it should revert to the original wording, as proposed by the noble Baroness, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Ludford">Lady Ludford</a>, in <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> 98EA. The JCHR expresses puzzlement as to why the Government chose to narrow the available exceptions originally listed, thereby risking contravening international law obligations other than those arising from the ECHR. So, as the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, asked, can the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> now explain the justification for doing so?</p> <p pid="a1750.0/9">In conclusion, once again this Government are showing disregard for the importance of citizenship and for the best interests of children. As they have made one welcome concession in this area, I hope that they will accept the strength of the case for removing entitlement to citizenship entirely from the Bill, or, at the very least&#8212;and it is the very least&#8212;reverting to the original wording of Clause 35.</p>            </div>

They include many people from Hong Kong who are rightly entitled to British citizenship but face serious uncertainty about their legal status. Many <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kongers">Hong Kongers</a> have reported appalling responses from immigration officials regarding their children born here, being told that they cannot have any travel documentation and even querying whether they are allowed to become British citizens in the future.</p> <p pid="a1751.0/3">We all know the turmoil and uncertainty that has plagued the people of Hong Kong in recent years&#8212;many have been subjected to unimaginable hardships, fearing for their safety and the future of their families&#8212;so it is concerning that so many face anxiety about the citizenship status of their children. The people of Hong Kong have shown immense courage and resilience against Beijing&#8217;s totalitarian regime, and many of those who have come to the UK face profound challenges, including concern about the safety and security of their families living abroad. The nature of the treatment of protesters and dissidents by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party">Chinese Communist Party</a> means that many of them are now permanently settling in the UK. This amendment is, simply, testament to our support for the people of Hong Kong, and it ensures that their status is not subject to further confusion.</p> <p pid="a1751.0/4">All the way through Committee, it has appeared that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and his team have set their face against accepting any amendments whatever.

The amendment seeks to ensure that all UK obligations under <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU">EU</a> law are considered when persons are considered for ineligibility in terms of the rights to entry or citizenship.</p> <p pid="a1752.1/2">As my noble friend said, the consideration of rights under the ECHR raises a number of concerns, such as in relation to Articles 2, 3 and 8. This includes, for example, the right to family reunion, the right for individual circumstances to be considered, and even the rights of safety and not to be tortured. The need to consider the best interests of children is a priority under the ECHR as well as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child">United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>. Indeed, the Government have acknowledged that children affected by the Bill will rarely qualify for citizenship, so it is difficult to see how provisions in the Bill are in the best interests of children, as required by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child">UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>.</p> <p pid="a1752.1/3">The right to citizenship is the means by which an individual is able to construct a life, settle, earn a living and feel at home in their circumstances. However, individuals fulfilling <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 2 conditions will be denied those things. They will most likely be kept in a form of limbo, waiting to be moved elsewhere. Ineligibility for citizenship is particularly important for children, who, in effect, will be denied a future by this Bill through no fault of their own.</p> <p pid="a1752.1/4">The Bill does not comply with many of the UK&#8217;s international obligations and penalises the most vulnerable and threatened people. The safeguards of ministerial discretion to protect people from breaches of international law are inadequate, as the report of the JCHR makes clear in its recommendations. I would be interested to hear the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8217;s response to those recommendations.</p> <p pid="a1752.1/5">We have heard from noble Lords some of the punitive measures in the Bill, so how could any of us support what the Government propose in terms of treatment of children? How can it be right to punish children for the activities of their parents? That is unjust and insupportable. To flout international law is deplorable, as it condemns many who have already suffered to more injustice. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a> has exposed the inadequacy of the Bill, and I hope that the Minister will consider its recommendations.</p> <p pid="a1752.1/6">As others have said, the systematic wrecking of long-supported safeguards for the protection of refugees and asylum seekers is totally unacceptable. The potential for the contravention of international obligations has been clearly established by the JCHR, and is the basis for Amendment 98EA and many other amendments in this part of the Bill, which deserve our support. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#8217;s response.</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 2 from lawfully travelling to the UK or securing settlement or British citizenship through naturalisation or registration; this is subject only to exceptions to comply with international agreements or where there are compelling circumstances. If the Bill fails to succeed in its aim of removing people, there will likely be a whole class of people stuck in the UK for extended periods without access to a system through which  they can obtain lawful status. Therefore, they will be unable to work or rent a home. The noble Baroness, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Ludford">Lady Ludford</a>, expanded on this point eloquently. To sum up the noble Baroness&#8217;s speech: she wants compliance with international law. We support her <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> 98EA.</p> <p pid="a1754.0/2">The noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Moylan">Lord Moylan</a>, gave a clear exposition of the Government&#8217;s intentions with this Bill, and on the different statuses on the second step, as he put it&#8212;the ban on acquiring citizenship by naturalisation but also by registration. As he said eloquently, registration is not a concession or a reward for good behaviour but an entitlement. His amendment seeks to address that point, with particular examples given in his speech.</p> <p pid="a1754.0/3">The noble Baroness, Lady Brinton, also spoke about the specific cases of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kongers">Hong Kongers</a> and BNOs, and how this Bill could cut across&#8212;or seems to cut across&#8212;their potential rights. My noble friend Lady Lister, who added her name to the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Moylan, attacked the problem from the perspective of concern for children who could be subject to this ban because of the actions of their parents. As she rightly argued, this is not fair on those children; she wants to revert to the original wording of Clause 35.</p> <p pid="a1754.0/4">We support the amendments in this group. I look forward to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8217;s response.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a1754.1/1">My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have spoken in this short debate. It has been particularly illuminating; I have noted the quality of the speeches and hope that I can answer the questions that have been put in relation to these clauses.</p> <p pid="a1754.1/2">Clauses 29 to 36 prevent a person who has entered the United Kingdom unlawfully, and meets the conditions in <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 2, being able to lawfully re-enter the UK, secure settlement or become a British national through naturalisation or most registration routes. A person who arrives in the UK illegally should not be able to make the UK their home and eventually settle here. Settlement in the UK confers significant benefits, such as the freedom to study, work and access healthcare and public funds; of course, it is also a pathway to British citizenship which, in turn, confers further benefits.</p> <p pid="a1754.1/3">Allowing someone who arrives in the UK illegally to settle clearly creates an incentive for people to make those dangerous journeys. It is a vital part of the deterrent effect that those categories should be included. This is because people taking advantage in that way is unfair. It is unfair on those who play by the rules and  come here legally, it is unfair on those who are genuinely in need, as it constrains our capacity to help, and it is unfair on the British public.</p> <p pid="a1754.1/4">Clause 29 precludes people who meet the conditions in Clause 2 from ever settling here and, once removed, being able to re-enter. This is achieved by preventing them from being granted any form of permission through the immigration system. We do, however, recognise there will be occasions when we will need to waive the bans and grant permission; for example, as the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, noted, where not granting permission would contravene our obligations under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a>. Clause 29 balances our need to disincentivise people from making dangerous journeys to the UK by ensuring that there is no benefit to be gained from entering the UK illegally, while recognising there may be a limited number of scenarios in which it is appropriate to grant permission. I put it to the noble Baroness, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Ludford">Lady Ludford</a>, that this is a proportionate and balanced provision. Therefore, I do not recognise her description of the Bill as &#8220;wielding a sledgehammer&#8221;.</p> <p pid="a1754.1/5">Clause 30 sets out that a person will not be eligible for British citizenship, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Overseas_Territories">British Overseas Territories</a> citizenship, British overseas citizenship and British subject status if they enter the UK unlawfully and meet the criteria in Clause 2. The ban will also apply to someone who enters a Crown dependency or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Overseas_Territory">British Overseas Territory</a> unlawfully in a similar way. We have included the other types of British nationality as we do not think it is right that illegal entry should allow a person to acquire any form of British nationality, but also to prevent a person using it as a stepping stone to register as a British citizen. Illegal entry into the UK, a Crown dependency or an overseas territory will have the same effect. We do not want people to be able to enter illegally in any of those locations and use that as a way to acquire citizenship and, ultimately, a right to enter and live in the UK.</p> <p pid="a1754.1/6">Clauses 31 to 34 set out the routes to which the citizenship ban will apply. The key citizenship route which will be affected is naturalisation, as my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Moylan">Lord Moylan</a> noted. This is the main way in which adults born outside the UK can acquire British citizenship and British Overseas Territories citizenship. The ban will also apply to certain registration routes. However, those applying under provisions that address historical inequalities in British nationality law will not be affected. This includes people born before 1983 to British mothers, those who missed out on citizenship because their parents were not married or those applying on the route for descendants of Chagossians.</p> <p pid="a1754.1/7">Clause 35 allows us to exempt a person from the citizenship ban if treating them as ineligible for citizenship would contravene our obligations under the human rights convention. This means that if a person can demonstrate that, for example, their right to a family or private life can be met only by us considering a grant of citizenship, we will not exclude them from applying. We do not think that acquiring citizenship will usually be essential to allow a person to have a private or family life in the UK; other options, such as leave to enter or remain, may satisfy that. However, in very exceptional cases where considering a grant of  citizenship is needed to prevent us breaching our ECHR obligations, Clause 35 may apply. We will publish guidance for nationality caseworkers setting out how to assess human rights in the nationality context.</p> <p pid="a1754.1/8">The amendments tabled by my noble friend Lord Moylan would remove registration routes for British citizenship and British Overseas Territories citizenship from the ban so that it applies only to naturalisation. They would also remove the bans on becoming a British overseas citizen and British subject through registration. My noble friend Lord Moylan has described registration as an &#8220;evidence-based process&#8221;, with decisions not based on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> exercising discretion. I am afraid to say that I disagree with my noble friend as this is not universally the case: some registration routes are dependent on ministerial discretion and there is no automatic entitlement.</p> <p pid="a1754.1/9">Let me explain this further. As my noble friend Lord Moylan said, not all registration routes are included in the ban. Those that allow people to acquire British nationality they missed out on because of previous unfairness are not included; nor are the specific routes for children born in the UK or stateless persons. However, registration routes that rely on residence or specifically for children born outside the UK are included in the ban, as we expect people who want to become citizens to have followed a compliant pathway, including having entered lawfully.</p> <p pid="a1754.1/10">For example, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_4">Section 4</a>(2) of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Nationality_Act_1981">British Nationality Act 1981</a> allows people who already hold another form of British nationality to register as a British citizen on the basis of five years&#8217; lawful residence in the UK. The residence requirements mirror those for naturalisation: the only significant difference between the routes is that other British nationals wanting to register under that route do not need to meet the knowledge of English and life in the UK requirements. Given that the residence requirements are the same as for naturalisation, it would be appropriate for them to be subject to the ban in the same way as naturalisation applicants. This is the route that BNOs can use if they come to the UK under our scheme and become settled: they can go on to apply for citizenship. It is right that those who apply and come through legal routes should have the right to become citizens, but we do not think it is right that those who enter unlawfully should benefit.</p> <p pid="a1754.1/11">The registration routes for children who are subject to the ban include two routes for children born abroad to British citizens by descent. Both have a residence element: either that the parent lived in the UK for a period of three years before the child was born or the family lived in the UK for the three-year period before applying to register the child. We do not anticipate that children of British citizens would be brought to the UK on a small boat when there are routes available to them as family members, but should that happen, the child will not be able to register as a citizen.</p> <p pid="a1754.1/12">The other child route that is included in the ban is registration of children at the Home Secretary&#8217;s discretion. The only statutory requirements are that the child is under 18 and is of good character if over 10. However, guidance sets out expectations about when a child will  be registered. The normal expectation is that the child will be settled in the UK, and that the parents will be British, or at least settled. It is unlikely that children who enter the UK unlawfully would be able to meet the normal expectations of having a British or settled parent, being lawfully present and having completed a period of residence, as under the Government&#8217;s proposals, children who have entered illegally will be removed. The citizenship ban will, however, prevent a child being registered under this provision unless there are ECHR grounds. This fits with the Government&#8217;s intention to discourage parents from bringing children to the UK via dangerous methods, including crossing the channel in a small boat, and that such a child cannot become a British citizen and create a means for the family to stay.</p> <p pid="a1754.1/13">My noble friend raised, quite rightly, the issue of compassionate cases. As I have said the ECHR exemption will allow us to consider registering, in rare and exceptional cases, where a person meets the statutory requirements and granting citizenship would be essential to allow them to exercise their family or private life.</p>            </div>

The whole point of the Bill, as I understand it, is that people should not be encouraged to come by illegal means, they should not jump the queue, et cetera. We disagree about that, but none the less, in that conversation about culpability, how can a child be culpable? Secondly, why should the ECHR take on the slack of compassion? There are many members of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8217;s Government who do not think we should even be signatories of the ECHR any more, and now the ECHR is being relied on for discretion and for slack and compassion.

Then the clock is running and you would be accumulating all the benefits. Which Bill are we discussing here?

The position, as he outlined in his speech, is that the deterrence effect takes its force from a number of sections in the Bill: the first, obviously, being the detention and removal, as he rightly identified; the second being the bans on the ability to settle or stay here, the idea being that that disincentivises people from entering illegally using dangerous routes. I do not accept that there are two <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> in the way that my noble friend identifies. The reality is that the question of registration of citizenship, which he raises, is unlikely to arise in as many cases as the naturalisation circumstance&#8212;I think we can agree on that&#8212;so it is natural that what we are talking about is probably an exceptional state of affairs, in any event. That is potentially why my noble friend perceives a dissonance between the deterrent effect and the two factors, but in fact there is no such distinction.</p> <p pid="a1758.1/2">Amendments 98ZA and 98EA, tabled by the noble Baroness, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Ludford">Lady Ludford</a>, seek to expand the circumstances in which the bans on settlement and citizenship are to be disapplied. The noble Baroness, Lady Lister, also touched on this issue. We consider that the circumstances in which a grant of settlement or citizenship would be an appropriate remedy are wholly covered by the ECHR, so our view is that the addition of other international agreements is unnecessary, hence the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>, as we have already canvassed.</p> <p pid="a1758.1/3">I turn now to Amendment 98I tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Brinton. This seeks to provide a broader protection for those holding British national (overseas) status. We do not believe this is necessary. The clauses which prevent people from obtaining various forms  of British nationality already do not mention British national (overseas) status. This is for the simple reason that no one has been able to obtain that status since 1997 and, consequently, there is no need to ban people from obtaining it should they arrive illegally.</p> <p pid="a1758.1/4">We already have in place a dedicated migration route for people from Hong Kong and, as the noble Baroness knows, it has been a significant priority for the Government and the department to offer this route to British national (overseas) people from Hong Kong in response to the situation there. We have done a great deal for the citizens of Hong Kong and hope to continue to do so. As cited in my response to my noble friend, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Moylan">Lord Moylan</a>, a route to citizenship exists under <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_4">Section 4</a>(2) of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Nationality_Act_1981">British Nationality Act 1981</a>. There should therefore be no reason for a person holding British national (overseas) status to arrive illegally in the manner which would mean they fall under this Bill&#8217;s provisions.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a1760.2/1">My Lords, our debate on this group has given me a new respect for nationality law, which is at least as confusing as I ever imagined. It has always been a rather &#8220;Here be dragons&#8221; subject for me; that has been fully confirmed by this debate. I need to try to make sense of my scribbles.</p> <p pid="a1760.2/2">One thing still puzzles me: I do not really understand why the Government are excluding registration for some forms of British citizenship but not for others. I remain bemused by that; I shall have to read exactly what the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> said in Hansard. Perhaps the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Moylan">Lord Moylan</a>, grasped that explanation better than I did.</p> <p pid="a1760.2/3">I have sympathy with the particular issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Moylan, and the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, on registration. I happen to think that there is more commonality with the issue of excluding routes to naturalisation than the noble Lord, Lord Moylan, wishes to acknowledge or give any quarter to, but on the issue of registration he made some important points. I wish him well in his pursuit of those issues with the Minister, but I also believe that there are serious issues around excluding people from the right to remain and a route to citizenship.</p> <p pid="a1760.2/4">I did not grasp the Minister&#8217;s explanation of why the phrase &#8220;other international agreements&#8221; was taken out by the Government. Why did you&#8212;I do not mean the Minister personally; I mean the Government and the Home Secretary&#8212;put it in the original draft of the Bill a few months ago and then take it out if it did not meet the tests of clarity and concision? I think that was the Minister&#8217;s explanation. I accept that taking out those few words makes the <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> more concise, but I do not think that doing so makes it clearer because we are then left wondering how the Government are going to secure compliance with those other international agreements    &#8212;including the refugee convention, the statelessness conventions and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child">UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>&#8212;which are not referred to in the Bill.</p> <p pid="a1760.2/5">In answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Chakrabarti, the Minister tried to explain that hanging fast to the ECHR was some new discovery by the Government. As I said last week, we tend to find it quite confusing as to when the Government like the ECHR and when they do not. They appear to act rather fast and loose on this subject.</p> <p pid="a1760.2/6">I applaud the probing <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> in the name of my noble friend Lady Brinton. I hope that she gets a fruitful meeting with the Minister because, as she and other noble Lords said, this issue seems to be the subject of considerable muddle and is having a severe impact on people&#8217;s lives. It is giving them extra anxiety. They have had to leave home and come to this country, but now they are being given the runaround by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> staff.</p> <p pid="a1760.2/7">I was left unclear, it has to be said, on the situation raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy. What will happen to the dependants of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> status holders who are having to leave Hong Kong irregularly and perhaps also arrive in this country irregularly? I am not clear whether we are sure about how their welfare and status will be assured. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> said that BNOs are not covered by this Bill, but if somebody who is not a BNO but is a dependant of one arrives in this country irregularly, surely they will potentially be subject to the Clause 2 duty to remove.</p> <p pid="a1760.2/8">Also&#8212;and almost finally&#8212;the noble Lord, Lord Moylan, highlighted a very interesting contrast between the Government wanting a duty to remove people but wanting only a discretion to be fair to them in legal and human rights terms. That does not seem very consistent. So I end by saying that I still feel very firmly that the duties under Clause 29 and 35 should be expressed in terms of not a discretion but a duty to obey our international legal obligations under the ECHR and other international treaties that we have signed.</p> <p pid="a1760.2/9">Very lastly, I flag to the Minister that I did not get an answer as to why there is that inconsistency within Clause 29. I cannot remember which way around it is, but it is about limited leave to remain and indefinite leave to remain, and for one of them the discretion covered only the ECHR and for the other it covers other international agreements. My amendment tried to address that. I do not know whether I will get an answer from the Minister&#8212;I do not expect him to pop up now and tell me&#8212;but perhaps he could find an opportunity to check whether he covered that point in his response. I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.</p> <p class="italic" pid="a1760.2/10">Amendment 98ZA withdrawn.</p> <p class="italic" pid="a1760.2/11">Clause 29 agreed.</p> <p pid="a1760.2/12"><b><i>Clause 30: Persons prevented from obtaining British citizenship etc</i></b></p> <p class="italic" pid="a1760.2/13">Amendment 98A not moved.</p> <p class="italic" pid="a1760.2/14">Clause 30 agreed.</p> <p pid="a1760.2/15"><b><i>Clause 31: British citizenship</i></b></p> <p class="italic" pid="a1760.2/16">Amendments 98B and 98C not moved.</p> <p class="italic" pid="a1760.2/17">Clause 31 agreed.</p> <p pid="a1760.2/18"><b><i>Clause 32: British overseas territories citizenship</i></b></p> <p class="italic" pid="a1760.2/19">Amendments 98D and 98E not moved.</p> <p class="italic" pid="a1760.2/20">Clause 32 agreed.</p> <p class="italic" pid="a1760.2/21">Clauses 33 and 34 agreed.</p> <p pid="a1760.2/22"><b><i>Clause 35: Disapplication of sections 31 to 34</i></b></p> <p class="italic" pid="a1760.2/23">Amendment 98EA not moved.</p> <p class="italic" pid="a1760.2/24">Clause 35 agreed.</p> <p pid="a1760.2/25"><b><i>Clause 36: Amendments relating to sections 31 to 35</i></b></p> <p class="italic" pid="a1760.2/26">Amendments 98F to 98H not moved.</p> <p class="italic" pid="a1760.2/27">Clause 36 agreed.</p> <p class="italic" pid="a1760.2/28">Amendment 98I not moved.</p> <p pid="a1760.2/29"><b><i>Clause 37: Suspensive claims: interpretation</i></b></p>            </div>
