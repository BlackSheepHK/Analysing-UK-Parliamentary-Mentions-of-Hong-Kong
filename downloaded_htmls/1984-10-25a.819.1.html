                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I will, with permission, make a statement on developments during the recess in the negotiations between the British and Chinese Governments on the future of Hong Kong.</p> <p>
During my discussions in Peking with Chinese leaders in late July I was able to resolve most of the major issues outstanding in the negotiations. I gave a progress report in a statement in Hong Kong on 1 August. Copies of that statement were <a href="/glossary/?gl=252" title="This phrase is often used in written answers to indicate that a minister..." class="glossary">placed in the Library</a> of the House on the same day.</p> <p>
Negotiations continued on the remaining unresolved issues and were brought to a successful conclusion on 22 September. As a result, a draft agreement consisting of a joint declaration and three annexes was initialled on 26 September by the British ambassador in Peking and the Chinese Vice <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of Foreign Affairs, Mr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Nan">Zhou Nan</a>. It was published on the same day in a <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> in London and Hong Kong and laid before the House.</p> <p>
I should like to draw the attention of the House to the following important features of the draft agreement. It constitutes a formal international agreement, legally binding in all its parts. This is the highest form of commitment that can be given by one sovereign state to another. It deals in considerable detail with Chinese policies towards Hong Kong after 1997 and thus provides a framework in which the people of Hong Kong can plan and work for a secure and prosperous future. It thus provides for Hong Kong's distinctive economic and social systems, freedoms and lifestyle to continue unchanged. It makes it clear that the policies which it spells out for Hong Kong will be stipulated in a basic law to be passed by the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and will remain unchanged for 50 years after 1997.</p> <p>
It is now for the people of Hong Kong to give their views on the draft agreement. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> has already been informed of the arrangements which have been made to enable them to do so. More than 2 million copies of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper">White Paper</a> have been distributed in the territory.</p> <p>
I am very glad to be able to tell the House that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Council_of_Hong_Kong">Executive Council of Hong Kong</a> has felt able to recommend the draft agreement to the people of Hong Kong&#8212;in the words of the senior unofficial member&#8212;"in good conscience." The House will also wish to know that at the conclusion of its debate last week the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Legislative_Council">Hong Kong Legislative Council</a> gave the draft agreement its overwhelming support and similarly commended it to the people of Hong Kong. Beyond that, I have been encouraged by the favourable reactions which have come from many other public bodies and individuals in Hong Kong and by the wide international welcome which the draft agreement has received.</p> <p>
The House will in due course wish to know the extent to which the draft agreement as a whole is acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. It was made quite clear in the White Paper that the draft agreement itself cannot be amended, but the views expressed in Hong Kong on all parts of it will be of value in our continuing discussions with the Chinese, particularly in the joint liaison group. I am sure that the House would wish me to urge everyone in Hong Kong to submit their views on all these aspects to the assessment office.</p> <p>
The report of the assessment office, together with that of the monitoring team, will be published at about the end of November. The House will, of course, attach great importance to these reports when it debates the draft agreement and I know that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House will be seeking to give the House an early opportunity to debate the matter after the publication of the reports.</p> <p>
It would not be right to anticipate that debate, but the Government have made quite clear their own view that the draft agreement provides the assurances which are necessary if the people of Hong Kong are to face the future with confidence. In the words of the White Paper:
<q>Her Majesty's Government believe that the Agreement is a good one. They strongly recommend it to the people of Hong Kong and to Parliament.</q></p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I congratulate the right hon. and learned Gentleman on the skill, patience and flexibility that he has shown in conducting an exceptionally delicate negotiation, which may set important precedents in other areas. The agreement must be regarded as the most outstanding achievement of British diplomacy since <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Carrington">Lord Carrington</a> concluded the Rhodesian negotiations and the state of Zimbabwe was born. In Hong Kong, as in Zimbabwe, the role of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> was critical, because the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s intemperate <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> at an earlier stage had threatened to torpedo the negotiations before they had even begun.</p> <p>
I hope that the Foreign Secretary will agree that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> have given him every assistance when it would have been all too easy for an irresponsible Opposition to seek to exploit some of the difficulties, to party advantage.</p> <p>
I am glad to hear that the House is to debate the agreement before the end of the year when the consultations are complete. If, as I expect, the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the House receives representations from both sides, I hope he will agree to a two-day debate so that the matter can be fully explored and all points of view fully expressed.</p> <p>
In the light of that impending debate, I shall not raise any points of detail now. I would say only that in my view it is the best possible agreement and very much better than many believed possible even six months ago.</p> <p>
However, let me make two points at this stage which arise out of the agreement or which are not included in it. First, I gather that there is some concern in Hong Kong that the assessment office, which is responsible for gauging public opinion, is insisting that all comment should be given in writing, properly signed, with the full name and address of the writer. I understand why that is so, but there is some anxiety in the colony that information about the views of individuals might later become available to persons and used for victimisation. I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman can assure the House that such letters will remain strictly confidential and that he will ensure that there is no risk that they could ever be used at a later stage to victimise the writers.</p> <p>
The second point is much more general. Inevitably, a change of status in a territory of this magnitude has disturbed some of the older citizens of the territory and led them to consider packing up sticks and going somewhere else. Knowing a little the character of the Chinese in Hong Kong, I am certain that two new millionaires will spring up where every one old millionaire has left.</p> <p>
I am more concerned about the conduct of British business men in Hong Kong. It has been noticeable that


the American business community has taken a far more optimistic view of the future in Hong Kong than have some of the more self-regarding and old-established British firms, perhaps because they expect to be able to compete on more equal terms for business from now on. I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will agree that it would be a pity if in Hong Kong, as in so many other ex-British colonies, constitutional change led to foreign firms taking business from British firms which were incapable of adjusting to the new status.</p>            </div>

Subject to that, I want to express to the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Benches my appreciation of the congratulations that he has tendered today, and, rightly, for the support that I have received in the course of the many discussions and consultations which we have all had to have about this. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the House will certainly take note of what was said about the length of the debate.</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman is right to draw attention to the desirability of allowing the assessment office to obtain evidence as widely as it can. It is an impressive feature that in a territory with not many more than 5 million people 2 million copies of the agreement have been taken up. That shows the intensity of interest there. For those who are unable to submit written evidence when arrangements can be made they will be able to do so orally through local offices, although it is obviously preferable for such evidence to be in writing wherever possible. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government_of_Hong_Kong">The Government of Hong Kong</a> and I are aware of the right hon. Gentleman's point about the need for confidentiality to be preserved in order to avoid any threat of subsequent victimisation. We shall be taking steps to deal with that.</p> <p>
It would be regrettable if the confidence expressed were affected by decisions hereafter of an investment or other nature which were differentiated by reference to nationality. The key point which I sought to emphasise many times in my discussions with the Chinese is that confidence depends on the way in which the system is established and will behave. It is confidence that will command the decisions of a multitude of individual investors. I am sure the House will hope that British investors will continue to play an active part.</p>            </div>

I said that while the agreement cannot be amended representations made about it in the years that lie ahead are appropriate to be taken into account by the joint liaison group.</p> <p>
The agreement provides for the Legislature of Hong Kong in the future to be on an elective basis and for the Executive to be accountable to that Legislature. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hong_Kong_Government">The Hong Kong Government</a> have published a <a href="/glossary/?gl=221" title="A Green Paper is a tentative report of British government proposals without..." class="glossary">Green Paper</a> foreshadowing the certain changes in the representative arrangements in Hong Kong. They are now considering public comment on those proposals. The comment that has been made generally gives support to the principle of gradual development of representative institutions, perhaps along the lines that the hon. Gentleman has in mind. It is hoped that a <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> setting out the reaction of the Hong Kong Government will be published shortly.</p> <p>
The hon. Gentleman made an important point on the joint liaison group. It is clear from the text of the second annex to the agreement that each side will determine the composition of its delegation. We shall ensure that Hong Kong is appropriately represented.</p> <p>
I thank the hon. Gentleman for what he had to say about the negotiation of the agreement and I endorse specifically what he said about the part played by the officials, who gave sustained and dedicated service through many long months of negotiation which became increasingly intense as the months went by. No Government could have wished for more devoted service from the civil servants taking part from Britain and Hong Kong.</p>            </div>

I know that the hon. Gentleman has thought carefully about the pace of development of representative institutions, because he has taken a close interest in the matter. It must be borne in mind that the general position supported by those who have commented in Hong Kong is one of support for the gradual development of representative institutions.

Will my right hon. and learned Friend accept that there was general admiration for the achievement of himself, the governor and the team of diplomats in arriving at such a detailed, comprehensive and understanding agreement? However, the agreement will not come into operation for 14 years.</p> <p>
Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that the maintenance of confidence over that period will depend very much on the conduct of the signatory powers? For instance, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> should produce a basic law which is a faithful reflection of the agreement, and it is equally important that Britain should appear genuinely to be committed to Hong Kong right up to 1997 and should retain a great interest in the area long after that.</p>            </div>

Friend for what he has said, and, in particular, for his reminder of the important part played throughout the process not only by the Executive Council members and the members of the Legislative Council, to whom I have already referred, but also by the governor of Hong Kong. The governor bore a double burden, being a continuous member of the negotiating team as well as governor of the territory. I am sure that the House will wish to pay tribute to him.</p> <p>
My hon. Friend is right to say that the maintenance of confidence depends upon the continuous pattern of behaviour of both the signatory powers. The agreement provides for the text to be reflected in the basic law to be introduced by the People's Republic of China. That is an important feature of the agreement. Continued participatory confidence by the United Kingdom is equally important.</p>            </div>

I hesitate to answer in the House in any general form questions about different citizenship positions, because there are so many different permutations. There is, of course, a distinction between those who are British dependent territory citizens and those who are not. Non-Chinese British dependent territory citizens will be eligible to retain appropriate status under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Nationality_Act">British Nationality Act</a> after 1 July 1997 if they obtain a British passport or are included in one before then.</p> <p>
There is specific, express and extended provision for civil rights in section <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XIII">XIII</a> of annex I to the agreement, including the provisions of the international covenant on civil and political rights, and economic, social and cultural rights.</p> <p>
The agreement provides that defence and foreign affairs are the concern of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>. The question of conscription is not mentioned in the agreement, but that does not mean that there will be conscription. The Chinese Government have certainly not suggested that there will be.</p> <p>
Public order is explicitly the responsibility of the government of the Hong Kong special administrative region.</p>            </div>

He has suggested direct Hong Kong representation in the British delegation to the joint liaison group.
