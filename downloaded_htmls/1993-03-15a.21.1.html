There is widespread support in the House and elsewhere for the proposals put forward by the Governor last October. We sought to respond to the wish of the Hong Kong people for a greater say in their own affairs while staying within the terms of the Sino-British joint declaration, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law">Basic Law</a> and other relevant exchanges with the Chinese side.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Governor">The Governor</a>'s proposals represent our judgment of the right way forward for Hong Kong, but we have said from the start that we are open to alternative idea, from the people of Hong Kong or from the Chinese side. We have had a wide range of suggestions from people in Hong Kong. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese">The Chinese</a> side have opposed the proposals without offering anything in their place. Since last October, we and the Governor have been urging the Chinese side to discuss these electoral issues with us in order to reach an understanding. We are ready to enter such discussions without preconditions. We want to see as much continuity as possible in Hong Kong's electoral arrangements before and after 1997.</p> <p>
Some two months ago, we renewed our efforts to get talks under way with China, and since then there have been intensive diplomatic contacts in Peking. It may be useful for the House if I set out briefly the basis on which we were prepared to hold discussions.</p> <p>
First, we accepted that the talks should be on the basis of the joint declaration&#8212;which I have mentioned&#8212;the principle of convergence with the Basic Law and the relevant understandings and agreements reached between Britain and China. The Governor's proposals are wholly compatible with those.</p> <p>
Second, as I made plain to the House on 10 March, we told the Chinese side that the British team in these discussions would include representatives of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Government">Hong Kong Government</a> on the same basis as other officials taking part in the talks. Hong Kong officials have joined over the past 10 years in discussions with the Chinese side as members of the British team, including during the negotiations on the joint declaration and later as members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Liaison_Group">Joint Liaison Group</a>. We cannot and do not accept what some Chinese officials have said in the past few days&#8212;that the role of people from Hong Kong in discussions about Hong Kong's future should be downgraded.</p> <p>
We received a positive response on the principle of talks from the Chinese side in early February. To help get the talks started, we and the Governor therefore decided, with the advice of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Council">Executive Council</a> in Hong Kong, to postpone the original plan to publish the draft electoral legislation in Hong Kong's Official Gazette on 12 February. As the diplomatic contacts proceeded, we held up publication for four further weeks; but we told the Chinese that it was not possible to delay indefinitely, given the need to pass legislation before the Legislative Council rose for its summer recess in July.</p> <p>
It is disappointing that, despite <ob/>all those efforts, the Chinese side were still not able to agree by 12 March to a date for talks&#8212;or even to a date on which an announcement of talks could be made. As we had

forewarned them, the Governor therefore published his proposals on that day, 12 March. A copy has been <a href="/glossary/?gl=252" title="This phrase is often used in written answers to indicate that a minister..." class="glossary">placed in the Library</a> of the House.</p> <p>
Publication in the Official Gazette is only the first step in the legislative process. Introduction of the Bill into the Legislative Council would be a separate step. As the Governor has said, we will have to judge, in the light of developments, when to take that step. Thereafter, I am sure that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members">Members</a> of the Legislative Council would want to discuss the draft legislation in great detail, in the light of the various alternatives put forward, before they reached a decision.</p> <p>
Publication of the legislation therefore should not make it more difficult to begin talks with China. The Bill sets out the Governor's proposals, which have been public since October, in legislative form. This does not affect the basis for talks with China, the need for such talks, or our wish to hold them. We have said that if we reached an understanding with the Chinese side we would recommend this to the Legislative Council.</p> <p>
So we remain ready for talks at any time and I hope that the Chinese side will be prepared to settle quickly on arrangements for such talks. We in Britain have responsibility for the administration of Hong Kong until 1997, and part of that responsibility is to maintain steady progress towards democracy in Hong Kong. We are open to discussion about how to achieve that, but the key point is that the electoral arrangements in Hong Kong should be fair, open and acceptable to the people of Hong Kong.</p> <p>
The Chinese side also have responsibilities and interests as the future sovereign power. Britain and China have every incentive to work together to ensure the future success of Hong Kong. We will continue to the greatest extent possible to pursue steadily the path of co-operation with China, and we look to the Chinese side to do the same.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I welcome the right hon. Gentleman's decision to make a statement about the circumstances in Hong Kong and on relations between the People's Republic of China and Her Majesty's Government. We had asked for such a statement, and I think that the whole House will be grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for making one. There is much in the statement with which to agree. It is conciliatory in tone and continues to offer open discussions without preconditions to the Government of the People's Republic of China. That, too, is welcome. It safeguards the legitimate interests and the right to make final decisions of the people of Hong Kong themselves whose future is the most important aspect of all in these matters. I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on all those issues.</p> <p>
However, the central question remains unanswered. Why is it that, in the face of long discussions over many months with the apparent openness and willingness of Her Majesty's Government to meet without preconditions, the talks have broken down? Why is progress not being made? Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that in my meetings with Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and in several discussions with the ambassador of the People's Republic of China in London I have made it clear that we would always support proposals to extend democracy to the people of Hong Kong?</p> <p>
Is the right hon. Gentleman also aware that we urged the representatives of the People's Republic of China to return to the negotiating table with counter proposals, if


they have any? It is regrettable that they have failed either in private discussions or apparently in public to present any counter proposals as a basis for discussions to resolve this deadlock.</p> <p>
The deadlock is serious for a number of reasons. For example, why are the Chinese now apparently objecting&#8212;I say "apparently objecting"&#8212;to the involvement of representatives of the people of Hong Kong when those representatives have taken part over many years in discussions about the future of Hong Kong? What has caused that apparent change of mind in Beijing? Will the right hon. Gentleman assure us and the people of Hong Kong that their legitimate right to be represented in any talks about their future will not be given away but will be safeguarded by Her Majesty's Government and the Governor? For example, what is to happen to the very important economic development of the new airport for Hong Kong? How will those proposals be affected by this continuing breakdown in the talks?</p> <p>
Will the right hon. Gentleman make it clear that he will continue, in line with the Governor, to make it clear to the Government of the People's Republic of China that delay cannot be endured indefinitely: that if legislation is to pass through Legco&#8212;I say "if legislation is to pass through Legco", because it remains for the members of Legco themselves to decide whether the proposals are acceptable to them, which will be a debate that we shall all watch with interest&#8212;that legislation cannot be delayed indefinitely, even though, and I agree with the right hon. Gentleman on this point, he insists that it is not too late for talks on alternative proposals to develop.</p> <p>
May I say to the right hon. Gentleman and, through him, to the people of Hong Kong and, for that matter, to the Governor that proposals to widen and deepen democracy in Hong Kong have had and retain our complete support, without any equivocation at all, but we want to see a resumption of talks between Her Majesty's Government and the Governor and the People's Republic of China in the interests, above all, of the future well-being of the people of Hong Kong.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his support. That is a great help. He questioned me in particular on two points. His first question&#8212;why the talks about talks did not succeed&#8212;is one which he must address to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>. I was reasonably hopeful a week ago, even a shorter time ago, that the different procedural obstacles that had come up were being resolved and that we would be able to start substantial talks. At the end, the difficulty focused on something that I mentioned in my statement. Representatives of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Government">Hong Kong Government</a> have taken part in this kind of discussion often before, without any difficulty. There was a suggestion from the Chinese side that their role and their designation should be, in some way, lessened or degraded. The implications of that are not ones which we could accept. It was really on that point that the talks about talks stalled.</p> <p>
On the right hon. Gentleman's second point, it is agreed between us and the Chinese and virtually everybody in Hong Kong that Hong Kong needs a new airport if it is to remain a first class international trade and financial centre. We went out of our way last year, as the House will recall, to take account of Chinese problems over the financing of

these arrangements. The result is the memorandum of understanding which the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> entered into. I believe that agreement could be reached quickly on these airport matters if the financial issues, in which the Chinese have a legitimate interest, were tackled on their merits. We shall seek to do that.</p>            </div>

That is what has caused offence in Beijing. Can my right hon. Friend confirm, lest there be any doubt, that the 1984 agreement remains the basis of our policy towards Hong Kong? In order to find a way in which both sides, or all three sides, can get themselves off the hook, would it not at least be worth while contemplating the proposition that an independent panel of lawyers should look at the simple, central question whether the Governor's proposals, made unilaterally last October, did or did not break both the 1984 agreement and, more importantly, the 1990 and 1991 discussions?</p>            </div>

As Governor, it is his duty&#8212;a duty that he does not share with anyone else at present&#8212;to put forward proposals for the conduct of the legislative elections in Hong Kong in 1995.</p> <p>
On 25 September, some time before the Governor published his proposals, I gave the Chinese Foreign <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> the text of what the Governor proposed to say. At all times, before and after the Governor announced his proposals, he, I and everyone made it clear that they were proposals and that we were perfectly ready to discuss them with the Chinese, just as they are open for discussion in Hong Kong.</p> <p>
As for my hon. Friend's suggestion, it is of course the Chinese who have most strongly opposed any internationalisation of the discussion on these issues. On the legal points, the documents are in the Library and hon. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members">Members</a> can make their own decisions and conclusions, but we are perfectly clear that we are justified in saying, as I did, that the Governor's proposals are entirely compatible with the joint declaration&#8212;I confirm that that remains the basis of our policy&#8212;and that they are compatible with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law">Basic Law</a> and with understandings reached in the context of the last Legislative Council elections. We are confident about that, but the talks that we seek should concentrate on the arrangements for the future, and I hope that they can be arranged on that basis.</p>            </div>

It is important to have sensible arrangements for the future which meet the criteria set out in my statement but which could be continued after 1997 in what is called the through-train. That should be the objective, but it has not yet been possible to reach it.</p> <p>
As for what the right hon. Gentleman said about the Chinese <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s statement this morning, it follows the line that has been taken before. There is nothing especially dramatic or unexpected in it, but it represents the continuation of a stalemate on a matter which it is in the practical interests of Britain, China and Hong Kong for the stalemate to be broken. That is the essence of the matter, and I hope that after gazetting, as before gazetting, it will be possible to start, continue and succeed in a dialogue that reflects those real interests.</p>            </div>

I do not think that he recognises the realities of the situation any more than he did when he was a Front-Bench spokesman. Most right hon. and hon. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members">Members</a>, including the right hon. Gentleman in calmer moments, know that

the political demand for democracy in Hong Kong is of reasonably recent date. It is now strong&#8212;[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh come on!"] That is true. When I first knew Hong Kong many years ago, it would have been hard for anybody to say that there was a demand in Hong Kong for political democracy. It simply was not so. Recent events, which I need not specify, have created that demand out of anxiety. It is now a real demand. It is no longer possible to treat or to handle Hong Kong as if it were simply a commercial city. The political demand is there and the political community is now there. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Governor">The Governor</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> must take account of that reality.</p> <p>
We can argue, as the right hon. Gentleman and I did at the time, about the OMELCO consensus, although I do not agree with his conclusion. The conclusion we reached last time was about right and worked. I always said that we would go back to the Chinese to see whether we could improve on it. I was thinking of an increase in the number of directly elected seats. What the Governor has done is not that. He has sought to improve democracy by other means compatible with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law">Basic Law</a>. The Governor has made a shrewd set of proposals.</p>            </div>

All that the Governor and my right hon.

Will my right hon. Friend accept that it is entirely right that we should persist with these modest proposals to make a reality of points to which the Chinese have already agreed? Will my right hon. Friend also bear in mind that the whole of Asia, including Hong Kong, is now in transition and that there is quite a degree of transition in Beijing as well?

It is a remarkably successful economy, precisely because of that combination of British administration and Chinese entrepreneurship.

I can confirm the hon. Gentleman's first point. Opportunities for trade with China are substantial and have been continuing. I hope that that will continue to be the case.</p>            </div>

Does my right hon. Friend recall that, after the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs visited Peking in 1989, it reported that the Chinese Government had said that they had no objection to faster progress towards democracy and that the introduction of representative government was a matter for Hong Kong. In its report, written after the Tiananmen square incident, the Committee reported unanimously to the House that we believed that full democracy must be introduced before 1997. That was on the basis of advice that we were given by the Chinese Government in Peking. It would be helpful if my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary would remind them of that.</p>            </div>

Certainly the right hon. Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham) has given that support. There is now a political city alongside a commercial city in Hong Kong. Both are now part of the reality. That is one reason why, in Hong Kong itself, the Governor's proposals have continued, despite sniping from inside and outside the colony, to receive very strong support.</p>            </div>

First, they were not prepared to see an increase in the number of directly elected seats beyond 20 as provided for in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law">Basic Law</a>. The Governor's proposals respect that. Secondly, the Legislative Council should not be changed in nature, and the Governor's proposals respect that. We therefore took into account both the main points that the Chinese had quite legitimately impressed on us as their view. The Governor found a way, while respecting those points, modestly but clearly of advancing democracy. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese">The Chinese</a> should accept the effort that has been made as a basis for discussion&#8212;as something that should be discussed.

The best agreements are those that rest on self-interest, and it is in the self-interest of China that it should take over in 1997 and be able to sustain a promising, prosperous city. That depends, in turn, on keeping alive in Hong Kong the entrepreneurial spirit, which rests on a degree of freedom of speech and on the growing institutions of democracy. This is not something theoretical for China: properly considered, it is in its self-interest. We will do what we can&#8212;I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman's tactic would be the right one&#8212;to bring that point home as often as we can.</p>            </div>

Indeed, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Select_Committee">Foreign Affairs Select Committee</a> report specifically rejected the views of the right hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester,_Gorton">Manchester, Gorton</a> (Mr. Kaufman). What the House wants is a sensible, structured approach both to democracy and to judicial matters which will enable this country to maintain its other commitment in the joint declaration&#8212;to economic and social stability in Hong Kong. It is therefore in China's interest and in the interests of the people of Hong Kong that we proceed as the Governor has suggested.</p>            </div>

No journalists were present when I gave the plans to the Chinese Foreign <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> on 25 November last year, and I made no statement. I made no effort to score points. I gave the plans to the Chinese in confidence so that they had an opportunity to comment in the weeks that followed, before the Governor announced the proposals. They refused to take that opportunity. I do not think that it would be reasonable to expect that the Governor should hold up publication of the proposals in October or their gazetting on 12 March this year indefinitely or until the Chinese agreed. Those are not reasonable proposals for the House or for Hong Kong.</p> <p>
Before publication of the proposals, we gave the Chinese an opportunity, and we offered them another between publication last October and gazetting in March. Neither of those opportunities was taken. A third opportunity exists now, when the proposals are gazetted. But the Legislative Council has not started discussions, let alone taken any decisions. We are not pillorying anyone.</p> <p>
I have deliberately chosen my words very carefully. We want to enter into discussions, and I hope that the opportunity can now be taken.</p>            </div>
