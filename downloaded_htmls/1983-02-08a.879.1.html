On 9 June 1982, in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Sir A. Kershaw), I set out the Government's initial response to the study by the Overseas Students Trust published on 6 June. I said then that the study represented, in the Government's view, a comprehensive and constructive contribution to the development of future policy on overseas students; and that we would seriously consider its recommendations, although I stressed the financial constraints.</p> <p>
The Government have now completed their consideration of the trust's recommendations and have taken into account the views of the many outside bodies interested in this field.</p> <p>
They have concluded that it is in <a href="/glossary/?gl=247" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_interest" class="glossary">the national interest</a>, both in the short term and in the longer term, to provide more help to enable overseas students to come to this country for their further and higher education. The Government have therefore decided to increase their support for overseas students by &#163;46 million over the next three years. This will involve an additional sum of &#163;25 million from the contingency reserve and a reallocation of resources within the aid programme amounting to &#163;21 million. This money will be used to finance a number of new measures involving provision for some 5,000 to 6,000 additional scholarships and awards each year.</p> <p>
The measures are as follows. First, the Government will enter into discussions with the Hong Kong Government about their proposals for a shared funding scheme which would have the effect of treating eligible Hong Kong university and polytechnic students as home students for fee purposes. The Government will be ready to consider arrangements to the same end for other dependent territories.</p> <p>
Secondly, additional awards will be provided for students from the Commonwealth under the Commonwealth scholarship and fellowship plan.</p> <p>
Thirdly, a new scheme of discretionary awards will be introduced. This will be selective and will have the object of attracting students who will not only benefit themselves but whose study and experience here will be of advantage to this country.</p> <p>
Fourthly, there will be some provision for Cyprus, which was singled out in the Overseas Students Trust's study as having a unique combination of claims for special consideration, and for Malaysia, which has traditionally sent the largest number of students to this country.</p> <p>
Fifthly, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_Development_Administration">Overseas Development Administration</a>'s bilateral technical co-operation programme will be expanded to provide additional awards.</p> <p>
Finally, there will be some limited additional provision to enable the British Council to assist the activities of British institutions in attracting fee-paying students from abroad and in strengthening academic links.</p> <p>
In addition to these measures, my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Education and Science is favourably inclined towards the trust's recommendation that institutions should have more flexibility over fixing their own fees for overseas students, provided no subsidy is

involved. This is currently being examined in consultation with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Grants_Committee">University Grants Committee</a> and local education authorities.</p> <p>
My right hon. Friend also hopes to broaden the scope of the overseas research students award scheme and to ensure that the full quota of awards is taken up.</p> <p>
The Government accept and will implement many of the other recommendations in the Overseas Students Trust's study concerning future policy towards overseas students but which do not involve additional public funding, such as spreading funds available for awards widely in order that more students may benefit.</p> <p>
A number of other recommendations in the Overseas Students Trust's study need further examination, for legal and practical reasons. I shall place in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=271" title="See &quot;placed in the library&quot;." class="glossary">Library of the House</a> in the next few days a paper dealing with these aspects and setting out in greater detail the Government's response to the Overseas Students Trust's study, including the measures which I have outlined in this statement.</p> <p>
The Government believe that it is right and in our interests to encourage students from abroad. We have responded positively to the recommendations of the Overseas Students Trust. I know that this will be widely welcomed both in this House and elswhere.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I should like to begin by thanking the right hon. Gentleman for his statement and to join him in what he said about the Overseas Students Trust's study. I should like also to express our thanks to Professor Peter Williams and the committee, who have produced a comprehensive and detailed report.</p> <p>
Would it not have been much better had such a report been available to the Government before they embarked on the disastrous and ill-considered policy of charging full-cost fees to non-British students? Even so, I think that the statement represents some small advance.</p> <p>
However, it seems odd to me that the right hon. Gentleman should have said in his statement that the Government have at last concluded what most hon. Members knew, that it is in <a href="/glossary/?gl=247" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_interest" class="glossary">the national interest</a>, both in the short term and the long term, to provide more help to enable overseas students to come to this country. In the meantime, over three or four years, we have continued to anger our friends in the Commonwealth and have discriminated against them in an unforgiveable fashion.</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman mentioned Cyprus. A Cypriot student coming to Britain now to study medicine will pay the best part of &#163;7,000 in tuition fees, whereas a student coming from neighbouring Greece pays &#163;480. The right hon. Gentleman's statement says nothing to deal with that measure of discrimination which currently exists, often to the disadvantage of some of the poorest countries.</p> <p>
Does the right hon. Gentleman realise that, so long as this indefensible discrimination exists between our treatment of EC nationals and those of Commonwealth and other friendly countries, it is no answer merely to up the schemes that have been described, which will be operated by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_Development_Administration">Overseas Development Administration</a>, the British Council and others? Is it not a fact that the &#163;46 million to which the right hon. Gentleman referred means, first, a reallocation of aid money? From where in the aid budget will that money come?</p> <p>
Secondly, until an agreement is made with the Hong Kong Government about co-funding, has the right hon. Gentleman an estimate of what part of the &#163;46 million has been set aside to provide for that Hong Kong agreement,


and how much will be left for the other schemes that the right hon. Gentleman has described to us? What is the relationship between his statement and the press release issued by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Science">Department of Education and Science</a> last Friday, which referred to an increase of 6 per cent. next year for full-cost student fees?</p> <p>
Finally, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> look forward to a fuller response. We have already waited six or seven months for the response that we now have, and it is the Labour party's intention to ensure that a proper response is given that will repair some of the damage that has been done to our political, cultural and commercial relationships with friendly countries.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will wish to study the details of the scheme in the paper to be <a href="/glossary/?gl=252" title="This phrase is often used in written answers to indicate that a minister..." class="glossary">placed in the Library</a> in the next few days.</p> <p>
I remind the hon. Gentleman that when the Government came to power we faced excessive public expenditure and it was vital to cut it back. Reluctantly, therefore, we took a decision that affected overseas students' fees. That had to be done for the sake of the economy and in <a href="/glossary/?gl=247" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_interest" class="glossary">the national interest</a>.</p> <p>
Some of the hon. Gentleman's comments about Cyprus are perfectly true. That country is in a special position for a number of reasons. It is a member of the Commonwealth, it has no university of its own, it has a large refugee population and there are British defence interests there. It is precisely because of the disadvantage at present experienced by Cyprus that I made it clear in my statement that we shall give that country additional assistance.</p> <p>
As for the relationships between EC and Commonwealth students, the House will know that the EC has regulations about students within the Community. We naturally provide for them and gain benefit from our students studying at universities in other Community countries. Nevertheless, one of the intentions outlined in my statement is to give particular assistance to the Commonwealth by increasing the number of fellowships and scholarships, enabling poorer countries of the Commonwealth to benefit from an extended part of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ODA">ODA</a> programme and from the new discretionary award schemes. In those and other ways, we intend to assist the Commonwealth.</p> <p>
As I said in my statement, there is some re-allocation of resources within the aid budget, but the aid budget for 1983&#8211;84 and for later years has been expanded. We intend to achieve the results that we want by a re-allocation of &#163;21 million, but there is an additional &#163;25 million from the contingency reserve. On the allocation to the countries that I mentioned and to others, I ask the hon. Gentleman to await the paper that will shortly be placed in the library.</p>            </div>

With regard to administration and so on, we shall be assisted by the British Council, which has an excellent record and knowledge in this area, so I believe that we shall be able to get things well organised in time for the next academic year.</p>            </div>

The number of overseas students coming to this country reached a peak in 1977 and was still well over 80,000 in 1978&#8211;79&#8212;infinitely more than there had been 10 years previously and at a cost that we then felt was excessive. The number has since fallen to about 55,000 for 1982&#8211;83&#8212;compared with 39,000 in 1971&#8211;72, to put the matter in perspective. I hope and believe that my announcement today will encourage an increase in the number on a very selective basis.</p> <p>
The <a href="/glossary/?gl=191" title="The house of Lords is the upper chamber of the Houses of Parliament.

There will be only a small adjustment in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ODA">ODA</a> budget in 1983&#8211;84 and a slightly larger adjustment in 1984&#8211;85 and later years.

First, total public expenditure was far too high. Secondly, there had been an enormous increase in the number of overseas students, at a vast cost that the Government felt we could not afford at that time. We have now proposed a scheme which I believe will be very helpful and positive in that it will provide for a further 5,000 or 6,000 scholarships and awards. There are no specific proposals for refugees, but they are in no sense excluded from the scheme.</p>            </div>

I wish to have your advice on what I believe is a point of order. We have just heard a statement in response to a publication by the Overseas Students Trust in June last year. In the intervening period there has been a much more important decision, with all due deference to the Overseas Students Trust, about the Government's responsibilities for overseas students within the law. That was the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Lords">Law Lords</a>' judgment on 16 December that overseas students who had been resident in Britain for more than three years should be regarded as being ordinarily resident and, therefore, entitled to home student status.</p> <p>
The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> said that consideration is being given to that matter in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Science">Department of Education and Science</a>, but as local education authorities, the students themselves and higher education institutions are now in a limbo of uncertainty and insecurity, and some of those students may be owed sums of up to &#163;20,000, may I, through you, Mr. Speaker, ask that most urgent attention be given to this more important consideration that affects students from all parts of the globe, including the Commonwealth, not just those to whom the Government saw fit to respond in today's statement?</p>            </div>
