Over the course of this week, many and various claims to prevent relocation have been brought forward. I welcomed the decisions of our domestic courts&#8212;the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court">High Court</a>, the Court of Appeal and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court">Supreme Court</a>&#8212;to uphold our right to send the flight. However, following a decision by an out-of-hours judge in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=199" title="Also referred to as the ECHR, the European Court of Human Rights was..." class="glossary">European Court of Human Rights</a> in Strasbourg, minutes before our flight&#8217;s departure, the final individuals remaining on the flight had their removal directions paused while their claims were considered.</p> <p pid="b291.1/3">I want to make something absolutely clear: the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights">European Court of Human Rights</a> did not rule that the policy or relocations were unlawful, but it prohibited the removal of three of those on last night&#8217;s flight. Those prohibitions last for different time periods but are not an absolute bar on their transfer to Rwanda. Anyone who has been ordered to be released by the court will be tagged while we continue to progress their relocation. While this decision by the Strasbourg court to intervene was disappointing and surprising given the repeated and considered judgments to the contrary in our domestic courts, we remain committed to this policy. These repeated legal barriers are very similar to those that we experience with all other removal flights. We believe that we are fully compliant with our domestic and international obligations, and preparations for our future flights and the next flights have already begun. Our domestic courts were of the view that the flight could go ahead.</p> <p pid="b291.1/4">The case for our partnership with Rwanda bears repeating. We are a generous and welcoming country, as has been shown time and time again. Over 200,000 people have used safe and legal routes to come to the UK since 2015, and most recently Britons have opened their hearts and their homes to Afghan nationals and Ukrainian nationals. But our capacity to help those in need is severely compromised by those who come here illegally and, as we have discussed in this House many, many times, seek to jump the queue because they can afford to pay the people smugglers. It is illegal, and it is not necessary, because they are coming from other safe countries. It is not fair, either on those who play by the rules or on the British taxpayers who have to foot this bill. We cannot keep on spending nearly &#163;5 million a day on accommodation, including hotels. We cannot accept this intolerable pressure on public services and local communities. It makes us less safe as nation, because those who come here illegally do not have the regularised checks or even the regularised status and because evil people-smuggling gangs use the proceeds of their ill-gotten gains to fund other appalling crimes that undermine the security of our country. It is also  lethally dangerous for those who are smuggled. People have drowned at sea, suffocated in lorries and perished crossing territories.</p> <p pid="b291.1/5">The humane, decent and moral response to all this is simply not to stand by and let people drown or be sold into slavery or smuggled, but to stop it. With that, inaction is not an option&#8212;or at least, not a morally responsible one. This is, as I have said repeatedly, a complex, long-standing problem. The global asylum system is broken and between 80 million and 100 million people are now displaced, and others are on the move seeking better economic opportunities. An international problem requires international solutions.</p> <p pid="b291.1/6"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> and Rwanda have shown the way forward by working together, and this partnership sends a clear message that illegal entry will not be tolerated, while offering a practical, humane way forward for those who arrive to the UK via illegal routes. It has saddened me to see Rwanda so terribly misrepresented and traduced in recent weeks. It is another example of how all too often, critics not only do not know what they are speaking about, but seek to vilify another country that has a good track record when it comes to refugees and stepping up to international responsibilities.</p> <p pid="b291.1/7">Rwanda is a safe and secure country with an outstanding track record of supporting refugees and asylum seekers. Indeed, we are proud that we are working together, proud that the UK is investing in Rwanda and helping that great country to thrive, and proud that those who are relocated to Rwanda will have an opportunity to thrive as well. They will be given generous support, including language skills, vocational training and help with starting their own businesses or finding employment, but I am afraid that the usual suspects, with the blessings of <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members, have set out to thwart and even campaign against these efforts and, with that, the will of the British people.</p> <p pid="b291.1/8">It would be wrong to issue a running commentary on ongoing cases, but I would like to say this: this Government will not be deterred from doing the right thing, we will not be put off by the inevitable last-minute legal challenges, and nor will we allow mobs to block removals. We will not stand idly by and let organised crime gangs, who are despicable in their nature and their conduct&#8212;evil people&#8212;treat human beings as cargo. We will not accept that we have no right to control our borders. We will do everything necessary to keep this country safe, and we will continue our long and proud tradition of helping those in genuine need.</p> <p pid="b291.1/9">Many of us have met refugees, both abroad and on British soil, and listened to the stories that are frankly chilling and heartbreaking. It suits Opposition Members to pretend that those on this side of the House do not care, but as you referred to in the earlier point of order, Madam Deputy <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, on this side of the House such accusations are a grotesque slur. What is truly chilling is listening to opponents going on about how awful this policy is while offering no practical solutions while lives are being lost.</p> <p pid="b291.1/10">Helping to develop safe and legal routes to this country for those who really need them is at the heart of this Government&#8217;s work. Having overseen efforts to bring to the UK thousands of people in absolute need, including from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, Syria, Afghanistan and Ukraine, I am the first to say that controlled immigration, including by refugees, is good and outstanding for our country, but we simply have to focus on supporting  those who need it most, and not those who have picked the UK as a destination over a safe country such as France. It is no use pretending that those people are fleeing persecution when they are travelling from a safe country.</p> <p pid="b291.1/11">Our capacity to help is not infinite, and public support for the asylum system will be fatally undermined if we do not act. The critics of the migration and economic development partnership have no alternative proposal to deal with uncontrolled immigration. As on so many other issues, the Labour party and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNP">SNP</a> are on the wrong side of the argument. With their arguments, we would see public trust in the system only being corroded. That is irresponsible and utterly indifferent to those who we seek to help and support.</p> <p pid="b291.1/12">I have always said that I will look at all proposals to reduce illegal migration and illegal entry to our country, even those that Opposition Members might put forward, although we are still waiting for them. [Interruption.] Fundamentally, <a href="/mp/?p=25301" title="Our page on Stuart McDonald - 'the hon. Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East (Stuart C. McDonald)'">Stuart C. McDonald</a> and others do not think there is a problem, which is why they do not have a solution. They still stand for open borders&#8212;pure and simple. Meanwhile, this Government want to get on with not just delivering what the British people want, but reforming our systems so that they are firm and fair for those who pay for them and those who need our help and support.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b293.0/1">This is a shambles; it is shameful, and the Home Secretary has no one but herself to blame. This is not, and never has been, a serious policy, and she knew that when she chartered the plane. She knew that among the people she was planning to send to Rwanda on that plane were torture and trafficking victims, that she did not have a proper screening process in place and that some of them might be children. Can she confirm that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> itself withdrew a whole series of those cases on Friday and yesterday because it knew that there was a problem with them, and that even without the <a href="/glossary/?gl=199" title="Also referred to as the ECHR, the European Court of Human Rights was..." class="glossary">European Court of Human Rights</a> judgment, she was planning to send a plane with just seven people on board, because she had had to withdraw most of the cases at the last minute?</p> <p pid="b293.0/2"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> knows that there is a lack of proper asylum capacity in Rwanda to make fair decisions and that as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> says, Rwanda normally deals with only a few hundred cases a year and has only one eligibility officer who prepares the cases. There is also a lack of interpreters and legal advisers to ensure fair decisions. The Home Secretary promised that there would be extra payments to Rwanda for each person transferred, presumably to pay for the extra caseworkers and support, but she has refused to tell us how much. What is she hiding? Will she tell us now how much she promised Rwanda for each of the people she was planning to send yesterday, and how many Rwandan refugees she promised to take in return?</p> <p pid="b293.0/3">The Home Secretary knows that serious concerns have been raised about Rwandan restrictions on political freedom, the treatment of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT">LGBT</a> people, the fact that  12 refugees were shot by the authorities in 2018 for protesting against food cuts, and the fact that Afghan and Syrian asylum seekers have been returned by Rwanda. She knows that none of those concerns has been addressed.</p> <p pid="b293.0/4">The Home Secretary also knows that the policy will not work. We need action to tackle dangerous criminal gangs who are putting lives at risk, and she knows that her policies will not achieve that. That is not their objective. If it was, she would not have asked the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Crime_Agency">National Crime Agency</a>, whose job it is to target the criminal gangs, to draw up 20% staff cuts&#8212;that is potentially 1,000 people being cut from the organisation that works to tackle the gangs. Can she confirm whether she has asked the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCA">NCA</a> to draw up plans for staff cuts?</p> <p pid="b293.0/5">If the Home Secretary was serious, she would be taking seriously the fact that the Israel-Rwanda deal ended up increasing criminal people trafficking and smuggling and that her plan risks making things worse. If she was serious, she would be working night and day to get a better joint plan with France to crack down on the gangs and to stop the boats being put into the water in the first place, but she is not, because her relationship with French Ministers has totally broken down.</p> <p pid="b293.0/6">If the Home Secretary was serious about tackling illegal economic migration or cutting the <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">bills</a> from people in hotels, she would speed up Home Office decision making so that refugees can get support and those who are not can be returned home. Instead, the number of decisions has totally collapsed from 28,000 to just 14,000 a year&#8212;fewer than Belgium and the Netherlands, never mind Germany and France. She is so badly failing to take those basic decisions that she is trying to pay a country thousands of miles away to take them for us instead. How shameful does that make us look around the world if our Home Office cannot take those basic decisions?</p> <p pid="b293.0/7">The Home Secretary knew about problem after problem with her policy. She knew that it was unworkable and unethical and that it will not stop the criminal gangs, but she still went ahead and spent half a million pounds chartering a plane that she never expected to fly, and she still wrote a &#163;120 million cheque to Rwanda with a promise of more to come, because all she really cares about is picking fights and finding someone else to blame.</p> <p pid="b293.0/8">This is not a long-term plan; it is a short-term stunt. Everyone can see that it is not serious policy; it is shameless posturing and the Home Secretary knows it. It is not building consensus; it is just pursuing <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">division</a>. It is government by gimmick. It is not in the public interest; it is just in the Government&#8217;s political interest, and along the way they are prepared to trash people&#8217;s lives, our basic British values of fairness, decency and common sense, and the reputation of our nation.</p> <p pid="b293.0/9">Our country is better than this. We have a long tradition of hard work and stepping up to tackle problems&#8212;not offloading them&#8212;to tackle the criminal gangs who put lives at risk, and to do right by refugees. That is what the Home Secretary should be doing now, not this shambles that is putting our country to shame.</p>            </div>

Actually the UK intelligence community are working together to tackle the people smugglers upstream, and we are investing in upstream programmes to tackle the people smugglers.</p> <p pid="b295.1/2">I have more to say on this subject, of course. <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members keep speaking about asylum seekers who have travelled from Iran, Iraq and other countries, but of course, they have come from France&#8212;a safe country. They have not come from Iraq; they have come from France. In the same way, the right hon. Lady said that people have come from Syria; they have come from France and they have paid people smugglers.</p> <p pid="b295.1/3">Opposition Members do not claim that it is immoral to send people back to European countries for their claims to be considered there. Their logic seems to be that Rwanda is a wonderful country that is good enough to host international summits and world dignitaries, but not to relocate people there, as our global partnership does.</p> <p pid="b295.1/4">Opposition Members know that people are dying in the channel, but they simply do not have a single workable solution between them. They are choosing sides while the Government are committed to pioneering a way forward. They are clutching at straws when they speak about money, but of course we cannot put a price on lives being lost. We believe in saving lives and breaking the people smuggling model.</p> <p pid="b295.1/5">On the legal claims that I think the right hon. Lady was referring to&#8212;pre-action protocol and national referral mechanism claims&#8212;I do not remember her making those points with that synthetic hypothetical rage when she occupied my seat under a previous <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a>. That Government brought in Acts and powers, including the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Asylum_Act_1999">Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality,_Immigration_and_Asylum_Act_2002">Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002</a> and the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, to remove people with no legal basis to be in this country. These are the same powers that we are using to remove individuals with no legal right to be in this country, and of course these are exactly the same powers that, only recently and again today, she was saying could be used if we had not left the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU">EU</a>.</p> <p pid="b295.1/6">Yet again, the right hon. Lady talks about the policy being unworkable and extortionate, but it cannot be both, because clearly, as we have said from the outset, this is a partnership based on working with Rwanda. If I may say so, there is nothing more inhumane than   turning a blind eye to those who are being smuggled not just across the channel but in lorries, and we have a global collective responsibility to work with international partners, on which the Labour party has clearly shut the door firmly.</p>            </div>

It does nothing to stop smugglers and it inflicts serious harm on victims, despite the Home Secretary&#8217;s cloud cuckoo land description of it. We wholeheartedly welcome the cancellation of this flight, and we condemn the reckless approach that the Home Secretary has taken to taxpayers&#8217; money and, more importantly, to the rule of law.</p> <p pid="b296.3/2">May I take a moment to commend the lawyers involved for their incredible work in the face of some utterly inappropriate commentary from the top of Government? Will the Home Secretary tell her colleagues to heed the   call from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Society">Law Society</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Council">Bar Council</a>, and stop attacks on legal professionals who are simply doing their job?</p> <p pid="b296.3/3">It is not the lawyers who caused this flight to be cancelled nor any court; this flight was stopped because of the stench of yet more Government illegality. [Interruption.] It was. Even the most ardent supporters of this dreadful policy must recognise that there is, to put it mildly, massive dubiety over its lawfulness. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR">UNHCR</a>, the guardian of the refugee convention, is clear that this is in breach of it. To seek to press ahead before the courts have concluded that issue either way was a reckless waste of taxpayers&#8217; money and shows again this Government&#8217;s total disregard for the rule of law.</p> <p pid="b296.3/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> should call this off now, and wait for that Court ruling. That is all we are asking for in the meantime. She should start answering the basic questions that we did not get answers to on Monday, such as about oversight, age assessments, and screening for torture survivors and trafficking victims. This is a dreadful mess.</p> <p pid="b296.3/5">Inevitably, this pitiful policy failure will now, wrongly, be blamed by the usual suspects on the European convention on human rights, so will the Home Secretary recognise what the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> previously said about the convention being a &#8220;great thing&#8221;? Will she recognise its importance for devolution, for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday">Good Friday</a> agreement and for the trade and co-operation agreement, and call off the agitators in her party who want the UK to follow Russia and Belarus through the exit door and on to pariah state status?</p>            </div>

Of those people, who had been travelling in these small boats&#8212;these unseaworthy vessels&#8212;seven were women, one was a teenager and one was a seven-year-old child. In addition, up to 166 are feared to have lost their lives or are missing across the channel: people who were safe already, in France. Overnight, many of my constituents have been in touch with me anguished at developments that have occurred to stop effective action to tackle the crossings. May I urge my right hon. Friend to continue to do everything possible to bring an end to these dangerous journeys, and ask her what representations she has received from the Labour party supporting action to bring these crossings to an end and save lives?</p>            </div>

I have spent a great deal of time both in my hon. Friend&#8217;s <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> and with her, and with the professionals in her constituency&#8212;not just in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Force">Border Force</a> or on the frontline on the coast, but in her local authority&#8212;who do a great deal of work when it comes to housing, providing sanctuary and providing support. We should take this moment to pay tribute to them, because they are on the frontline day in and day out, it is fair to say. I also want to commend them for the way they work with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> officials and our operational teams.</p> <p pid="b298.1/2">My hon. Friend speaks very strongly and powerfully about the lives that have been lost, and I think the House should recognise that this is not just about those crossing the channel. It is about those crossing the Mediterranean, going through European countries and sometimes even those going through parts of Africa and the Sahel. The conditions are absolutely appalling. On that journey I have just spelt out&#8212;from north Africa and the Sahel, crossing the Mediterranean and going to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU">EU</a> member states&#8212;the EU member states are safe countries, and this is the model that we have to break.</p> <p pid="b298.1/3">It is a fact&#8212;we know this through intelligence work and the UK intelligence network&#8212;that a lot of those gangs are based in European member states. While I cannot speak in more detail about the wider work that has taken place, a lot of good, solid co-operation led by this Government has spurred action in EU member states to deal with the smuggling gangs, go after the smugglers, and ensure they are prosecuted.</p>            </div>

I will just finally say clearly that we are in touch with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=199" title="Also referred to as the ECHR, the European Court of Human Rights was..." class="glossary">European Court of Human Rights</a>, because we want to see its judgment and decision in writing, which we have not had yet.

The moral response would be to provide safe and legal routes for those people who are exercising their legal right&#8212;their legal right&#8212;to seek asylum. The Government do not even have a basic monitoring and safety process in place for this ugly policy. The monitoring committee promised in their memorandum of under-standing with Rwanda is still not going to be set up for several months. She is not even exercising the most basic care. Is that because she knows full well that, if she did, no decent committee or procedure would ever agree to trade refugees in this despicable way?</p>            </div>

That is a fact, and every country around the world is speaking about it, not just in Europe, but over in America&#8212;even the American Administration are looking at similar policies. Tackling illegal migration requires new solutions. That is effectively what we are doing, because we know that existing approaches have not worked. It means that we work with all our counterparts, which is the right thing to do; it also means that change is needed.

In fact, before the elections, a good deal of work was under way to take UK-French partnership and co-operation to a new level. That work is under way right now; just last Friday, our two teams came together to move it forward under the instruction of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Government">French Government</a>  and, obviously, my instruction as Home Secretary. It looks not just at improved co-operation, but at moving into territory in which the French Government had previously been slightly more hesitant to work with us on more co-operation. A great deal of work is under way&#8212;let me give my right hon. Friend that assurance.</p>            </div>

This is not the same agreement as the country that she mentioned has in place with Rwanda; it is a migration and economic development partnership. We are investing in the people who will be removed to Rwanda; they will not only be housed and taken care of, but have the opportunity to rebuild their lives. That is fundamental to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Rwanda">Government of Rwanda</a> and the resettlement policies that they already have successfully in place. The hon. Lady cannot compare this policy to any previous policy whatever. It is important that we continue with it so that we can not only demonstrate, in quarters, that it will work to break up the people smuggling model, but show that we can provide new opportunities in safe countries around the world.</p>            </div>
