                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p class="" pid="b.890.2/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.890.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House <br><strong>regrets</strong> the Government's recent statement outlining the eligibility criteria for Gurkhas to reside in the United Kingdom; <br><strong>recognises</strong> the contribution the Gurkhas have made to the safety and freedom of the United Kingdom for the past 200 years; <br><strong>notes</strong> that more Gurkhas have laid down their lives for the United Kingdom than are estimated to want to live here; <br><strong>believes</strong> that Gurkhas who retired before 1997 should be treated fairly and in the same way as those who have retired since; <br><strong>is</strong> concerned that the Government's new guidelines will permit only a small minority of Gurkhas and their families to settle whilst preventing the vast <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; <br><strong>is</strong> used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a>; <br><strong>further</strong> believes that people who are prepared to fight and die for the United Kingdom should be entitled to live in the country; <br><strong>and</strong> calls upon the Government to withdraw its new guidelines immediately and bring forward revised proposals that extend an equal right of residence to all Gurkhas.</p> <p pid="b.890.2/3">I am particularly pleased to be leading in this debate since my county of Hampshire has a long and intimate association with the Gurkhas and the Gurkha museum is based in Winchester, next door to my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>. The museum is a remarkable celebration of this remarkable brigade, and I recommend it to any Member.</p> <p pid="b.890.2/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gurkha">The Gurkha</a> regiments have provided extraordinary service to this country since 1815, when the first Gurkhas entered service with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company">East India Company</a>, which had been impressed by their fighting prowess as opponents in the Nepal war. The company took the eminently pragmatic view that if we found it hard to beat them, we had better hire them. During the first world war, the Gurkhas fought in France, the Suez canal, Mesopotamia&#8212;that is, Iraq&#8212;and Gallipoli. During the second world war, the regiments took part in the campaigns of north Africa, Italy, Greece, Malaya and Burma.</p> <p pid="b.890.2/5">After the war and Indian independence, the Gurkha regiments split between the Indian army and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army">British Army</a>. Our British regiments saw service in the 12-year Malayan emergency, the Falklands, Kosovo, Bosnia, East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan. The Gurkhas have a deserved reputation for effectiveness, bravery and loyalty. Given that remarkable history, it is perhaps surprising that until 2004 it was difficult if not impossible for foreign and Commonwealth members of the armed forces and Gurkhas to obtain settlement and British citizenship at the end of their service.</p> <p pid="b.890.2/6">The view before 2004 seemed to be that Gurkha rights were governed by the tripartite agreement of 1947 between Britain, India and Nepal, which stated that a</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.890.2/7">"Gurkha soldier must be recruited as a Nepali citizen, must serve as a Nepali citizen, and must be resettled as a Nepali citizen".</p> <p pid="b.890.2/8">We should pay tribute to the Gurkha welfare campaign and to <a href="/mp/?m=1701" title="Our page on Ann Widdecombe - 'the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe)'">Miss Widdecombe</a>, who I do not believe is <a href="/glossary/?gl=144" title="Of a female MP, sitting on her regular seat in the House. For males, &quot;in..." class="glossary">in her place</a> today, for raising the issue in 2003 both in parliamentary questions and in two Adjournment debates. We should also pay tribute to my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=2011" title="Our page on Charles Kennedy - 'the Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Mr. Kennedy)'">Mr. Kennedy</a> for pushing the issue at <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s questions.</p> <p pid="b.890.2/9">In 2004, <a href="/mp/?m=1810" title="Our page on David Blunkett - 'the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett)'">Mr. Blunkett</a>, who was then the Home Secretary, set out changes to the immigration rules so that all those with at least four years' service in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM">HM</a> forces could apply for settlement in the UK after discharge. It is important that we recognise that crucial precedent. However, one key stipulation discriminated against Gurkhas compared with other foreign and Commonwealth troops, namely that they had to be discharged on or after <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase>. There were some exceptions, but the fundamental rule was there.</p> <p pid="b.890.2/10">The rationale was simply that 1997 was the point at which the Gurkha regiment moved from its base in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> to the UK, following the handover of Hong Kong to China. That was never, frankly, the dividing line that some in Government seemed to think. One has only to look at the areas in which the Gurkhas served in the last 100 years to see that they were an integral part of the British armed forces. That decision led to some ridiculous and shameful anomalies. In a famous case, the Victoria Cross holder, Honorary Lieutenant <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tul_Bahadur_Pun">Tul Bahadur Pun</a>, was initially refused indefinite leave to remain for having inadequate ties to the United Kingdom. Indeed, veterans of Malaya, the Falklands, the first Gulf war and long service veterans who were seriously ill were all refused entry. The standard reason given was that they had failed to demonstrate strong ties to the United Kingdom.</p> <p pid="b.890.2/11">A landmark in the recent history of the issue was the judicial review of the Limbu case by the honourable Mr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Blake">Justice Blake</a> on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-30">30 September 2008</phrase>. Mr. Justice Blake found that the policy regarding Gurkhas was unlawful and should urgently be revisited. He noted the apparent concerns of the Ministry of Defence concerning the attitude of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Nepal">Government of Nepal</a>, but pointed out that they were not based on evidence. Instead, Mr. Justice Blake cited the honouring of an historic debt, and quoted the military covenant as follows:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.890.2/12">"Soldiers will be called upon to make personal sacrifices&#8212;including the ultimate sacrifice&#8212;in the service of the Nation. In putting the needs of the Nation and <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a> before their own, they forego some of the rights enjoyed by those outside the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces">Armed Forces</a>. In return, British soldiers must always be able to expect fair treatment, to be valued and respected as individuals, and that they and their families will be sustained and rewarded by commensurate terms and conditions of service."</p> <p pid="b.890.2/13">Mr. Justice Blake added his own comment:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.890.2/14">"Rewarding long and distinguished service by the grant of residence in the country for which the service was performed would, in my judgment, be a vindication and an enhancement of this covenant."</p> <p pid="b.890.2/15">I agree.</p>            </div>

Although I believe that we ought to give serious consideration to extending the criteria to people who have served in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army">British Army</a> or armed services, today's motion is specifically limited to the Gurkhas because of the long history involved. Moreover, I remind the hon. Gentleman of what I said about the history of the Gurkha regiments. Some of those who served in the Gurkhas and who went into the Indian army regiments after independence would not necessarily benefit from our proposal&#8212;although, frankly, the age of the people involved means that the question is no longer of practical relevance. However, if Ministers are able to find any members of the Brigade of Gurkhas who went into the Indian army after independence and who are still alive, I would be delighted.</p>            </div>

They must now have at least three years' continuous lawful residence in the UK during or after service, and close family ties in the UK. They must also have at least a level 1 to 3 award for gallantry, leadership or bravery, 20 or more years of service, or a chronic or long-term medical condition. There were some other exceptions for Gurkhas who did not fulfil those criteria, but many hon. Members want to speak so I will not go into them.</p> <p pid="b.893.5/3">However, to make the point that I want to make, I shall deal with just one example from the list of criteria that I have set out. The 20-year rule seems to me to be a key discriminator, as so many Gurkhas&#8212;and especially private soldiers and riflemen&#8212;serve just 15 years. Only officers would have achieved 20 years of service&#8212;something that some Labour Member might find surprising, given what I am sure is their desire to treat officers and men equally. That criterion is five times as long as the period for which a foreign and Commonwealth soldier must serve to be granted settlement in the UK.</p> <p pid="b.893.5/4">What does this new package mean in practical terms? The Government say that 4,000 ex-Gurkhas and 6,000 spouses and children will be able to enter&#8212;in other words, a total of 10,000 people. Lawyers acting for the campaign say that, to their knowledge, the total would be more like 100. What if we were to extend the pre-1997 rights on a equal footing with those after 1997? The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> is on record as saying that 100,000 people could enter.</p> <p pid="b.893.5/5">Who should we believe? When I was an economic journalist, I was always very suspicious of well rounded numbers, and hon. Members may note that the Minister's estimate of our proposed policy is precisely 10 times as big as his estimate of his own policy&#8212;which, in turn, is a nice round 10,000. Let no one accuse the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> of failing to decimalise.</p> <p pid="b.893.5/6">However, we see the same cavalier attitude to figures when we look at costs. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> has spoken in various interviews about a potential extra cost of &#163;1.5 billion, but during today's <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s questions the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister">Prime Minister</a> put that at &#163;1.4 billion. The Government cannot even get their own story straight to within the nearest &#163;100 million.</p>            </div>

In fact, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> estimate was based on a five-year-old figure for the number of Gurkha pensioners in Nepal of 36,000. We know from parliamentary answers from the Ministry of Defence that there are currently just 26,500 Gurkha pensioners, so even under the Home Office's own preferred methodology, the total, including dependants, would be 75,000 not 100,000, but that makes the assumption that every single one of those discharged servicemen would want to move.</p>            </div>

Members of that community are very much valued and appreciated, but the situation is producing pressures locally. Major Dewan, the chairman of the British Gurkha Welfare Society, which is based in Farnborough in my constituency, has made it clear that of the 291 Gurkhas who are waiting to come to this country immediately, 80 per cent. will come to Farnborough. That means 1,000 people. My local authority tells me that it cannot cope. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has any plans to help us. He said that he would set out some practical propositions to deal with what might happen in particular areas of the country, where the Gurkhas are hugely valued, but where the move might cause a problem for local services&#8212;</p>            </div>

If he had come to some of the immigration debates that we have had, he would be aware that we <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> have been putting forward proposals that would ensure that local authorities are better able to identify their needs, and better able to have the resources to meet them. I entirely accept that his is a legitimate concern, but I am afraid that it applies much more widely than merely to the narrow issue of the Gurkhas. For example, in areas of east London such as Newham, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a> register is far out of line with the census results, which are used as a basis for the distribution of public finance, so I am entirely sympathetic to that point.</p> <p pid="b.896.5/2">There is a fundamental point that a number of my hon. Friends have already made, and have anticipated. We can play the numbers game, and if we do, the Government will lose the argument, because their figures, frankly, are fantasy. However, the numbers are not the point. The point is simple: Gurkhas have given an unconditional commitment to this country. They have put their lives on the line for us time and again. More than 45,000 Gurkhas have died in the conflicts of the two world wars, fighting for our freedoms and our way of life. They represent a tradition of service to Queen and country that is almost without equal.</p> <p pid="b.896.5/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brigade_of_Gurkhas">The Brigade of Gurkhas</a> alone is the proud recipient of no fewer than 26 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Crosses">Victoria Crosses</a>&#8212;the highest medal, of course, for valour in combat that our nation can award.

We have to consider the implications for the developing world of our policies, not just in this area but in others, too. I am sure that that was something of which Ministers were aware when they made the settlement for those who gave service after 1997. The hon. Gentleman should also bear in mind that Nepal is not as dependent on the remittances from Gurkha soldiers as popular folklore in the UK sometimes suggests. The population of Nepal&#8212;and this was reported to Mr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Blake">Justice Blake</a> in a submission&#8212;is about 25 million, and its gross domestic product is substantial. Workers' remittances from Nepalese working abroad in India, the Gulf and elsewhere are very substantial indeed, so I am satisfied, to answer the hon. Gentleman directly, that if we rose to our obligations, there would be no corresponding bad effect on Nepal. His concerns can therefore be allayed.</p>            </div>

Are we really the sort of people who know the price of everything, and the value of nothing&#8212;who reward loyalty with a rebuke? Are we to say that people who are prepared to fight and die for our country are not good enough to live in it? This debate is not just about the Gurkhas. It is the about the sort of people we are.

Friend from the mouth of the Thames.</p> <p pid="b.899.2/2">Not only can the Government say that they pay tribute to the Gurkhas, but we can prove by our record that we are doing so. Let me explain the background to this case. It has been said that the guidelines that we published on Friday have undermined support for the Gurkhas, but I do not accept that that is so. Gurkhas are recruited in Nepal, and remain Nepalese citizens throughout their service with the brigade, in line with the wishes of the Nepalese Government. Before 1997, the Brigade of Gurkhas was based in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, and following the handover of Hong Kong to China, the regimental base was moved to the UK, which put the brigade on the same footing as Commonwealth soldiers.</p> <p pid="b.899.2/3">The service given by members of the brigade is chiefly recognised through the arrangements made to support them following their discharge. Gurkhas who served on or after <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase>&#8212;the date of the handover of Hong Kong&#8212;are eligible to transfer to the armed forces pension scheme. Gurkhas who were discharged before that date, and who served for at least 15 years, receive a pension under the Gurkha pension scheme. In 2000, the value of those pensions was doubled. On top of that, the amount of the pension is regularly reviewed and increased in accordance with annual inflation in Nepal&#8212;for information, in 2009 it was 14.1 per cent. plus an additional 20 per cent. for those over 80. The pension received by ranks up to corporal is comparable to the salary of an engineer in Nepal, and it may be of interest to Members to know that the pension received by those of the rank of sergeant and above is equivalent to or greater than that of a <a href="/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a>.</p>            </div>

                    <blockquote><p>Dear Rt Honorary Mr Phil Woolas, Minister of Immigration    As an ex-Gurkha, I feel victimisation of institutional discrimination, I think you are trying to derail (deceits) the point of Equality here.  Gurkhas are asking for Equal Rights to other comrades of the same Forces.  It is totally unfair and sad to see that you seem trying to treat the Gurkahs of the same British Forces with double standard.  Probably that's what the HQBG had/s been suggesting you but whose ultimatum responsibility to imply the law of Equality Act, but not to alienate or discriminate the Gurkhas?  Do you think the whole world will believe in what you preach if you do not treat the Gurkhas on the ground of Equality properly?     To your point of comparing the pension to the salary of an Engineer, have you got a record of how many Gurkhas or their children have been able to hold the high positions in Nepal or elsewhere comparing to the Engineers&rsquo; children? Or given the nearly 200 years of service in the British Army, how many Gurkhas or their generation are there in Neapl in the richest or brainiest list?  My point is the money...</p><cite>Submitted by Shobh gurung</cite>

Gentleman's party has been consistent on the Gurkhas&#8212;I have recognised that&#8212;in contrast with the Conservative party, which I shall come on to with great relish. I am setting out the position to tackle the accusation that, somehow or other, the Government have not treated the Gurkhas fairly or properly, although I accept that he has not made that accusation, and I am grateful to him. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> May I finish setting out the background, then we can deal with the second point, which is the subject of the debate?</p> <p pid="b.899.4/2">In addition, for those Gurkhas who did not serve long enough to qualify for a pension, the Ministry of Defence gives just over &#163;1 million annually to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurkha_Welfare_Trust">Gurkha Welfare Trust</a>&#8212;hence the discrepancy between the two figures raised by parliamentary questions, which the Under-<a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence, my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1556" title="Our page on Kevan Jones - 'the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)'">Mr. Jones</a> addressed. The charity provides financial, medical and community aid to alleviate hardship among former Gurkhas. I do not accept the accusation that Gurkhas discharged before 1997 have been abandoned by the Government, and it is offensive to senior members of the armed forces who are charged with the welfare of ex-soldiers of all regiments. It is against that background that decisions on settlement rights for ex-Gurkhas must be seen. It was never the case that Gurkhas joining up did so in the belief or expectation that they would get settlement rights. There was no expectation that they would be permitted to settle in the United Kingdom on discharge, and that was not part of the terms and conditions under which they enlisted.</p> <p pid="b.899.4/3">Notwithstanding that, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> chose in 2004 to introduce settlement rights for Gurkhas, in particular to bring their treatment into line with that of Commonwealth soldiers. Before that date, a discharged Gurkha had no route to apply to settle in the United Kingdom on the basis of service. In 2004, the then <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> announced that those discharged after 1997, when the regimental base moved to the UK, would enjoy the same settlement rights as others&#8212;that is, after four years of service and if they apply for settlement within two years of their discharge.</p> <p pid="b.899.4/4">However, the then Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> went further than that. He recognised that there would be former Gurkhas who were discharged before 1997 when the base was still in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> who would have made outstanding or exceptional contributions and for whom settlement in the United Kingdom would be desirable. He therefore announced that the cases of Gurkhas discharged before 1997 would be considered on a discretionary basis. Guidance was issued to immigration case workers on how to consider applications from Gurkhas applying to settle on this basis. Since these rules were introduced, we have welcomed to our country about 6,000 Gurkhas plus their families.</p>            </div>

The decision was retrospective to <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase>. Those who have been granted settlement include significant numbers&#8212;3,500 from the previous period, before the 1997 cut-off, and 2,500 post-1997. The hon. Gentleman's point is valid in that regard.</p> <p pid="b.900.1/2">We come to the crux of the matter. The judicial review was launched against the background of that policy. It challenged both the 1997 so-called cut-off date and the guidance under which decisions were made on pre-1997 cases. The question has been asked, not least in the media today, where the guidelines come from. The answer is that they come from the instruction of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court">High Court</a> to clarify the guidance pre-1997.</p> <p pid="b.900.1/3">On the 1997 cut-off, the judge, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Blake">Justice Blake</a>, said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.900.1/4">"The identification of July 1997 . . . was not an arbitrary or irrational consideration."</p> <p pid="b.900.1/5">He went on to say that</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.900.1/6">"it cannot have been irrational or unjustifiable to distinguish July 1997 as the date after which rights as opposed to discretion to settle in the United Kingdom accrued."</p> <p pid="b.900.1/7">So we have a judgment from the judge that the 1997 cut-off date is fair and lawful&#8212;<i> [Interruption. ] </i>His exact words were "not . . . irrational". The Government changed the situation in 2004, which has allowed 6,000 Gurkhas plus their families&#8212;some 3,500 from before 1997&#8212;to settle in this country.</p> <p pid="b.900.1/8">No Government from 1948 to 2004 allowed the settlement of Gurkhas in the UK. From 1948, when the brigade was established on its modern-day footing, until 1997, the number of Gurkhas who were given naturalisation in the United Kingdom was five&#8212;five ex-Gurkhas. It is against that background that the motion from the official <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> claims that the current Government have betrayed the Gurkhas and implies that we should get rid of the 1997 cut-off&#8212;something that no Government did from the second world war until <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair">Tony Blair</a> did it in 2004.</p>            </div>

He spoke about the judicial review. Let me clarify the figures. It has been claimed and reported that the Gurkhas and their supporters believe that the new guidelines will give settlement to only about 100 Gurkhas. That figure is an estimate, from the campaign, of the total number from the outstanding 1,500 appeals&#8212;1,350 of which are from Nepal, and the remainder in country&#8212;of how many will be granted under the guidelines. It is not the estimate out of the total number of 36,000 Gurkhas plus their families to whom reference has been made, so it is disingenuous to suggest, as others have, that only 100 would qualify under the new guidelines.</p>            </div>

My officials will consider these applications on a case-by-case basis, as we are bound to do, to assess whether they fall to be granted settlement under the revised guidelines.</p> <p pid="b.902.4/2">Subsequent to that, the Border Agency is required under the immigration rules to consider all the relevant factors of an individual's circumstances to see whether the person should be allowed to stay in the United Kingdom.

The point about the potential resource implication of this is important, and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> referred to it earlier at Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s <a href="/glossary/?gl=25" title="Question Time is an opportunity for MPs and Members of the House of Lords..." class="glossary">Question Time</a>. Let me be clear because the numbers have been challenged, I think unfairly. I looked at the numbers after I had met representatives of the campaign. I cannot base the advice of the Government on the "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4_News">Channel 4 News</a>" fact indicator; I have to base it on the best information available to us, and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has explained the derivation of the figures. But it is an important point. The Government have never said that 100,000 people would apply and would get settlement. We have to look, as we do under all immigration law, at the potential, and our best estimate is that it is 100,000. It may be more, it may be less.</p>            </div>

There has been a lot of progress today. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> accepted that Ministers would review the 1,300 cases and that that would be concluded by <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-11">11 June</phrase>.

Both those statements are welcome. I do not expect an immediate answer from my hon.

Friend for that comment; he brings us to the crux of the debate. For the benefit of those who wish to contribute to the debate, I will depart from my written speech. We have two worries about abolishing the pre-'97 cut-off date. First, we are concerned that it would set precedents for other groups, and, as one would expect, I have taken legal advice on that. We fear that the precedent would be set for people from Commonwealth countries who had served in the armed forces, and that that retrospective decision from pre-'97 would apply to other groups. We have to be clear that if a blanket decision was made on Gurkhas for pre-'97 there would be no unintended consequence for other groups who may have the right to challenge on the basis of common law and public law. With that there is the consequential impact on budgets, and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> referred to the &#163;1.4 billion. I do not recall using the &#163;1.5 billion figure, but if I did I withdraw that. Our estimate is &#163;1.4 billion, and I remind the House that that would come from the defence budget.</p> <p pid="b.903.2/2">Secondly, if right hon. and hon. Members are honest with themselves&#8212;I hope that we all are&#8212;the truth is that none of them knows how many would apply. But as the former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Defence_Staff">Chief of the Defence Staff</a> said in <i> The Independent on Sunday, </i>the Government have to live in the real world, not in the world of emotion. Therefore the staged approach that we have taken, as described by the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8212;this is the crux of my right hon.

My right hon.

I think that when people hear the argument, if they are fair-minded they will accept it. I am sorry to go back to the judge, but this is the derivation of the argument. He said that the old guidelines were unclear&#8212;we therefore had to make them clearer&#8212;on the basis of quality and quantity of service. The criteria that we have proposed provide for a range of circumstances that cover both points. It is the case that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of people who have 20 years' service are below commissioned officer rank. Although it is true that soldiers in the private ranks join for 15 years and people who intend to be officers join for 20 years, it is also true and not contradictory that many people serve more than 15 years, but a majority of those who serve 20 years are below the rank of commissioned officer. In any event, that is only one criterion.</p> <p pid="b.905.3/2">The other criteria, which include, as we know, a generous expansion of the guidance on people who have disabilities and, importantly, people who have drawn a pension in the past because of a disability or an injury, reflect the quantity and quality of service. I put those criteria before the House in the belief and expectation that more Gurkhas and their families will be granted settlement rights in our country, and with the review that my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1664" title="Our page on George Howarth - 'the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth)'">Mr. Howarth</a> asked for and has just pressed me on. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Indeed, it was part of the written ministerial statement, but I recognise the feeling of the House and we will review the situation.</p> <p pid="b.905.3/3">However, we as a Government must bear in mind the potential implication of that precedent for other groups of people and for the resources of our country, not to mention the point that my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1850" title="Our page on David Drew - 'the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)'">Mr. Drew</a> made about the future of Nepal itself, which seems not to have featured much in the debate.</p>            </div>

Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)'">Chris Huhne</a>. We tabled an <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>, which the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> misunderstands; it would improve the motion in small but important ways that I shall come to later. This is a day for the whole House to speak up for the Gurkhas and for the overwhelming <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of the people of this country who want to support them. We will vote for the motion, because our analysis of the Government's position is very simple: the Government are wrong.</p> <p pid="b.906.5/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> spent a lot of time talking about history. Let me give him a bit more history, because he does not seem to understand it. In 1997 the terms of the Gurkhas' engagement changed radically; their headquarters were moved to this country and they started doing tours of duties in this country; and so some of their children started to be educated in this country. Therefore, to say that a Government whose term had ended before that change happened should somehow have changed the rules to recognise that is simply absurd&#8212;but that was the assertion that the Minister made in his speech.</p> <p pid="b.906.5/4">The Minister also asked what has changed since the&#8212;very wise&#8212;words of my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1735" title="Our page on Keith Simpson - 'the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)'">Mr. Simpson</a> in 2004. What has changed is the court decision. The Government were taken to court and lost the case, so for the Minister to say that nothing has changed since then is also absurd.</p> <p pid="b.906.5/5">I assure hon. Members that a Conservative Government would scrap this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a>'s plans for the Gurkhas, although I hope that the House passes the motion so that we can proceed more rapidly. I have rarely seen such an outpouring of public outrage as the one that has engulfed the Minister since he made his ill-fated decision last week.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.907.2/1">That is a faintly ridiculous point. Clearly, the future of the Brigade of Gurkhas is extremely important, but the way in which the hon. Gentleman phrased his point suggests that he is not interested in having the constructive debate that we need.</p> <p pid="b.907.2/2">The current situation is part of a long-running set of mistakes by the Government on the issue. They have been wrong on it ever since the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court">High Court</a> made its ruling last year. We have heard a lot about Mr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Blake">Justice Blake</a>, but his judgment came down to this central point, when he said that the Gurkhas' service is worthy of</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.907.2/3">"an unquestionable moral debt of honour" from the British people. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> have been absolutely clear about that. The following day, my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a> said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.907.2/5">"Yesterday the courts ruled that Gurkhas who want to come and live in Britain should be able to. They risked their lives for us and now we must not turn our backs on them. I say to the government... Do not appeal this ruling. Let's give those brave Gurkha soldiers who defended us the right to come and live in our country."</p> <p pid="b.907.2/6">Many Gurkhas outside this House today, and millions more of their supporters throughout the country, will be not only appalled by the Government's position but puzzled about how they arrived at it, so it is worth investigating why the Government find themselves in this position. The underlying reason they have to behave in such an unfair and ungenerous way to the Gurkhas is that the Government's overall immigration policy has been out of control for many years. Why are they trying to stop Gurkhas coming here? It boils down to the fact that they have failed to stop so many much less deserving people from coming here and, what is worse, staying here.</p> <p pid="b.907.2/7">A long list of failures on immigration policy has driven the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> to his present uncomfortable position. The Government failed to deport the killer of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Lawrence">Stephen Lawrence</a>; they failed to remove the suspected terrorist <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Qatada">Abu Qatada</a>; only one third of released foreign prisoners have been deported; and only 14 employers of illegal immigrants have been prosecuted since 2008.</p> <p pid="b.907.2/8">Then there is the wider point about immigration numbers. The Government used to say that there was no obvious upper limit on immigration, and in their headlong retreat from that disastrous policy, they are now in the ridiculous and immoral position of trying to keep out some of the best and most loyal servants of this country.</p>            </div>

Those of us who are on our side of the debate are also on the side of the Gurkhas. We are on their side because ours is the only fair solution to the problem that the Government face. How would we do it? We would fit their applications into the general framework of our proposed immigration policy. As the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> knows, we would build on the points-based system with our proposal for a limit on the number of work permits issued every year, so that we have a properly controlled immigration system.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.909.5/1">As I said, as the hon. Lady would have heard had she been listening, there would be a presumption in favour&#8212;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Let me deal with this now. One of our small differences with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> is that, although we support the motion, there is a problem that it appears to allow that right to anyone, even if, for example, they have committed serious crimes. I am sure that the hon. Member for Eastleigh would not wish people like that to be given the right to come to this country. Our <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> would ensure that we retained controls over individuals whom we might not wish to come here. I cannot believe that that would be a controversial point even among Government Members.</p> <p pid="b.909.5/2">One of the key questions that remains is about the numbers who are eligible to apply. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> tried to convince us that the figures from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> and the Ministry of Defence were unquestionable. I am afraid that those of us who spend large parts of our lives dealing with Home Office figures, and those of my colleagues who deal with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOD">MOD</a> figures, will not share his confidence that absolutely everything that comes out of those Departments is necessarily of the highest calibre. At various stages, the MOD has estimated that the total numbers eligible will be 22,000; it has mentioned other figures, but I will stick with the lower one because it helps the Minister's case. The British Gurkha Welfare Society estimates that the total would be 30,000. On top of that, of course, there are the dependants, because we all agree that we need to be fair to them as well. In their statement last week, the Government estimated that there are about 1.5 dependants per Gurkha&#8212;4,000 soldiers with 6,000 dependants&#8212;whereas the British Gurkha Welfare Society estimates that there are three dependants per Gurkha.</p> <p pid="b.909.5/3">This is a significant area where any Government would need to do some proper research to find the truth. Even on those two estimates&#8212;there are others; this morning, I heard the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC">BBC</a> reporting a figure of 40,000 potential qualifying ex-Gurkhas&#8212;the numbers eligible to come here could vary between 55,000 and 120,000; those are the absolute maximums. Before we settle on a final policy, the Government need to sort out that confusion and make a sensible assessment of how many people will actually apply to come here. Over the past couple of years, about 1,300 have made applications. If that is the realistic level of demand, then our proposals would solve the problem on day one; certainly, the number of visas on offer would be significantly higher than that. We can be clear that a Conservative Government would grant visas under the new tier of the points-based system to give the Gurkhas what they deserve: the right to settle in this country with their immediate dependants. The lower the number who apply, the faster we can right this wrong, which I am sure hon. Members in all parts of the House want to do.</p> <p pid="b.909.5/4">I know from my own talks with Gurkha campaigners that they want this matter solved quickly&#8212;in fact, now&#8212;so I have a suggestion for the Minister. The Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Bill is currently passing through Parliament. It has completed all its stages in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a> and will come to this House in the next few weeks. The long title of the Bill includes the words</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.909.5/5">"To make further provision about immigration and asylum".</p> <p pid="b.909.5/6">It would therefore be perfectly in order for the Minister to introduce our proposal&#8212;or, indeed, any other proposal that he wants to introduce&#8212;in that Bill so that it could be on the statute book within the next few months. If his proposal is sensible&#8212;if he wishes to adopt ours, or anything similar&#8212;my party will support him, and I guess that the Liberal Democrats would also want this problem to be solved as quickly as possible. This debate is about playing fair with the people we should let into this country while at the same time, in wider immigration policy, doing much better in stopping the people who should not be allowed in to this country.</p> <p pid="b.909.5/7">Over the course of the past few days, the Minister has managed to attract <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> from all parts of the spectrum. In looking at the various options put forward by Members in all parts of the House, I am particularly struck by one that we have already touched on, which points out that only officers benefit from the Government's proposals. It must strike the House as the most exquisite irony that in the week that the Government publish their <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_Bill">Equality Bill</a> they produce another policy which favours the officer class and tramples all over the other ranks. I cannot imagine that many Labour Members came into politics to support such divisive nonsense.</p> <p pid="b.909.5/8">There are two genuine concerns that need to be addressed, the first of which was raised by <a href="/mp/?m=1850" title="Our page on David Drew - 'the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)'">Mr. Drew</a>. If the vast <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of former Gurkhas were to leave Nepal over a very short period, that would do huge damage to the Nepali economy and the structure of governance in Nepal. I do not believe that that huge exodus would happen, and I take the points that the hon. Member for Eastleigh made about that, but we need to bear the possibility in mind.</p> <p pid="b.909.5/9">The second concern, which we have not discussed much, is that those who arrive here need to be properly assimilated into British society as easily and comfortably as possible. I can draw on my experience in saying that, because my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> has a fast-growing Nepali community. They are model citizens, from the dedication of the children at school to the big efforts made by adults to play a key role in wider civic life, while demonstrating their justifiable pride in their history and culture. That is a lesson in how cohesion and integration can work in this country, and above all, what has happened in my constituency is a tribute to the wholly admirable people that the Gurkhas are.</p> <p pid="b.909.5/10">Before I close, I should mention that the changes proposed in the amendment that we tabled were designed not to change the sense of the motion in any way but to tidy it up. I have made the point that expressing a presumption of the right to come rather than an absolute right would alleviate one of the potential problems. That shows that it is not very difficult to change the motion in minor ways that give a basis for practical legislation that the Government could introduce as soon as they wanted, and that a Conservative Government would introduce as soon as they were able.</p> <p pid="b.909.5/11">I urge the Minister once again to stop digging the hole in which he finds himself. He has created a rare degree of unity inside and outside the House, and it is a united front against his policy. He must now listen to the voices of those who support the Gurkhas, respect the strength of feeling throughout the country and reverse this unfair, ungenerous and divisive policy. The Gurkhas should not be made the scapegoat for the failure of the Government's immigration policy. I support the motion.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.911.2/1">I come to this issue as somebody who was a child in the period following the second world war. Pretty well everybody I knew&#8212;my father, my mother, uncles, neighbours&#8212;served in the armed forces and fought in the war in some capacity. Not many people spoke much about their wartime experience&#8212;it was a kind of convention that people did not go on in great detail about what had happened to them. However, one of my clear recollections is the extent to which those who served with Gurkhas were full of praise for their fierceness in battle, their loyalty to the UK and their contribution in the second world war. That is the background to my own sentiments towards the Gurkhas.</p> <p pid="b.911.2/2">More recently, I have had some direct experience of Gurkhas. Since the conflict in Iraq began, I have travelled there on three occasions either as Chairman of a Committee, as a guest of the Government or, on one occasion, with my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1525" title="Our page on Ann Clwyd - 'the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)'">Ann Clwyd</a>. On all those occasions, I encountered Gurkhas who were serving out there, sometimes working in a private capacity for private security companies and in some cases with the armed forces. I have nothing but respect for the Gurkhas.</p> <p pid="b.911.2/3">It was for that reason that I joined forces with my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1774" title="Our page on Martin Salter - 'the Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter)'">Martin Salter</a> yesterday and tabled an <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> that has attracted the signatures of 70 right hon. and hon. Members, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of whom, although not all, are Labour Members, including my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1674" title="Our page on Keith Vaz - 'the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)'">Keith Vaz</a>, the Chairman of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> on Home Affairs. I have been around the House long enough to know that an amendment tabled by a Back-Bench member of the governing party is unlikely to be selected when the Government and the official <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> have tabled amendments. However, I thought that it was important to send the Government a message that I, and those who signed the amendment, did not believe that they had given the Gurkhas the honour and recognition that they deserved.</p> <p pid="b.911.2/4">In an <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> on my hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, I indicated that progress had been made in the past 24 hours. At <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s questions, my right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister">Prime Minister</a> announced that the 1,350 cases that are currently in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> will be dealt with by <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-11">11 June</phrase>. He went on to say&#8212;my hon. Friend the Minister confirmed this from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a>&#8212;that the lessons that could be learned from those cases would be examined and a statement made about the outcome of that examination. Shall I use the word "review"? In particular, it was said that there would then be a review of the impact that those findings would have on all cases if the new guidelines were applied. That is basically the point that we had reached at the time of my intervention.</p> <p pid="b.911.2/5">Since then, the Home Secretary has written to my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West, a co-signatory of my amendment, and it might help the House if I read out some of the letter. She wrote:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.911.2/6">"We have committed to reviewing around 1,350 individual cases where there is an outstanding application by <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-11">11 June</phrase>. We will inform the House immediately thereafter of the impact of the guidance on those cases, and the numbers of cases which fell to be granted, the number refused, and the number where we have requested and are still awaiting further information from the applicant. In the light of lessons learned from this we will review carefully what further policy changes may be required. I am happy to confirm that we will begin this work before the summer recess."</p> <p pid="b.911.2/7">Again confirming a point that my hon. Friend the Minister made earlier, she continued:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.911.2/8">"Subsequent to that, UKBA is required under the immigration rules to consider all the relevant factors of an individual's circumstances to see whether the person should be allowed to stay in the United Kingdom. I cannot foresee circumstances in which these honourable men, who have served the UK so well, would ever be removed from the UK."</p> <p pid="b.911.2/9">Prior to receiving that letter and the developments of the past 24 hours, it had been my intention to abstain on both the Government amendment and the Liberal Democrat motion. In the light of those assurances, I now feel that my party's Government have proved to be an honourable Government, and they are a better Government than they were 24 hours ago for that. I will support them.</p>            </div>

In a bitter irony, soldiers from that battalion returned to Shorncliffe on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-19">Sunday 19 April</phrase>, 10 days ago&#8212;just five days before the Government made their announcement&#8212;from a tour of duty in Afghanistan. It was a tour of duty in which, yet again, they demonstrated their heroism and valour, and during which they lost two of their comrades. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-04">Tuesday 4 November</phrase>, Rifleman Yubraj Rai received a gunshot wound from enemy fire. He received medical treatment at the scene but he died a short time later from his wounds. Only a few days later, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-15">Saturday 15 November</phrase>, Colour Sergeant Krishnabahadur Dura was taking part in a road move in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_Qala">Musa Qala</a> district of Helmand, when the Warrior infantry fighting vehicle in which he was travelling was struck by an explosive device.</p> <p pid="b.913.0/2">Those Gurkha soldiers made the supreme sacrifice for our country. When they died, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> told the House that we should never forget the sacrifice that they had made, just as he did some three hours ago in respect of the death of the Welsh Guardsman who lost his life yesterday. However, those words must be accompanied by deeds.</p> <p pid="b.913.0/3">When the Gurkhas returned to Shorncliffe 10 days ago, they were warmly welcomed home by the rest of my constituents. The welcome home that they got from the Government was the decision that we are debating this afternoon. The Gurkhas are a most cherished part of the community that I represent in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>. To say that they are held in high regard would be a gross understatement.</p> <p pid="b.913.0/4">Two weeks ago, I attended and spoke at the launch of an appeal in Folkestone for the erection of a statue dedicated to the Gurkhas. Hundreds of people turned up: Gurkhas themselves, including their two holders of the Victoria Cross, our highest award for valour&#8212;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tul_Bahadur_Pun">Tul Bahadur Pun</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachhiman_Gurung">Lachhiman Gurung</a>&#8212;civic dignitaries of the area and many local people, who wanted to show the affection and esteem in which the Gurkhas are held locally. We are proud to have them as members of our local community. We are not proud of the Government's decision, which we are debating this afternoon.</p>            </div>

I therefore do not need to go into any great detail about them, but I want to say a word about one, perhaps the most objectionable&#8212;the 20 years' service requirement and the extent to which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford pointed out, it favours the officer class.</p> <p pid="b.914.3/3">The Under-Secretary now shakes his head. His rebuttal of the point was that more other ranks than officers had served for more than 20 years before 1997. <i> [Interruption.</i><i> ] </i>He tells me that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Borders and Immigration said that, and I am more than happy to accept the correction. It was an entirely bogus point and disingenuous statistic, which characterises the Government's approach. Most other ranks did not serve for 20 years before 1997; most other ranks were not allowed to serve for more than 15 years before 1997.</p> <p pid="b.914.3/4">I ask hon.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.916.0/1">I did mention the letter from the Home Secretary, but my right hon. Friend was talking to our right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1572" title="Our page on Joan Ryan - 'the Member for Enfield, North (Joan Ryan)'">Joan Ryan</a> and did not hear me. However, whether the letter comes from the Home Secretary or the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Borders and Immigration and whether it is written in blood, wax or whatever, I have such an enormous immigration case load that I have difficultly accepting that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> and the immigration and nationality directorate can process 1,500 cases by June. I do not think they can do it.</p> <p pid="b.916.0/2">Let me turn to the crux of what I want to say, which is about the decision of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> on Home Affairs last year. We wrote a letter to the Minister for Borders and Immigration on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-04">4 November</phrase> last year&#8212;this also goes to the question of speed&#8212;that reflected a unanimous decision by the Committee after taking evidence from him and from campaigners from the Gurkha community. The letter said four things.</p> <p pid="b.916.0/3">First, the Committee recognised the historic debt of gratitude that is owed to the Gurkhas. We called them brave, loyal and distinguished. Secondly, we agreed that the current Government policy of distinguishing those Gurkhas who retired before <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-01">1 July</phrase> from those who retired afterwards has, in effect, created two classes of Gurkhas. We considered that there was no reason for that distinction. Thirdly, we concluded that the treatment of the Gurkhas was unfair, given the discrepancy between that and the settlement rights afforded to other Commonwealth citizens. Fourthly, we asked the Minister to bring forward regulations to replace the regulations that have already been declared unlawful and to extend the rights of settlement to all the Gurkhas who had applied for settlement. That was absolutely in keeping with the motion that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> have tabled. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee">The Committee</a> came to a unanimous decision&#8212;I see one Committee member, <a href="/mp/?m=1507" title="Our page on Bob Russell - 'the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)'">Bob Russell</a>, <a href="/glossary/?gl=145" title="Of a male MP, sitting on his regular seat in the House. For females, &quot;in..." class="glossary">in his place</a>. I will now need the speech of a lifetime from the Under-<a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence, my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1556" title="Our page on Kevan Jones - 'the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)'">Mr. Jones</a>, to convince me that the Government's position has changed since the motion that they have tabled. We need to move much further.</p> <p pid="b.916.0/4">My final point relates to the issue raised by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1850" title="Our page on David Drew - 'the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)'">Mr. Drew</a>. The view that there has to be an impact assessment for other countries&#8212;in this case Nepal&#8212;when Parliament takes a decision on immigration policy is ludicrous. I came here as a first-generation immigrant, and for a country that at one stage ruled a third of the world suddenly to start talking about having impact assessments is bizarre. My hon. Friend the Minister for Borders and Immigration will know the Bangladeshi community in Oldham. He will know, as will anyone who knows the south Asian community, that just because those people are settled in Oldham, that does not mean that they do not have connections with Bangladesh or that they do not send remittances back to their country of origin. It is a spurious argument that is being developed. I have received no representations from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Nepal">Government of Nepal</a>, but to be perfectly frank, would we take into consideration representations made by India about the points-based system? I do not think so, because India is against the points-based system, yet we have already told India that we are going to implement it anyway.</p> <p pid="b.916.0/5">For those reasons I am still minded to support the Liberal Democrat motion, despite the speech from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>, which almost put me off. However, the Lobbies belong to everybody and, in keeping with the unanimous decision of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs_Committee">Home Affairs Committee</a>, I think that that is the honourable thing for me as the Chairman to do, given that I signed the letter to the Home Secretary.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.917.0/1">I am delighted to follow <a href="/mp/?m=1674" title="Our page on Keith Vaz - 'the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)'">Keith Vaz</a>, particularly as he has just announced that he is going to keep the faith.</p> <p pid="b.917.0/2">The weakness of the Government's case is surely illustrated by the fact that in the course of this debate the Home Secretary has felt it necessary to send a letter to a Labour <a href="/glossary/?gl=47" title="A Backbencher is a Member who holds no official position in government or..." class="glossary">Back Bencher</a>, apparently without having the courtesy or the foresight to send it to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> who was addressing the House. It is something of an insult to the House that our proceedings should be treated in that way. Like the right hon. Gentleman, I have been here for 22 years, and in that time I do not remember letters being passed around the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Benchers">Back Benchers</a> of any Government in that way.</p> <p pid="b.917.0/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> did his best to put a brave face on the decision that he has to justify, but the truth is that it is a shabby decision. That is why he sounded both unconvinced and unconvincing. I approach the matter as an issue of principle. We have had a lot of exchanges about calculations and potential numbers, but at the bottom of this debate there lies a question of principle. It seems to me that we have not only a moral obligation to recognise those who risk their lives and who, as we heard in an eloquent speech by <a href="/mp/?m=1587" title="Our page on Michael Howard - 'the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)'">Mr. Howard</a>, often make the ultimate sacrifice, but a moral obligation to fulfil. All the speeches that we have heard this afternoon have mentioned that moral obligation. When we come to vote in a little while, there will be a chance to fulfil that obligation in a way that the recipients undoubtedly deserve.</p> <p pid="b.917.0/4">Earlier today the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> spoke about a stage-by-stage process, as if the Government had embarked upon a carefully planned journey, in which the rights of Gurkhas were to be enhanced over a period of time by a series of carefully considered measures. However, that is simply not true. Changes have been made during the lifetime of this Government because of the pressure in the House and the pressure outside it. We are only here today because Mr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Blake">Justice Blake</a> partially upheld the proceedings for judicial review in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court">High Court</a>. If he had not done so, does anyone think that the Government would have brought forward proposals of any kind whatever? They were compelled to do so because of that judicial decision.</p> <p pid="b.917.0/5">Like others, I have a quarrel with the so-called qualifications. As others have dealt with them, including the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe, I do not need to deal with them further, except to say this. Although there may be persons other than officers who serve for 20 years, the curious symmetry between the 20-year period that was chosen and the length of service of officers has undoubtedly figured in the minds of those members of the public who have made it clear in their droves that they support the campaign to extend rights of residence to deserving Gurkha soldiers.</p> <p pid="b.917.0/6">Another point that I do not think anyone has made, but which is worth drawing to the House's attention, is this. There appears to be a qualification based upon receipt of a decoration. That is a qualification based not on being brave, but on being recognised as having been brave. Anyone who has been engaged in conflict will say that some of the bravest and most selfless acts of heroism are committed by people who never receive any recognition of any kind whatever. The proposed qualification seems to me to be wholly artificial. The bravery lies in volunteering and in fulfilling a six-month tour of duty in Afghanistan.</p>            </div>

That is why I regard with some suspicion the suggestion that, were the criteria set out by the Government to be relaxed, there would be an inundation of people that would be deeply damaging to public services and things of that kind. If we introduce people into this country who are motivated, who want to be employed and who will be good citizens, that will be entirely for the benefit of this country. Look at the impact that the Asians who were expelled from east Africa have made in the time that they have been in the United Kingdom. That is the precedent that we should be concerned about, and no other. And that is as good a reason as any to vote for the motion.</p>            </div>

However, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> cannot have it both ways. The changeover in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> did not just appear on the horizon; they knew many years beforehand that it was coming, and that it would affect the Gurkhas&#8212;and, therefore, their terms and conditions&#8212;but they did nothing about it.</p> <p pid="b.918.2/2">The real reason that I want to speak is my admiration for and involvement with the Brigade of Gurkhas during my two years as the Defence <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> with responsibility for Gurkha terms and conditions. I was proud to introduce and agree the new terms and conditions for Gurkhas, which are the best that they have ever had. I argued strongly in the Department for the extra money needed to support those new terms and conditions. I believe that the sum was &#163;30 million a year, given the massive increase in pensions.</p> <p pid="b.918.2/3">A number of issues need to be considered in relation to any decision to extend entry rights to former Gurkhas, some of which have already been alluded to today. It was this Government who changed the immigration rules and allowed many Gurkhas to come in. We have heard that about 6,000 have settled here. We have also heard arguments about the figures. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ministry_of_Defence">The Ministry of Defence</a> team that dealt with Gurkha issues was superb, and I always had trust in what it provided me with as a Minister. When we look at the potential outcomes of such a decision, it is important that we do so with an open mind.</p> <p pid="b.918.2/4">It is possible that not all the Gurkhas who have served in the armed forces would decide to come to this country. However, the evidence so far is that all those who have been able to do so have done so, and I suspect that a large proportion of the 36,000 to 40,000 who have served in our armed forces would come here, with their family members. We are talking about a large number of ex-Gurkhas and their families coming to this country.</p> <p pid="b.918.2/5">The point was made about the effect of such a decision on other nationalities, including members of the Indian army. When we were dealing with the compensation for the far east prisoners of war, an appeal was lodged in London on behalf of between 40,000 and 50,000 former members of the Indian army from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_and_India">Pakistan and India</a>. If we were to open the door, I do not believe for a moment that many of them would not seek to apply to come to this country, as well as many other ex-service personnel from other Commonwealth countries. I do not see how we could have a policy that says that it is okay for Gurkhas who have served this country to come here, but not okay for those others. I do not see how such a policy could legally stand up.</p>            </div>

I dealt with many cases in which the Ministry of Defence needed legal advice during the various campaigns that were going on. I received very strong legal advice on this matter, and I adhered to it. There is a potential for such a decision to affect many tens, possibly hundreds, of thousands of people. I accept that we do not actually know how many people might be affected, but perhaps that is the point. There is a potential for such a change to affect many people, and we need to understand what that would involve.</p> <p pid="b.919.1/2">I also want to talk about the effect on Nepal. The loss of that many people could be a major problem. First, there could be a brain drain, because the people who get through the Gurkha test and training are Nepal's best people, and they would be leaving the country to come here. That would clearly have an impact on their society, both socially and economically. Secondly, Gurkhas' pensions are currently paid in Nepal, but they would be paid here following such a decision. That would result in a significant loss of income in Nepal, which is one of the world's poorest countries. We need to take account of that as well. It is all very well to say that we need to stick with the principle and allow people in, but such a decision would have an impact.</p>            </div>

It would not be seen as a good amount of money in this country, so there would then be a campaign for pre-1997 Gurkha pensioners to get the same pension as current Gurkhas and, therefore, the rest of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army">British Army</a>. That would be a significant extra cost as well. So there is another implication of which we need to take account.</p> <p pid="b.920.1/3">The fact is that when we agreed the terms and conditions&#8212;it took a number of years, as those matters were complex and difficult, and involved a lot of time and effort at the Ministry of Defence, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> and elsewhere&#8212;they were widely welcomed by serving Gurkhas because there was a massive change in their circumstances. I announced the change and they were delighted that it was going to happen. We took that decision as a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a>, and we should not forget that this Labour Government made that massive change to Gurkha terms and conditions, which has given the best pay and pensions that the Gurkhas have ever had here.</p> <p pid="b.920.1/4">On the immigration changes, if I have any criticism of the Home Office, it is that it has perhaps been trying to be too helpful in many ways and has tried to change things to allow more people in. As a result, it gives weight to the argument of those who want more changes to allow more people to have the opportunity to come to this country as well. There would be major implications for housing, jobs, benefits and health support if tens of thousands of people could come here and did so, although we do not know whether they would. That is a major consideration and we need to take account of it.</p> <p pid="b.920.1/5">There are significant implications involved with changing the policy. Legally, we must go back to the point I made earlier: the advice I received was that such a change could open the door to many tens of thousands of other people coming to this country and we could not hold the line just for the Gurkhas, however much we may want to do so. In fairness, anyone who has fought for this country would have the same legal right as the Gurkhas. The fact that someone might have fought in the second world war and had in the past a chance to apply to come to this country would not cut much ice because the legal precedent would have been set. That is the key part of this debate.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.921.0/1">During my brief and much curtailed comments, I shall highlight several real-life cases in the knowledge that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will have to hear what is the real plight faced by those very brave Gurkhas.</p> <p pid="b.921.0/2">I start by mentioning a true story of real heroism. Bhim <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasad_Gurung">Prasad Gurung</a>, who lives in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, was posted to Brunei with the 6th <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth">Queen Elizabeth</a>'s Own Gurkha Rifles in 1964. During a jungle operation, Mr. Gurung and a small group of his comrades were ambushed by Indonesian guerrillas. They did not have their weapons, as they had been locked away for the night in a store.</p> <p pid="b.921.0/3">During the fierce and one-sided firefight that ensued, seven Gurkha soldiers were killed and the same number severely wounded. Mr. Gurung and the survivors somehow regained their rifles and took the fight to the enemy, but unfortunately they ran out of ammunition. Their wireless radio was destroyed and they could not call for help or support. Alone in the jungle, out of ammunition and surrounded by their dead and wounded comrades, they never gave up hope.</p> <p pid="b.921.0/4">Mr. Gurung and his comrades roared out the famous Gurkha war cry, "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayo_Gorkhali">Ayo Gorkhali</a>!", which means, "The Gurkhas are coming!" Through their shouts of defiance, they terrified the enemy so much that, despite Mr. Gurung and his brothers in arms being outnumbered and without ammunition, their enemy retreated.</p> <p pid="b.921.0/5">That is just one example of heroism displayed by those brave Gurkha soldiers. It is truly a disgrace, then, when they are forced to come to this country and live in destitution after their retirement from <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a>.</p> <p pid="b.921.0/6">Many of the brave Gurkhas who have settled in Reading have found themselves living in abject poverty. Former Gurkha Ash Bahadur Gurung served in the 6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles for 16 years. He lives with his wife and their 12-year-old daughter in a small, rented house paid for out of the basic salary of his son, who is in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army">British Army</a>. He struggles to make his Gurkha pension of &#163;25.67 last the week. He says that the main problem he faces is getting his daughter&#8212;she goes to Reading girls' school&#8212;to school, which costs &#163;3 a day on the bus. That is a lot of money out of a &#163;25 pension. Mr. Gurung's wife is not entitled to use the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a>, so she had to buy a pair of crutches and a wheelchair from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross">Red Cross</a> after one of her legs was amputated after having cancer.</p> <p pid="b.921.0/7">To treat anyone in such a way is dreadful, but to do it to the brave Gurkhas is a national disgrace. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> criteria that were put out recently are immoral. I could not have put it better than <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_Lumley">Joanna Lumley</a>, who said that she is ashamed of this Government. Today, the whole nation is ashamed of them.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.922.0/1">We have had a good and lively debate this afternoon. My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1565" title="Our page on Christopher Huhne - 'the Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)'">Chris Huhne</a> started it off by reminding the House that we owe a debt of honour, which we are repaying with the penny-pinching mentality of an accountant, as the Government try to get away with the least that they think they can under the terms of the law court ruling. I do not know whether it will prove that they have done enough today, but I am perfectly clear that they have approached the task with as mean a spirit as they could. In the bandying of numbers between my hon. Friend and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, we saw the absurdity of the Government's case.</p> <p pid="b.922.0/2">I do not assert that the 1,350 whose cases are currently at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> would be the end of the matter, but it is nonsensical for the Government to total up the maximum number and then bandy it about as representing those who are likely to wish to take advantage of such a right. We do not devise our immigration policies with any other part of the world, the free movement of citizens within the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU">EU</a>, or the policies that we adopt for Commonwealth countries, on the basis that every person who could avail themselves of them is likely to do so. It is a completely illogical approach to the issue.</p> <p pid="b.922.0/3">I regret hearing Ministers do that, as they have the right to pat themselves on the back for what they did in 2004, and for their improvements to the conditions of Gurkhas, to which <a href="/mp/?m=1609" title="Our page on Derek Twigg - 'the hon. Member for Halton (Derek Twigg)'">Derek Twigg</a> referred. By doing what they did in 2004, and creating the entitlement for those who have served since 1997, they have crossed the line in principle. They have done the big thing, and are being dragged kicking and screaming on the smaller issue of who served before 1997. By creating mythological numbers, they are putting a stain on that for which they deserve congratulation.</p> <p pid="b.922.0/4">I do not accept the logic of the 1997 threshold as those on the Conservative and Labour Front Benches seem to accept. The fact that the Gurkhas were garrisoned in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> until 1997 is of no real significance. The Government seem almost to have looked for something that happened in 1997&#8212;they might as well have asked who won the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA">FA</a> cup in that year, and hung everything around that. The point is of no significance. The Gurkhas were members of the British armed forces, and were sent to serve in different parts of the world, and it is of no consequence whatever that they happened to be garrisoned in Hong Kong. They cannot settle in Hong Kong&#8212;their service was not to Hong Kong or China, but to Britain. That gives them the moral entitlement to settle in the UK, and that is what we are debating this afternoon.</p>            </div>

I very much agree with him that the most objectionable of the criteria that have been laid down is the one relating to the 20 years of service, for exactly the reason to which many hon. Members have alluded.</p> <p pid="b.923.1/2"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chairman">The Chairman</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs_Committee">Home Affairs Committee</a>, <a href="/mp/?m=1674" title="Our page on Keith Vaz - 'the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)'">Keith Vaz</a>, reminded us of the excellent letter that the Committee sent, which was signed by all of its members, from across the parties. He rightly urges us to take with "a pinch of salt" a letter from the Home Secretary that has been catapulted into this debate at this stage. He was also right to say that the suggestion that we should conduct an impact assessment on the effect in Nepal is bizarre. I say that because surely it was when the Government allowed those who have served since 1997 the right of settlement that those who would have the most direct impact on the Nepalese economy were allowed to come to this country. The young ones coming to this country with many years of wage earning ahead of them will have far more impact than a relatively small number of those whose service took place long ago.</p> <p pid="b.923.1/3">The hon. Member for Halton asked why should we now open the doors to those who served in world war two. My father served throughout that war and he is now 90. The number of 90-year-olds across the world who are likely to wish to migrate to this country need not trouble or detain us for very long. That is a completely ludicrous way of examining the issue.</p> <p pid="b.923.1/4">As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North-East_Fife">North-East Fife</a> says, it was a shabby decision to respond to the court ruling in quite this mean and minimalist way. I agree very much with what <a href="/mp/?m=1875" title="Our page on Andrew MacKinlay - 'the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)'">Andrew Mackinlay</a> said in his interventions. It is perfectly clear to me that the public in this country are of the overwhelming view that we owe a debt of honour to the Gurkhas. When I see on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=5" title="The order paper is issued daily and lists the business which will be dealt..." class="glossary">Order Paper</a> the range of names of hon. Members who have signed the various amendments, it is perfectly clear to me that opinion in this House across the board is also that we owe a debt of honour to the Gurkhas.</p> <p pid="b.923.1/5">The hon. Member for Thurrock was right when he said that sooner or later the Government will end up losing this argument, having to give more ground and be seen to have done so with appalling bad grace, having been dragged kicking and screaming every inch of the way despite having had this opportunity to recognise the obligation and to do something in the spirit in which we owe. People who are prepared to fight and die for the United Kingdom deserve the right to settle and live in this country, and the sooner we recognise the debt of honour and repay it honourably, the sooner we will acknowledge these brave Gurkhas and everything that they have done for this country over 200 years. I commend the motion to the House.</p>            </div>

I disagree with some of the things that she says, but I do not question her integrity.</p> <p pid="b.924.0/2">As the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> responsible for veterans, it is my privilege to take responsibility for Gurkha welfare. Two weeks ago I visited Nepal, where I met Gurkhas and the various organisations that support their welfare there. The impression given in the last week that Gurkhas are living in abject poverty and being ignored in Nepal is not the case. It is important that we consider the various types of pension. The service pensioners, as my hon. Friend the Minister for Borders and Immigration said, receive a pension that can be accrued after only 15 years service, so people can retire at 33 on a full pension. For privates, that means &#163;173 a month. That is equivalent to the wage of a skilled technician. For an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCO">NCO</a>, the payment is &#163;240 a month, and Government Ministers in Nepal earn &#163;234 a month.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.925.0/1">I will come to that point in a moment.</p> <p pid="b.925.0/2">There are 26,000 Gurkha pensioners in Nepal. My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1674" title="Our page on Keith Vaz - 'the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)'">Keith Vaz</a> asked how we know how many there are; we know because we are paying them pensions. Some &#163;54 million is therefore going into the Nepalese economy. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFID">DFID</a> budget is only &#163;56 million. Some have suggested that taking that money out of the Nepalese economy will have no effect, but that is definitely not the case. It is important to recognise that the service pensioners whom I met last week would not claim that they did not have a good standard of living.</p> <p pid="b.925.0/3">I am sad that lawyers representing the Gurkha Army Ex-Servicemen's Organisation, which is involved in the campaign, failed to turn up for the meeting that I had arranged with them. They later issued a press release condemning me for not meeting them. The House should be careful when it comes to some of the tactics being used in this debate.</p> <p pid="b.925.0/4">I asked some of the service pensioners whether they would want to come here, and most said, "No, but our families and children would." For those service pensioners, this Government have a proud record. The increase in their pensions over the past 10 years has been some 500 per cent., and we cannot just ignore the financial contribution that that makes to the economy of Nepal.</p> <p pid="b.925.0/5">The second group of pensioners is the welfare pensioners, who did not accrue the service pension&#8212;like many who serve in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army">British Army</a>&#8212;because they did not serve for long enough. In this country, they get no pension at all, but in Nepal they are paid the equivalent of &#163;30 a month through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurkha_Welfare_Trust">Gurkha Welfare Trust</a>, which the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOD">MOD</a> supports through a grant of more than &#163;1 million a year and through administrative support. Then there is the medical care. According to some of the commentators, the Gurkhas want to come here because they lack medical care in Nepal, but that is not the case. Service pensioners and welfare pensioners get free primary health care, and their secondary health care is supported by the trust. Service pensioners, who already get a good income, also get a percentage of the cost of their care paid.</p> <p pid="b.925.0/6">On the subject of the Gurkha Welfare Trust, may I put on the record our thanks to those people? They are doing a first-rate job and since my visit I have given a commitment that I will review MOD support and see what else we can do to help. Those people are truly inspirational, not just because of their help for Gurkhas but because of their charity work in villages and helping the wider community in Nepal.</p> <p pid="b.925.0/7">May I address some of the points that were made in the debate. Quite clearly, the main <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> party has a problem with this issue. Over the past few days, I have been trying to work out what its policies would be. For example, on Monday <i> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun">The Sun</a> </i>declared that <a href="/mp/?m=1932" title="Our page on David Cameron - 'the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)'">Mr. Cameron</a> is now supporting the Gurkha campaign. Anyone can defy me if, after reading the article, they can say what conclusion he comes to. Today, we have heard a very clear policy. Under the regulations, there would be new criteria that allowed anyone who had served in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty">Her Majesty</a>'s armed forces to settle in the UK. That would include personnel from India, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, Malaysia, Burma, Singapore, Kenya and Rhodesia, to name but a few.</p> <p pid="b.925.0/8">My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1856" title="Our page on Chris Mullin - 'the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin)'">Mr. Mullin</a> made a very good point about the <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> track record. When the Tories had the opportunity to reward servicemen and women, they did not. In the draw-down from Hong Kong, only one in seven of the Crown officers and able personnel was allowed in. We are seeing crocodile tears, I think. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a>' policy would have an immense cost and would drive a coach and horses through the immigration policy of this country. I am glad that they have clarified that policy.</p> <p pid="b.925.0/9">Let me clear up another point about the 20 years. The idea that only officers who served would qualify is not true. They all started as privates and 55 per cent. of the people who will qualify will not be officers.</p> <p pid="b.925.0/10">The other issue that we need to clarify, which was raised by <a href="/mp/?m=1587" title="Our page on Michael Howard - 'the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)'">Mr. Howard</a>, concerns the position of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Nepal">Government of Nepal</a> and the court case. The Nepalese official who gave evidence to the court case did so in a private capacity. There was nobody there from the Ministry of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs">Foreign Affairs</a> and the Nepalese Government have not given a view about whether they support Gurkha welfare or not.</p>            </div>

As <a href="/mp/?m=1715" title="Our page on Mark Lancaster - 'the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)'">Mr. Lancaster</a> said&#8212;he speaks with authority, and I wish that his Front Benchers would listen to him more on the subject of the Gurkhas&#8212;it is quite clear that the Nepalese Government had a position of opposing Gurkha recruitment. There is some silence on that point now. Have they expressed any opinion on the court case? No, they have not. I met senior members of the Government, including the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>.</p> <p pid="b.926.1/3">May I address the issues raised by <a href="/mp/?m=1773" title="Our page on Robert Wilson - 'the hon. Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson)'">Mr. Wilson</a>. I am very concerned about the case that he raises. If he has a Gurkha constituent whose wife is not entitled to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a> help, I want to see that evidence so that we can take up that case and see what can be done to help. The hon. Gentleman also raised a good point. If people are to retire here on a Gurkha service pension, that small amount will not go very far in supporting them. There is a danger that the next position will be that we should offer retrospection on pensions to increase them to the post-1997 level. That would be a huge additional cost to the taxpayer that we must take into account when recognising that point.</p> <p pid="b.926.1/4">There has been a lot of coverage over the past few days of the way in which the Government have treated Gurkhas. May I say that I think that we have done a lot for Gurkhas and their families, and that we are continuing to do that? We should be proud of that, as it is something that no other Government have ever done. As my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has said, this is the first time ever that settlement rights have been given to Gurkhas. Before 1997, only five had been allowed to settle. That shows our commitment. However, I advise people who debate this issue to put any motion to one side and look at the facts. Over the next few days, we need to look at the detailed work that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurkha_Welfare_Trust">Gurkha Welfare Trust</a> and other bodies are doing in Nepal to support Gurkhas. We are not talking about people living in abject poverty.</p> <p pid="b.926.1/5">We have had a good debate today. Everyone in the House supports the Gurkhas and appreciates the bravery that they have demonstrated in previous wars and still show today. This Government are committed to the Gurkhas and, as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> responsible, I am committed to doing my utmost both for Gurkhas serving now and for those who served before.</p>            </div>
