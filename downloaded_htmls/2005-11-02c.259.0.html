Before turning to the substance of the report itself, I record my thanks to the members of Sub-Committee C of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Committee">European Union Committee</a> for their work in the preparation of the report; to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benita_Ferrero_Waldner">Benita Ferrero Waldner</a>, the Commissioner for External Affairs; to Mr Daws, the executive director of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Association">United Nations Association</a> in the United Kingdom; to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Jeremy_Greenstock">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</a>, the former representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations; and to Mr Douglas Alexander, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Europe, for giving evidence to the committee. I also record our particular thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, who, before joining the sub-committee as a member and assisting us with his knowledge and expertise of the subject also, as long ago as May 2004, gave evidence to the committee on the work of the Secretary-General's high-level panel of which he was a distinguished member.</p> <p pid="c.239.2/2">There was pressure to produce the report by the summer, and I am grateful to Emily Baldock, the committee clerk, and Pamela Strigo, the committee specialist, in the drafting of the report and enabling us to meet our self-imposed deadline.</p> <p pid="c.239.2/3">The report has inevitably been overtaken by the events to which it looked forward, and I know that the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, will deal with the outcome of the millennium review summit, so I do not propose to dwell too long on that myself. But it is worth looking at the report and the Government's response. In September 2005, the heads of the United Nations member states met in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> to mark the United Nations 60th anniversary. They were there to review the progress of the millennium development goals on the basis of the report commissioned from the Secretary-General, entitled <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Larger_Freedom">In Larger Freedom</a></i>, but that report went much further. It was divided into four sections, which our report tends to follow. A much larger point was, as our report states, the question of the United Nations' role in the post-Cold War world.</p> <p pid="c.239.2/4">We, as a sub-committee of the European Union Committee, were anxious to see what the European Union's role would be in that. The Secretary-General's report, <i>In Larger Freedom,</i> consisted of four main themes: Freedom from Want&#8212;the Development Agenda; Freedom from Fear&#8212;the Security Agenda; Freedom to Live in Dignity&#8212;Human Rights and Democracy; and Strengthening the United Nations&#8212;Reform of the Institutions. The sub-committee recognised at the start that the United Nations is an organisation of sovereign states. The European Union has only observer status, but we also observed, and witnesses confirmed, that among the many groups there, the European Union stands out as the most cohesive and the one that is most likely to assist in collective action. One of our recommendations, which one might have thought was a statement of the obvious, was that to ensure and endeavour to achieve a successful outcome at the summit, the European Union must advocate the case for reform, use its particular relationship with the United States and have a dialogue with countries in the other continents.</p> <p pid="c.239.2/5">The Secretary-General, in the "Freedom from Want" section of his report, urged all the UN member states to implement the global partnership between rich and poor countries. It is worth noting that the committee commended the European Union for its pre-stated commitment to increased aid. The EU is still the largest contributor to overseas development aid.</p> <p pid="c.239.2/6">We also commended the Government for having made a brave and principled decision to pick climate change as one of their key priorities for the United Kingdom's European Union and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8">G8</a> presidencies. We urged the Government to seek agreement at the conference to begin in November and proposed that a specific date for the post-2012 discussions be included in the millennium review summit draft outcome document. We would like to hear from the Government whether those discussions commenced on time.</p> <p pid="c.239.2/7">Regarding "Freedom from Fear&#8212;the Security Agenda", we urged the European Union to,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.239.2/8">"press for new principles on the application of force", and we endorsed the concept of the responsibility to protect. We are pleased that that was recognised. We also suggested that the Government should press for as much detail as possible in the conclusions regarding the setting up of a peacebuilding commission. Although the Government agreed with that in their response, one of the key issues as we see it is that it is not clear how that will relate to and work with the Security Council. It would be extremely helpful if the Minister could respond to that. We were also concerned that a definition of terrorism should be achieved at the summit. That has not happened and, with great respect to the Government, their response is set out in rather complacent terms, bearing in mind that that was a particularly important issue.</p> <p pid="c.239.2/10">Regarding the section, "Freedom to Live in Dignity", the sub-committee supported the proposal for a new human rights council which we hoped would be more effective than the existing institution. We hoped that the Government and the European Union would support the measures proposed at the summit that would strengthen the UN's human rights machinery. As we understand it, that new institution was established but, again, can the Minister give us more detail and information on the progress that has been achieved?</p> <p pid="c.239.2/11">On the reform agenda, strengthening the United Nations institutions, we always knew that reform of the Security Council was not a matter on which the member states of the European Union would be able to agree. Indeed, that proved to be the case. We also called for the Government to indicate how they believed the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a> could, in the words of the report, be revitalised and work towards the Secretary-General's reforms. The government response indicates that a working group was set up, but it does not indicate what proposals and measures the Government would advocate and be pressing in conjunction with our partners in Europe.</p> <p pid="c.239.2/12">Lastly, I draw noble Lords' attention to the fact that, while the summit achieved only partial success, the European Union itself was successful in producing a co-ordinated position at the summit. As I have already said, with the exception of the Security Council, that co-ordinated position seems to have been maintained throughout the process. By focusing on the areas of agreement, the European Union was able to contribute positively to the positive elements of the outcome of the summit&#8212;a lesson which we should perhaps consider when we sometimes discuss the desirability, or not, of having a common foreign and security policy. Failure to be able to agree on absolutely everything is no reason not to try to achieve agreement on as much as possible. The result of the summit in that regard at least suggests that those efforts were not only for Europe's collective benefit but also for the benefit of the United Nations. I beg to move.</p> <p pid="c.239.2/13">Moved, That this House takes note of the report of the European Union Committee on the European Union's Role at the millennium review summit.&#8212;(<i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Bowness">Lord Bowness</a></i>.)</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.241.0/1">My Lords, I begin by commending the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Bowness">Lord Bowness</a>, for the excellent way in which he guided EU Sub-Committee C through the various stages of the report. As the noble Lord mentioned, we also benefited from the expertise and special knowledge of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, who appeared as both a witness and a committee member and greatly assisted in the drafting of the subsequent report. I look forward to hearing his speech later in the debate.</p> <p pid="c.241.0/2">The importance of the EU/UN relationship is self-apparent. EU member states are the largest financial contributors to the UN system, as the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, mentioned. The EU pays 38 per cent of the UN's regular budget, more than two-fifths of the UN peacekeeping operations and around half of the UN member states' contributions to UN funds and programmes. Thus, in my view, the committee's report is both timely and an important contribution to the debate about the role and influence of the EU within the structures of the United Nations.</p> <p pid="c.241.0/3">Overall, as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Triesman">Lord Triesman</a>, told your Lordships' House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-10">10 October</phrase>, the resulting millennium review summit,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.241.0/4">"delivered a worthwhile package of reforms and commitments".&#8212;[<a href="/search/?pop=1&s=date:20051010+column:10+section:wms"><i>Hansard</i>, 10/10/05; col. WS 10</a>.]</p> <p pid="c.241.0/5">My own feeling is that, although there were disappointments at the September UN world summit, there were also significant advances. The noble Lord, Lord Bowness, mentioned that one of those advances was the way in which the EU member states themselves maintained a co-ordinated approach to the negotiations at the summit. I would argue that the outcome was not as disappointing as some commentators would have your Lordships believe, and I hope that the Minister, in responding to the debate, will concur.</p> <p pid="c.241.0/6">There was a strong and unambiguous commitment by all governments, of donor and developing nations alike, to achieve the millennium development goals by 2015. An additional $50 billion a year would be found by 2010 to fight poverty. There was agreement to provide immediate support for quick impact initiatives to support anti-malaria efforts, education and healthcare.</p> <p pid="c.241.0/7">For the first time, the UN agreed a clear and unqualified condemnation of terrorism by all governments,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.241.0/8">"in all its forms and manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and for whatever purposes".</p> <p pid="c.241.0/9">There was a strong push for a comprehensive convention against terrorism within a year and support for early entry into force of the nuclear terrorism convention. The Government managed to secure the adoption of the Security Council resolution calling on all countries to ban the incitement of terrorist acts, despite the failure to agree on a definition of terrorism, as the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, mentioned.</p> <p pid="c.241.0/10">UN members could not agree on a definition of terrorism that treated attacks targeting civilians and non-combatants by non-state agents as terrorist acts. The logic is that similar acts by governments are already proscribed as war crimes. Some countries insisted that the definition of terrorism should exclude "legitimate" struggles for liberation and self-determination.</p> <p pid="c.241.0/11">Although it is often said that one person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter, it is disingenuous to suggest that blowing innocent children, women&#8212;and men, for that matter&#8212;to pieces in any political cause is other than terrorism. Was the killing of more than 150 children in Beslan in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ossetia">North Ossetia</a> in September 2004 not terrorism because some of the terrorists felt that they were fighting for self-determination? I think not. Of course the world must avoid double standards, but, on the other hand, the civilised international community is entitled to say that there are lines that rational human beings should not cross, whatever the cause, whatever the war.</p> <p pid="c.241.0/12"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN">The UN</a> world summit also agreed to build a peacebuilding commission backed by a support office and a standing fund. There will also be a standing police capacity for UN peacekeeping operations. Human rights machinery is to be strengthened; a human rights council established within a year; the Convention against Corruption came into force; and a new ethics office, badly needed following the Volcker reports, will help strengthen internal oversight. There was recognition of the serious challenge posed by climate change and a commitment better to tackle <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV">HIV</a>/<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS">AIDS</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TB">TB</a> and malaria. An improved Central Emergency Revolving Fund would ensure that relief arrived more swiftly and reliably when disasters happened. The signatories reconfirmed the Monterrey consensus, in which they pledged to,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.241.0/13">"make concrete efforts towards the target of 0.7 per cent of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a> in official development assistance".</p> <p pid="c.241.0/14">Of course, the key is to turn those fine words into action. That process should be helped by a little-noted <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a>, paragraph 22a, in the outcome document, in which all UN members agree to,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.241.0/15">"adopt, by 2006, and implement comprehensive national development strategies to achieve the internationally agreed development goals and objectives, including the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals">Millennium Development Goals</a>".</p> <p pid="c.241.0/16">From now on, development strategies prepared by bodies such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank">World Bank</a> should be comprehensive and designed to achieve the development goals. That is a new concept which, it is hoped, will force a change in the behaviour of institutions and governments around the globe.</p> <p pid="c.241.0/17">Another major breakthrough was the clear and unambiguous acceptance by all governments of the collective international responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. When peaceful action proves inadequate and national governments refuse to act, the Security Council will have the responsibility to protect the innocent. The responsibility to protect, which was initially resisted by Egypt, Algeria, Pakistan, India, Russia, Cuba, Iran and Syria, was finally pushed through in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a>. The UN world summit is to be congratulated for overcoming resistance among some of its participants to the principle that people sometimes need to be protected from their own governments.</p> <p pid="c.241.0/18">Of course, the world summit was not a resounding success in all areas, as I mentioned in the case of the definition of terrorism. Secretary-General <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan">Kofi Annan</a> rightly said that it was a "disgrace" that no progress had been made on disarmament at the summit. The committee's report before your Lordships' House stated that the earlier <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPT_Review_Conference">NPT Review Conference</a> was a "disastrous failure" and that non-proliferation should have been one of the Government's priorities in New York. The Government's response to the committee's report acknowledges disappointment in that area and promises to,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.241.0/19">"find pragmatic solutions to overcome that setback and enhance the non-proliferation regime".</p> <p pid="c.241.0/20">In the dangerous world in which we now live, solutions cannot come soon enough. I hope that the Minister will reflect on the response required by the Government in this area.</p> <p pid="c.241.0/21">Post-2012 climate change commitments will be discussed at the December 2005 climate change conference, but the UN review summit itself took no decision on further international action. On both the peacebuilding commission and the human rights council, issues still remain outstanding. Progress on the issue of Security Council reform, on which the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, expended so much effort as a member of the high level panel, was non-existent.</p> <p pid="c.241.0/22">The only positive thing which could be said about Security Council reform was that the subject did not derail the whole millennium review summit, as some feared it might. Reform of the General Assembly also seems some way off. Consensus among a body with 191 member states is understandably sometimes beyond the reach of even the best diplomats.</p> <p pid="c.241.0/23">The UN millennium review summit achieved a lot but, as someone once said, there still remains a lot to be done.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.244.0/1">My Lords, before I commence, I should declare an interest in the context of this report for those Members who have not seen the report itself, in saying that the House may wish to know that my sister is UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights. Having said that, I have not consulted her at all in forming my opinions on the report.</p> <p pid="c.244.0/2">I came to the committee in the final stages of its deliberations on the report. The analysis within it is extremely pertinent to the many issues that the UK will have to grapple with in the remaining time of its presidency of the EU. In those late hours as the report was being finalised, I should extend my thanks to our chairman, the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Bowness">Lord Bowness</a>, whose wise guidance on what we should really focus on was invaluable to a new member like myself.</p> <p pid="c.244.0/3">UN summits are not always as relevant as they might be. However, given contemporary geopolitics and the state of multilateralism, both in the wider framework and within the EU itself, this summit was always going to be a testing one. In aspiring to do as much as it sought, the UN was perhaps being over-ambitious. Perhaps it should have concentrated on the critical areas of how we might actually achieve the millennium development goals&#8212;no small matter when it comes to halving extreme poverty, providing an education for all the world's children or combating the reduction of infectious diseases&#8212;rather than attempting to embrace the broader, but also deeply important, agenda of UN reform.</p> <p pid="c.244.0/4">In the committee, we too had a wide-ranging agenda in reviewing EU relations with the UN. I will confine my remarks to three areas only: the convention on terrorism, the human rights council and the reform of the UN organisational structure. In doing so, I wish I was speaking after the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, as his knowledge of matters relating to both the UN and the EU is far superior to almost anyone else in this House and therefore much of what I say may well be made redundant when he speaks.</p> <p pid="c.244.0/5">In representing the EU at the UN, and bearing in mind how much more important the EU is to the UN now, given that we contribute, as many noble Lords have said, almost 40 per cent of the regular budget, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> had particular leverage at this summit. That it was able to achieve as much as it did in the context of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDGs">MDGs</a>, and particularly in achieving agreement on responsibility to protect, is to be welcomed. However, given that the EU went into this summit in a more united position than the recent past&#8212;one only has to think back to 2002 and 2003, when EU divisions would have been rather more evident&#8212;it is to be regretted that more could not be achieved.</p> <p pid="c.244.0/6">A significant failure was the inability of the UN to arrive at a successful outcome on the convention on terrorism. Had that been achieved, it would have been of more than symbolic importance, as it would have resulted in genuine commitment on the parts of other states to meet their responsibilities in this regard. The reason we were unable to get agreement was that the Organisation of the Islamic Council, which represents 57 Muslim countries, was reluctant to agree terms whereby legitimate struggle for autonomy and/or self-determination could be made unlawful. As many of those struggles relate to Muslim populations&#8212;not least those in Palestine and Kashmir, not forgetting the plight of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Muslims">Chinese Muslims</a> or those in Russia&#8212;it was not entirely surprising that we could not succeed. So we will probably not gain agreement on this most contentious issue of our time, and that is to be regretted.</p> <p pid="c.244.0/7">We should note in the context of terrorism that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a> did indeed agree Resolution 1624, which is wide-ranging. I mention it because the Government have invested so much political capital in this resolution, recalling time and again that it is now under obligation to abide by that resolution in the context of the Terrorism Bill which is currently being debated in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>. But there is a warning here: we must be very careful not to adopt a pick-and-choose approach to international law or we will bring it into disrepute. So while our Government remind noble Lords on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> Benches of their commitments to multilateralism, they might pause to reflect on their own standards of adherence to measures for international peace and security in contemporary times. They should also note those sections of the resolution that call on states to take measures as may be "necessary and appropriate". The resolution also stresses that states must ensure that measures comply with international human rights law. I could go into detail about why I think that Resolution 1624 does not comprehensively support the Government's case, but this is not the debate for that.</p> <p pid="c.244.0/8">A further disappointment was the lack of progress on agreement for a human rights council. That was all the more disappointing as, I believe, the concern of certain developing countries that the new council would sideline them and work only to the Western agenda was predictable&#8212;and what is predictable is, to some extent, resolvable. The failure to move forward in that regard can be explained partly by the lack of dialogue between those who could see themselves losing voice through the reforms and those who would gain. With greater forward planning we might have had progress.</p> <p pid="c.244.0/9">The debate will now centre on how wide the membership of the council should be. I have some experience in that regard: in addition to the interest that I have already declared, I worked for the Commonwealth secretariat for several years and was responsible for the ministerial committee for human rights and democracy. On the whole, the Commonwealth committee&#8212;the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Ministerial_Action_Group">Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group</a>&#8212;has been quite successful. In response to violations of fundamental principles in relation to Zimbabwe and Pakistan, it was able to bring some sanctions to bear. If the human rights council is to have any influence in advancing human rights, the one lesson that we should draw from the Commonwealth is to keep the council a reasonable size to achieve coherence for oversight. Current thinking is that the council may have as many as 47 to 50 members. That should be avoided. Creating a body with a quarter of the membership of the UN will not be the recipe for achieving either consensus or common positions. An effective council must have a manageable membership, and the EU should bear that in mind, even if it has to compromise its own interests in terms of membership and numbers. In doing so it will advance the cause of human rights overall, and that must be a good thing.</p> <p pid="c.244.0/10">Finally, I come to the overhaul of the UN system itself. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Secretary-General">UN Secretary-General</a> commented two years ago that the UN was at a fork in the road: on one side lay reform and renewal and on the other lay growing irrelevance. Those sentiments expressed a growing sense of frustration among capitals that the UN could no longer just muddle along; however, that seems to be where we find ourselves and where the EU, as a significant contributor across the board, has much leverage. That it failed to achieve the required reforms will have direct implications for the UN's present accountability and future mandates. At present, the mismanagement of the Oil for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Programme">Food Programme</a> is a case in point. As the Volker report made clear, the split responsibilities between the secretariat, the Security Council and the General Assembly render the lines of accountability much more diffuse. An overhaul of the UN staffing regime is also needed, if only to clear out dead wood with a move to greater flexibility to achieve staff turnover, which would greatly benefit efficiency. A streamlined secretariat, with clearly defined and greater powers for the Secretary-General, is needed.</p> <p pid="c.244.0/11">Overall, the summit was a missed opportunity for both the UN and the EU. That we failed to achieve the radical but necessary reforms means that we will have to muddle through a bit longer. However, a debate is now under way, and we must be determined to continue pushing the reform agenda even as we hand over the EU presidency. Our responsibility as a permanent member has historically been discharged with great commitment. We look forward to renewal of that commitment towards both the UN and the EU.</p>            </div>

            </h2>


                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.247.0/1">My Lords, it could be thought that for this House to be debating a report on the European Union's role in the UN millennium review summit, which took place a little over a month ago in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a>, might be missing the bus, but I do not believe that is so. This report ranges a good deal more widely than the agenda of the summit meeting itself. It looks into what the United Nations means for the EU's emerging common foreign and security policy, and looks also at what the EU's member states, acting jointly through that policy, can and should be doing at and for the UN.</p> <p pid="c.247.0/2">The report also constitutes a kind of baseline from which to judge the outcome of the summit. As a newcomer to his sub-committee I would like to convey a word of appreciation to the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Bowness">Lord Bowness</a>, who chaired our deliberations so ably, and to our excellent staff who helped to put together our report under considerable pressure of time, not to mention the "noises off" such as the atrocities on the Underground on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase>, which coincided precisely with one of our meetings, and certainly concentrated our minds on one of the main threats facing this country and the UN as a whole: terrorism.</p> <p pid="c.247.0/3">I have seen it suggested that the EU's input into the preparation of the millennium review summit was a bit feeble and inadequate; that its collective voice was not properly heard. That is nonsense. Not only was a dialogue struck up from the outset with the two members of the high-level panel from EU countries, myself and M Robert Badinter&#8212;to whose perspicacity and contribution I pay tribute&#8212;but a detailed written submission by the EU was entered in July 2004. In June this year the heads of state and government of the EU adopted a position highly supportive of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Secretary-General">UN Secretary-General</a>'s reform proposals, and, in the long and tortuous&#8212;not to say tortured&#8212;negotiations over the outcome document, the EU, under the leadership of the British permanent representative, played a prominent and unfailingly constructive role without which, it can safely be said, there would have been no agreed outcome at all. I know of no other country or group of countries that made a greater input into the preparation of the summit, nor of any whose policy prescriptions were such a close fit with the proposals put forward by the panel and the Secretary-General.</p> <p pid="c.247.0/4">As previous speakers have mentioned, on the proposal regarding enlargement of the Security Council and the question of whether that should include new permanent members, the EU was divided from the outset and remained so to the end. On the rest it was united, as it was on the overall proposition that reforming and strengthening the UN was a major objective of its policy. Not too bad a score, I would suggest.</p> <p pid="c.247.0/5">Why does the UN matter so much to the EU? The answer is simple, and it is set out in our report. The EU has major global interests to defend and to further, but it does not suffer from the illusion that it can do that unaided, powerful and prosperous though it may be thought to be by some; nor does it seek to become some sort of superpower, let alone a "superstate", aspiring to get its way outside the constraints of international law and practice. So it has nailed its colours to the concept of effective multilateralism, one of the leitmotifs of its own security strategy. For effective multilateralism to work, you need an effective UN that can deliver on the tasks it is set collectively by the international community.</p> <p pid="c.247.0/6">Why, in its turn, does the EU matter so much to the UN? The answer is a matter of simple arithmetic. Some 40&#8211;50 per cent of the resources of all UN programmes come from the enlarged European Union. It goes wider than that, however. For the UN to work effectively it needs the firm support of a critical mass of countries that have worldwide outreach and the resources and political will to back up the UN when the going gets rough. The EU has at least the potential to provide that, even if hitherto it has often fallen a bit short of doing so.</p> <p pid="c.247.0/7">What is one to say about the September summit? I myself would say two cheers at best; certainly not three. Quite a lot of highly desirable proposals got lost on the way. Enlargement of the Security Council remains stuck, as it has been for over 10 years. It will return, like Banquo's ghost, to haunt the UN's deliberations. The proposal to set guidelines for the collective use of force fell foul of an unholy alliance of those who thought that they were too constrictive and those who thought that they were too permissive. The decisions on counter-proliferation policy were simply dropped in their entirety, an ominous omission that bodes ill for the future, following as it does the debacle of last May's Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference. The truncation of the responsibilities of the new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacebuilding_Commission">Peacebuilding Commission</a> to exclude conflict prevention will surely come to be regretted.</p> <p pid="c.247.0/8">Nevertheless, set against those failures is a certain number of successes: the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission; the endorsement of a strategy against terrorism and the commitment to a comprehensive convention that, in my view and that of other speakers, needs to outlaw any targeting of civilians or non-combatants; the commitment to the responsibility to protect those whose governments cannot or will not do so themselves; the decision to set up a new council on human rights; and the measures to make the work of the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the secretariat more relevant, better focused and more accountable. There is also the recalibration of the millennium development goals with additional resources and a new sense of purpose. I would argue that the decisions that were taken represent a critical mass of reforms of real value, a reform programme that could be seen as being wider in scope than any adopted since the UN was set up in 1945.</p> <p pid="c.247.0/9">Will it all happen? Will it work? That, naturally, will depend on the follow-up and the implementation. If the Doha development round bogs down; if the new dialogue on global warming runs into the sands; if the convention on terrorism is shipwrecked on the quicksands of disagreement over definitions; if the first case of need to exercise the responsibility to protect is fluffed, flunked or fudged, as has happened so often; if the resources for the development policies and the policies themselves fall short of the promises of Gleneagles and New York; or if the Peacebuilding Commission becomes a fifth wheel rather than a motor for post-conflict peace building, it will be yet another false dawn, yet another opportunity missed.</p> <p pid="c.247.0/10">That brings us back to the European Union's role. It cannot on its own be determinant in the positive sense on any of the issues. Wider co-operation is needed than simply among members of the European Union. There must be co-operation with developing countries and, above all, the emerging giants among them, such as China, India, Brazil, Nigeria and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a>. There must be co-operation with the United States, whose somewhat enigmatic and ambivalent approach to UN reform and the summit still leaves plenty of unanswered questions. There must also be co-operation with the long-term, stalwart supporters of the UN, such as Canada and Japan, whose approach often matches closely that of the European Union.</p> <p pid="c.247.0/11">The European Union's role can be and often is determinant in the negative sense. If it does not provide resources in men, money and political backing, the UN will get nowhere. I hope that we shall hear from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> how the Government, during the rest of their EU and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8">G8</a> presidencies, will set those organisations off along the long and arduous path of effective implementation of the reforms endorsed. Also, how do the Government intend to proceed in the areas in which nothing has been achieved, most pressingly on counter-proliferation policy?</p> <p pid="c.247.0/12">The European Union has a particular stake in the whole process that relates to its internal development as well as to the wider world. There is no doubt that the European Union, like the UN, is going through choppy seas. Like the UN, it needs reform. In the case of the European Union, the institutional path to reform is not only inadequate on its own but is probably blocked for some considerable time, following the negative outcomes of the French and Dutch referendums. I believe that, in the immediate future, the EU's salvation lies through making its policies more effective, more credible and more apt to the needs of its citizens. That is the best way&#8212;perhaps the only way&#8212;to rebuild the support that has ebbed away but is there to be regained.</p> <p pid="c.247.0/13">One of the EU policies that needs to be developed, strengthened and made more visible and comprehensible to the general public is the common foreign and security policy. Is it to remain a mass of apparently meaningless acronyms, a system for writing cheques while others shape the decisions, or is it gradually to become a means of delivering outcomes that our citizens genuinely want and value, such as greater security against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; greater respect for human rights world-wide; and greater prosperity and freedom from disease, hunger and want for those less fortunately placed than ourselves? It is to answering those questions that the European Union must now address itself with renewed determination and purpose.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.250.0/1">My Lords, first, I echo what has been said by a number of speakers. As my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Truscott">Lord Truscott</a> said, we are grateful to our chairman for his leadership during the writing of the report by the committee of which I am a member. We are grateful in particular to the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, who has demonstrated during the past few minutes exactly why his unique overview and ability to see the whole problem of the UN in the round from his experience as an ambassador and on the high level panel was a uniquely valuable contribution to our work. I hope that I do not plagiarise his speech, but my balance sheet will sound somewhat similar.</p> <p pid="c.250.0/2">I echo my noble friend Lord Truscott. I was not aware of the remarkable statistic&#8212;it is reproduced on page 12 of the report&#8212;that the EU countries together provide 38 per cent of the UN budget. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_States">The United States</a> provide 22 per cent. The United States are the sole superpower. There is not time to compare the United Nations with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations">League of Nations</a>. However, perhaps we should reflect on one or two points of impasse regarding non-proliferation and the Security Council&#8212;there are some pluses on climate change&#8212;reflecting on the constitution in a broader sense.</p> <p pid="c.250.0/3">There has always been a problem with organisations where everyone has a right to be a member. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_African_Union">The African Union</a> is different, therefore, from the European Union. We shall study the relationship between the African Union and the European Union and scrutinise it in a wider sense over the next few months leading to a proposed EU/<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AU">AU</a> summit. Different organisations have different internal dynamics. To get them to move forward and to take on more authority is a constitutional question. It is obvious that the United Nations is only as strong as some of the contributions made by key members of the Security Council&#8212;the United States, <i>primus inter pares,</i> and it must be true of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_Russia">China and Russia</a>. It is somewhat disturbing that the new US ambassador to the United Nations is not looking for a stronger role for the UN. Yet when we consider specific policies, as my noble friend Lord Hannay, said, all the forces of history demand that.</p> <p pid="c.250.0/4">Perhaps I may make a slightly jocular aside. For 35 years I helped to run the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUC">TUC</a>, in various lowly and less lowly capacities. When we got into difficulties, going round in circles and going nowhere in particular, we always used to say, "The problem is that running the TUC is rather like running the United Nations. You can't really do anything as you have very big members throwing their weight about". To coin a phrase, the problem with running the United Nations is a little like running the TUC. That may not have the same resonance with other people as it has with me, but it is worth reflecting on what is needed to make an organisation cohere.</p> <p pid="c.250.0/5">Compared with the UN, the EU has some remarkable success stories. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, touched on one or two of them. Even drawing up and agreeing between the 25 member states a substantive report on the non-proliferation treaty that formed the hymn sheet to be used in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> was quite an achievement. The common foreign and security policy is a fancy title because it has to be based on unanimity, but historians will look back and note that the EU is doing more and more at an impressive speed. I am sure that that is the kind of setting against which we ought to judge some of the less than brilliantly successful outcomes we have seen recently.</p> <p pid="c.250.0/6">We have seen the UN move a considerable distance on climate change over the past 13 to 14 years. In 1992 I happened to be an expert adviser as part of the UK delegation to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Summit">Earth Summit</a> held in Rio. At the time the possibility that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> would be agreed in any form, and that the newly developing industrial nations such as India, China and Brazil would relate to the system, was very remote. The debating point of the day was that it was the duty of the great industrialised powers of the developed world, those which created pollution with their carbon dioxide emissions, to give the lead; we could not expect the participation of India and China. Today we are finding the modalities where that is starting to happen. In historical terms, that is happening over a short period.</p> <p pid="c.250.0/7">The noble Baroness, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Falkner">Lady Falkner</a> of Margravine, said that there is a crisis of multilateralism. I tend to agree, but it is worth stating its nature .</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.251.1/1">My Lords, I apologise if I wrongly paraphrased the noble Baroness. But I think that there is a crisis of multilateralism, and I shall put it in my own terms. There should be a form of high-level brainstorming on the nature of the negotiation which is now meant to be developing on issues such as the non-proliferation treaty. The traditional way in which documents are drawn up for meetings such as the NPT review conference, which was such a comprehensive failure, shows that lessons ought to be learnt. During their presidency, which has only another six weeks to run, could Her Majesty's Government put into play the notion that there ought to be a reflection on what the failure of the NPT review conference can tell us about the nature of multilateral modalities? I ask that because we have another fast-emerging problem; that is, the Iranian question.</p> <p pid="c.251.1/2">We have suggested both in the report on the non-proliferation treaty and more generally that it would be desirable to experiment, through Britain, France and Germany, with reporting to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=205" title="An informal reference to the Council of the European Union." class="glossary">Council of Ministers</a>, and then Europe taking a lead in the UN system. There has been some rather facile talk recently of going to the Security Council. To do what, exactly? Either building on the alliance of the UK, France and Germany or the failure of the NPT treaty conference, it would be very useful indeed for the Government to give a lead to the setting up of a high-level forum or brains trust&#8212;it does not matter what it is called&#8212;to think through some of the problems attached to the modalities of multilateral negotiation.</p> <p pid="c.251.1/3">On millennium development goals more generally, I do not agree with the noble Baroness on this occasion. I definitely do not agree that we should have given more prominence in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> to the progress on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDGs">MDGs</a>. I see totally the reverse. MDGs are, in a sense, dependent on an average 7 per cent economic growth across the developing world. That is a tremendously ambitious target, but what is the problem with achieving it? It is largely, in our analysis, the problems of corruption, of governance and money-laundering&#8212;which comes back to London and Jersey and such places. It is also the problem of trade, with the Doha round, and the problem that in Africa we have a doctrine of non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states. That is the problem with the MDGs and getting to that 7 per cent. It is not just waving magic wands about economic arithmetic. We now have an ambitious agenda because we cannot avoid some of these challenging questions.</p> <p pid="c.251.1/4">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> may be glad to know that I want to conclude by asking for this note to be attached to the Government's reply. I do not think anyone else has mentioned the interesting note in the annexe on conditionality. There is a not unintelligent attempt there at some rehabilitation of conditionality, which ought to be addressed as a key point in the response. We have moved away from the idea that conditionality is a disgrace. We say that it is part of the condition for making progress. That is very true in Africa and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America">Latin America</a>. It would be useful if the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> could comment on that. The EU can set conditions in its negotiations with Africa and Latin America simply because it cannot easily be accused of, or represented as being, imperialist in the way that an individual country like Britain, France, Spain or Portugal&#8212;the whole lot of us&#8212;can be separately.</p> <p pid="c.251.1/5">My conclusion is that this whole exercise has demonstrated the tremendous innate power for development for the better in the world through the developing role of the European Union.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.252.0/1">My Lords, I add my congratulations to the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Bowness">Lord Bowness</a>, and his committee for a report which is timely, lucid and highly relevant. The report is precisely titled but, as the debate has already demonstrated, it raises wider questions than the European Union's role at the millennium review summit. Indeed, as the introduction states, it:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.252.0/2">"looks at the EU's role in the UN".</p> <p pid="c.252.0/3">It does that, to an extent, in the round.</p> <p pid="c.252.0/4">One key question with wide implications arises within the first section of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_3">Chapter 3</a> of the report, "The EU's importance to the UN". Several references have been made to quite startling data, but if I may mention them again; member states of the EU contribute 38 per cent of the United Nations' regular budget, which compares with 22 per cent contributed by the United States. More than 40 per cent of the UN's peace-keeping role costs are met by EU member states. This question, then, seems to arise logically in my mind: is the EU's role in the United Nations, and through it, commensurate with its budgetary contribution?</p> <p pid="c.252.0/5">Judging by the way the media see this issue, the answer is, "Certainly not".</p> <p pid="c.252.0/6">When the UN's future is discussed in terms of crisis, it is often because of US scepticism about the UN and, indeed, the desultory nature of the financial contributions of the United States. By contrast, the European Union's contribution, if it is discussed at all, is taken for granted. I suspect that its extent and dimension is little known, and the committee has made an important contribution to the debate by drawing attention to these figures.</p> <p pid="c.252.0/7">It is unsurprising, in a way, that the European Union's contribution to the UN is somewhat taken for granted because the European Union is based on multilateralism, as indeed is the UN. To an extent, they are birds of a feather. There are, of course, signs now&#8212;and many in the House will be pleased about these signs&#8212;that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Administration">United States Administration</a> is taking the United Nations more seriously than it did at its outset. It nevertheless remains true that, both in its rhetoric and, indeed, in quite large slices of its thinking, the United States Administration is, by instinct and emotion, seriously unilateralist.</p> <p pid="c.252.0/8">In giving evidence to the committee, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Jeremy_Greenstock">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</a> expressed this most tactfully. He said that United States governments have failed to resolve the dichotomy of wanting, on the one hand,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.252.0/9">"the United Nations to do things to make the world better which the United States does not want to do", but opposing the evolution of a global body in the UN,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.252.0/11">"that can take decisions properly the business of the United States".</p> <p pid="c.252.0/12">That is a very diplomatic expression of the dichotomy, which is clear. It goes to the heart of the difference between the EU and the United Nations, and, indeed, between the EU and the United States, in their approach to these issues. The European Union is not only committed to multilateralism but also, historically and in its whole dynamic, to pooling sovereignty where this enables us to do together what we cannot do separately. In theory, this is what the Security Council is meant to be able to achieve, and historically it occasionally has.</p> <p pid="c.252.0/13">But it is famously what it was not able to do over Iraq. Again, Sir Jeremy Greenstock explained why. The European Union, like the United Nations,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.252.0/14">"very considerably is governed in its business by decisions of political leaders in their national context".</p> <p pid="c.252.0/15">States have to agree, on each issue,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.252.0/16">"whether they will be collective rather than national".</p> <p pid="c.252.0/17">The report concludes that,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.252.0/18">"This was demonstrated by the divisions over the war in Iraq".</p> <p pid="c.252.0/19">The question for the European Union, however, given the scale of its contribution, is whether it will be more effective&#8212;and more true to itself&#8212;if agreements to act collectively at the UN are more frequent and, indeed, the norm.</p> <p pid="c.252.0/20">Does the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> believe that there is a case for the European Union to be itself represented on a permanent basis in the Security Council? She shakes her head. In that case, because it is not a surprising response&#8212;it is a response shared by France for much the same reason&#8212;is it not an almost automatic consequence that Her Majesty's Government should consider supporting German membership of the Security Council on a permanent basis?</p> <p pid="c.252.0/21">Turning to the Doha round, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a> trade negotiations, the role of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP">CAP</a> in all this and prospects for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> summit, the Government's response to the report's conclusions are admirable as far as they go, which I suggest is not quite far enough. Thus, in responding to the report's challenge in its summary at chapter 8, they state:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.252.0/22">"As EU Presidency, we will work closely with the Commission, our EU partners and other WTO members to build on the progress made so far to ensure a successful and pro-development outcome at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December. This will allow us to achieve our aim of completing the WTO Round by the end of 2006. A successful trade round has the potential to lift 140 million people off subsidence of less than $2 a day . . . We will continue to press for reform of the CAP and other developed countries' trade-distorting agricultural policies".</p> <p pid="c.252.0/23">I imagine that that is to a considerable extent a reference to the policies of the United States. They go on to say:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.252.0/24">"Within the WTO Round, we will push for improved market access for developing countries, reductions in trade-distorting domestic support and agreement on an end date for agricultural export subsidies at Hong Kong".</p> <p pid="c.252.0/25">The trouble with those statements of good intent is, to go back to Sir Jeremy Greenstock's neat phrase, the decisions of political leaders in their national context: specifically, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Chirac">President Chirac</a> being difficult and seeking to prevent Mr Mandelson from being good. There was President Chirac at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Court">Hampton Court</a> declaring France's right not to approve any Doha outcome that undermines the 2003 CAP agreement: not 40 per cent cuts; no more than 25 per cent. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, in this House on Monday, advised President Chirac&#8212;I certainly enjoyed this word of advice&#8212;to read the Nice treaty, because if he did so he would discover that he had no veto. However, we have a record of signing European treaties allegedly without having read them either.</p> <p pid="c.252.0/26">Before we all succumb to the pleasures of seeing Mr Mandelson as a righteous crusader&#8212;a slightly alarming prospect&#8212;let us try to remember that the countries of the developing world do not see even a 40 per cent cut as enabling them to surmount the hurdles facing their agricultural exports. The reason is simple: the Uruguay round set such high ceilings for United States and EU subsidies that insurmountable hurdles will remain even with a 40 per cent CAP cut. Will Her Majesty's Government recognise that and seek despite the difficulties with France and others to go beyond the rhetoric to the realities of what would actually make a difference to agricultural exports from the developing world?</p> <p pid="c.252.0/27">The Doha round started back in 2001, a journey that I hope will be completed in Hong Kong. But if it is really to alleviate the appalling disadvantages and problems faced by the developing world, a huge amount of work remains to be done. I would like to conclude with a brief example that is very topical. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_2001">In 2001</a>, the developing countries were promised special and differential treatment in the areas of public health and relevant <a href="/glossary/?gl=261" title="patents (for inventions), trade marks, protected designs, and copyrights;..." class="glossary">intellectual property</a> rights. The lack of clarification since 2001 in this area and in particular the failure to meet the deadlines that were accepted at that point of six months or slightly more means that we have reached a situation where, for example, if there was a flu pandemic in the developing world, countries in the developing world could, in theory, like ourselves or other countries in the developed world, overrule patent rights to manufacture the necessary drugs under compulsory licence, but only if they had the manufacturing capacity to do so.</p> <p pid="c.252.0/28">For example, a country such as Mozambique does not have such manufacturing capacity, so for it to issue a compulsory licence would be futile. It would need in some way to licence another country to act on its behalf as the manufacturer and at present it cannot do so. Will the Minister look at that issue urgently? The report asks the Government to use the remaining weeks of their presidency to make a difference at the United Nations and to advance the development agenda. I am sure that we all hope that that is indeed what will happen.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.255.0/1">My Lords, I repeat and echo the thanks that have been paid to the chairman and members of the committee&#8212;on which I served as well, although I arrived on the scene later than some others&#8212;about the excellence of the report, its construction and the help given by our officials.</p> <p pid="c.255.0/2">This has been an excellent debate. I was particularly grateful for the very interesting organisational requirements for the UN enunciated by my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Falkner">Lady Falkner</a>. That is a huge subject, which needs more discussion by experts in the future.</p> <p pid="c.255.0/3">I believe that the EU's role is improving in the UN. It is a considerable role already and needs to be much more cohesive and co-ordinated in the future. It is respected more in the UN because, unlike other leading members of the Security Council, it does not grind those more narrowly based axes. That is a genuine position, which can easily continue. I hope so. And there is no reason why the recent arrival of the 10 new members will change that position.</p> <p pid="c.255.0/4">The millennium summit was too ambitious in its coverage and suffered from the usual effect of looking much more interesting and compelling before it actually took place. I suppose that was inevitable. It was a long litany of desirable objectives and aspirations for a world where many countries are grappling with sincere and noble goals, including under-developed countries, where the danger is, as the Government have acknowledged, that implementation of reform measures is much harder than talking about them in such a large forum. The idea that all the millennium development goals will be reached in due time is a matter of doubt. On climate change, the crucial post-2012 obligations will, I hope, be dealt with decisively at the UN climate change conference in December, but there is an awful lot of work to be done, and talking, as we know, is easier than doing.</p> <p pid="c.255.0/5">Will the peacebuilding commission get off the ground eventually? There is room for serious doubt on that as well.</p> <p pid="c.255.0/6">I am glad that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMG">HMG</a> have developed more arguments on conditionality which I believe have been put in the Library, or are about to be. We shall study those carefully.</p> <p pid="c.255.0/7">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTI">DTI</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury of Turville, spoke positively in answer to my Starred Question, on the urgency of the targets referred to by my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Watson">Lord Watson</a> for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> conference at the end of the year.</p> <p pid="c.255.0/8">The EU response has already been much more helpful and rapid than that of the United States to many of these things. If the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> continues to claim a special relationship with an increasingly ailing <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush">President Bush</a>, he should, in the time available in the second term, at least make sure that the Americans respond much more energetically than so far demonstrated.</p> <p pid="c.255.0/9">The Government have also recognised the need to analyse the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism as well as the normal parts of the counter-terror strategy. That must include a coherent picture, description and recommendations about terrorism in uniform as well, whoever the perpetrators in different countries may be, in the future as in the past.</p> <p pid="c.255.0/10">Will we also be able to see progress in reform of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a>, so long overdue but still as elusive as ever, due the entrenched positions of the privileged &#233;lite of a small number of leading member states? It was rather depressing to read the press in the UK and elsewhere after the millennium summit, which was described as talking rather than achieving much. According to the <i>Economist</i> in mid-September:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.255.0/11">"Most countries put the blame on the United States, in the form of its abrasive new ambassador, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bolton">John Bolton</a>, for insisting at the end of August on hundreds of last-minute amendments and a line-by-line renegotiation of a text most others had thought was almost settled".</p> <p pid="c.255.0/12">According to the<i> </i>international section of the <i>Guardian</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-17">17 September</phrase>, the only conclusion was "low marks on the final scoreboard". On the same date, the <i>Guardian</i> leader said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.255.0/13">"Not much can be said in praise of the UN world summit, which has ended with little more than a heavily spun restatement of its loftiest ambitions".</p> <p pid="c.255.0/14">These are the realities we all face, which is why the Minister has to convince the House that action will be taken. The <i>Independent</i> said in its leading article on the same date:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.255.0/15">"<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Blair">Mr Blair</a> has spent much of this past week attempting to chivvy the UN summit in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> into accepting a universal definition of terrorism. In this he has failed. The motion was rejected by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_General_Assembly">UN General Assembly</a>".</p> <p pid="c.255.0/16">One can understand the reasons why.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.257.1/1">My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, is entitled to his opinion and I am certainly entitled to mine. A lot of people regarded the whole exercise of the terrorism examination as extremely disappointing and it is sad that he views it as an official function rather than from a more practical standpoint about the action that is going to be taken. It is perfectly valid to quote from the press, because it is interesting to see how the press considered the summit.</p> <p pid="c.257.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-17">17 September</phrase>, the <i>Times</i> referred to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s love-in with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Musharraf">General Musharraf</a> of Pakistan:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.257.1/3">"But General Musharraf is also a military ruler who has broken his own promises about stepping down as head of <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the army</a>, and choked off the mainstream political parties".</p> <p pid="c.257.1/4">The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, and others will perhaps note that I am referring to the reality that many members of the General Assembly feel dismayed about the future of the UN unless more of a balance is injected into its bodies and procedures and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</a> is reformed. In that sense, the millennium review has let people down. Perhaps one was unwisely expecting too much. Many things were started in an incipient way, which is a good thing. However, it is much more difficult to reach conclusions than to start things off.</p> <p pid="c.257.1/5">Iran was mentioned in the context of the UN. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a> will have a testing time deciding what to do with reference to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU-3">EU-3</a> and so forth at further stages. I must refer to the outburst about Israel from the Iranian President Ahmadinejad, which was mentioned in Questions yesterday. This will be a continuing matter for the UN. It was such a ghastly and violent piece of nonsense and has been happily buried in a veritable avalanche of worldwide condemnation, including from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Secretary-General">UN Secretary-General</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority">Palestinian Authority</a> and others. I was glad to see a strong rebuke from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Khatami">Muhammad Khatami</a>, the former president of Iran, of what the new Iranian president said.</p> <p pid="c.257.1/6">I speak as a long-standing friend of Israel. I have been heavily involved with Israel for many years. It is a remarkable country. It is a country that is brave and courageous enough to overcome such spurious and rather foolish sounding threats. Of course, there have been attempts by moderate Iranians to go back on what the president said in foolish outbursts on two occasions.</p> <p pid="c.257.1/7">Israel is a remarkable and courageous country, but it remains the unbeatable military power in the whole zone. That is a solid fact that no amount of hysterical and blustering rhetoric from Iranian racialists such as this new president can gainsay. The reality is that none of this imposes other than a strong obligation on the Sharon-led coalition at long last to commence negotiations with the administration of President Abu Mazen. I am entitled to mention this because the subject came up at the summit in General Assembly speeches and in the corridors and <i>Derri&#232;re les coulisses</i>. It is time for the stalling to stop.</p> <p pid="c.257.1/8">The leading members of the advanced world in the Security Council have long let down the rest of the UN with their disregard for the needs of the third world in basic political terms and their predilection for regarding the UN Security Council at a sort of private estate for their own pattern of dominance. That happened in the beginning of the UN and has continued for many years since. It must change in the future for the General Assembly members, or those rising larger countries&#8212;Brazil was mentioned and there are others, such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_and_Pakistan">India and Pakistan</a>&#8212;will lose heart about the validity of a modern version of the UN for the future.</p> <p pid="c.257.1/9">The 34 vetoes that have been exercised by the Americans to stop various Israeli governments behaving more fairly towards Palestine according to international law after nearly 40 years of occupation, is the case in point but there are many others. This pattern of misuse of the UN by the United States and other powers has not stopped since the end of the Cold War. Many active members of the General Assembly feel angry and frustrated, and the West must recognise the need to build a modern 21st century UN that acts for all the members, not just the rich club.</p> <p pid="c.257.1/10">Because of the positive influence of the European Union, attitudes are at last changing, and the growth of the Asian nations, such as India, China, Indonesia and Japan as world and involved powers at long last&#8212;it has taken a long time indeed&#8212;will help to right that overdue unfairness and imbalance. The EU has pledged to double aid to the third world, and various other things will happen from now on to give us more cause for hope.</p> <p pid="c.257.1/11">While I am sceptical about the summit and its detail&#8212;I hope that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will reassure us and make us feel more cheerful about what will be done&#8212; huge questions remain. There is the peacebuilding commission, the construction of the definition of terrorism in the modern context on a balanced basis, and other matters. Non-proliferation has been referred to, as has the complicated reform of the Security Council, conditionality and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8">G8</a> initiatives. They need further monitoring and elucidation by the House.</p> <p pid="c.257.1/12">World agricultural reforms have been referred to in the debate, and we can take some pleasure from the reality that the common agricultural policy, despite being expensive and old-fashioned, and needing further reform beyond the insipid reforms that have been launched in recent years, is far from being the most expensive of the main farm support systems in the world. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_US">The US</a> is much more expensive for a much smaller number of farmers. Japan is similar in its effect. The EU has a better record in taking in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACP">ACP</a> food product and staple imports than do some other advanced countries.</p> <p pid="c.257.1/13">There is a balance in the arguments, but more needs to be done. I hope that the House, the Government and, indeed, the UN will not be complacent.</p>            </div>

I, too, extend my congratulations to my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Bowness">Lord Bowness</a> for securing it, and thank him, his committee and its staff for all their hard work in the timely production of the report ahead of the summit.</p> <p pid="c.259.0/2">As your Lordships have recognised the 2000 UN millennium summit produced a landmark agreement,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.259.0/3">"a blueprint agreed to by all the world's countries and all the world's leading development institutions", and the birth of the millennium development goals.</p> <p pid="c.259.0/5">The eight goals range from halving extreme poverty to halting the spread of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV">HIV</a>/<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS">AIDS</a> and providing universal primary education&#8212;all by the target date of 2015. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN">The UN</a> MDG website states:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.259.0/6">"They have galvanized unprecedented efforts to meet the needs of the world's poorest".</p> <p pid="c.259.0/7">In contrast the millennium review summit 2005 has been described as a "summit of hypocrites"&#8212;just another talking shop with little progress on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDGs">MDGs</a>. They are goals that, as the report highlighted, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan">Kofi Annan</a> said would not be achieved in the time-scale without significant corrections to many of the developmental policies.</p> <p pid="c.259.0/8">Does the noble Baroness believe that the millennium development goals can be met by 2015? The UN report, <i>Investing in Development,</i> points out that sub-Saharan Africa, for example, is not on track to meet all millennium development goals. It has the highest rate of under-nourishment with one-third of the population below the minimum level of dietary energy consumption. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a> has the lowest primary enrolment rates of all regions. Despite recent progress, gender disparity at the primary level is the lowest of all regions.</p> <p pid="c.259.0/9">Meanwhile, west Asia, a region that includes many countries typically classified as part of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East">Middle East</a>, is reportedly not on track for the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of the goals. Both income poverty and hunger are increasing, and progress toward gender equality has been slow. Primary enrolments increased by only 2 per cent between 1990 and 2001, and mortality rates in under-fives per 1,000 live births in the same period. Maternal mortality remains high and infectious diseases such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TB">TB</a> are still a threat.</p> <p pid="c.259.0/10">Three years ago, to meet the millennium development goals on water and sanitation, we should have been spending $180 billion a year on all water projects, but we were spending only $80 billion. What reforms have been made to meet the goals? How will Her Majesty's Government ensure their effectiveness? Does the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> agree with the committee's view that the EU,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.259.0/11">"needs to deploy its diplomatic outreach to countries in Asia, Africa and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America">Latin America</a>"?</p> <p pid="c.259.0/12">If so, how does that square with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCO">FCO</a>'s commitment, of which we heard at <a href="/glossary/?gl=25" title="Question Time is an opportunity for MPs and Members of the House of Lords..." class="glossary">Question Time</a> today, to close various embassies around the world by the end of next year?</p> <p pid="c.259.0/13">We welcome the EU's commitment to increase aid, and we are glad that the Government agree that the commitment must be monitored in light of doubts expressed on whether all member states will be able to deliver the sums pledged. Could the Minister explain in a little more detail whether further action will be taken or penalties imposed, beyond monitoring, if a member state is found to be failing consistently to increase its aid package?</p> <p pid="c.259.0/14">Despite the increase in aid, I feel that we should question whether more aid is always the answer to poverty reduction and economic development. Nigeria is an example of a country in which, despite swallowing up billions of pounds in aid and oil revenues, living standards have actually fallen over the past two decades. There are significant examples of countries in which aid does not necessarily equal development. It may actually prevent it by providing "easy money" aid flows, which then remove the incentives to reform and grass roots enterprise. What steps are Her Majesty's Government taking to investigate the waste element of UK and European aid? Will the Government ensure that more is filtered through <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGOs">NGOs</a> to target projects rather than to governments who fail to be transparent and accountable? It is vital that we have joined-up governance and government on issues such as trade, aid and security to help to break the cycle of poverty rather than unwittingly add to it.</p> <p pid="c.259.0/15">The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, in his evidence to the committee, and as a member of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Level_Panel_on_Threats,_Challenges_and_Change">High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change</a>, suggested that the EU's position at the UN has changed. That is partly due to significant financial contribution to the institution. Secondly, the common foreign and security policy has meant that the EU has become more cohesive and able to deliver according to the UN's needs. Does the Minister agree that the EU will have a real influence on whether the UN will succeed or fail in the current era?</p> <p pid="c.259.0/16">We shall return to some issues again, particularly in the run-up to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a> meeting in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> next month. It is vital that we should heed the UN 2005 report that argues that the,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.259.0/17">"currency of pledges for the international community is by now so severely debased by non-delivery that it is widely perceived as useless. Instead of more grandstanding, world leaders need to knock a few heads together".</p> <p pid="c.259.0/18">We believe that the UN does have a role to play in today's world, the fight against poverty and security, and within that the EU has an important role. Poverty and security are interlinked but we must be careful not to lose sight of one by concentrating too much on the other. Words are not enough; we need action, efficiency rather than bureaucracy, and transparent, accountable governance at all national and international levels.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.261.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords who have contributed to this important debate on the European Union's role at the millennium review summit. I am also extremely grateful for the work of the noble Lords of Sub-Committee C, notably their excellent chair, the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Bowness">Lord Bowness</a>, on their comprehensive report. As usual, it is of the highest standard.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/2">As this House will be aware, the Government and the European Union are deeply committed to the United Nations. Since the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Secretary-General">UN Secretary-General</a> announced his intention to take forward his bold and ambitious reform agenda for the UN by setting up the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Level_Panel_on_Threats,_Challenges_and_Change">High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change</a>, of which the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, was a member, we have underlined at every opportunity our strong support for a more effective United Nations, better able to tackle the interrelated challenges of development, security and human rights, underpinned by an efficient <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Secretariat">UN Secretariat</a>. That remains the case today.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/3">That is precisely why the Government and the European Union worked tirelessly for a successful outcome at the UN world summit in September. The reforms agreed, enshrined in the summit's so-called "outcome document", will set the agenda of the United Nations for years to come. They are a set of essential reforms and commitments that will enable the UN to be better equipped to tackle the challenges faced by the modern world. As the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Watson">Lord Watson</a>, suggested, this debate is an excellent opportunity to draw attention to the vital role of the EU within the United Nations.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/4">Holding the EU presidency, the UK plays an important role in the often difficult negotiations on the summit outcome document. Gaining consensus agreement on such a broad agenda was always going to be a difficult objective, reflecting the diversity of the UN's membership. But it is to the credit of the members of the United Nations, with the European Union at the fore, that they were able to rise to the challenge and agree on such an extensive set of reforms.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/5">The bar was set very high. The reports of the high-level panel, Jeffrey Sachs' UN Millennium Project, and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan">Kofi Annan</a>'s own report <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Larger_Freedom">In Larger Freedom</a></i> demonstrated one inescapable truth: until the international community takes decisive action to address with urgency poverty, disease, environmental degradation and social injustice, we will not be able to achieve sustainable conflict resolution and secure global peace and security. Without peace and security, we cannot tackle development&#8212;it is as simple as that. All of these are not possible without universal respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/6">History has shown that too often the international community has responded to these challenges with dissent and lethargy, driven by conflicting priorities. However, the summit has shown that the international community is at its most powerful and effective when it operates with unity and energy, driven by common goals and purpose. The summit secured firm commitments from both donor and developing countries on development, with several important Gleneagles outcomes endorsed and new EU commitments welcomed by the broader UN membership. These included the need to accelerate progress towards the millennium development goals and to address the special needs of Africa. As the noble Lord, Lord Astor, suggested, people say that it will be extremely difficult for us to reach the millennium development goals by 2015. However, that is what we shall strive to do. Those are our goals and we have to meet them, if at all possible. Together, I hope, we can do it.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/7">We certainly welcome the mandate given to the Secretary-General to address longer-term reform of the UN development architecture and we hope that this will result in more effective uses of the wealth of expertise, experience and resources within the UN system. We also support the clear commitment made to improving the timeliness and predictability of humanitarian funding. Humanitarian funding is one of the key plinths of our development policy, together with trade and the other part of the triangle.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/8">Sustainable development was recognised as a key element of the overarching framework of the UN's activities and was integrated throughout the development section of the outcome document, while the UN reform section underlined the need for a more coherent institutional framework for environmental activities in the UN system. Countries at the UN summit committed to move forward the global discussion on long-term co-operative action to address climate change and stressed the importance of the UN climate change conference to be held in Montreal later this month. Yesterday, the first meeting of the dialogue on climate change took place in London.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/9">At the EU Environment Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-17">17 October</phrase>, the EU agreed its negotiating strategy for the conference in Montreal. Its priority is to get the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> off to a good start and to ensure that it operates efficiently. The EU confirmed its determination to meet its commitments under the UN Framework Convention and Protocol, including in relation to funding to assist developing countries. The EU also set an objective to launch discussions on a process to determine further action after the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/10">The summit's endorsement of the responsibility to protect underlined the obligation on states to protect their own populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. Importantly, for the first time, UN member states also acknowledged that the international community should act&#8212;through the Security Council&#8212;if governments fail to protect their populations from these terrible atrocities.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/11">The summit's agreement to create by the end of this year a new peacebuilding commission will close an institutional gap in the UN's conflict architecture and will assist countries emerging from conflict. As the holder of the EU presidency, we are working hard to achieve the establishment of the new body by <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-31">31 December</phrase> of this year. There has been progress, including on arrangements for involving the affected countries in the work of the commission. Of course, there remains the need to find satisfactory conclusions on other practical issues, including on how the commission will operate. However, I understand that it is hoped that agreement will be reached in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> on countries being able to self-nominate. If that happens, clearly the peacebuilding commission could help countries to avoid slipping into conflict. The Government see an obvious need for a clear and agreed role for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</a> in the peacebuilding commission, and this matter is currently under discussion.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/12">We have strongly welcomed the agreement to establish a new human rights council to replace the much-maligned <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_Human_Rights">Commission on Human Rights</a>. Noble Lords are right when they say that the current commission is both inefficient and much discredited. But we are working hard with EU partners and the wider membership to settle the main elements of the council by the end of December so that the council can start its work as soon as possible in 2006. Human rights must have their proper place within the UN system, and that is right at the heart, or centre, of the UN system.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/13">I agree that preferably the human rights council should be smaller than the current commission. Obviously that is a very difficult matter for negotiation, but negotiations will continue. Consultations on the council have begun in earnest. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_President">The President</a> of the General Assembly, Mr Eliasson, is holding four rounds of open consultation with states in October and November. He is aiming to produce a draft text in the second half of November and to begin detailed negotiations on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-28">28 November</phrase> with a view to reaching agreement on the main points by the end of the year. I consider that to be very good news for the global system of governance and human rights.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/14">In respect of terrorism, I was rather astounded to hear the quotation cited by the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, and to hear that he believed everything that he had read in the newspapers. I have participated with him in many debates on the European Union in which we have both urged noble Lords not to believe everything they read about the EU in the newspapers. I respectfully suggest to him that perhaps he should not believe everything that he reads about terrorism and the United Nations.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/15">Gaining an unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and, separately, unanimous adoption by the Security Council of the UK's Security Council resolution to prohibit by law incitement to terrorism were useful steps forward. Noble Lords will be glad to know that discussions on the comprehensive convention on international terrorism are ongoing, with the UK presidency participating actively. We welcome the commitment of world leaders at the summit to work to conclude this convention during the current session of the General Assembly, as the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, suggested.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/16">In response to the noble Baroness, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Falkner">Lady Falkner</a>, about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OIC">OIC</a>, the UK and other EU members have been lobbying the OIC on its proposed <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> to the comprehensive convention. The OIC proposal concerns foreign occupation and raises concerns with several delegations that an exception for the definition of terrorism is being sought, but the UK and other delegations are working hard to find a solution.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/17">Although the primary focus from the perspective of disarmament and non-proliferation this year was rightly the NPT review conference, its disappointing outcome gave us added incentive to make strenuous efforts to remedy that at the UN world summit in September. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> was pleased to take part in the initiative promoted by his then Norwegian colleague designed to generate broad support for a forward-looking non-proliferation agenda. That is why, as presidency of the European Union, we also worked hard to secure European support for strong and meaningful commitments on non-proliferation and disarmament. From discussion with the new Foreign <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of Norway last week, I understand that the initiative started by his colleague will continue. It is of course disappointing that the summit was unable to agree on commitments to disarmament and non-proliferation. However, we remain completely committed to exploring ways to achieve progress and to strengthen the global disarmament and non-proliferation regime.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/18">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAEA">IAEA</a> general conference last month demonstrated an especially good spirit of co-operation and determination among states to strengthen non-proliferation and address other issues, such as the peaceful use of nuclear technology. Those are important building blocks. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN">The UN</a> First Committee, presently in session, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNSCR_1540">UNSCR 1540</a> Committee and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8">G8</a> global partnership are all fora in which we are actively participating and we continue to work hard to bring into force the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Test_Ban_Treaty">Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty</a> and to begin negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/19">All those reforms were underpinned by proposals for reform of the UN Secretariat. The world summit recognised that the organisation needs reinvigorating to enable the UN to deliver the challenging mandate that it has been set. That will require an efficient and effective secretariat. Failure to reprioritise activity and modernise working methods risks undermining the wider reforms that the summit set in train.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/20">Some noble Lords have suggested that reform of the secretariat should be a secondary issue, but the Government's view is that reform of the secretariat is crucial to the implementation of the new UN agenda. We strongly endorse the reforms under way and urge the Secretary-General to be bold in the exercise of his existing mandate. Efforts already under way to strengthen accountability through improved oversight and performance management are welcome. Further reports from the Secretary-General are expected to make proposals for overhaul of financial and human resource regulations that will improve flexibility and transparency in decision-making at the UN. The EU will continue to work closely with the Secretary-General to deliver the management reforms that world leaders have endorsed.</p> <p pid="c.261.0/21">The lack of agreement that has been apparent for reform of the UN structure reflects the diverse and strong opinions within the UN system. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> support reform of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a>, and its expansion to include Germany. We also support the extension of the Council to Japan, India and Brazil, as well as permanent African representation. My noble friend Lord Lea suggested that there are lessons to be learnt from past failures.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.265.1/1">My Lords, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Charter">UN Charter</a>, as it stands, would not allow membership of the EU. I believe that we should therefore leave that question for another day.</p> <p pid="c.265.1/2">My noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Lea_of_Crondall">Lord Lea of Crondall</a> suggested that we should be looking at new ways to deal more effectively with multilateralism and learn from the lessons of the past. He suggested that there should perhaps be a body set up under the UK presidency. It is an interesting idea, which I shall certainly take to my <a href="/glossary/?gl=172" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to another MP of..." class="glossary">right honourable friend</a> the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>. However, I think that there are other priorities in the six remaining weeks of the UK presidency. Clearly, however, there are lessons to be learnt.</p> <p pid="c.265.1/3">Members of the committee have received what I believe to be an excellent policy paper on conditionality, an issue which the noble Lord also raised. We believe that donor programmes must support developing countries' own priorities. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> programmes respect this, so long as recipients are committed to sound financial management, human rights and reducing poverty.</p> <p pid="c.265.1/4">The noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Watson">Lord Watson</a> of Richmond, raised many important and difficult issues. Many noble Lords have referred to the amount of money paid by the EU to the UN&#8212;38 per cent. The noble Lord asked if our role in the EU is proportionate to our budgetary contribution. The Government believe that it is, absolutely. The EU is a key partner with the UN in a number of fora. For example, there is EU financing for peacekeeping missions, and we played a crucial role in the summit negotiations and implementation. So we are a key player, and it is therefore beholden on us to make a key contribution.</p> <p pid="c.265.1/5">As the noble Lord, Lord Watson of Richmond, will know, the UK has been at the forefront of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP">CAP</a> negotiations in Doha, arguing for the removal of trade-distorting agricultural subsidies, recognising their negative impact on developing countries. It would not be appropriate for me to say at the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> how much we think subsidies should or should not be. That could inflame discussions that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Mandelson">Peter Mandelson</a> is involved in. However, the UK is certainly pushing for an agreement that will benefit developing countries.</p> <p pid="c.265.1/6">The noble Lord also referred to pharmaceutical companies in Mozambique. I am afraid that I do not know the answer to the matter that he raised, but I shall certainly pursue it.</p> <p pid="c.265.1/7">Although the summit endorsed all the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8">G8</a> achievements of 2005, particularly on making faster progress towards the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDGs">MDGs</a> and recognition of the special needs of Africa, some have expressed disappointment and frustration at the results of the world summit. I am delighted, however, that so many noble Lords today clearly understand that real progress took place. I endorse the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick. I agree that we should give two cheers for the results of the summit, if not three.</p> <p pid="c.265.1/8">Many felt that the commitments made did not go far enough. In some cases, we share their disappointment. Let us be realistic, however. It is unlikely that, in any summit involving 191 nations, there would be unanimity on the range of issues under discussion. Of course, we wanted the summit to go further in some areas, but if the reforms that we agreed are really implemented&#8212;as we are working hard to achieve&#8212;the Government are confident that the summit will represent a landmark moment for the United Nations.</p> <p pid="c.265.1/9">The noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Bowness">Lord Bowness</a>, asked whether reform would happen. Clearly, the success of the reforms depends on the political will of the member states. That will is certainly here in the Government, and is shared by other governments within the EU. We are committed to playing an active role in ensuring that the reforms agreed are fully and urgently implemented. This represents a vital part of the EU's goal of an international order based on effective multilateralism and the rule of law.</p> <p pid="c.265.1/10">Only last week, our ambassadors, acting as the EU presidency, lobbied in all African posts to encourage visible and positive African positions in the ongoing implementation discussions in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a>. These outreach efforts will continue as negotiations in New York progress. As the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> said in New York, if we start implementing urgently the reforms agreed on doubling aid, opening up trade, debt relief, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV">HIV</a>/<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS">AIDS</a>, malaria, conflict prevention and stopping genocide, we would have a more modern democracy, less oppression, more freedom, less terrorism, more growth and less poverty. We do not live in an ideal world but we are striving to ensure that the UN can make the world a better place, and we will continue to do so. The results of the summit were exceptionally successful for 191 nations working together in partnership.</p>            </div>

It is clear from the debate that there are still issues outstanding: the peacekeeping commission, the human rights commission, the definition of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation and the reform of the administration. In many ways, this is the start of the story rather than the end. The debate has covered a wide range of subjects. Many of the issues raised could themselves have formed the subject of a debate, whether it be the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a> round or the memorandum circulated on conditionality&#8212;I agree with the Minister, although I did not refer to it in the introduction to my report&#8212;to say nothing of whether the European Union should have membership of the Security Council.</p> <p pid="c.267.0/2">However, the report was on the EU's role at the millennium review summit. It is clear from this debate and the report that the EU took a co-ordinated approach. Very detailed work was done over a long period so that the June European Council conclusions could be produced in preparation for the summit. The co-ordinated approach continued. It is interesting to note that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> was able to make a statement to the General Assembly on behalf of the 25 members of the European Union, the acceding countries of Bulgaria and Romania, the then candidate countries of Turkey and Croatia, the countries of the stabilisation association process and potential candidates <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia-Herzegovina">Bosnia-Herzegovina</a>, the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, as well as Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova. They all aligned themselves with that statement. That is quite an impressive achievement for the European Union.</p> <p pid="c.267.0/3">I thank all noble Lords who have spoken in the debate. All are members of the EU sub-committee, except the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Watson">Lord Watson</a>, who is a former member. It is perhaps indicative of the commitment of members of the sub-committee to the subject that the noble Lord, Lord Lea, has chosen to spend his birthday evening with us debating the report. It would not be in order for me to move a resolution of happy returns, but we wish him that.</p>            </div>
