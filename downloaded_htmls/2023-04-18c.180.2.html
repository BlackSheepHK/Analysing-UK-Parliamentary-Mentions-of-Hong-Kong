Gentleman&#8217;s <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> and his corner of the United Kingdom are marking the very important anniversary of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday">Good Friday</a> agreement; we wish everyone who is marking that occasion the very best for the future. I know that there are points of contention with his party, but one reason why we are so very committed to the Windsor framework is that we want to ensure that issues that have arisen through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> protocol are resolved with the EU to enable the economic flourishing that he rightly describes.</p> <p pid="c165.2/2">I can reassure the hon. Gentleman and my right hon. Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Hampshire">North West Hampshire</a> that even with the increase to 25%, we will still have the lowest rate of corporation tax in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a>. What is more, it will be lower than at any point before 2010. I very much hope that the Committee understands why we are taking this approach: because we have to take a fiscally responsible approach to our public finances, but we want to do so while encouraging growth and international competitiveness.</p> <p pid="c165.2/3"><a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 6 will maintain the small profits rate, as I hope I explained in answer to my right hon. Friend&#8217;s <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>. Clause 11 will update the patent box legislation to reflect the introduction of the small profits rate. The patent box incentivises the retention and commercialisation of <a href="/glossary/?gl=261" title="patents (for inventions), trade marks, protected designs, and copyrights;..." class="glossary">intellectual property</a>, allowing UK companies to elect to pay a lower rate based on their earnings from patents or similarly robust <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP">IP</a>. This is part of our drive to encourage innovation and growth in our economy.</p> <p pid="c165.2/4">We are not stopping there. A competitive corporate tax system that supports growth, investment and innovation is about so much more than just the headline corporation tax rate; the availability and generosity of reliefs also matter. Clause 7 will therefore introduce new first year capital allowances, including a 100% first year allowance for qualifying new main rate plant and machinery investments, known as full expensing. It will also introduce a 50% first year allowance for new special rate expenditure such as long-life assets. Full expensing offers a substantial financial incentive for companies to increase their investment, improving their cash flow by lowering their corporation tax bill in the year of investment.</p> <p pid="c165.2/5">These changes will provide a &#163;27 billion tax cut for companies over three years. They will help to boost business investment by ensuring that the UK&#8217;s capital allowances regime is among the world&#8217;s most competitive: joint first by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> net present value. The independent <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Budget_Responsibility">Office for Budget Responsibility</a> estimates that full expensing will increase business investment by 3% for each year that it is in place. What is more, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> has set out his intention to make the measure permanent when fiscal conditions allow.</p> <p pid="c165.2/6">Clause 8 will set the maximum amount of the annual investment allowance at &#163;1,000,000 indefinitely, providing certainty to the more than 99% of businesses that invest up to that amount.</p> <p pid="c165.2/7">Clause 9 will make changes to extend the generous 100% first year allowance for electric vehicle charging equipment. This will continue to encourage businesses to invest in the roll-out of charging equipment, which will be a key enabler of the transition to zero-emission vehicles.</p> <p pid="c165.2/8">Clause 10 and schedule 1 set out changes that will modernise research and development tax reliefs in order to better incentivise R&amp;D methods that rely on vast quantities of data which are analysed and processed via the cloud. These changes will also help reduce error and fraud, requiring claims to include more information&#8212;including the name of any agent involved&#8212;and to be provided digitally. The Government have tabled <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 14, which is a technical fix to ensure that companies claiming small and medium-sized enterprise credits will be able to benefit from the change in the going concern rules.</p> <p pid="c165.2/9">Clause 12 will introduce a new rate of investment allowance in the energy profits levy, set at 80%, for qualifying expenditure on decarbonising upstream  oil and gas production. This builds on the existing 29% investment allowance which is designed to encourage the sector to reinvest its profits to support the economy, jobs, and the UK&#8217;s energy security. It supports key commitments in the North sea transition deal and the Government&#8217;s aims for net zero by 2050. Clauses 13 and 14 will extend the duration of the reliefs available to our important cultural sectors, including orchestras, theatres,  museums and galleries, to meet ongoing pressures and to boost investment in those wonderful and important cultural bodies.</p> <p pid="c165.2/10">The final clause relating to investment incentives is clause 15. As well as making other improvements, it increases the amount of seed enterprise investment scheme funding that companies can raise over their lifetimes from &#163;150,000 to &#163;250,000. This will boost start-ups and young companies by widening access to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEIS">SEIS</a> and increasing the funding limits, and we estimate that it will help more than 2,000 very early-stage companies a year to gain access to finance.</p>            </div>

That may be a reflection of the wider economic environment, but it nevertheless means that fewer businesses are being started under that scheme. Will the Minister and her Treasury colleagues give some consideration over the next few years to the sheer complexity that is involved in making what is a relatively small investment through the SEIS? The scheme deals with quite small amounts of capital&#8212;&#163;25,000 or so&#8212;but an accountant and a lawyer are needed, as is pre-authorisation from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Majesty">His Majesty</a>&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_and_Customs">Revenue and Customs</a>. An enormous amount of compliance is required even before a company makes its first investment, and a fair amount of the investment that is being made can be absorbed in compliance costs. Complexity is therefore as much of a deterrent as the limits on the scheme, which may be why it is not being taken up with the enthusiasm that I am sure the Minister would like to see.</p>            </div>

Friend for that <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>. I am trying to ensure that, not just in the context of this fiscal event but in our work across the Treasury, we focus on the pressure points involved in developing a business&#8212;setting it up, employing the first member of staff, and all the other major milestones that constitute a critical part of the journey towards growing a business. Obviously there has to be paperwork, but we want to ensure that it does not get in the way.</p> <p pid="c167.1/2">I will take away some of the ideas that my right hon. Friend has advanced, but let me also say that I very much understand his concerns. One of the main challenges that I issue to the Treasury during every one of our policy discussions is &#8220;Does this proposal make tax fairer, does it make it simpler, and does it support growth?&#8221; Those are the three objectives that I will be endeavouring to meet in all my work as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Secretary">Financial Secretary</a> to the Treasury.</p> <p pid="c167.1/3">Let me now turn to the measures in clauses 121 to 277 and schedules 14 to 18, which constitute a large proportion of the Bill. I know that, rightly, they are meeting the sort of scrutiny that we expect of parliamentary colleagues, because they relate to a very significant international agreement. In 2021, my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> brokered an international deal as part of our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a> presidency to tackle profit shifting by large multinational groups and to level the playing field between countries for tax competition. That will ensure that countries are  better able to tax the profits that multinational groups generate from trading in their jurisdictions. More than 135 countries have now signed up to the deal, including all members of the G7.</p> <p pid="c167.1/4">These changes mean that, regardless of where a multinational group operates, it pays tax of at least 15% on its revenues, or profits. This will protect the UK from multinational tax planning by removing the incentives to shift profits out of the UK for tax purposes, and will help to ensure that profits generated in the UK are taxed in the UK. It will also strengthen the UK&#8217;s international competitiveness by raising the floor on the low&#8212;or no&#8212;tax rates that have been available in some countries, while ensuring that groups are not exposed to top-up taxation in the UK as a result of the UK&#8217;s world-leading R&amp;D credit and full expensing regimes. Finally, it will ensure that the top-up tax due from UK groups under pillar two is collected in the UK rather than being collected by other countries, which could be the case if we did not implement these arrangements by <phrase class="date" code="">31 December</phrase>.</p>            </div>

It is of course important for multinational companies to pay their fair share of tax, but for too long too many have not done so, and it is good news that action is being taken in that regard. If it is to work, however, we must ensure that other countries not only sign up to the rules but implement them. I am thinking in particular of the possible impact on sectors such as insurance. My <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> contains a great many insurance companies, and many of my constituents work in the sector. It is a global industry, in which we happen to be the world leader.</p> <p pid="c168.0/2">We need to ensure that other countries implement these rules, as they have promised to do, and do not end up trying to avoid doing so, thus undermining our own competitiveness and potentially forcing businesses that have been paying tax in the UK to go overseas. May I therefore urge my hon. Friend and her excellent team at the Treasury to focus, laser-like, on ensuring that all countries do implement the rules, as they have promised? We have seen, time and again, many EU countries signing up to rules and then not implementing them in accordance with the timescales. Will my hon. Friend also ensure that if other countries try to retaliate against our measures&#8212;through sanctions, for example&#8212;we will not just rely on the undertaxed profits rule to ensure that we can obtain taxes from them, but will have a plan B up our own sleeve to ensure that our industries and our competitiveness are not threatened?</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 132 determines how multinationals should calculate their effective tax rate for a territory. Clauses 133 to 172 set out how multinational groups should determine their underlying profit and then make adjustments. Clauses 173 to 192 describe how to determine the amount of taxes called covered taxes paid by a multinational that should be included in the effective tax rate calculation. Clauses 193 to 199 set out how multinationals should use the effective tax rate and adjusted profit they have calculated to work out how much top-up tax, if any, is due for each territory in which they operate.</p> <p pid="c168.1/4">Clauses 200 and 201 set out how much of the top-up tax in the low-tax jurisdiction should be attributed to the responsible members of the group. Clauses 202 to 219 set out further adjustments to deal with particular circumstances, including losses, and rules that apply an additional top-up amount where the covered taxes are less than expected.</p> <p pid="c168.1/5">Many multinationals will include entities that are not wholly owned. This means that they need specific rules, which are set out in clauses 226 to 229. Clauses 220 to 225 set out how the rules work for investment entities, which was a key ask for the insurance sector. I am providing this level of detail at this stage to give the House a sense of just how much work has gone into this set of rules internationally and, importantly, how we in the UK have managed to influence and shape the rules before we bring them before the House in this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Bill">Finance Bill</a>. Clauses 230 to 259 provide definitions for the various terms, and clauses 260 to 264 set out general and miscellaneous provisions.</p> <p pid="c168.1/6">The Government are also introducing technical adjustments in amendments 12 to 13 and 15 to 20. <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> 12 will remove unnecessary duplication. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment_13">Amendment 13</a> will ensure that tax paid that contributes to the effective tax rate is appropriately allocated to group members. Amendments 15 to 20 will ensure that the transitional rules work effectively.</p> <p pid="c168.1/7">Part 4 of the Bill focuses on the domestic top-up tax, which will largely mirror the functionality of the multinational top-up tax but which is in itself an important measure because it ensures that multinational groups operating in the UK pay any top-up tax here on their UK profits. Without it&#8212;this is the critical point about implementation&#8212;other countries that have introduced a multinational top-up tax will collect this tax. The domestic top-up tax will also apply to groups that operate only in the UK, ensuring that all in-scope groups operating in the UK are treated consistently, preventing economic distortions. Clauses 265 to 277 deal with both the domestic top-up tax and the interplay with the multinational top-up tax legislation.</p> <p pid="c168.1/8">I listened carefully to the scrutiny provided by right hon. and hon. Friends on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>, and I want to try to answer one or two of the points raised. That is important, because this is what <a href="/glossary/?gl=96" title="The clause by clause consideration of a parliamentary bill takes place at..." class="glossary">Committee of the whole House</a> is for, after all. On the question of implementation and the actions of others, which my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25614" title="Our page on Vicky Ford - 'the Member for Chelmsford (Vicky Ford)'">Vicky Ford</a> has just raised, the UK is not acting alone here. Germany, Spain, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Ireland and Belgium&#8212; indeed, the EU as a whole&#8212;are acting alongside us, as  are Canada, South Korea and Japan. South Africa, Singapore and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> are all preparing to implement in 2024 or 2025. [Interruption.] I hear chuntering from behind me, so I will break some of that down. Those countries are in the process of legislating. In fact, since we last met, Ireland has published draft legislation and Japan has enacted its <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a>. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> already knows that the EU has set a directive for implementation by <phrase class="date" code="">31 December</phrase>, and we are working closely with the largest EU member states to ensure that progress is made.</p> <p pid="c168.1/9">I know that colleagues also focus on the US, so I will spend a little bit of time on this. In 2017 the US introduced a minimum tax on the foreign income of its multinationals. It has also recently introduced a further minimum tax on the aggregate domestic and foreign income of large groups, which includes the US income of foreign-headed multinationals. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_US">The US</a> therefore already has in place rules that operate on a similar basis to pillar two, and it has been one of the strongest advocates of developing a global standard. This means that the differences in outcomes for US businesses are perhaps not as large as some of my hon. Friends might think.</p>            </div>

That is why, with the US having its own rules and with its encouragement that these global standards should be applied, we are in lockstep with other countries in implementing this rule. I would just make the point that this is unprecedented; this is new and we have to be realistic. A hundred years ago we did not have multinational groups operating in the way that they do today, or in the way they will in five or 10 years&#8217; time. We as an international community are trying to deal with some of the aggressive tax planning that we have seen multinational groups indulge in. We want to raise the floor, and those economies have signed up to this. They are part of the 135 countries that have committed themselves to this agreement. That is what was so important about the agreement, and these taxes will apply in those jurisdictions even if they have not implemented it.</p>            </div>

Was she saying that the other countries in the international community that have signed up to it have effectively agreed that America does not need to go any further than its existing legislation in order to meet the requirements of this international standard?

Are we likely to see Governments around the world play a game of competitive subsidies and competitive allowances? We will have full expensing, but some of our competitors will not&#8212;full expensing will reduce the effective rate for quite a lot of capital-intensive businesses, although not necessarily for services businesses&#8212;but there will now be a menu of allowances, derogations and tax breaks that can effectively be used to play a slight game of subterfuge as we all compete for these large, and now very mobile, businesses to locate in our territories.</p>            </div>

Indeed, I said that in the Budget debate and on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>. We believe it is fair to have a spectrum of corporation tax thresholds between 19% and 25% as businesses grow and accrue profits, but I fully admit that does not make it simple. The balance the Government have to strike is where there might be tension between fairness and simplicity. Of course, we always want to ensure that fairness prevails.</p> <p pid="c173.2/2">I take my right hon. Friend&#8217;s point about complexity, but I gently remind him that these enormous multinational groups have armies of lawyers and accountants looking after their affairs. One might say that many of them have been able to shift their profits in this way because they are able to conduct that analysis. I should say that they are doing it completely lawfully, and there is no allegation of misfeasance, but we wish to bring forward this international agreement.</p> <p pid="c173.2/3">In the 21st century, we should not be frivolous or dismissive about encouraging businesses to invest in plant, machinery and people. I know my right hon. Friend is not being frivolous or dismissive, but this is not a game. If we can encourage multinational groups to come and do more business here, to invest in our workforce and in other businesses, that would be a great thing for the UK economy. This international agreement is about trying to introduce a level playing field in 135 countries to ensure multinationals are taxed fairly in each jurisdiction.</p> <p pid="c173.2/4">Finally, if we do not implement this measure, the top-up tax that these groups would have paid to the UK will be collected by other countries.

This may be a little niche, but may I take her back to the experience of the United States? A large number of US multinational companies, such as Apple and others that will be covered by this measure, held their cash balances offshore and did not take them back to the US because of the levels of corporation tax. Those levels were reduced under <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Trump">President Trump</a> from 33% to 21% or 25%, I believe, but then in addition a special law was introduced providing for a 15.5% repatriation tax. That one-off tax enabled or incentivised companies such as Apple to bring their resources back to the US and pay tax there. Under the specifications both within the UK and under our international agreements, will what she is asking us to support today enable the UK to make one-off changes that might be in the specific interests of our corporations to help them bring back capital here?

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c174.3/1">Thank you, Dame Rosie, for the opportunity to respond on behalf of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a>. I would like to speak to the amendments and new clauses in my name and that of my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25846" title="Our page on Abena Oppong-Asare - 'the Member for Erith and Thamesmead (Abena Oppong-Asare)'">Abena Oppong-Asare</a>.</p> <p pid="c174.3/2">When we debated this Bill&#8217;s <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> at end of last month, we made it clear that what we needed was a plan to get us out of what the previous <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> rightly called a &#8220;vicious cycle of stagnation&#8221;. We need a plan for growth&#8212;a plan to raise the living standards of everyone in every part of the country&#8212;but this Government have failed to offer us one. That much was clear from the data published alongside the Budget, which showed that ours is the only <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a> economy forecast to shrink this year and that our long-term growth forecasts were downgraded in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Budget_Responsibility">Office for Budget Responsibility</a> report.</p> <p pid="c174.3/3">Since we last debated this Bill, further data has been published confirming our fears. Earlier this month, a report from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> put the UK&#8217;s growth prospects this year at the bottom of those of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20">G20</a> biggest economies&#8212;a group that includes sanctions-hit Russia. After 13 years of economic failure, people and businesses across the UK deserve so much better than that. They deserve a plan for the economy that offers more than managed decline. So today, we begin by looking at some of the measures the Government are seeking to introduce in this Bill and explaining why their approach is letting Britain down.</p> <p pid="c174.3/4">First, let me speak to clauses 5 to 15, which address the rate of corporation tax, capital allowances and other reliefs relating to businesses. On those, one thing prized above all else is the need for certainty and stability. Businesses across the country want stability, certainty and a long-term plan, yet under the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> corporation tax has changed almost every year since 2010. Furthermore, as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_Foundation">Resolution Foundation</a> has pointed out, the introduction of the latest temporary regime for corporation tax represents the fifth major change in just two years. It seems that the Conservatives are simply incapable of offering stability.</p> <p pid="c174.3/5">Let us start by looking at the main rate of corporation tax, which <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 5 sets at 25% for the financial year beginning in April 2024. The clause will mean that corporation tax will continue to be charged at the rate to which it rose at the start of this month. That rate, 25%, was first announced by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, when he was Chancellor, in his spring Budget 2021. One might think that sounds like a rare example of certainty, but, sadly, that is not the case. As we know, last September, the then Chancellor, the one who said our economy was trapped in a &#8220;vicious cycle of stagnation&#8221;, announced that the rise to 25% would be cancelled, leaving the rate at 19%. That was of course reversed just a month later, when the current Chancellor moved into No. 11, and confirmed that the rise to 25% was back on. So much for stability! But we are where we are, and if we are to assume that the current Chancellor&#8217;s plans will indeed go ahead&#8212;a bold assumption, I admit&#8212;the rise to 25% will now continue from April 2024.</p> <p pid="c174.3/6">With the rate of corporation tax being increased, it is particularly important to get capital allowances right. The Government should be focused on giving businesses certainty that will help them to plan and increase their investment in the UK economy. We need that certainty and greater investment&#8212;the UK currently has the lowest investment as a percentage of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a> in the G7&#8212;yet the approach in clause 7 is to introduce temporary full expensing for expenditure on plant and machinery for three years only. By making that change temporary, it only brings forward investment, rather than increasing its level overall. The Government&#8217;s own policy paper on this measure, published on the day of the Budget, makes that clear. It says:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c174.3/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;This measure will incentivise businesses to bring forward investment to benefit from the tax relief.&#8221;</p> <p pid="c174.3/8">As the Office for Budget Responsibility has made clear, the Government&#8217;s approach will mean that business investment between 2022 and 2028 is essentially unchanged as a result of these measures. If anything, there is a very slight fall. Britain deserves better than this. As Paul  Johnson of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Fiscal_Studies">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a> said in response to this temporary tweak to the tax regime for businesses:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c174.3/9" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;There&#8217;s no stability, no certainty, and no sense of a wider plan.&#8221;</p> <p pid="c174.3/10">That is why we have tabled new clause 3, which would require the Chancellor to follow Labour&#8217;s lead by developing a wider plan for business taxes, which we believe is needed. As my right hon.

We know that where taxation is concerned the creation of a window can often create an incentive to move quickly. For example, when there was a stamp duty window, we saw a significant number of transactions brought forward and take place. The Government are saying that they want to see very significant investment taking place. We know that British industry has accumulated a large amount of cash on its balance sheets. Why would the Government not create a particular incentive by saying, &#8220;Look, there is a deadline. If you get in now, we will give you this very generous tax break and then who knows what may happen in the future&#8221;? We must not forget that although the investment may absorb all of the profit for small businesses, it will, in effect, create a tax loss that is able to be carried forward beyond the window. So I do not understand his criticism of our having a window if, as the Government say, they want action now rather than in three years&#8217; time.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c176.1/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> but I feel he rather misses the point. Surely having a temporary change merely moves investment around, rather than increasing its overall level, as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBR">OBR</a> has set out. We have the lowest investment as a percentage of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a> in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a>, so the importance of increasing investment should be agreed by Members in all parts of this House. We need a wider plan that will give that stability and certainty, which is exactly what my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> has set out. She has set out Labour&#8217;s mission to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7, which means that in government we would review the business tax system and set out a clear road map to provide that certainty and boost investment.</p> <p pid="c176.1/2">New <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 3 speaks to that, and perhaps the right hon. Gentleman would like to join us by voting for it later this evening. It would require the Government to follow our lead by initiating that review of business taxes that we want to see now. Such a review would make recommendations on how to give businesses more certainty about the taxes they need to pay, and how to make sure that the system of capital allowances operates effectively to incentivise investment. The new clause would require the review to be conducted, and recommendations on how to increase certainty and investment to be published, within six months of the current <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Bill">Finance Bill</a> becoming law. I urge Ministers and, indeed, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Benchers">Back Benchers</a> to accept and support new clause 3. If they do not, I at least encourage Ministers to give as much certainty as possible by making it clear what their plans for capital allowances are beyond the three-year period covered by clause 7.</p> <p pid="c176.1/3">Beyond the capital allowances in clauses 7 to 9, the Bill introduces other reliefs relating to businesses in clauses 10 to 15. I wish to ask the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> a fairly technical point about clause 10 and its associated schedule 1. As we know, clause 10 introduces changes to the research and development tax relief for small and medium-sized companies and to the R&amp;D expenditure credit, which is mainly claimed by larger companies. The clause widens qualifying expenditure to include data licences and cloud computing services, and introduces new compliance measures. More widely, we are concerned that the Government&#8217;s piecemeal and rapid changes to R&amp;D reliefs are causing uncertainty. As we know&#8212;we have discussed this already today&#8212;such an approach is harmful to the effectiveness of reliefs and does not help the UK&#8217;s position in attracting investment. We are also aware, however, that there are concerns that the claim notification measure in this clause may be poorly targeted. Although it will prevent some dubious claims, it may well mean that many genuine claims, and disproportionately those from smaller companies, will fall out of time.</p> <p pid="c176.1/4">On the detailed changes introduced by clause 10, I wish to ask the Minister a specific question about the wording of a new power for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Majesty">His Majesty</a>&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_and_Customs">Revenue and Customs</a>, to which the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartered_Institute_of_Taxation">Chartered Institute of Taxation</a> has helpfully drawn our attention. Paragraph 14 of schedule 1 introduces a new power for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMRC">HMRC</a> to remove a claim for R&amp;D relief from a corporation tax return when an officer of HMRC</p> <p class="indent" pid="c176.1/5" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;reasonably believes that a claimant company has failed to comply with a requirement relating to the making of the claim&#8221;.</p> <p pid="c176.1/6">There is no right of appeal against a decision of HMRC made pursuant to this power. It seems that the Government&#8217;s intention is for this new power to be used only in relation to the new compliance measure introduced by the Bill. However, it is not clear that the wording of the new legislation itself is limited in that way. To suggest a potential solution to this problem, we have tabled <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 26. It is a clear and technical amendment, drafted by the Chartered Institute of Taxation, and I encourage the Minister to accept it and make it part of the Bill.</p> <p pid="c176.1/7">Clause 12 introduces a new investment allowance at a rate of 80% for oil and gas companies for investment in the decarbonisation of upstream petroleum production activities. As Members from all parts of the House will know, Labour has been calling for a windfall tax on oil and gas giants since January last year to help fund support for people struggling with the cost of living. After months of pressure, the current <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, and other Conservative Members, were finally dragged kicking and screaming into introducing an energy profits levy in May last year. At every turn, however, the Government have left loopholes and weaknesses in their version of the windfall tax, and they have stubbornly refused our calls to address them.</p> <p pid="c176.1/8">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a>&#8217; refusal to strengthen the windfall tax means that billions of pounds of profits of the oil and gas giants are being left on the table. They are refusing to strengthen the windfall tax on those oil and gas giants while, at the same time, pushing up taxes for people across the country through a 5% hike in council tax. If we were in power, a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> would freeze council tax this year, funded by a proper windfall tax on the oil and gas giants. That is Labour&#8217;s fair way to help families through the cost of living crisis. All the  Conservatives have to offer is yet more tax rises on working people. If any Conservative Members agree with us, they can join us in voting for new clause 6.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c178.1/1">The hon. Member is right to point that out that, in addition to the points that I have made, the Government&#8217;s decision has a climate change impact. It shows, I think, in the design of the windfall tax that investment allowances really should have no place in a proper windfall tax on oil and gas giants&#8217; profits. We want to scrap those investment allowances and to make sure that that money is spent helping people through the cost of living crisis that we face right now. I would very much welcome the hon. Member and any Member on the Conservative Benches joining us in voting for new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 6, which will force the Government to come clean about how much money they would raise by strengthening the windfall tax&#8212;money that could go towards freezing council tax this year.</p> <p pid="c178.1/2">I have spoken so far about the clauses of the Bill that relate to the main rates of corporation tax, capital allowances and reliefs. I now turn my attention to another important way that the Bill impacts on corporation tax through parts 3 and 4, which relate to the new multinational top-up tax and the related domestic top-up tax. As I set out earlier, we desperately need greater stability and certainty in business taxes and allowances to help the economy grow in the future. We also need greater fairness to help people with the cost of living crisis right now.</p> <p pid="c178.1/3">That principle of fairness is crucial in making sure that British businesses that pay their fair share of tax face a level playing field when competing with large multinationals that may not do so. That is why we have, for so long, pressed the Government to back an ambitious global minimum tax rate for large multinationals. We have long needed an international deal on a global minimum corporate tax rate to stop the international race to the bottom and to help raise revenue to support British public services. We welcome the international agreement, fostered by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a>, that makes sure that large multinationals pay a minimum level of 15% tax in each jurisdiction in which they operate.</p> <p pid="c178.1/4">As I set out on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>, it has been a long and winding path to get to this point. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, when he was <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a>, was often lukewarm in his support of such an approach. However, the deal now faces a new front of challenges, as Conservative <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Benchers">Back Benchers</a> have begun to be open in their hostility towards the implementation of the deal, as we have seen in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> today. We believe that it is crucial to get this legislation in place, so I hope the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> can reassure us today that those parts of the Bill that introduce a multinational top-up tax will not be bargained away in the face of <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> from Conservative Back Benchers.</p> <p pid="c178.1/5">On <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Reading">Second Reading</a>, we heard from <a href="/mp/?p=24778" title="Our page on Priti Patel - 'the right hon. Member for Witham (Priti Patel)'">Priti Patel</a> and others as they rallied their colleagues against the global minimum rate of tax for large multinationals. We therefore want to  press the Government to make sure that, in the face of opposition from their Back Benchers, they do not back away from implementing this landmark deal.</p> <p pid="c178.1/6">That is why we have tabled new clause 1, which would require the Chancellor to report every three months for a year on the Government&#8217;s progress in supporting the implementation of OECD pillar two rules. The quarterly reports mandated by the new clause would update the House on the Government&#8217;s progress towards implementation. Those updates must include details of what efforts the Government have undertaken to make the rules as effective as possible. They must explain what the Government have done to encourage more countries to implement the pillar two rules&#8212;a point made by <a href="/mp/?p=25614" title="Our page on Vicky Ford - 'the right hon. Member for Chelmsford (Vicky Ford)'">Vicky Ford</a>, who is no longer <a href="/glossary/?gl=144" title="Of a female MP, sitting on her regular seat in the House. For males, &quot;in..." class="glossary">in her place</a>. This is important because we know that the rules will be more effective the more widely they are implemented. I hope that the Government will support our new clause, which commits them to giving these updates. Surely that is a matter on which we broadly agree. Even if Ministers do not support the new clause, I hope that many Conservative Back Benchers do.</p> <p pid="c178.1/7">On Second Reading, the right hon. Member for Witham expressed her concern that the implementation of the OECD rules had so far progressed with &#8220;very limited scrutiny&#8221;.</p> <p pid="c178.1/8">Although I know that she and I, and others on the Conservative Benches, may have very different views on these rules and on what they will achieve, surely she and her fellow Back Benchers will not vote against transparency and will not try to block our new clause that simply requires updates to Parliament every three months.</p>            </div>

We tend to have a reputation for gold-plating all our regulations. My concern is that other countries will not do what they say they will do. By enacting this legislation, my concern is that other countries will not do so. The hon. Gentleman has been extolling the virtues of supporting British enterprise, but Labour&#8217;s approach runs the risk of putting British companies at a disadvantage, because the United States and other countries may not move forward as we introduce these restrictions.

Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 2 would require the Government to set out their approach to pillar one of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> agreement and the digital services tax. We know that, unlike pillar two, the implementation of which is proceeding both here in the UK and in many countries overseas, the prospects of pillar one being implemented in the near future look less positive. That is likely to have an impact on the Government&#8217;s approach to the digital services tax, so I urge the Government to support our new clause, which requires the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> to make a statement to the House on the matter. While new clause 2 has not been selected today, I none the less encourage the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> to set out the Government&#8217;s approach to pillar one and the digital services tax in her closing remarks.</p> <p pid="c180.1/3">Through today&#8217;s debate on the Bill&#8217;s clauses and our amendments, we have seen the state that the Government are in. We have seen how they are failing to provide our economy with the stability and certainty that is needed for growth&#8212;growth that we need in every part of the country to make everyone, rather than just a few, better off. We have seen how the Government&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Benchers">Back Benchers</a> risk putting their party before our country at every turn, and how they are unable to provide the long-term plan that people and businesses need.

It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>.</p> <p pid="c180.2/2">I am on the record as having concerns about not just the implementation but the purpose of all this. No one would disagree that multinational companies need to pay their fair share of tax, but I question the way we are going about achieving that. I put it on the record that I was semi-humoured by the comments of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> spokesperson just now. Even when the Labour party is taking a break from its efforts to heap extra burdens on businesses, which is obviously what it stands for, it is raising concerns about implementation timetables.</p> <p pid="c180.2/3">Labour has missed the opportunity to speak up for British businesses, so it falls to those on the Conservative side of the House to do that. We believe in competition, business growth and business investment. My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25614" title="Our page on Vicky Ford - 'the Member for Chelmsford (Vicky Ford)'">Vicky Ford</a> is not <a href="/glossary/?gl=144" title="Of a female MP, sitting on her regular seat in the House. For males, &quot;in..." class="glossary">in her place</a> right now, but sectors such as insurance employ my constituents, probably the constituents of <a href="/mp/?p=25801" title="Our page on James Murray - 'the hon. Member for Ealing North (James Murray)'">James Murray</a> and hundreds of thousands of constituents up and down the country. Those are the types of jobs we should try to safeguard in the United Kingdom.</p> <p pid="c180.2/4">The hon. Gentleman was partisan, so I will make a point now as well: the response of the Labour party is always to build up even more red tape, regulations and reporting. I think we all know how we adopt regulations in this country. My own personal view, which I attested to on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Reading">Second Reading</a>, is that I would like to have a delay to implementation until we see a critical mass of other countries, including very significant competitors, moving some way towards implementing the tax, as has been said by colleagues this afternoon.</p> <p pid="c180.2/5">As my hon. Friend the Minister already knows from interventions today and from Second Reading, I feel that this new tax risks placing significant compliance costs on British businesses, which are already paying well above the minimum 15% tax rate. We must recognise that there are current pressures and that these inevitable costs will be fed on to consumers. I have touched on the insurance sector, but at the end of the day it is consumers who will end up picking up the costs through higher premiums and other impacts on them. On top of consumer prices, which bear the brunt of that and are also inflationary, there is no way, given the delays that we are seeing elsewhere, that implementing this tax will not have an impact on our competitiveness. By pressing ahead, we risk capital flight and jeopardising future investment income.</p> <p pid="c180.2/6">I have a range of questions to put the Minister shortly. I understand the reassurances that she has shared with the House today about other jurisdictions, but we have to be honest with people and say that we are not seeing a mass move towards co-ordinated implementation. That is not happening. We understand that that is down to electoral cycles and all sorts of pressures within other jurisdictions, and I also acknowledge that she pointed to Germany, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands as having published draft legislation. However, only three EU member states are reaching the stage that we were at last July, and that does not mean they are meeting the parallel process on the timetable for implementation. She also pointed to Japan and Canada; Japan is interesting, because its legislation delays implementation until several months after the UK&#8217;s, while Canada is yet to pass its legislation for a whole range of reasons.</p> <p pid="c180.2/7">We should level with everyone, particularly because we as <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> believe in British businesses and the risks they take and know that they look to the Government of the day to give them certainty and support&#8212;I will come on to the support side in a moment. We must be clear with businesses about the environment in which we will be bringing in this measure, what it will be like and what it will mean for them. That is even before we come to the problem of the United States, which, as my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24787" title="Our page on Richard Fuller - 'the Member for North East Bedfordshire (Richard Fuller)'">Richard Fuller</a> touched on, is not implementing pillar two at all, and Singapore and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, which are also important jurisdictions for financial institutions and which will be delaying implementation until 2025.</p> <p pid="c180.2/8">I entirely understand the Minister&#8217;s point about the revenue-raising nature of this measure, but, given the delays in key and significant jurisdictions, those revenue  projections are fluid&#8212;and I am being polite in using the word &#8220;fluid&#8221;; we could say they are uncertain, as they already were, but I think we could even go further and say they are probably in jeopardy. We need greater scrutiny of some of the revenue figures.</p> <p pid="c180.2/9"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> has seen the research by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartered_Institute_of_Taxation">Chartered Institute of Taxation</a>, which has already said it is in doubt whether pillar two will raise the &#163;2 billion annually that the Government are predicting. Perhaps it would be useful for the Committee to get a greater understanding of the projections, the calculations and the insights used in considering this matter, because that institute and others have raised concerns around the figures.</p> <p pid="c180.2/10">Those institutions also raise concerns about the implementation timelines, which have been the subject of discussion. I would rather see no implementation or see implementation delayed until others look at it. However, since we are using the tool of primary legislation to bring this measure forward, at a time when the matter is still under live international discussion, which could change in months&#8212;that is the nature of the world and the markets&#8212;we need to understand what it means for British businesses and the complexities that it will bring to them.</p> <p pid="c180.2/11">On the point of complexity, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Fiscal_Studies">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a> recently released its own report expressing significant concerns about that, and many of us made the point on Second Reading about what that means for businesses. No doubt they have an army of tax lawyers, but will this be a perverse incentive? Will it have unintended consequences?</p> <p pid="c180.2/12">On Second Reading I also touched on significant questions about international dispute resolution, which have still not been answered and which raise considerable concerns. We still have wider concerns about implementation, other jurisdictions, the ways of working and how we will resolve some of those unanswered questions. I urge Ministers to come back on Report with solutions to the points that I have made and others will no doubt make. We really do need to see what this means not just for businesses but for the whole principle of accountability, fairness and transparency internationally.</p> <p pid="c180.2/13">We have spoken about the European Union and the United States, but the impact on British jobs and businesses is our predominant concern. I raised the whole issue of tax sovereignty. The wider implications of the policy measure for our tax sovereignty have not been unpacked. I have previously touched on the threats to competitiveness, but I genuinely feel right now that, for a country and a Government who believe in free market fundamentals, in having a dynamic economy that embraces free enterprise, and in low and simple taxation, these measures could be regressive&#8212;we could actually be going backwards. My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25346" title="Our page on Kit Malthouse - 'the Member for North West Hampshire (Kit Malthouse)'">Kit Malthouse</a> mentioned the infamous tax guide for accountants. When accountants have to follow tomes of guidance, that goes against the grain of tax simplification. I am concerned that part of the Bill really fails to address those issues.</p> <p pid="c180.2/14">I have one plea for the Minister. She understands that this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Bill">Finance Bill</a> has such a significant section dedicated to international taxation&#8212;the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> rate of taxation&#8212;so I urge her to reflect on the comments that I and many others have made, which very much come from industry. I and many colleagues wrote to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> before the Budget back in March with a range of concerns. We  have not yet even had a response to that letter. I think it is important that we see proper, considered responses to all the concerns that we have raised&#8212;that is absolutely appropriate. Before jumping headlong into implementation without proper timescales, without thinking through the consequences of what the provisions mean and with other jurisdictions acting independently and changing their own legislative parameters, will the Minister come back to this House with significant answers to my questions?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c183.1/1">It is a pleasure to take part in a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Bill">Finance Bill</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=96" title="The clause by clause consideration of a parliamentary bill takes place at..." class="glossary">Committee of the whole House</a>. I will raise a number of points, particularly in relation to the new clauses and to what the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> said about them.</p> <p pid="c183.1/2"><a href="/mp/?p=24778" title="Our page on Priti Patel - 'The right hon. Member for Witham (Priti Patel)'">Priti Patel</a> mentioned tax simplification. During later consideration of the Bill, we will raise questions about the removal of the Office for Tax Simplification, what has happened to the Government&#8217;s assessment of the benefit of that office, whether we will have an issue with removing that office, and whether there will be a cost to the public purse or to businesses as a result of.</p> <p pid="c183.1/3">We will support <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> new clauses 1, 3 and 6. We would also support new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 10 if it were pressed to a vote. I will talk a little about new clauses 6 and 10 on requests for transparency. It is incredibly important that we have transparency about how allowances, tax and everything else put in place by the Treasury&#8212;and, in fact, by every Government Department&#8212;work. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Book">The Red Book</a> that is produced at Budget time gives us a genuine idea and expectation of how much any measure&#8212;be it an investment allowance, a new tax measure, or something else&#8212;is expected to generate, but the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> are not terribly good at putting in place post-implementation reviews of such tax measures.</p> <p pid="c183.1/4">We do not have enough transparency on whether the tax measures put in place have actually achieved what the Government intended. In fact, I tabled a written question on this some time ago, and various Government Departments were unable to tell me even how many post-implementation reviews they had carried out and whether there were any that they had not carried out. It seems to me pretty fundamental that the Government should fulfil their role of calculating the cost or benefit and saying whether the projection has seemed accurate. It is all well and good for the Government to say, &#8220;This is going to raise &#163;100 million,&#8221; but if they do not then assess whether it did, how can we be sure that a measure had the desired effect, particularly when it is something such as an investment allowance? We are not saying, &#8220;We don&#8217;t think there should be allowances&#8221;; we are saying, &#8220;We want the allowances that are put in place to actually work in the way that they are intended to work.&#8221; I have concerns about that.</p> <p pid="c183.1/5">New clauses 6 and 10 would require the UK Government and the Treasury to provide transparency on the allowances and their resulting outturn. It is particularly important to look at our climate change obligations. In fact, we have tabled an <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> specifically on looking at the entire Finance Bill through the lens of whether it will  help us to meet our climate change and Paris agreement commitments. There is no point in this House agreeing to legislation that takes us further from the Government&#8217;s stated aims and legislative commitments on climate change. I am still of the opinion that the UK Government are fairly good at talking the talk on their climate change commitments but not at translating that into checking whether our climate change objectives will be hampered by the policies that are put in place.</p> <p pid="c183.1/6">During the Committee stage of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Research_and_Invention_Agency_Act_2022">Advanced Research and Invention Agency Act 2022</a>, for example, I requested that the new organisation be set up on a net zero basis from the beginning. Given that we have net zero targets, I do not think that it is unreasonable to ask for any new Government department to be set up on that basis and, at least, to not contribute in a negative way to our carbon outturns. As I said, we will support new clauses 6 and 10 if they are pushed to a vote.</p> <p pid="c183.1/7">New clause 8, which relates to clause 10, addresses the R&amp;D spend on data and cloud computing. We have tabled a probing amendment on that, and although we do not intend to press it to a vote, I would appreciate it if the Minister were able&#8212;either today or at a future stage&#8212;to answer some questions. We have particular concerns about clause 10 as it relates to part 2 of schedule 1. The explanatory notes&#8212;a hefty document&#8212;state that:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c183.1/8" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Expenditure on data licences and cloud computing services only qualifies for relief to the extent that the commercial use of that licence or service is restricted to the particular research and development activity to which the claim relates, and that the customer does not have a right to&#8230;ongoing use after the relevant research and development has ended.&#8221;</p> <p pid="c183.1/9">I appreciate the Government&#8217;s intention, but we have tabled new clause 8 because we are concerned that this will hamper anyone applying for the allowance in the first place, as they may want to continue to use that data licence and cloud computing after the research and development. Surely they are only doing the research and development because they think it will be profitable and positive for their company. I am concerned that they may choose not to make the investment or to apply for the allowance if they know that they will have to pay it back at a later stage if this does what the company surely wants to achieve, which is to make money.</p> <p pid="c183.1/10">This could have been done in a different way, by allowing companies the investment opportunity and the R&amp;D allowance for the data licence and cloud computing, and then stopping the allowance at the point at which it begins to make money, rather than saying, &#8220;If this does begin to make money, you have to pay us back.&#8221; It would be great if the Minister could answer questions on that issue today, but if not, I am happy to receive information afterwards, so that we have clarity on the Government&#8217;s assessment of this.</p> <p pid="c183.1/11"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> mentioned the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>&#8217;s stated aims in relation to inflation targets. I appreciate that these are aims to reduce inflation, but the reality for our constituents is that there will still be inflation&#8212;although the rate will drop, we will still have inflation, with prices going up. Given that there has been a massive increase in the price of food particularly, which went up 17% at one point, and in the price of energy, our constituents will still see the lower rate of inflation levied on current  prices, so they will still see the price of pasta increasing, and they cannot avoid buying staples such as pasta and rice. I am concerned that the UK Government are not taking this seriously enough.</p> <p pid="c183.1/12">At this moment, my hon. Friends the Members for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_North_East">Glasgow North East</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_McLaughlin">Anne McLaughlin</a>) and for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverness,_Nairn,_Badenoch_and_Strathspey">Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Hendry">Drew Hendry</a>) are finishing up a drop-in session on the concerns of their constituents and all our constituents about energy prices. Again, I am concerned that the UK Government have not done enough; we have been saying that for a significant period and calling for individuals&#8217; <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">bills</a> to be reduced. It seems like more could be done by the UK Government to protect our constituents. It is appreciated that there has been some protection in place, but the reality for people coming through the door of our surgeries is that their energy prices have increased significantly and their wages have not kept pace, and they have far less disposable income as a result.</p> <p pid="c183.1/13">In Scotland, we look at all decisions, and in particular financial ones, through the lens of wellbeing. I appreciate that the Government have targets in relation to inflation. They also have targets in relation to fiscal rules. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> announced in the last couple of weeks that two of the main fiscal rules will be missed. If there are to be rules in place, we should have better rules, and we should actually meet them. If we look at decision making through the lens of ensuring individual and community wellbeing and meeting climate change targets, we end up in a situation where everybody is better off, rather than having fiscal rules that do not actually translate into my constituents&#8217; outgoings at the end of the month and that are not being met anyway as a result of the decision-making process.</p> <p pid="c183.1/14">We know that a major factor that has created the situation the UK finds itself in, almost uniquely, is the loss of single market access and Brexit. It is also to do with the reduction in immigration that we are seeing because we do not have the freedom of movement that we did previously, and therefore we are struggling to fill an awful lot of the jobs that would have been filled by people coming from the EU, a significant number of whom have left as a result.</p> <p pid="c183.1/15">We will move a number of amendments in Committee. We do not intend to push new clause 8 to a vote, but we would appreciate more conversation with the Minister on our concerns about that issue. We will be supporting new clauses 1, 3, 6 and 10 if they are pushed to a vote.</p>            </div>

Member for Aberdeen North (Kirsty Blackman)'">Kirsty Blackman</a>, although I must say that there was some irony in a representative of the Scottish nationalist party speaking in favour of following financial rules, which sometimes seems not to happen in that part of the United Kingdom.</p> <p pid="c185.0/2">Of course, like everyone else here, I am a taxpayer, so we all have to declare some element of interest, and I am a corporate tax payer, under a particular hat, so I have an interest in the subject. Today&#8212;perhaps suitably, for what we are discussing&#8212;is the eve of the feast of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Alphege">St Alphege</a>. Hon. Members will recall that St Alphege was murdered for refusing to pay higher taxes. He was, in many ways, the first tax martyr, who, reluctant to pay an additional Danegeld, had ox bones thrown at him until he was dead. I fear that, under current circumstances and with the approach taken by those on both Front  Benches, we see endlessly higher taxes, and we are having metaphorical ox bones continually flung at us. Let us hope that we do not get martyred through it.</p> <p pid="c185.0/3">It is appropriate to think of St Alphege, because we are debating the worst bit of the Budget today, turned into law. It is the bit that will be most damaging to the economy, and it is the bit that is least in the interests of the United Kingdom. Let us start with <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 5, which is an historic mistake&#8212;it is a major blunder being made by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Majesty">His Majesty</a>&#8217;s Government, and it fails politically and economically. It is worth remembering why the then <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Osborne">George Osborne</a>, started to reduce corporation tax. He got the Treasury for the first time to do a dynamic assessment of the consequences of cutting a tax. What did that dynamic assessment show? It showed that more revenue would be raised, which is precisely what happened. More revenue came through, both in actual, nominal cash terms and as a percentage of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a>. That cannot just be ascribed to general economic improvement and growth: it was a fundamental change in the level of corporation tax raised at a lower rate. Why was that? Well, it made the country more competitive, it encouraged people to set up businesses, and it created a system where people thought that the United Kingdom was open for business. What we are doing now is the precise opposite.</p> <p pid="c185.0/4">In her opening remarks, my hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> referred to our noble Friend the late Lord Lawson&#8212;most distinguished Chancellor, most effective Chancellor&#8212;but this goes against everything that he did as Chancellor. In every single Budget that he presided over, he managed to abolish one tax. Why? Because he realised that simplification of the tax system was the right way to go, and because he realised&#8212;we saw more of this in the United States during the same period&#8212;that lower rates with fewer write-offs is a better way to go than higher rates and complex write-offs. Today, His Majesty&#8217;s Government are doing the exact opposite, because the Government think that they know how businesses should spend their own money better than businesses do themselves, which is fundamentally wrong.</p> <p pid="c185.0/5">As such, we get a raise in the basic rate, which will hit small businesses. It actually hits them at a higher marginal rate, because between &#163;50,000 and &#163;250,000, it has to make up the 19% to the 25%. As people get their business out of the foothills and begin to climb the mountain, we start hitting them with a high marginal rate, which is not particularly clever. Then we say, &#8220;You, dear business, do not know how to spend money&#8212;you are far too stupid&#8212;so we will tell you how&#8221;, which fundamentally misunderstands the British economy. It may be that we were a wonderful manufacturing economy in the 19th century. I love the 19th century; I have great affection for the 19th century. Some people accuse me of being the hon. Member for the 19th century&#8212;I would point out that it is the right hon. Member, and it may be earlier than that, but never mind. However, that is not the economy we have now. Our economy is primarily a service economy, and providing complex write-offs for investment that benefit manufacturing but hit services does not understand where our economy is based.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c187.0/1">My right hon. Friend is right, and for once, those on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> were right as well. Part of the problem with the write-offs is that they are temporary, but why are they temporary? Not because that is what the Government want to do, but because the Government are in hock to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBR">OBR</a>, which gets all its forecasts wrong. All the OBR has managed to say about the write-offs is that they will bring forward investment. That is not a bad thing in and of itself, but the long-term benefit is not being achieved because we insist on following what a bad forecaster tells us will happen. Actually, to the credit of the bad forecaster, it admits that what it says will happen will not happen, so we are doing something on the basis of something that even the forecaster says will not be the case when the years have passed. That cannot possibly make sense. We are making it more difficult to do business in this country, and our aim should be lower rates and fewer write-offs. That is the way to encourage business, and it is the way to grow the economy. If we grow the economy, we can afford the public services that we want. At the moment, we are risking shrinking the economy, encouraging business to leave and set up elsewhere and not having the money we need for public services. <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 5 is a bad clause; it is a bad thing to be doing, and it is a bad thing for the British economy.</p> <p pid="c187.0/2">I would go further, because this idea that attacking corporations is a free lunch for Governments is a mistake. Corporation tax is of itself a bad tax, because it is not a tax that falls on nobody; it actually falls directly on consumers. It comes through to consumers, because businesses thinking of operating in this country do not care about their gross margin; they care about their net margin. When the corporation tax rate goes up, what do they do? They say, &#8220;We either have to increase prices or reduce employment to maintain the net margin.&#8221; Increasing corporation tax from 19% to 25% in a period when there is already inflation in the system will be more inflationary, as multinationals will raise their prices to compensate and maintain the net margin, or they will reduce employment, which makes the cost of living crisis worse for people, because people&#8217;s incomes then fall when they are trying to deal with rising prices.</p> <p pid="c187.0/3">I fear that there is a view among politicians that we tax corporations because they do not vote, and it is therefore an easy raid to make and therefore it does not matter. It is the old saw about plucking the goose with the least amount of hissing. Unfortunately, the hissing on corporation tax is delayed, but all taxation ultimately falls on individuals, and that is true of corporation tax. That is why it is a bad tax and why increasing it is  a mistake in these current circumstances&#8212;indeed, it is a mistake in almost all circumstances.</p> <p pid="c187.0/4">The multinational minimum tax is also a mistake, and it is a mistake in terms of diplomacy and foreign policy. It was a daft thing to agree at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a>. We had no interest in doing it, and my hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> said that they have all done it in the EU, as if that was meant to be any salve or balm in Gilead for us anyway. The fact that the high-tax, highly inefficient, highly  regulatory EU is keen on it is enough to make most people reach for the smelling salts, rather than to think it is some glorious success of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Majesty">His Majesty</a>&#8217;s Government. Why is it a bad idea? It is a bad idea because it deprives us of ambition. My right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> himself called for corporation tax to come down to 12.5%, and we are now legislating to make his ambition impossible. That is not something that Governments usually do; they normally try to ease their way through to something that they have set out, even if they recognise that the circumstances are not immediately possible in which to do it.</p> <p pid="c187.0/5">The other reason that the tax is wrong and deprives us of ambition is that it is about settling for a high-tax, inefficient world. I think <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel">Angela Merkel</a>, the former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Chancellor">German Chancellor</a>, said, &#8220;We have a system where we have all this welfare, and other countries do not. How are we going to carry on paying for it when they are so competitive?&#8221; That is a quotation from her from a few years ago. We are trying to make the whole of the rest of the world as uncompetitive as we have allowed ourselves to become. That is surely not the answer; the answer is to make ourselves more competitive and therefore to have and to be able to afford lower taxation. Instead of looking at those countries that have low-tax regimes as pariahs, we should look at them as models. Instead of saying that Ireland with its low tax rate is doing something scandalous and should be punished, we should say, &#8220;No, Ireland has got more from corporation tax than it gets from value added tax.&#8221; We do not get a fraction of the money from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAT">VAT</a> and corporation tax, because we have a much higher rate, and we have not attracted the businesses that Ireland has attracted.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c188.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely spot-on that <a href="/glossary/?gl=261" title="patents (for inventions), trade marks, protected designs, and copyrights;..." class="glossary">intellectual property</a> rights are, of their nature, much harder to tax, but they clearly belong in the country that invented them or that owns the intellectual right, which is a saleable asset. If that is in a low-tax jurisdiction, why should it be taxed at a falsely high rate? If Disney makes a plastic toy in China, where is the value? It is not actually in the plastic toy being created; it is in the fact that millions of people like watching Disney characters. Trying to locate where that tax ought to be paid is therefore an extremely complex issue, and not one that is solved by a minimum tax. All that does is make it less efficient for companies to invest, develop and do things here, and they might as  well do that somewhere else. They might as well do it in China, actually, because China does not seem to be very enthusiastic about this minimum tax anyway.</p> <p pid="c188.1/2">I do not think this will succeed in stopping complexity. Indeed, it adds to the complexity of the system, and we need only look at this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Bill">Finance Bill</a> to see by quite how much. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, to her credit, did admit this, and said it was so important that we debated it, with which I thoroughly agree, but the dozens of pages of clauses and schedules on this are making our system fundamentally more complex.</p> <p pid="c188.1/3">My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24778" title="Our page on Priti Patel - 'the Member for Witham (Priti Patel)'">Priti Patel</a> raised the issue of tax sovereignty. We got into a terrible muddle by signing up, in the European Union, to a minimum rate for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAT">VAT</a>. We thought at the time it was a success, because the EU wanted to be able to set a unified rate, and we got just a minimum rate agreed. However, that led to suddenly finding that it was impossible to lower VAT rates, as we discussed during the Brexit debate, and as we still cannot do in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, where we are stuck with VAT rates still being set according to the minimum agreed in the European Union. So we remove flexibility, remove sovereignty, increase complexity and make it less competitive for business, and we are selling the pass on becoming a tax-efficient, tax-competitive country.</p> <p pid="c188.1/4">Tax competition is a good thing for those of us on this side of the House, who are meant to be capitalists. I accept that the socialists do not want it, and that is fair enough&#8212;that is what they believe in&#8212;but we believe in growing economies through free-market solutions. Therefore, we believe that if we have a lower tax rate than Germany, that is a good thing because it makes our economy more competitive and makes the British people richer than the Germans. That is not something we are achieving currently, but that I would like to achieve, Mr Evans&#8212;the independent Chairman seemed to be nodding at that, but I am sure that Hansard will take no notice of his agreement that we ought to be richer than the Germans.</p> <p pid="c188.1/5">This is about a failed economic orthodoxy of an undynamic kind that is leading to the increase in corporation tax, when the evidence from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Osborne">George Osborne</a> showed that that is not true, so <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 5 is a mistake. Then the multinational minimum tax is about making globally the rest of the world as inefficient as the European behemoth has become, and that is the wrong approach to be taking. Where is our ambition, where is our vision and where is our free-market approach?</p>            </div>

Just last week, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> predicted that the UK economy would contract by 0.3% this year, making us the worst-performing major economy. Prolonged weakness in business investment and productivity are a major barrier to economic growth, and if the Government want to boost innovation and drive long-term sustainable growth, they need to implement effective and well-designed policy on tax and investment.</p> <p pid="c190.0/3">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_Small_Businesses">Federation of Small Businesses</a> calls research and development tax credits for SMEs the most effective industrial policy of the last 10 years, enabling small businesses to develop cutting-edge products and foster competition and innovation within industry. The Government&#8217;s decision to dramatically slash R&amp;D tax credits has therefore come as a blow to thousands of businesses. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a>&#8217;s new policy of targeting tax breaks at research-intensive firms has been celebrated by the life sciences industry, but many other industries will fall outside the 40% intensity threshold. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Directors">Institute of Directors</a> has also warned that targeting tax credits at research-intensive firms could lead to less innovation across the economy more widely.</p> <p pid="c190.0/4">We need to incentivise companies across all sectors to innovate, and particularly to encourage those that have not habitually been innovators. The manufacturers&#8217; organisation <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_UK">Make UK</a> has warned that further damage has been caused by the Conservatives&#8217; chopping and changing on tax credit policy, which leaves businesses struggling to keep up and weakens business confidence. On <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill.

Whether for switching a fleet to electric cars or installing solar panels, reducing demand for energy is essential not only for decarbonising our industrial sector, but for bringing down production costs.</p> <p pid="c190.0/6">The need for targeted incentives for energy efficiency has been underlined by the ongoing energy cost pressures that businesses are experiencing, and the Conservatives&#8217; decision to slash energy support for businesses by 85% will force countless shops, pubs and restaurants to pass increased costs on to their consumers, further fuelling inflation. The Liberal Democrats have repeatedly called on the Government to do more to tackle rampant inflation by supporting businesses with their energy <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">bills</a>. Amidst Government inaction, last month the rate  of inflation in the UK jumped to 10.4%, driven largely by the cost of food and alcohol in hospitality venues. I urge the Government to look again at their policy on energy support and tax incentives offered to business, to tackle inflation, to stimulate economic growth and to drive productivity across all sectors.</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 10, which stands in my name and addresses the decarbonisation allowance first announced by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> in the autumn statement and now legislated for in this Bill. Although in principle the decarbonisation allowance may sound innocuous or even useful, it is in fact an outrageous subsidy that sees the taxpayer paying companies to decarbonise their activities.</p> <p pid="c191.2/2">Under this scheme, a company spending &#163;100 on so-called &#8220;upstream decarbonisation&#8221;&#8212;in other words, reducing emissions from the process of extracting oil and gas that then goes on to be burned&#8212;is eligible for &#163;109 in relief. We should remember that these companies have themselves admitted that they have</p> <p class="indent" pid="c191.2/3" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;more cash than we know what to do with&#8221;,</p> <p pid="c191.2/4">and earlier this year they recorded obscene, record profits, with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP">BP</a>&#8217;s profits more than doubling to &#163;23 billion and Shell reporting annual profits of more than &#163;32 billion, all while millions of UK households face unbearable choices between basic needs and desperately struggling to make ends meet.</p> <p pid="c191.2/5">In his Budget statement, the Chancellor recognised what he called the enormous pressures on family finances, with some people remaining in real distress, yet even with the decision to freeze the energy price guarantee at &#163;2,500 as of this month, <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">bills</a> will still rise by almost 20% and 7.5 million households will be in <a href="/glossary/?gl=273" title="A household is said to be in fuel poverty when its members cannot afford to..." class="glossary">fuel poverty</a>. It is utterly perverse that in this context the Government have decided to hand the climate criminals&#8212;those who have profited from the spoils of war&#8212;yet another subsidy. These are, at bottom, political choices.</p> <p pid="c191.2/6">The Chancellor may say, in response to my amendments, that we should be endorsing the decarbonisation allowance to cut emissions from the oil and gas sector, but that ignores the economic reality of the situation and the reality of our planetary boundaries, with upstream decarbonisation doing nothing to mitigate the end result of the fossil fuels choking our precious planet. I am afraid that, in the face of worsening climate impacts, paying companies to power oil rigs with wind turbines or to monitor emissions to detect leaks simply does not cut it. Even more alarming is the provision in the Bill for the decarbonisation allowance to support carbon  capture. That UK taxpayers would pay oil and gas companies to capture their emissions in order to allow them to continue production&#8212;essentially, to continue business as usual&#8212;is a shocking violation of the &#8220;polluter pays&#8221; principle.</p> <p pid="c191.2/7">If the Government were seriously looking at reducing production emissions, they would, for example, be looking to bring forward an outright ban on flaring by the end of 2025 at the very latest&#8212;I remind Members that flaring has been banned in Norway since 1971&#8212;or they would be strengthening the lamentable targets in the North sea transition deal from a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030 to at least a 68% reduction, as proposed by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_Climate_Change">Committee on Climate Change</a> in its balanced pathway, both of which have been called for by the Environmental Audit Committee, of which I am a member. Yet in their response to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EAC">EAC</a>&#8217;s report on &#8220;Accelerating the Transition from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_Fuels">Fossil Fuels</a> and Securing Energy Supplies&#8221;, the Government roundly rejected both recommendations, maintaining that the existing targets in the North sea transition deal are &#8220;sufficiently ambitious&#8221;.</p> <p pid="c191.2/8">This is not a Government who are serious about cutting emissions from production, and they are certainly not serious about the climate crisis. New clause 10 recognises that the decarbonisation allowance is just one of the handouts to fossil fuel companies that have been introduced under the energy profits levy. It would require the Government to produce an assessment of the cost of the decarbonisation allowance to the Treasury and, crucially, its impact on overall investment in oil and gas production. It would also reveal how much money would be raised through the energy profits levy without the enormous gas giveaways in the form of both the investment allowance and the decarbonisation allowance, as well as assessing their impact on delivering our crucial climate targets.</p> <p pid="c191.2/9">At this point, I would like to say a few words in support of new clause 6, which would require the Chancellor to conduct a review of the decarbonisation allowance and its impact on public finances, although it is important to note that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> is somewhat narrower in not requiring an assessment of climate impacts as well. The Government are very transparent about the fact that the investment allowance is directly aimed at encouraging companies to pump more money into oil and gas extraction in the UK by allowing them to claim &#163;91.40 for every &#163;100 invested. That policy runs directly counter to the advice of the world&#8217;s leading scientists on what is needed to keep 1.5&#176; within reach, with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Secretary-General">UN Secretary-General</a> calling for a cessation of</p> <p class="indent" pid="c191.2/10" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;all licensing or funding of new oil and gas&#8221; at the recent launch of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&#8217;s &#8220;AR6 Synthesis Report&#8221;, and the report itself being clear that emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure already exceed the remaining carbon budget for 1.5&#176;.</p> <p pid="c191.2/12">The bottom line is that our climate simply cannot take any new oil and gas licences. As I have said time and again, new licences would also fail to deliver energy security. With the oil and gas sold on global markets to the highest bidder, they will not bring down bills in the UK and will inevitably come at a huge cost to the taxpayer. Indeed, if we take just one example, Rosebank, the UK&#8217;s largest undeveloped oilfield, the costs become  clear. Rosebank is enormous. At triple the size of the neighbouring Cambo oilfield, it would produce more emissions than 28 low-income countries combined or, to put it another way, it would produce the carbon dioxide equivalent of running 58 coal-fired power stations for a year. If developed, its owners will be gifted a &#163;3.75 billion taxpayer-funded subsidy from the Government to the estimated &#163;4.1 billion project. The Norwegian state-owned company Equinor, which made a staggering &#163;62 billion last year, contributed just &#163;350 million while pocketing enormous profits.</p> <p pid="c191.2/13">The total cost of the investment allowance to the taxpayer has been calculated at a staggering &#163;11 billion. That is enough to give an inflation-matching pay rise  to every <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a> worker and teacher for a year. On decarbonisation, Equinor has said that it will invest &#163;80 million to ready its production vessel for electrification, meaning that the firm would get &#163;87 million in saved taxes. That is just ludicrous. The full cost of powering Rosebank with clean electricity would run into the hundreds of millions, but thanks to the decarbonisation allowance, that now risks being borne by UK taxpayers.</p> <p pid="c191.2/14">If the Chancellor cannot see the problem, he is simply not paying attention. I ask him and the Treasury <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> team, in all seriousness, to scrap not just the decarbonisation allowance but the investment allowance and, instead, to bring forward a windfall tax worthy of its name. Failing that, I ask that they please accept my amendments, which would at the very least give us transparency over the costs of these policies both to the taxpayer and, crucially, to our planet.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c193.0/1">What an interesting debate it has been. I have found myself slightly amused numerous times by comments from Conservative Members, especially when have they tried to make out that theirs is the party of low taxes, when taxes as a share of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a> are heading to a post-war high. The public are not stupid. A recent poll in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spectator">The Spectator</a> showed that the public associate the Conservative party with higher taxes. The reason is that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> keep putting their taxes up.</p> <p pid="c193.0/2">Another problem that I have seen play out this afternoon as I have sat here is that the Conservative party is inherently divided. Different parts of the governing party are pulling in different directions. That is seen in the seven Chancellors we have had since 2010. As different factions have taken over the leadership, those seven Chancellors have pulled the party in different ways, creating uncertainty. Uncertainty is one of the key things that businesses say leads to a lack of investment. It is not just businesses telling us of the problem of uncertainty, but economists. They tell us about the difficulty with uncertainty and why the UK is uniquely impacted by a lack of investment.</p> <p pid="c193.0/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsten_Bell">Torsten Bell</a> said that if we go back to 2010 when the Conservatives first came to power&#8212;13 long years ago&#8212;we initially see a relatively good bounce back from the financial crisis, but then</p> <p class="indent" pid="c193.0/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;we basically miss out on all of the investment growth that other countries saw in the second half of that decade. We flatlined, everyone else soared. In so far as there was a global boom going  on, that is when it happened. We did not see that. There have been some revisions to the data recently that make the bounce back from the pandemic on business investment less grim than they looked before, but they are still pretty bad.&#8221;</p> <p pid="c193.0/5">That is one economist. Another economist, Professor Coyle, said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c193.0/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Tax will make a difference, but it is not the only thing that matters, and surveys of employers tend to highlight poor infrastructure&#8221;&#8212; something that anyone who spends any time travelling by rail around the north is only too aware of&#8212;</p> <p class="indent" pid="c193.0/8" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;and lack of skills, which we&#8217;ve already been talking about. Lining up all the different things that matter is obviously part of the challenge&#8212;so, consistency&#8221;&#8212; that word again&#8212;</p> <p class="indent" pid="c193.0/10" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;and making the system work as a whole.&#8221;</p> <p pid="c193.0/11">Another economist, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Johnson">Paul Johnson</a>, said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c193.0/12" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;The lack of consistency in policy is clearly a problem. Something that we talked about&#8212;perhaps it is not the right place to talk about it&#8212;is that the political instability is a problem for companies looking to invest&#8221;.</p> <p pid="c193.0/13">Seven Chancellors and a divided governing party that does not know which direction to take the economy and our country. Businesses are seeing that, voting with their feet and choosing not to invest in the UK. Professor Coyle went on to say:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c193.0/14" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;If you look at the past decade or so, what has been happening to firms, even within a given industry, is that the dispersion of productivity has increased. There are some very productive firms. Their productivity growth has slowed down, but they are pulling further and further ahead of&#8230;the rest. Firms that are operating outside London and the south-east tend to be the ones in the low productivity part of that distribution.&#8221;</p> <p pid="c193.0/15">As we have said before, the issue goes back to infrastructure. The constant under-investment in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Powerhouse_Rail">Northern Powerhouse Rail</a>, with different <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Ministers">Prime Ministers</a> making decisions about whether we will or will not have it, will have an impact on business investment and influence whether businesses choose to invest in our country.</p> <p pid="c193.0/16">Professor Coyle went on to say:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c193.0/17" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;I do not mind whether it is called an industrial strategy or not, but we need some kind of long-term perspective&#8212;some kind of strategic approach to managing the economy.&#8221;</p> <p pid="c193.0/18">Hear, hear, Professor Coyle. I agree and so does the Labour party, which is why the Labour party has a long-term plan for growth in the country and why I am speaking in support of new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 3. If businesses cannot have certainty from the governing party or understand which <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> is going to introduce which measure in what way, or which faction is the latest to take over the governing party, then they need that certainty from the Labour party, because they are really struggling.</p> <p pid="c193.0/19">I have met with local businesses in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> and they gave me a very clear message: it is incredibly difficult. The Chancellor may boast&#8212;boast, ha!&#8212;that we are not in a technical recession, but try telling that to the small businesses in my constituency that are finding life incredibly difficult. As we walk around different high streets, we can see the number of shops that are closing. Although the review of business rates does not go as far as the Labour party wants&#8212;we want to get rid of business rates altogether&#8212;hopefully Members from across the House can support such a fundamental review. Let us look at what we can do to support businesses, especially small businesses. I am sure each and every  one of us has been lobbied hard by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_Small_Businesses">Federation of Small Businesses</a> and heard directly from small businesses about how difficult they are finding things.</p> <p pid="c193.0/20">I will comment briefly on new clause 7 about research and development tax relief, which is proposed by Liberal Democrat Members. It is well worth reading the TaxWatch report into the levels of fraud associated with R&amp;D tax reliefs. We may want to support businesses with R&amp;D tax reliefs&#8212;I am not saying that we should not do that&#8212;but we need to take the issue of fraud more seriously. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBR">OBR</a> predicts that the total cost of R&amp;D reliefs will increase from &#163;6.8 billion in 2021 to &#163;9.2 billion in 2026-27, but fraud and error in that scheme totals over &#163;1.1 billion in the last three years.</p>            </div>

When we have businesses ripping off the taxpayer for &#163;1.1 billion&#8212;money that is desperately needed for our public sector, hospitals and infrastructure&#8212;we need to take the issue seriously and not brush it under the carpet. R&amp;D claim firms continue to hard sell opportunities to claim refunds, often to companies that should not qualify.</p> <p pid="c195.1/2">We have issues with the tax gap, which is around &#163;32 billion. That tax gap continues to increase and the tax fraud gap stands at &#163;14.4 billion. That is a heck of a lot of money. If they were serious about wanting to reduce taxes, I would have thought Government Members would want to tackle tax fraud. I have raised the issue with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> in a previous debate and I know she is aware of it, so will she outline the steps being taken by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMRC">HMRC</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Treasury">HM Treasury</a> on the important work of reducing tax fraud and simplifying our tax system?</p> <p pid="c195.1/3">While we are talking about tax simplification, and as a teaser for the debate tomorrow, it seems strange that the Government wish to abolish the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Tax_Simplification">Office of Tax Simplification</a>.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c195.2/1">I always wondered how the Conservative party did its policy development, but I think <a href="/mp/?p=24926" title="Our page on Jacob Rees-Mogg - 'the right hon. Member for North East Somerset (Mr Rees-Mogg)'">Mr Rees-Mogg</a> has helped me to come to a conclusion. My sympathies therefore go to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>.</p> <p pid="c195.2/2">This <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Bill">Finance Bill</a> is yet another glaring example of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> trying to shove a square peg into a round hole for the people of Scotland. They are desperately trying to fix economic problems of their own making, but their Bill will do the square root of zero to fix the enormous productivity and labour supply challenges that our nation faces as a result of their mismanagement.</p> <p pid="c195.2/3">I know that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNP">SNP</a> is often seen as a force for positive general happiness around this Chamber, but there is a great black cloud of gloom and doom overhanging the Bill. It relates to Brexit: the unwelcome guest at the  wedding, the elephant in the room, the truth that dare not be spoken by its instigators. Brexit has brought us headlines such as &#8220;Economy in decline&#8221;, &#8220;No-growth Britain&#8221;, &#8220;Bottom of the class at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a>&#8221; and &#8220;Export exodus&#8221;&#8212;hardly what we would call sunlit uplands, and not a unicorn in sight.</p> <p pid="c195.2/4">Did Scotland vote for this? No, we did not. We did not want Brexit, but it was forced upon us. Meanwhile, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> seems to be contradicting his own ideology by remarking on all the special and exciting opportunities for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> from access to the EU and UK markets. He does not even realise the irony of his comments or the gross unfairness to Scotland, which has been left in the lurch, with our democratic mandate ignored.</p> <p pid="c195.2/5">The Scottish people know that this is a Government in denial, with a double whammy of <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> ineptitude on the economy and a damaging Brexit that cannot be fixed by a Finance Bill produced by the same team who were behind that not-so-winning combination. With the economy contracting, according to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund">International Monetary Fund</a>, and with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> failing to meet his two main fiscal targets of a falling public debt burden and borrowing below 3% of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a> by 2028, we now know that workers in old Blighty are &#163;1,300 worse off as a result of Brexit. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFS">IFS</a> has stated that our productivity and economic output will fall by 4% as a result of leaving the single market, leaving workers significantly worse off and public services at the thin end of the wedge again, with less money in their budgets. We need less &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Together">Better Together</a> for Scotland&#8221; and more &#8220;I&#8217;m Scottish&#8230;Get Us Out of Here <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDQ">PDQ</a>!&#8221;</p> <p pid="c195.2/6">I turn to our amendments. I hear from small and medium-sized businesses in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> and across Scotland that they are struggling as a result of the economic decline. They are fighting a war on all fronts with energy costs and the costs of doing business, not to mention that they are still trying to get back on their feet after the pandemic and are dealing with the new red tape generated by Brexit.</p> <p pid="c195.2/7">I am happy to support SNP new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 8 on extending relief of R&amp;D expenditure for our excellent and important data and cloud computing services. On research and development, the refrain that I hear on repeat from businesses is that they are keen to invest but have their hands tied behind their back. Looking at the clauses before the Committee today, it is easy to see why the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> have lost their &#8220;party of business&#8221; strapline. So many businesses are reporting that they feel abandoned by this Government and left to float alone, without a life raft to get them out of the swirling morass of the economy and into better times. If the Government want growth and prosperity, they need to listen&#8212;really listen&#8212;to the people at the coalface who do business every day and who have faced years of knocks and challenges.</p> <p pid="c195.2/8">On corporation tax, the Government do not seem to know whether they are coming or going. One minute, corporation tax rises seem to be in vogue; the next minute, they are not. The Government swither and dither, but the business community desperately needs stability, security and some long-term plans that will give it the space to breathe and grow.</p> <p pid="c195.2/9">The ever-present climate crisis is a threat not just to business, but to people&#8217;s livelihoods. The UK Government have not shown their best colours when it comes to ensuring that their legislation is in line with the climate  challenges. Despite the climate-induced weather events in the UK and abroad, the Prime Minister left out tackling climate change and reaching net zero from his core priorities for his growth strategy. With the number of elephants in the room, No. 10 and No. 11 are getting pretty crowded.</p> <p pid="c195.2/10">We cannot pretend that Brexit and climate change are not devastatingly bad for business and for people&#8217;s finances. Without acknowledging the catastrophic damage that they bring, we cannot move forward with a comprehensive plan. The Chancellor can present as many Finance <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> to Parliament as he wishes, but these are people&#8217;s real lives, real livelihoods and real futures, uncushioned by wealth and privilege, and catastrophically unsupported by a tin-eared Government who refuse to look at the reality of the situation that they themselves face. It is time for Scotland to make a swift exit, and I hope that in the coming months we can achieve just that.</p>            </div>

Their job&#8212;your job, dare I say it to Members&#8212;is to scrutinise our legislation, and I welcome that. It may well be that Opposition Members have highlighted a fundamental difference between the Labour and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National">Scottish National</a> parties and the Conservative party: we have the intellectual self-confidence to hold these debates, and to debate policy. [Laughter.] Opposition Members may laugh, but we know how difficult internal debate has been in the Labour party. It has meant inquiries by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_and_Human_Rights_Commission">Equality and Human Rights Commission</a>, it has meant a Labour MP being protected by the police in order to attend her own party&#8217;s conference, and I understand that a member  of that party is currently being ostracised because her views on what a woman is differ from those of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a>.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c197.3/1">I will not <a href="/glossary/?gl=176" title="To allow another Member to speak." class="glossary">give way</a>, because I know it has been a busy day for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNP">SNP</a>. [Interruption.] I will not say any more.</p> <p pid="c197.3/2">My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25346" title="Our page on Kit Malthouse - 'the Member for North West Hampshire (Kit Malthouse)'">Kit Malthouse</a> rightly raised the subject of the corporation tax increase, but so, significantly, did  <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members. They have made much play of the tax rate, and I thought it important just to remind everyone why we are where we are.</p> <p pid="c197.3/3">The Government borrowed an additional &#163;14 billion in 2020-21 and 2021-22 to fund the response to covid. I cannot imagine that any Opposition Member&#8212;including those on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>&#8212;actually disagreed with, for example, the furlough scheme, which protected more than 11 million jobs and companies throughout the country. However, that enormous sum has to be repaid. In response to the energy crisis, the Government have provided just over &#163;100 billion to help households and businesses with higher energy <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">bills</a> in 2022-23 and 2023-24. That has contributed to a significant increase in our public debt, which is forecast to reach 100.6% of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a> in 2022-23, the highest level since the 1960s.</p> <p pid="c197.3/4">That has happened precisely because the Government have responded to the pandemic, to the international crisis in Ukraine and, importantly, to the knock-on effects that that has had on our cost of living. I cannot imagine that Labour Members really begrudge the support that we are providing&#8212;more than &#163;3,000 for every household, including households in their constituencies, to help those people with the cost of living.</p> <p pid="c197.3/5">However, as my right hon. Friend rightly pointed out, we also believe in the principles of sound money. In the autumn statement, my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> explained that some very difficult decisions had to be made. Indeed, even with the increase in the rate to 25% that was originally announced by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> when he was Chancellor, we will still have a corporate tax system that remains one of the most supportive of business anywhere in the world, with the lowest headline rate of corporation tax in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a>, the joint most generous capital allowances regime for plant and machinery in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a>, thanks to the full expensing in this Bill, and the joint highest uncapped headline rate of R&amp;D tax relief support for large companies in the G7. That is in addition to the features of the corporate tax system that make the UK an attractive location as a global hub, including having the largest tax treaty network in the world, mitigating the risk of double taxation. I point out for the sake of clarification that at 25%, the rate of corporation tax will be lower than at any time before 2010 under the last <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a>.</p> <p pid="c197.3/6">I will move on to the provisions in relation to pillar two. My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24778" title="Our page on Priti Patel - 'the Member for Witham (Priti Patel)'">Priti Patel</a> raised some important questions, including about capital flight. We have looked carefully at this and I understand why she is asking about this. I hope she will be reassured that this has been at the forefront of negotiators&#8217; minds as we have looked at this agreement. The rules contain defensive measures to prevent capital flight. If a country does not implement them, the top-up tax will be collected by other countries instead, so there is no incentive to move or escape from these rules.</p> <p pid="c197.3/7">My right hon. Friend also asked about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartered_Institute_of_Taxation">Chartered Institute of Taxation</a>&#8217;s view that this measure might raise less than expected. Again, I hope she will be reassured that the costing for pillar two was certified by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Budget_Responsibility">Office for Budget Responsibility</a> and published at the autumn statement. The estimates are that pillar two will raise &#163;2 billion a year by 2027-28. This includes revenue arising from UK-headquartered groups that are subject   to low tax on their foreign operations, the diminished incentive for groups to shift their profits out of the UK and the qualified domestic minimum tax.</p> <p pid="c197.3/8">My right hon. Friend also asked about Japan. It has passed its legislation and it is implementing this in April next year, three months after we are legislating for. I hope that that timeframe gives her some comfort. I also note that 40 countries have implemented or announced pillar two or a similar rule, and I am told that they make up around 60% of global GDP. It is precisely because of the interlocking nature of the rules that revenues will be taxed at 15%, no matter where they are shifted. I am going to move on to three new clauses that I have a feeling might be the cause of contention and therefore Divisions tonight, but I will happily write to <a href="/mp/?p=25314" title="Our page on Kirsty Blackman - 'the hon. Member for Aberdeen North (Kirsty Blackman)'">Kirsty Blackman</a> about her point on data licences, because I want to reassure her on that.</p> <p pid="c197.3/9">On new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 1, the Government are committed to sharing expertise on implementation and to co-ordinating our efforts internationally. We are playing an important and active role in the design of pillar two rules and we are achieving the delicate balance between having rules that are effective in tackling profit shifting and being proportionate. It would not be appropriate to provide a running commentary on international discussions ahead of the agreed outcomes of these meetings, which are published by the OECD, including in the administrative guidance to the rules published in February. We therefore say that the new clause is unnecessary and we urge colleagues to vote against it if it is pushed to a <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">Division</a>.</p> <p pid="c197.3/10">New clause 3 would require the Government to conduct a review of the UK&#8217;s business tax regime. This is business as usual for the Treasury and the Government. We have done, and continue to undertake, significant work to understand the impact of tax incentives on business investment. The tax plan published at spring statement 2022 set out the Government&#8217;s vision for using the tax system to incentivise investment in capital assets and in research and development, and we have set out detailed information on the Exchequer, macroeconomic and business impacts of these policies at the Budget. The evidence for this continuing work lies in both the full expensing policy in clause 7 and the increase to the annual investment allowance in clause 8, both of which I trust the Opposition will support.</p> <p pid="c197.3/11">I remind colleagues that the full expensing policy is equivalent to a &#163;27 billion tax cut for businesses over three years. It saves eligible businesses 25p in tax for every &#163;1 they invest. That is the Conservative approach to sound money, and that is what we will do to help grow our economy. The impact of our plan to halve inflation, to grow the economy and to reduce debt is demonstrated in the rising confidence of finance executives, as reported in the recent Deloitte survey. Do not listen to the doom-mongers opposite; listen to British businesses.</p> <p pid="c197.3/12">Turning to new clause 6, the Government expect the energy profits levy to raise just under &#163;26 billion between 2022-23 and 2027-28, helping to fund the vital and unprecedented cost of living support orchestrated by this Government. This includes the impact of the investment allowance. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMRC">HMRC</a> regularly publishes estimates for the cost of various tax reliefs where relevant data is available and identifiable in tax returns. For example, estimates for the cost of the investment allowance against the supplementary charge and the first-year allowance of  the ringfencing regime are regularly included in that publication. HMRC intends to make a cost estimate for the investment allowance against the energy profits levy in due course.</p> <p pid="c197.3/13">We have always been clear that we want to see significant investment from the sector to help protect our energy security. Oil and gas accounted for 77% of the UK&#8217;s energy demand last year and, as set out in the energy security strategy, the North sea will still be a foundation of our energy security, so it is right that we continue to encourage investment in oil and gas. Supporting our domestic oil and gas sector is not incompatible with net zero 2050, as we know we will need oil and gas for decades to come.</p> <p pid="c197.3/14">As the energy crisis in the UK has shown, constraining supply and dramatically increasing prices does not eliminate demand for oil and gas. A faster decline in domestic production would mean importing more oil and gas at greater expense, potentially resulting in additional emissions, especially in the case of gas.</p> <p pid="c197.3/15">On the climate targets, the Treasury carefully considers the impact of all measures on the UK&#8217;s climate change commitments as a matter of course. It should be noted that the Government have made the UK a climate leader and have reduced emissions faster than any G7 country over the last 30 years. We are on track to deliver our carbon budgets and on course to reach net zero by 2050, creating jobs and investment across the UK while reducing emissions.</p> <p pid="c197.3/16">I hope I have been able to reassure Members. I have genuinely enjoyed the scrutiny they have brought to this important piece of legislation. I urge the Committee to reject new clauses 1 to 3 and 6 to 10, and <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 26. For the reasons I set out at the beginning, I commend Government amendments 12 to 13 and 15 to 20.</p> <p pid="c197.3/17">Question put and agreed to.</p> <p pid="c197.3/18">Clause 5 accordingly ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p> <p pid="c197.3/19">Clauses 6 to 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>            </div>
