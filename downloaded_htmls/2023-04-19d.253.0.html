                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d247.2/1">Ordinarily, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Security, my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25374" title="Our page on Thomas Tugendhat - 'the Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Tom Tugendhat)'">Tom Tugendhat</a> would have responded to this urgent question, because it sits within his portfolio. He is in Northern Ireland today, so I have been asked to respond <a href="/glossary/?gl=145" title="Of a male MP, sitting on his regular seat in the House. For females, &quot;in..." class="glossary">in his place</a>.</p> <p pid="d247.2/2">The latest reporting in <a href="/glossary/?gl=49" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/" class="glossary">The Times</a> on the so-called overseas police stations are of course of great concern. As my right hon. Friend the Minister for Security said in his previous statement on the matter in November last year, investigations by the law enforcement community are ongoing, which limits what I can say in the House about a live investigation into a sensitive matter. As Members will appreciate, I do not want to say anything that would jeopardise any operational investigations or indeed any potential future prosecutions.</p> <p pid="d247.2/3">I will, however, take this opportunity to reassure the House of the Government&#8217;s resolve to protect every community in this country from transnational repression. Protecting the people of the United Kingdom is of the utmost importance. Any attempt to coerce, intimidate or illegally repatriate any individual will not be tolerated. That egregious activity is part of a wider train of authoritarian Governments&#8212;not just China, but others&#8212;perpetrating transnational repression in an effort to silence their critics overseas, undermine democracy and the rule of law, and further their own narrow geopolitical interests.</p> <p pid="d247.2/4">Through our police forces and the intelligence agencies that work with them, we take a proactive approach to protecting individuals and communities from threats. Where we identify individuals who may be at heightened risk we are front-footed in deploying security measures and guidance where necessary.</p> <p pid="d247.2/5">The upcoming National Security Bill will strengthen our powers to deal with transnational repression and with agents of foreign states more generally. Coercion, harassment or intimidation linked to a foreign power will be criminalised under the new foreign interference offence in that Bill. Existing criminal offences against a person, such as assault, will in future command higher sentences where they are undertaken at the behest of a foreign power through the state threats aggravating factor in that Bill.</p> <p pid="d247.2/6">The National Security Bill will also introduce a new foreign influence registration scheme, and we will not hesitate to use those new powers to bear down on the activities of foreign entities of concern. The Bill will return to this House in early May and I call on all hon. Members to support it when it does.</p> <p pid="d247.2/7">It is clear, however, that we can and must do more. That is why the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> asked my right hon. Friend the Minister for Security to lead a new defending democracy taskforce, a key priority of which is to enhance our response to transnational repression. That work is ongoing and he will provide an update to the  House in due course. It builds on the work done by his ministerial predecessor, my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24782" title="Our page on Damian Hinds - 'the Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds)'">Damian Hinds</a>, who I see is in his place. I am clear, as is the rest of Government, that the repression of communities in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> will not be tolerated and must be stopped.</p>            </div>

Those very serious allegations raise vital national security questions, and I think the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a> should be here to answer them.</p> <p pid="d248.0/2">The director general of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI5">MI5</a> has warned about the Chinese authorities both trying to influence our politics and running operations to monitor and intimidate the Chinese diaspora, including forcibly repatriating Chinese nationals. In November, we questioned the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Security about possible secret police stations in Croydon, Hendon and Glasgow. He provided no information, but said he would come back with an update. He has not done so. Nor has he met with my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25673" title="Our page on Sarah Jones - 'the Member for Croydon Central (Sarah Jones)'">Sarah Jones</a>, despite promising to do so.</p> <p pid="d248.0/3">Other countries have taken visible action. This week, two men were arrested by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI">FBI</a> in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> for suspected operations, and in the Netherlands similar operations have been shut down. In the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a>, however, we have heard nothing&#8212;no reports of arrests and no reassurance that these operations have been closed down. Instead, we are told that one key individual has been vice-chairman of the Chinese group fundraising for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Association">Conservative Association</a> in the City of London, and has attended party-organised events with two out of the last three Conservative Prime Ministers.</p> <p pid="d248.0/4">Can the Minister tell us the full extent of that individual&#8217;s involvement with the Conservative party and contact with any Ministers? What actions have Ministers and the party taken? What have the Government done about the alleged secret police stations in Croydon and elsewhere? Have their operations been closed down?</p> <p pid="d248.0/5">The lack of answers will raise grave concerns that the Government are not addressing the scale of this threat and are not updating Parliament for fear of party political embarrassment because of the connections with the Conservative party. That is not good enough. Party political concerns must never&#8212;repeat: never&#8212;be put before our national security. The country deserves answers.</p>            </div>

I can tell the House that I have been briefed today, as one would expect&#8212;at short notice, as this is not ordinarily part of my ministerial portfolio&#8212;and there is a live investigation of this matter by the law enforcement community.

Investigations into individual transgressions are absolutely fine, and they progress. The problem is that we in this House and the Government have known for a considerable time&#8212;it has been raised by many of my colleagues&#8212;about the activity of the three illegal Chinese police stations. We know that they are bringing Chinese dissidents in, confronting them with videos of their families, and threatening their families in front of them if they do not co-operate, leave and go back to China. We know that. The security services have warned the Government about it. The question today is this: why in heaven&#8217;s name have we not acted, alongside the Americans and even the Dutch, to shut those stations down and kick those people out of the country?</p>            </div>

I completely agree with his second point about the importance of prosecuting people domestically in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> and, if they have committed a criminal offence here in the UK, making sure they serve a sentence here prior to getting kicked out.

We have extended a very warm welcome to those people, who are at risk of repression in Hong Kong now because of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist">Chinese Communist</a> party&#8217;s brutal repression of democratic freedoms and other freedoms there, which this Government abhor in the strongest terms. That is why we have offered refuge here to those people.</p> <p pid="d253.0/2">The right hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that foreign nationals residing in this country, regardless of their immigration status, should enjoy all the rights and freedoms around free speech and freedom from intimidation that we would expect any citizen of this country to enjoy. I agree with him: it is the duty of Government and the law enforcement services and agencies to ensure that those freedoms and rights are protected, including on campuses. I think the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Education">Department for Education</a> is doing some work in that area. Where Chinese nationals are students at universities, they should be free from harassment and intimidation&#8212;the same applies, of course, to other groups of people, Jewish students being another obvious example. It is vital that university authorities take robust action to protect their students, whether Chinese, Jewish or from any other group, from any sort of intimidation on campuses, which is totally unacceptable.</p>            </div>

Whether those are Chinese students, Iranian students, Jewish students or anyone else, they should not be getting intimidated. I will just repeat the point I made earlier: individual universities, first and foremost, should be ensuring the safety of students on their campuses in the first instance.</p> <p pid="d254.1/2">In relation to the hon.

What I will say is that I will ask the Security <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> to come back to the hon. Lady specifically on that point and update her in writing on what work he is doing with the DFE to ensure the safety of students on campuses. It is a vital question, and it is appropriate that the Government get involved as well as leaving it to universities. I will ask the Security Minister to come back to her on that very important point, but I completely agree with the sentiment of her question.</p>            </div>

I believe we have a duty in this country, acting with our allies in the free world, to make sure that that influence is circumscribed.</p> <p pid="d254.3/2">Clearly, we are taking more powers domestically, for example through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_and_Investment_Act_2021">National Security and Investment Act 2021</a>, which came into force just over one year ago, to seek to limit influences in the investment and economic spheres. We are doing work with partners around the world, too. We are supporting countries where freedom  is threatened, including Taiwan, which obviously we strongly support in its right to choose its own destiny. The question my right hon. Friend specifically raises is obviously a complicated one that is probably better dealt with by higher powers than me, but I have made clear in my answer my feelings on the topic of our relations with China.</p>            </div>
