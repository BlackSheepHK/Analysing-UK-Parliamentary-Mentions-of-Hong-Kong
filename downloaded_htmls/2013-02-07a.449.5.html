                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a.441.1/1">With your permission, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, I should like to make a statement on the future of qualifications, school league tables and the national curriculum.</p> <p pid="a.441.1/2">Last September, we outlined plans for changes to GCSE qualifications that were designed to address the grade inflation, dumbing down and loss of rigour in those examinations. We have consulted on those proposals and there is a consensus that the system needs to change. However, one of the proposals that I put forward was a bridge too far. My idea that we end the competition between exam boards to offer <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCSEs">GCSEs</a> in core academic qualifications and have just one wholly new exam in each subject was one reform too many at this time.</p> <p pid="a.441.1/3">The exam regulator Ofqual, which has done such a great job in recent months upholding standards, was clear that there were significant risks in trying to both strengthen qualifications and end competition in a large part of the exams market. I have therefore decided not to make the best the enemy of the good, and I will not proceed with plans to have a single exam board offering a new exam in each academic subject. Instead, we will concentrate on reforming existing GCSEs, broadly along the lines put forward in September. There is a consensus that the exams and qualification system we inherited was broken.</p> <p pid="a.441.1/4">Our first set of reforms were to vocational qualifications, which had been allowed to become less rigorous options under the previous Government. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Wolf">Alison Wolf</a>&#8217;s report outlined how to improve the quality of vocational courses and expand work experience. It secured near universal support and it will soon all be done. We are also reforming apprenticeships. Under the previous Government, the currency of apprenticeships was devalued alongside every other qualification. The Richard report on apprenticeship reform will restore rigour, as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Adonis">Andrew Adonis</a> has explained so powerfully.</p> <p pid="a.441.1/5">We are also reforming A-levels. Schools and universities were unhappy that constant assessment and modularisation got in the way of proper learning, so we are reforming those exams with the help of school and university leaders. GCSEs will also be reformed in a similar fashion. The qualifications should be linear, with all assessments normally taken at the end of the course. Examinations will test extended writing in subjects such as English and history, have fewer bite-sized and overly structured questions, and in mathematics and science there should be greater emphasis on quantitative problem-solving. Internal assessments and the use of exam aids will be kept to a minimum and used only where there is a compelling case to do so, to provide for effective and deep assessment of the specified curriculum content.</p> <p pid="a.441.1/6">Importantly, the new GCSEs will be universal qualifications and I expect the same proportion of pupils to sit them as now. This is something we believe the vast <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of children with a good education should be able to achieve. However, reformed GCSEs will no longer set an artificial cap on how much pupils can achieve by forcing students to choose between higher and foundation tiers. Reformed GCSEs should allow students to access any grade while enabling high-quality assessment at all levels. The appropriate approach to assessment will vary between subjects, and a range of solutions may come forward&#8212;for example, extension papers offering access to higher grades alongside a common core. There should be no disincentive for schools to give an open choice of papers to their pupils.&#160;</p> <p pid="a.441.1/8">I have asked Ofqual to ensure we have new GCSEs in the core academic subjects of English, maths, the sciences, history and geography, ready for teaching in 2015. These proposals will, I believe, achieve a swift and significant rise in standards right across the country, equipping far more young people with the knowledge and skills they need to achieve their full potential.</p> <p pid="a.441.1/9">However, reforming qualifications alone is not enough to ensure higher standards for every child, and we must also reform how schools are graded to encourage higher expectations for every student. Existing league tables have focused almost exclusively on how many children achieve a C pass in five GCSEs, including English and maths, but that deceptively simple measure contains three perverse incentives. It encourages schools to choose exams based on how easy they are to pass, rather than how valuable they are to the student; it causes a narrow concentration on just five subjects, instead of a broad curriculum; and it focuses teachers&#8217; time and energy too closely on those pupils on the C/D borderline, at the expense of their higher or lower-achieving peers.</p> <p pid="a.441.1/10">Today I am proposing a more balanced and meaningful accountability system, with two new measures&#8212;the percentage of pupils in each school reaching an attainment threshold in the vital core subjects of English and maths; and an average point score showing how much progress every student makes between key stage 2 and key stage 4. The average point score measure will reflect pupils&#8217; achievement across a wide range of eight subjects. As well as English and maths, it will measure how well pupils perform in at least three subjects from the English baccalaureate&#8212;sciences, history, geography, languages&#8212;as well as computer science, and also in three additional subjects, whether arts subjects, academic subjects or high-quality vocational qualifications.</p> <p pid="a.441.1/11">That measure will incentivise schools to offer a broad, balanced curriculum, with high-quality teaching and high achievement across the board. It will also affirm the importance of every child enjoying the opportunity to pursue English baccalaureate subjects. By measuring average point scores rather than a single cut-off point, the new measure will ensure that the achievement of all students, including low attainers and high achievers, is recognised equally.</p> <p pid="a.441.1/12">Alongside today&#8217;s proposed changes to exams and league tables, we are also publishing our proposals for the new national curriculum in England. Over the past two years, we have examined and analysed the curricula used in the world&#8217;s most successful school systems in jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, Massachusetts and Singapore. We have combined the best elements of their curricula with some of the most impressive practice from state schools in this country. The result is published today in a new draft national curriculum for the 21st century, which embodies high expectations in every subject.</p> <p pid="a.441.1/13">We are determined to give every child, regardless of background, a broad and balanced education, so that by the time their compulsory education is complete, they are well equipped for further study, future employment and adult life. All the current national curriculum subjects will be retained at both primary and secondary levels, with the important addition of foreign languages, to be taught in key stage 2. Our new draft programmes of study in core subjects are both challenging and ambitious. They focus tightly on the fundamental building blocks of study, so that every child has the knowledge and understanding to succeed.</p> <p pid="a.441.1/15">A key principle of our reforms is that the statutory national curriculum should form only part of the whole school curriculum, not its entirety. Each individual school should have the freedom to shape the whole curriculum to their particular pupils&#8217; aspirations&#8212;a freedom already enjoyed by the growing numbers of academies and free schools, as well, of course, as schools in the independent sector. Programmes of study in almost all subjects&#8212;subjects other than primary English, mathematics and science&#8212;have been significantly slimmed down, and we have specifically stripped out unnecessary prescription about how to teach, and concentrated only on the essential knowledge and skills that every child should master.</p> <p pid="a.441.1/16">In maths&#8212;learning from east Asia&#8212;there is a stronger emphasis on arithmetic and more demanding content in fractions, decimals and percentages, to build solid foundations for algebra. In the sciences, there is rigorous detail on the key scientific processes from evolution to energy. In English, there is more clarity on spelling, punctuation and grammar, as well as a new emphasis on the great works of the literary canon. In foreign languages, there will be a new stress on learning proper grammatical structures and practising translation.</p> <p pid="a.441.1/17">In geography, there is an emphasis on locational knowledge, using maps and locating key geographical features from capital cities to the world&#8217;s great rivers; and in history, there is a clear narrative of British progress, with a proper emphasis on heroes and heroines from our past. In art and design, there is a stronger emphasis on painting and drawing skills. In music, there is a balance between performance and appreciation. We have also replaced the old information and communications technology curriculum with a new computing curriculum, with help from Google, Facebook and some of Britain&#8217;s most brilliant computer scientists. We have also included rigorous computer science GCSEs in the English baccalaureate.</p> <p pid="a.441.1/18">With sharper accountability, a more ambitious curriculum and world-class qualifications, I believe we can create an education system that can compete with the best in the world&#8212;a system that gives every young person, regardless of background, the high-quality education, high aspirations and high achievement they need and deserve. I commend this statement to the House.</p>            </div>

This is a humiliating climbdown. The trouble with this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> is that he thinks he knows the answer to everything, so he digs out the fag packet and comes up with his latest wheeze. What does that result in? It results in free schools that do not get built, scrapping <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS-levels">AS-levels</a>, which Cambridge university hates, and the rejection of English baccalaureate certificates by the CBI, which says they are a mistake. This is a familiar routine; one of the Secretary of State&#8217;s advisers briefs the</p> <p class="italic" pid="a.443.0/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail">Daily Mail</a></p> <p pid="a.443.0/5">, and when it falls apart by lunchtime, it is time to blame the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>. His priority is pandering to the right wing of the Conservative party.</p> <p pid="a.443.0/6">Parents and pupils are left confused and frustrated. Will the Secretary of State now apologise to them for this shambles? Having done down their hard work on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCSEs">GCSEs</a>, will he accept that that was the wrong thing to do? The statement demonstrates once again his flawed vision for education and a total misunderstanding of the future needs of our country.</p> <p pid="a.443.0/7">Last September, the Secretary of State said:</p> <p pid="a.443.0/8">&#8220;After years of drift&#8230;we are&#8230;reforming our examination system to compete with the world&#8217;s best.&#8221;&#8212;[<a href="/search/?pop=1&s=date:20120917+column:655+section:debates"><i>Hansard</i>, 17 September 2012; Vol. 550, c. 655</a>.]</p> <p pid="a.443.0/9">Is it not the case that he is the one adrift? This is a total shambles. Forced into apologising to the House when he scrapped <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Schools_for_the_Future">Building Schools for the Future</a> and forced into a partial U-turn on school sport, he should have learnt his lesson by now. It is simple, really: before announcing a bright idea, would it not make sense to check it first with the deputy headmaster?</p> <p pid="a.443.0/10">I want to pay tribute to those who have argued against the Secretary of State&#8217;s plans. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_CBI">The CBI</a> said that they would leave young people in a holding pattern when they need a clear target to aim for at 18. Entrepreneurs, such as the inventor of the iPhone, said the impact on this country&#8217;s economy would have been catastrophic. The head of the leading private schools association said that the Secretary of State was hankering after a bygone era. Backward looking, narrow and two-tier, the best thing would be for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Secretary">Education Secretary</a> to go back to the drawing board. Instead, we have another back-of-the-envelope plan: a new national curriculum, following the last one that his own expert advisers said was deeply flawed.</p> <p pid="a.443.0/11">Education is too important for this kind of short-term thinking. Most children only get one chance at their GCSEs. Surely their future is too important to be subjected to the usual party politicking and parliamentary game-playing. <i>[</i><i>Laughter.</i><i>]</i> Conservative Members laugh at the suggestion that that is the case. If <a href="/mp/?m=40475" title="Our page on Andrew Stephenson - 'the hon. Member for Pendle (Andrew Stephenson)'">Andrew Stephenson</a> visits schools in his <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, that is the message he will hear from teachers, parents and pupils. We have to focus on standards, and move beyond this shambles. Surely there should be a cross-party consensus on a future plan for the next generation of qualifications. That should be based on the best available expert evidence, not on the back of an envelope. Will he do things differently this time?</p>            </div>

One of the benefits of the national curriculum approach that we are taking today is that one of the areas that matters most to heads and teachers&#8212;how they teach&#8212;will be devolved to their responsibility. It has been the case in the past that prescriptive teaching methods and particular styles of pedagogy have sometimes intruded into the national curriculum. We have stripped them out to concentrate on the knowledge that every child should expect to have and that every parent needs to know their child is receiving.</p>            </div>

Gentleman, who was a distinguished Chairman of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> on Children, Schools and Families. I am sorry that the speed of my diction was too fast for him, but I believe that the clarity of our proposals was understood very well by those on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> and other Members who have spoken. As I mentioned earlier, our proposals have also been welcomed by head teacher organisations. They have given that welcome because we did exactly what the hon. Gentleman enjoined me to do: we consulted. We put forward proposals, some of them very radical, for change to our examination system. Many of those proposals have been welcomed. One of them&#8212;one that was dear to my heart&#8212;was a bridge too far. I have listened, and that is why we have dropped it. I hope that in future we will continue to work&#8212;as I have worked so pleasantly with him in so many other areas&#8212;to achieve consensus for all our children.</p>            </div>

Gentleman&#8217;s Committee for the fantastic work it has done in the past and I look forward to reading the report. We have ensured, I hope, with the national curriculum changes we are making, that the building blocks of a mathematical and scientific knowledge will be there in order to ensure that higher-level engineering qualifications can be enjoyed and achieved by a wider group of pupils than ever before. Of course, when we make our propositions, we always look at the evidence. I was delighted earlier this week to see that a number of scientists in America were looking at the initial outline of our approach to our curriculum.

There was consensus between the Committee and Ofqual on one of the flaws in our proposals, and I listened to the evidence that they both produced.

One of the changes that the English baccalaureate has helped to cement is that students will be clearer about the subjects that they need to take in order to get on to a particular course or into a particular university or college. Given how fast the world is changing, it is vital that we ensure that the advice is tailored to every student in the right way. It is also important that students recognise the potential of new subjects, such as computing, to offer them an even richer range of chances to succeed.</p>            </div>

We retain the option of moving in that direction if exam boards do not change the way in which they operate, but I have been encouraged by the eagerness with which awarding organisations have responded to Ofqual&#8217;s desire to ensure that standards are higher. I note that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> did not acknowledge Ofqual or thank it for the work it did to ensure that the English GCSE and other <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCSEs">GCSEs</a> were protected as gold standard qualifications.

I realised, however, as I mentioned in my statement, that the best was the enemy of the good. The case made by Ofqual, the detail it produced and the warning it gave, as well as the work done by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a>, convinced me that it was better to proceed on the basis of consensus around the very many changes that made sense rather than to push this particular point.</p>            </div>

I am delighted that so many of the changes that we have made which were initially controversial and vigorously contested&#8212;from the introduction of academies and free schools to changes in the way in which teachers are paid and rewarded&#8212;are now accepted.

I think there was a case for the change he describes, but I felt that the best was the enemy of the good, and we agreed it would be better to put this to one side. We are still not clear whether Labour believes we should move towards having a single exam board. That was its position last September; we do not know whether it has U-turned since then.

Let me also take this opportunity to say that the role of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Seacole">Mary Seacole</a> is not just cemented but enhanced in the curriculum. I also believe the new history curriculum is fairer in its treatment of black and minority ethnic figures in European and world history, and is more inclusive in its approach to the contribution women have made to our past, but I look forward to hearing all responses from both sides of the House about how we can make sure the subject is taught properly. As for creative and artistic subjects, we will do everything possible, working with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_Council">Arts Council</a> and others, to make sure that they are of high quality.</p>            </div>

There is a higher level of ambition at every stage in the national curriculum and a decisive shift towards 21st-century<sup>( )</sup>subjects, so that mathematics is more rigorous and the computing science curriculum is more attuned to the demands of today. Critically, that curriculum will not only prepare people to be the programmers of the future, but help to keep children safe online by ensuring that e-safety is at the heart of how children are taught in primary school.</p>            </div>
