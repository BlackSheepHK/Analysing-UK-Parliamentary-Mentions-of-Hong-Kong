The CAA will be run along similar lines to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FSA">FSA</a>. Although the NAO is tasked with keeping track of taxpayers&#8217; money, it has oversight of the FSA, which receives no income from the taxpayer. The CAA will be in the same position. There are clear parallels between the two organisations, so why will the NAO not have oversight of the CAA as well?Other industry-funded regulators are subject to NAO oversight, including Ofgem, which is funded by the energy companies, Ofwat, which is funded by the water companies, and <a href="/glossary/?gl=217" title="Ofcom is the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK..." class="glossary">Ofcom</a>, which is funded by broadcasters, the media and communications providers.

As she will recall, I raised the concerns of a very big business and a large industry in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>&#8212;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHL">DHL</a> and the industry trade body, the Association of International Courier &amp; Express Services&#8212;about the information provisions. I thanked the Minister then and I thank her now for the positive comments she made about the express services sector. As she acknowledged, DHL is a very significant employer in my constituency, and obviously a key player in the wider UK exports market.</p> <p pid="b.1022.0/4">As the Minister knows, the express sector as a whole is broadly supportive of the Bill and wants to work with the Government and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Authority">Civil Aviation Authority</a> to ensure that the security aspects are implemented effectively and in consultation with all stakeholders. However, AICES members are concerned that express services have been incorporated into the information on services provisions, which they feel are not appropriate to the sector.</p> <p pid="b.1022.0/5">First, express services operate in a different and a very competitive marketplace, and failure to provide the necessary information to their customers would simply result in those customers moving their account. It is a very fluid market indeed. As the Minister acknowledged in Committee, this is mainly a business-to-business sector rather than a business-to-consumer sector, which makes it very different from passenger traffic on airlines. In consequence, the level of regulation required is also very different. I know that the Minister has acknowledged this key difference in the sectors being regulated&#8212;between air passenger traffic and express&#8212;and it would be helpful to know whether she believes that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAA">CAA</a> shares her views.</p> <p pid="b.1022.0/6">Secondly, as I said in Committee, <a href="/glossary/?gl=217" title="Ofcom is the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK..." class="glossary">Ofcom</a> already has the relevant powers on the provision of information on express services under the enabling provisions of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_Services_Act_2011">Postal Services Act 2011</a>. I was concerned about a possible duplication here. The enabling provisions under section 51 of the 2011 Act could further extend to cover under subsection (3)(d)</p> <p pid="b.1022.0/7">&#8220;the information that is to be made available by postal operators to users of their services about service standards and about the rights of those users&#8221;,</p> <p pid="b.1022.0/8">and under subsection (3)(e)</p> <p pid="b.1022.0/9">&#8220;anything else appearing to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OFCOM">OFCOM</a> to be necessary to secure effective protection for those users.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1022.0/10">That is effectively duplicated in information terms in the Bill. Under this particular section, express services constitute postal operators.</p> <p pid="b.1022.0/11">Ofcom has judged that there has been no market failure in the provision of information and that the powers in the Act are not required to be used at present. They are still there, however, so conferring the CAA with the same powers will lead to regulatory duplication. Existing legislation already provides for the required &#8220;future-proofing&#8221; that we talked about so much in Committee.</p> <p pid="b.1022.0/12">Finally, but crucially, the express sector is different from air passenger traffic because the mode of transport is not relevant to the consumer. The key factor is the time required to get a package from A to B. How it gets there is completely irrelevant. Most of the time it will be done by air in this particular sector, but sometimes it will be done by truck&#8212;and sometimes, perhaps, on public transport. Obviously, the same cannot be said for air passengers unless they are unfortunate enough to land on the wrong runway at Heathrow and want to get to terminal 4. That fact means that the consumer would expect Ofcom, not the CAA, to be the relevant regulator. Making the CAA the regulator for the provision of information services in the express sector would be confusing, and unlikely to bring any benefits to consumers.</p> <p pid="b.1022.0/14">I hope that the Minister will comment, will look again at the issue, and will perhaps even consider meeting me, along with representatives of the Association of International Courier &amp; Express Services, to discuss the association&#8217;s legitimate concerns.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.1024.0/1">Amendments 2 and 1&#8212;that is the order in which they appear on the selection list&#8212;may be considered to be either relatively minor or the most important amendments to the Bill, depending on how they are interpreted.</p> <p pid="b.1024.0/2">This is the &#8220;minor&#8221; aspect. I asked in Committee why the word &#8220;effectiveness&#8221; was not included in <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 1(3)(c) and clause 2(4)(c), along with the words &#8220;economy&#8221; and &#8220;efficiency&#8221;. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8217;s responses are always very courteous and comprehensive, but on this occasion, unusually, I was not satisfied that there was a good reason for the absence of the word &#8220;effectiveness&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b.1024.0/3">When I was more centrally involved in local government, we regularly spoke to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit_Commission">Audit Commission</a>. It used to refer to the &#8220;three E&#8217;s&#8221;&#8212;effectiveness, efficiency and economy&#8212;and used to joke that &#8220;economy&#8221; was usually left out. That is not surprising in view of the dictionary definitions of all three words. &#8220;Effectiveness&#8221; apparently means</p> <p pid="b.1024.0/4">&#8220;to accomplish the purpose, producing expected results.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1024.0/5">The meaning of &#8220;efficiency&#8221; is self-evident:</p> <p pid="b.1024.0/6">&#8220;performing or functioning in the best possible manner with the least waste of time and effort&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b.1024.0/7">Those are clear and relatively objective terms. &#8220;Economic&#8221;, however, is defined as</p> <p pid="b.1024.0/8">&#8220;pertaining to the production, distribution, and use of income, wealth, and commodities.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1024.0/9">It is a much more general term, and it is the one that the Audit Commission used to say was left out. Why on earth do clauses 1 and 2 not state that the holders of licences should be effective, which is surely very important? Although I consider that to be the relatively minor aspect of the amendments, it goes to the heart of the Bill. As I have said on a number of occasions, although the Bill gives the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAA">CAA</a> new responsibilities to look after the interests of consumers, it does not tell us either how that is to be done or what the consumer&#8217;s interests are.</p> <p pid="b.1024.0/10">The Bill states that the CAA must oversee airports to ensure that there is continuity, and that air transport services have regard to</p> <p pid="b.1024.0/11">&#8220;the range, availability, cost and quality of airport operation services.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1024.0/12">That in itself is fair enough, but the Bill does not give the CAA the overarching purpose of improving aviation and ensuring that it continues to form a major part of the United Kingdom economy.</p> <p pid="b.1024.0/13">Our demand for the inclusion of the word &#8220;effectiveness&#8221; highlights the strong deficiency in the Bill that we debated in Committee. No real political controversy is involved in changing the nature of the functions of the</p> <p pid="b.1024.0/14">CAA, whether we are talking about the regulation of air space or the ensuring of economy and safety. That is not a matter of great debate between the parties. There is a great debate between Members and parties, however, about how aviation should develop and whether we should continue to be a leading country in aviation, and about whether our economy, which depends on aviation, should be hindered by not having the aviation facilities we deserve. I could make a very long speech about these matters. I shall not do so, but I do want to make a few important points.</p> <p pid="b.1024.0/15">I believe that many Conservative Members, and many members of the Government, want to improve our aviation facilities, including by increasing the capacity of airports in south-east England. Unfortunately however, they are caught in a situation where the tail is wagging the dog. Indeed, there are two tails. Dogs with two tails are usually known to be particularly happy, but not in this instance. There is the Lib Dem tail, as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lib_Dems">Lib Dems</a> have for historical&#8212;and, I think, mistaken&#8212;reasons always opposed increasing airport capacity in south-east England. The Government tail is also being wagged by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson">Boris Johnson</a>, current <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_London">Mayor of London</a>, who believes he can only win the mayoral election by opposing the expansion of airports within the London system, and by proposing instead an absurd island airport in far east London&#8212;in the Thames estuary, in fact. That may be good for his chances in the mayoral election, but it is extremely bad for the country.</p>            </div>

It is driven by an understanding of the importance of ensuring that aviation has the space to grow, but also that it does so within parameters that address the local impacts of aviation, such as aircraft noise and air quality, which, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will agree, can be corrosive. We also need aviation to play its part in our efforts to tackle climate change.

The noise around airports is diminishing as planes get quieter, and air quality is regulated by European regulations, with most of the pollution around airports being caused by cars and other road traffic. That needs to be dealt with, but the levels are set by European regulations, and those levels cannot be surpassed.</p> <p pid="b.1025.1/2">Those arguing against increasing airport capacity often say that that will help in our commitments to reducing carbon dioxide emissions. As we demonstrated in Committee however, that is not the case, because as a result passengers on intercontinental journeys often have to fly via other countries, so they have to take off twice, which produces extra pollution and extra carbon dioxide.</p> <p pid="b.1025.1/3">If the Government carry through their intention to put aviation into the European emissions trading scheme, as with the polluter on the ground, aviation will be dealt with on a Europe-wide basis, so we do not need an extra domestic policy to address the issue. The Government&#8217;s current policy is strangling the British economy.</p>            </div>

The situation is directing passengers to airports in Europe that have added extra runways, such as Madrid, to where <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways">British Airways</a> has moved much of its operations, and Charles de Gaulle. <a href="/mp/?m=40198" title="Our page on Chris Heaton-Harris - 'The hon. Member for Daventry (Chris Heaton-Harris)'">Chris Heaton-Harris</a> was talking about integrators. The two main centres for freight in the aviation industry are Brussels and Charles de Gaulle; we have already lost out on those issues. Passengers are going to Madrid, Charles de Gaulle, Schiphol and Frankfurt, and, increasingly, to Copenhagen, at the expense of London. That is damaging not only the London economy, but the UK regions, because of the decreasing number of routes from the regional economies into Heathrow, in particular, and into the whole of the south-east system.</p>            </div>

Before the debate, I looked up on the internet how many cities in China have a population of more than 1 million&#8212;the size of Birmingham. There are 160 cities that are bigger than or the same size as Birmingham and five cities that are bigger than London, three of which are not very well known. The biggest, Chongqing, has a population of 31.4 million, but how many air routes do we have to Chongqing? There are routes to Shanghai from London but from nowhere else in the UK. The others are Beijing, Guangzhou&#8212;or Canton, as most people would know it&#8212;and Tianjin.

Member for Blackley and Broughton (Graham Stringer)'">Graham Stringer</a>. First, let me respond to what he said about Heathrow and China. We all see the adverts in Westminster tube station, but there is a fundamental inconsistency with the line being pushed by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_London">Mayor of London</a>, among others, that Heathrow is essential as a hub but that we do not have enough point-to-point flights to different places in China. The model used by BA and its oneworld alliance relies not just on Heathrow as a hub but on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, too. It is deciding that it is more effective to use Hong Kong as a hub, for all the reasons given by the hon. Gentleman and others, and to fly to all those Chinese cities with greater frequency and service out of Hong Kong. I do not accept the argument that a lack of point-to-point flights from Heathrow to cities in China makes the case that Heathrow needs a third runway to be a hub airport. The very economies of the hub and of the Heathrow and Hong Kong dual hub model for service for China leads to the system that we have.</p>            </div>

Hubs developing in the middle east are doing a similar job in serving parts of China and there are also hubs in south-east Asia. A better measure of the failure of Government policy is the number of airlines that want to get into Heathrow from all parts of the world but cannot do so. A number of those airlines, some from China and some from other developing countries with large growth rates, have applied but cannot get their aeroplanes into Heathrow.

BA uses most of those landing slots, has capitalised the value and does not sell many of them on, partly to ensure that there is only limited competition so it can maximise its profits. I will return to that point, but I have quite a lot of sympathy with the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s arguments that the regulator should look to ensure that licence holders&#8212;airports&#8212;are effective as well as economic and efficient.</p> <p pid="b.1028.2/2">I also have considerable sympathy with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8217;s new clauses on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Audit_Office">National Audit Office</a> oversight. However, I understand that those are only intended to be probing. I hope that that will also be the case with his amendments, because ultimately I trust the Minister on this issue. I do so for the ultimate reason that, in so many areas of public policy one can pretty much know what the policy will be by looking at where the money is&#8212;where the vested interests lie&#8212;and at what the civil servants are pressing. Too often Ministers merely oversee that policy solution. In this area I believe that it is the personal, political <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> of the Minister, both as shadow <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> in <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> and now as Minister responsible for aviation policy, that led to, and kept, the Conservative policy against a third runway at Heathrow.</p>            </div>

Gentleman&#8217;s <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, there are such significant plans for expansion. At Gatwick, too, there is significant expansion, even of the one runway, and the possibility of a second runway from 2019. I wonder whether one option might be rail links between Heathrow and Gatwick and/or Luton, and whether the charges could pay for those. I am interested in hearing about the Northolt options and what the impact might be if Northolt were linked in to Heathrow. I very much believe that Birmingham airport, in terms of being half an hour from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Oak_Common">Old Oak Common</a> or 40 minutes from Euston on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Speed_2">High Speed 2</a>, can become a very significant player in the south-east aviation market.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.1029.7/1">I strongly support our policy of promoting <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Speed_2">High Speed 2</a> for inter-regional transport within the UK. I recognise the value of transfer passengers at Heathrow for the provision of the network it has, but I do not ultimately see how it is a disaster for the British economy if some people from the regions transfer at a European hub for some flights, rather than always coming to Heathrow. What I would like to see at Heathrow is high value flights that produce the best outcome for the country as a whole. Having Heathrow operated effectively would be very sensible. It has significantly increased its landing charges in order to pay for the third runway and, under the quinquennial review,</p> <p pid="b.1029.7/2">Heathrow-<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a> has carried on raking in that money, even though it is not investing in the third runway that that money was meant to fund. I do not see how that makes sense.</p> <p pid="b.1029.7/3">Most people refer to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAA">CAA</a> as a good and effective regulator, but how will it remain so? What certainty do we have about that? That is why a role for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAO">NAO</a>, expectations that it should be efficient in its management, and a role in ensuring the effectiveness of licence holders are, in principle, sensible things to ask for. I hope the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, the Department and in due course the CAA will listen to Members and ensure that those things happen.</p> <p pid="b.1029.7/4">The point made by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40198" title="Our page on Chris Heaton-Harris - 'the Member for Daventry (Chris Heaton-Harris)'">Chris Heaton-Harris</a> about freight transport&#8212;that the consumer is indifferent to the mechanism used for that freight transport&#8212;may also apply to Heathrow. As an economist, my assessment is that the end user, the consumer of flight services through Heathrow, may be indifferent to the level of landing charges to the extent that the price of tickets is set by the scarcity and the monopolistic pricing at Heathrow, rather than on the basis of the cost of using Heathrow. Therefore, just as I previously suggested that there might be a great deal of investment in Heathrow, which could be good for consumers without pushing up prices for those end users, so, if the CAA were to be a flabby and inefficient regulator that was putting its own charges on the industry, it could potentially do that without the statutory constraint of acting in the interests of the users of those services.</p> <p pid="b.1029.7/5">We have seen that the scarcity at Heathrow has become capitalised in the costs of slots. When they are traded, it can be &#163;5 million or &#163;10 million now per pair of take-off and landing slots, to the great benefit potentially of BA, but to who else&#8217;s benefit? That has happened not through a decision of the House, and not even through the development of the common law, but through the development of European jurisprudence in this area. There is very significant value there. The CAA could potentially transfer that value from BA to BAA with little, if any, impact on the consumer, or it could allow for significantly greater investment, or it could be quite flabby and inefficient or, to the extent that Government policy influences this and we have air passenger duty which is higher for the south-east or particularly higher for Heathrow, that might raise money to help the Government close the deficit, without having a negative impact on the users of Heathrow. All these are significant points that need to be considered, along with the value for money and the effectiveness propositions.</p> <p pid="b.1029.7/6">I should like to address briefly the issues raised in Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 19 in relation to the market power determination. I support the Bill and the Minister, and I will defer to her judgment on this, but I am nervous about the extent to which we are giving power to the CAA to make this market power determination. It used to apply to Manchester; it no longer does. I have heard arguments with respect to Stansted and to Gatwick as to why it should not apply. The risk with Stansted, I would have thought, is not so much that it would shove up the prices massively, but that Stansted may not be competing effectively with Heathrow as it would if it were under separate ownership.</p> <p pid="b.1029.7/7">We have just heard comments about flights to Asia and emerging markets, but we have recently seen significant openings of routes into and out of Gatwick to places such as Vietnam and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea">South Korea</a>. There may be the prospect of significant further movement in that direction. But larger airlines&#8212;A380s and so on&#8212;currently do not have particularly good service at Gatwick, and it is difficult for Gatwick to invest to service the A380s and to have people transferring straight from the plane into the terminal, because of the significant cost involved and the need at least to bring along the current airline users of the airport and the great difficulty of putting through the investment if they are fighting it tooth and nail.</p> <p pid="b.1029.7/9">If Gatwick feels that it should invest significant sums of money in better terminal facilities in order to service the A380s and that type of airline and allow the sorts of routes to high-growth markets in Asia that we so strongly support, I see no strong reason why it should be prevented from doing so and charging what the market will bear. I believe that that could be to the benefit of the consumer. The CAA might be a good regulator and take that into account, but at least the idea, in principle, of allowing freer competition and having less regulation and fewer airports with the market power determination&#8212;it is only really Heathrow where there is clearly substantial power&#8212;might lead to a more competitive system in which Gatwick and Stansted were free in the way Manchester now is. I am not certain, but it might do so. Under the Bill, it will now fall to the CAA to make that decision, unless this is reconsidered before the Bill is passed. I would like to pay my regards to the Minister and say that I trust her position on this and hope that the CAA will make the right decisions as well.</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 63 by specifying that the functions captured by the references to &#8220;relevant 1998 Act functions&#8221; in clause 63 are the functions specified in clause 62(2). <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment_15">Amendment 15</a> enables further clarification of how clause 70 will operate. Clause 70 provides that two or more persons are joint operators of an airport where they jointly have overall responsibility for the management of all the area. It is important to be able to identify the operator or joint operators so that there is clarity about who is appropriately subject to regulation.</p> <p pid="b.1031.0/3">Concern has also been expressed, for example by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways">British Airways</a>, that the test could draw some companies into the regulatory system in a way that is not intended, for example when an airline is involved in running the terminal from which its flights take off. Amendment 15 provides that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> has the same powers to make regulations when two or more persons are to be treated as having overall responsibility for the management of an area, as she already has for sole operators under the Bill. If unforeseen problems emerge, further clarity could be provided by secondary legislation.</p> <p pid="b.1031.0/4">On Government amendment 19, the intention of clause 77(5) is to exclude persons carrying out exempt Crown functions from economic regulation under chapters 1 and 3 of the Bill. The Bill already provides that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Border_Force">UK Border Force</a> and the police, who currently carry out exempt functions on behalf of the Crown, are not subject to the prohibition on levying charges in clause 3. Amendment 19 ensures consistency, removing the possibility of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAA">CAA</a> being required, in response to a request under clause 7(2) to make a market power determination in respect of a core airport area operated by a person exercising exempt Crown functions. It also disapplies the requirement under clause 14(4) to treat persons carrying out exempt Crown functions as having applied for a licence if there is a positive market power determination.</p> <p pid="b.1031.0/5">After the excitement of Government amendments, I now turn to new clause 4, which relates to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Audit_Office">National Audit Office</a>. I fully agree with <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Front Benchers and others about the need for the CAA to be efficient in carrying out its functions, but I am afraid that I am not persuaded that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAO">NAO</a> would deliver more effective scrutiny than the current mechanisms by which the CAA&#8217;s functions are audited and scrutinised.</p> <p pid="b.1031.0/6">Moreover, the CAA is overwhelmingly funded by the aviation industry, whereas the NAO&#8217;s role is to scrutinise public spending on Parliament&#8217;s behalf, and the income the CAA receives from the industry is not classified as public spending. Parliament recognised that by removing the NAO&#8217;s role in 1984. As the shadow Minister acknowledged, the issue was considered by Sir Joseph Pilling in his 2008 review of the CAA. He concluded that there was no need for NAO involvement, and that recommendation was accepted by Ministers under the previous Government, and I have yet to see convincing reasons why they were wrong.</p> <p pid="b.1031.0/7">There are other examples of industry-funded regulators that come under the scrutiny of the National Audit Office, as the shadow Minister said, but most either are non-ministerial Government departments or rely on Government funding for a significant amount of their income. Others, such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Services_Authority">Financial Services Authority</a> and the Office of Rail Regulation, are funded by industries that receive or have received significant taxpayer support&#8212;distinguishing them, again, from the aviation sector, where such indirect taxpayer support is not present.</p> <p pid="b.1031.0/8">To provide reassurance in response to the concerns that have been raised, I shall highlight the strength of the current scrutiny arrangements. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State appoints the CAA&#8217;s external auditors; she presents the CAA&#8217;s accounts to Parliament by placing the annual report statement in the Library; she is involved in the development of the authority&#8217;s corporate plan; with the Treasury&#8217;s consent she approves the national loans and sets the CAA&#8217;s required rate of return on capital; and she will continue to approve the pay of the chairman and the non-executive members of the CAA board. That oversight, combined with the work of the CAA&#8217;s independent auditors, gives a strong incentive to secure value for money and offers accountability to Parliament.</p> <p pid="b.1031.0/9">I also advise the House that the CAA has implemented the Pilling recommendation on establishing a programme of value-for-money audits. The CAA also consults on its charges and fees, giving stakeholders the opportunity to raise any concerns that they have&#8212;they are always robust in making their views known&#8212;and the Bill makes such consultation an explicit legal requirement.</p> <p pid="b.1031.0/11">There are therefore already effective mechanisms in place to ensure that the CAA acts efficiently. As the shadow Minister said, however, when we considered a similar new clause in Committee, I undertook to reflect on these issues and whether additional reassurance could be given on them. I am therefore today announcing a change to the CAA&#8217;s accounting direction, which I hope will provide some further reassurance.</p> <p pid="b.1031.0/12">Every year the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFT">DFT</a> issues a report direction and an accounts direction to the CAA, specifying the matters that should be addressed in the authority&#8217;s annual report and accounts. The Secretary of State intends to make an addition to the accounts direction for 2013 and succeeding years which will for the first time require the CAA to include an efficiency statement in the annual report. The CAA has also agreed to do so for its activities in the current financial year.</p> <p pid="b.1031.0/13">The efficiency statement will be subject to validation by the external auditors, whose statement in the annual report will contain a summary of their findings on it, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Transport">Department for Transport</a> will approve the terms of reference for this work. Industry representatives on the CAA&#8217;s finance advisory group will be given an opportunity to discuss the statement.</p> <p pid="b.1031.0/14">One advantage of such action over the Opposition&#8217;s proposed change is that it strengthens the existing annual process of scrutiny, with transparency in relation to industry and to Parliament when the Secretary of State presents the accounts, whereas the NAO&#8217;s focus on the CAA would inevitably be less frequent than any annual one. Our approach also enables the CAA to continue to pursue value for money through the selection of its external auditor by tender.</p> <p pid="b.1031.0/15">Although I agree with the Opposition about the sentiment of new clause 5, which would impose an explicit efficiency duty on the CAA, I think its adoption is unnecessary because the authority is already subject to such a duty in all but name. The CAA&#8217;s strategic plan contains the objective</p> <p pid="b.1031.0/16">&#8220;to ensure that CAA is an efficient and effective organisation which meets Better Regulation Principles and gives value for money&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1031.0/17">Subsections (3) and (4) of clause 1 already require the CAA to carry out its economic regulation functions under part 1 of the Bill transparently, accountably, proportionately and consistently. To meet its statutory obligation to act proportionately and to target activity only on cases where it is needed, the CAA is obliged to act efficiently and to have regard for the costs and benefits of its activities.</p> <p pid="b.1031.0/18">Moreover, the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 provides that all statutory regulators</p> <p pid="b.1031.0/19">&#8220;should be accountable for the efficiency and effectiveness of their activities&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b.1031.0/20">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Transport">Secretary of State for Transport</a> writes to the CAA chair setting objectives for its term, and the most recent such letter makes it very clear that the Government expect the CAA to operate efficiently and to minimise the cost to industry. That oversight, combined with the work of the CAA auditors, gives a strong incentive to secure value for money and offers accountability to Parliament. Over the past 10 years, the CAA has reduced its operating costs in real terms by more than 20%.</p> <p pid="b.1031.0/22">I turn now to the points made by <a href="/mp/?m=40091" title="Our page on Graham Stringer - 'the hon. Member for Blackley and Broughton (Graham Stringer)'">Graham Stringer</a>. I will not trespass on your patience, Madam <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>, with a broad-ranging discussion of aviation capacity, given that that was the subject of a new clause that was not selected, but I reassure the hon. Gentleman that we take this issue seriously and that our approach on a third runway at Heathrow is driven by the evidence on the impact that such a project would have. We believe that it is essential to find an alternative way to meet the long-term capacity needs of the UK economy.</p> <p pid="b.1031.0/23">Building a third runway at Heathrow would have a significant noise impact. People who live near Heathrow account for about 70% of the people in the UK and more than one in four of the people in Europe who are exposed to an average noise from airports of more than 55 dB. Thousands of people live with a plane going overhead every 90 seconds on a daily basis, not to mention the planes that wake them up at 4.30 in the morning. The quality-of-life impact of a third runway, which would mean 220,000 more flights every year over a densely populated part of London, would be significant. There is no technological solution in sight to ensure that planes will become quiet enough quickly enough to make the burden tolerable.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.1034.5/1">As I said, London is one of the most well connected cities in the world and arguably the most well connected. It has five or, depending on one&#8217;s definition, six successful international airports that serve our economy very well. We need this debate to be based on evidence, not on the propaganda that one reads on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAA">BAA</a> posters.</p> <p pid="b.1034.5/3">As I said, that matter is not, strictly speaking, germane to the motion, so before I try your patience, Madam <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>, I will turn to amendments 1 and 2 tabled by the hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackley_and_Broughton">Blackley and Broughton</a>. His intention is that &#8220;effectiveness&#8221; should be construed as spending wisely. Imposing such an obligation on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAA">CAA</a> could pull it into an inappropriate management role over regulated airports. I am sure that that is not his intention, given that he is rigorous in opposing disproportionate regulation.</p> <p pid="b.1034.5/4">My concern is that it is one thing to specify an output that is required, but quite another to specify the manner in which the operator should meet that obligation. The Bill gives the CAA the power to ensure that airports with substantial market power do not impose unreasonable charges on their customers or exploit them. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> might oblige the CAA to start telling an airport how to run its business in the most effective way. That outcome would be disproportionate.</p> <p pid="b.1034.5/5">The current wording in <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 1(3) is broadly understood by the stakeholders who are affected by the regime. Inserting the word &#8220;effectiveness&#8221; at this stage might undermine the clarity of the duties to which the CAA is subject, when clarity is one of the most important goals in the Bill.</p> <p pid="b.1034.5/6">My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40198" title="Our page on Chris Heaton-Harris - 'the Member for Daventry (Chris Heaton-Harris)'">Chris Heaton-Harris</a> is a staunch defender of the air freight industry, and it is always a pleasure to hear his contributions. I repeat the comments that I made in Committee about my admiration for the efficiency and success of that industry in the UK, and I reassure him again that in exercising its information powers in relation to the freight industry, the CAA is obliged to take a proportionate approach. The degree of <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> required in a business-to-business market may be less than is appropriate in the consumer market, and I am sure the CAA will take that on board in ensuring that it takes a proportionate approach.</p> <p pid="b.1034.5/7">I am sure that <a href="/glossary/?gl=217" title="Ofcom is the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK..." class="glossary">Ofcom</a> and the CAA will take care to avoid regulatory overlap. We do not believe that there is a significant danger of that, but there are ways to deal with such risks if they emerge in future, for example through memorandums of understanding. My hon. Friend also asked whether I would be happy to meet representatives of the air freight industry, and I would be delighted to do so.</p> <p pid="b.1034.5/8">I hope that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> will not press the new clause and amendments, but if they do, I must ask the House to vote against them.</p>            </div>
