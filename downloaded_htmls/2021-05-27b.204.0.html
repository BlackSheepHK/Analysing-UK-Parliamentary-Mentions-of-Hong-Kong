World Press Freedom Day, which falls on <phrase class="date" code="2021-05-03">3 May</phrase>, is a reminder to Governments of the need to respect their commitment to press freedom; a day of reflection among media professionals about issues of press freedom and professional ethics; and a day of support for media workers who are targets for the restraint or abolition of press freedom. It is also a day of remembrance for those journalists who lost their lives in the pursuit of a story.</p> <p pid="b189.3/4">I am grateful to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbench_Business_Committee">Backbench Business Committee</a> for having granted time for this debate today, which has been the first opportunity to hold it since the start of the new parliamentary Session. I also declare my interest as the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on media freedom, which is supported by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporters_Without_Borders">Reporters Without Borders</a>.</p> <p pid="b189.3/5">This debate comes in the wake of last Sunday&#8217;s hijacking of a civilian aircraft by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarusian_Government">Belarusian Government</a> in order to kidnap the journalist <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Protasevich">Roman Protasevich</a>, an outspoken critic of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Lukashenko">President Lukashenko</a>&#8217;s illegitimate and oppressive regime. This is one of the most audacious attacks on press freedom we have seen, but it is just another example of the increasingly brazen way in which Governments seek to oppress legitimate journalism with increasing impunity.</p> <p pid="b189.3/6">In 2018, we saw the murder of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Khashoggi">Jamal Khashoggi</a> by agents of the Saudi Arabian Government in the grounds of their own consulate in Istanbul. In 2017, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphne_Caruana_Galizia">Daphne Caruana Galizia</a>, a campaigning journalist who investigated corruption and organised crime and delved into visa-for-sale  schemes, energy deals and Caribbean offshore companies set up for Maltese politicians, was assassinated by a car bomb planted by a professional hitman.</p> <p pid="b189.3/7">According to Reporters Without Borders, 50 journalists were killed around the world last year, and a further 13 have already been killed in 2021. These include Sadida Sadat and Shahnaz Roufi in Afghanistan, who worked for Enikass <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV">TV</a>&#8217;s dubbing service and were gunned down in an alley in Jalalabad as they were walking home at around 4.30 pm. Their colleague Mursal Waheedi was shot in the rickshaw she had taken to go home. All three women were aged 20 or 21. Furthermore, in 2020, 387 journalists and media workers were held in detention: 117 of those were in China, and 34 were in the next highest country, Saudi Arabia. In the Philippines, in the five years since President Rodrigo Duterte came to power, 16 journalists have been killed in connection with their work, the latest of whom was beaten to death in May 2020.</p> <p pid="b189.3/8"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_freedom">Media freedom</a> is being threatened not just by violent physical attack, but by the use of dubious legal procedures to intimidate or close down journalists. In the Philippines, Maria Ressa, a journalist and the chief executive of the digital news service Rappler, has been under repeated legal attack since the election of Duterte. Rappler has tirelessly investigated human rights violations and the country&#8217;s increasingly authoritarian Government, and Ressa, whom I am proud to serve alongside on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Facebook_Oversight_Board">Real Facebook Oversight Board</a>, currently faces 10 open charges against her, relating to nine separate cases. Some of those have been brought retrospectively through new <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> created since the alleged offences occurred.</p> <p pid="b189.3/9">In this country, too, our legal system is being used to intimidate legitimate journalism through lawfare&#8212;the misuse of legal systems and principles against an opponent by seeking to damage or delegitimise them, wasting their time and money&#8212;and what is known as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLAPP">SLAPP</a>, a strategic lawsuit against public participation. Such actions are intended to censor, intimidate and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of legal defence until they abandon their criticism of the opponent. The initiator of such a lawsuit does not usually expect to win, but to wear down the defendant until they succumb to fear, intimidation and mounting legal costs or exhaustion, and cease their otherwise legitimate criticism. A current example is the journalist <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Belton">Catherine Belton</a>, author of &#8220;Putin&#8217;s People&#8221;, which was published last year by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarperCollins">HarperCollins</a>, who is facing lawsuits, along with her publisher, filed in London by four Russian businessmen, including <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Abramovich">Roman Abramovich</a>.</p> <p pid="b189.3/10">Mr Abramovich has also recently forced apologies from British newspapers&#8212;<a href="/glossary/?gl=49" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/" class="glossary">The Times</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Mail">The Daily Mail</a>&#8212;for stating that he gave a yacht, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Grand_Bleu">Le Grand Bleu</a>, to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Shvidler">Eugene Shvidler</a>, a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian-American">Russian-American</a> oil billionaire, despite the fact that Mr Shvidler had stated this himself in English court proceedings on <phrase class="date" code="2021-11-14">14 November</phrase>, 2011, during the hearing of the Berezovsky v. Abramovich case. I also understand that in 2019, Mr Abramovich&#8217;s lawyers were also successful in preventing the broadcast of a BBC &#8220;Panorama&#8221; investigation. It is interesting that Mr Abramovich, who is not a resident of the UK, has not visited the country since 2018 and has not been granted a new UK visa, can nevertheless retain the services of the London law firm Harbottle &amp; Lewis and has full access to the English courts.</p> <p pid="b189.3/11">Data protection legislation is also being routinely abused to make multiple requests against investigative journalists and corporate research and intelligence companies, for any information that they hold on any individual or organisation. In Australia, the Protection of Public Participation Act 2008 seeks to</p> <p class="indent" pid="b189.3/12" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;protect public participation, and discourage certain civil proceedings that a reasonable person would consider interfere with engagement in public participation.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b189.3/13">In the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">USA</a>, high-profile public figures are also limited in their access to the courts to pursue such cases. It is time we looked at whether such reforms are required in the UK, and also to review the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDPR">GDPR</a> legislation to prevent it from being used to intimidate those engaged in legitimate investigations acting in the public interest.</p> <p pid="b189.3/14">We also have to consider the commercial pressures faced by the news industry today, which pose perhaps one of the greatest threats to the freedom of the press. In 2019, the Cairncross review, commissioned by the Government, highlighted that the sales of both national and locally printed papers have plunged. They fell by roughly half between 2007 and 2017, and are still dropping. In addition, print advertising revenues, which used to carry much of the cost of producing news, have fallen even faster, declining in that decade by 69%. To cut costs there have been mergers, as well as heavy cuts in staffing numbers of frontline journalists in the UK, and in that period those numbers have dropped from 23,000 to 17,000, and the numbers are still falling.</p> <p pid="b189.3/15">These pressures came to light recently in Australia, where an investigation by its competition authority has highlighted that for every $100 of online advertising spend, $53 goes to Google, $28 to Facebook, and $19 to everybody else. This creates enormous pressure on other organisations, particularly news companies and publishers that have in the past relied on advertising revenue to pay their journalists and investigations. The decline in ad revenue for publishers is a direct challenge to the news industry itself, which has already led to the closures of a great number of publications, and many of those that have survived have had to make significant cuts and reductions.</p> <p pid="b189.3/16">In order to preserve the future of public interest journalism, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government">Australian Government</a> presented the news media bargaining code to oblige companies such as Facebook and Google to enter into commercial arrangements with the news industry to ensure fair renumeration for their content. It was only because they legislated to require this, and to give a regulator the power to mediate and set the term of renumeration if no deal was done, that Google and Facebook eventually did move. We have to consider what the role of journalism is in the digital age, where people increasingly use the internet as their primary source of news and information. The most recent <a href="/glossary/?gl=217" title="Ofcom is the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK..." class="glossary">Ofcom</a> &#8220;Media Nations&#8221; survey, published last summer, showed that around 35% of people now regularly get their news from Facebook.</p> <p pid="b189.3/17">News media and the freedom of the press face a constant assault every day. Direct challenges are issued, through social media, against &#8220;the mainstream media&#8221;, which is used as a derogatory term, seeking to persuade the public that they should not believe the so-called mainstream media on anything they write, whether critical or praiseworthy, and putting people in a position  where they simply do not know what they should believe anymore. In the world of social media, where algorithms of engagement drive content through those platforms, often it is the misleading or the downright lies and conspiracy theories that gain a bigger audience, are more interesting and are actively promoted by those platforms. When Parliament considers the online safety Bill later this year&#8212;it is currently in draft form&#8212;we must take into account the impact of harmful disinformation, spread through and sometimes amplified by social media, which is undermining news and, through that, democracy itself.</p> <p pid="b189.3/18">We need to protect journalism and the freedom of the press if we are to remain an open and democratic society. We need to recognise that those values are increasingly under attack from authoritarian Governments around the world who actively and deliberately target journalists, sometimes physically, sometimes emotionally, sometimes economically, but always with intent to suppress their necessary work. We need to ensure that our modern media landscape, driven by social media platforms and their engagement, still works to provide fair remuneration for journalists creating content, because if journalists cannot be paid for what they do, few will do it. The people who will win in that situation will be those who fear legitimate investigation and questioning.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b192.0/1">I compliment <a href="/mp/?p=24744" title="Our page on Damian Collins - 'the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins)'">Damian Collins</a> for securing the debate and on the way in which he introduced the subject. It is absolutely crucial and essential to all our lives that we think seriously about what press freedom actually means. In any free society, the right to know, the right to speak and the right to assemble are important and precious, and indeed are encapsulated in the 1948 universal declaration of human rights.</p> <p pid="b192.0/2">In considering press freedom, we should also look at media ownership and control, and the concentration of media ownership into a small number of global companies that impose news values on their outlets, which are not necessarily very open and which are often not interested in many of the poorest parts of the world but only in celebrity and the goings on in the wealthiest parts of the world. It is important that we recognise the importance of the right to know, and therefore the importance of diversity of ownership and diversity of access to the media.</p> <p pid="b192.0/3">As the hon. Gentleman quite correctly pointed out, many people now get most of their information from online sources, through social media and associated outlets. Many people simply do not buy newspapers and do not access newspaper websites or anything else. They rely completely on news that they believe they select themselves from various websites around the world, but they are often unaware of the complex, complicated and very efficient algorithms used to drive people in certain directions on certain stories and news issues.</p> <p pid="b192.0/4">We must look not only at the freedom of journalists and the importance of independent ownership of all media outlets, but at making social media accessible to everyone. Social media companies have shown themselves to be very happy to operate with authoritarian and oppressive regimes and close down access altogether to  certain individuals. For example, in the middle of their strike action in Delhi, Indian farmers suddenly found that they had no access whatsoever to social media, which was a crucial outlet for them. Social media is restricted in a number of countries, and Google and others are quite happy to do deals with national Governments in order to restrict access to information. These things have to be looked at seriously and carefully. We need international agreement on this, which I will come on to in a moment.</p> <p pid="b192.0/5">I have in front of me the &#8220;<a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> on Global Journalism&#8221;, produced by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_of_Journalists">International Federation of Journalists</a>, of which I am a member, in the sense that I am a member of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Union_of_Journalists">National Union of Journalists</a> in Britain. This report makes for chilling reading. Since 1990, as the hon. Gentleman has pointed out, 2,650 journalists have been killed around the world. Those are the ones we know of&#8212;there may well be more. A good friend of mine, Anabel Hern&#225;ndez, a Mexican journalist, launched a book called &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sorrows">The Sorrows</a> of Mexico&#8221; with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Cacho">Lydia Cacho</a> and others at the Edinburgh international book festival three years ago. I was there. She described what she had gone through in preparing the book and in writing about the power of drug cartels, corrupt police forces and the role of the military. She described the threats made to her:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b192.0/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Ever since, I have lived with 24 hour protection, if you can call that living.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b192.0/7">The threat never goes away. On <phrase class="date" code="2021-12-21">21 December</phrase> 2014, a dozen men, armed with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK47">AK47</a> rifles and handguns, closed off the street where Hern&#225;ndez lived, and started asking her neighbours in which house the journalist lived. They deactivated the security cameras in the immediate area, including those installed in her house. She was lucky that day, because she was not at home; she was away. That is the kind of life that she and other very brave journalists live in Mexico, in Colombia, in Egypt and in other countries where journalists are consistently under threat.</p> <p pid="b192.0/8">We mourn those who have been killed, but there are many others in jail and the threat of jailing journalists is a form of censorship. Many of the world&#8217;s Governments know that by consistently threatening journalists, they will either tone down their reporting or simply not report what is going on where corruption, drug cartels and so on are involved. There is a kind of league table of journalists who are in prison. Globally, there are 235 of them in prison&#8212;those are the ones we know of &#8212;including 67 in Turkey, 21 in Egypt and 20 in China. They are all people who have been imprisoned because they were trying to report the truth.</p> <p pid="b192.0/9">The hon. Gentleman quite rightly pointed out what happened to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Protasevich">Roman Protasevich</a>. Obviously, it is appalling that the plane was effectively hijacked and he was taken to Belarus because he had been writing stories that were critical of its regime. Obviously, action should be taken. I am a member of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=207" title="An international organisation of member states (45 at the time of writing)..." class="glossary">Council of Europe</a> and my fellow members and I will make our views very well known at subsequent meetings. Unfortunately, Belarus is not a member of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe">Council of Europe</a>; it is the only European country that is not a member.</p> <p pid="b192.0/10">Our complaints and objections about the way in which Roman Protasevich is being treated would be far more credible if the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a> was not at the same time hosting financial servicing arrangements and opportunities to raise cash for the Belarussian  Government. If we are serious about press freedom and freedoms in general, we must think very carefully about what financial institutions and others are doing.</p> <p pid="b192.0/11">The terrible events in Gaza and the west bank over the last few weeks and the loss of life of people both in Israel and in Palestine are obviously shocking and appalling. It is also very clear that the bombing was very effectively and efficiently targeted in Gaza. Two towers were taken out completely; they were demolished by targeted bombing. They included the offices of al-Jazeera and a number of other journalistic outlets in the region, so they could no longer effectively report what was happening in Gaza. Some brave journalists managed to use satellite phones and so on to keep in communication, but they were reporting while under fire from Israel that was quite clearly targeting those places where journalists were trying to report the reality of what is going on. And Yousef Abu Hussein, a young journalist, was killed during that whole process.</p> <p pid="b192.0/12">In this debate I hope that we can reflect on the bravery of journalists around the world&#8212;those who seek to speak truth to power and who try to tell us the truth about what is happening around the world. We all love newspapers; we all love news and information. However, we need to make sure that those who collect and gather that information&#8212;irritating as they often are to politicians; that is the world in which we live&#8212;are a crucial part of any democratic society.</p> <p pid="b192.0/13">The work done by the International Federation of Journalists and others in trying to get global agreement on the protection of journalists is very important. It is also important that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council">United Nations Human Rights Council</a> continues its work on protecting journalists, and that we have an effective protection mechanism for journalists all around the world. Too many have died, too many are in prison and too many are frightened to report the news they ought to be reporting, because they are scared of what will happen to them if they do so.</p> <p pid="b192.0/14">We should not be complacent about our own society, either, because often in Parliament we have this sense of complacency that bad things&#8212;</p>            </div>

In that time, I have had quite a few dodgy moments, but I have never been arrested, I have never been tortured and, patently, I have never been murdered.  I have published and reported on stories that politicians have not liked, but I can honestly say that I have not been subjected to political pressure and I certainly have not suffered from the online threats that, sadly, today&#8217;s journalists suffer from.</p> <p pid="b194.2/2">I recognise that around the world there are very brave people going where I, frankly, would have feared to go in the interests of publishing and truth. It is right that we say &#8220;Thank you&#8221; on occasions to some people in power. I recognise the initiatives taken by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> in pursuing this issue seriously through the global conference in London and as co-chair with Canada of the Media Freedom Coalition. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_December">Last December</a>, the world press freedom conference highlighted the cause again, and I hope that it will be raised at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a> in Cornwall, when we sit in the president&#8217;s chair.</p> <p pid="b194.2/3">We do not often say &#8220;Thank you&#8221; to civil servants, so perhaps it is right that we recognise the work of Kanbar Hossein Bor, Louise Savill, Michelle Webster and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Williams">Justin Williams</a>, who head up the media freedom teams at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign,_Commonwealth_and_Development_Office">Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office</a>. We also ought to thank <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Vincent">Rebecca Vincent</a> of Reporters Sans Fronti&#232;res, who I understand also provides the secretariat for the all-party parliamentary group on media freedom. They are doing valuable work, and we must be grateful to them.</p> <p pid="b194.2/4">During my time with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Assembly">Parliamentary Assembly</a> of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=207" title="An international organisation of member states (45 at the time of writing)..." class="glossary">Council of Europe</a>, we pursued this issue vigorously. My friend and colleague <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Foulkes">Lord Foulkes</a> was, and still is, stalwart in seeking to defend media freedom. The appalling case of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Protasevich">Roman Protasevich</a>, which was instigated by Lukashenko, the President of Belarus, and the equally vile murder of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Khashoggi">Jamal Khashoggi</a>, at the behest of the Saudi Arabian Government, are frightful. However, every day there is ongoing oppression of journalists in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Federation">Russian Federation</a>, in China, in Azerbaijan, in Ethiopia, in Myanmar and most certainly in Turkey. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_World_Service">BBC World Service</a> reporters are under desperate pressure in Hong Kong and in Persia, and sadly, because of some careless words uttered by a previous Foreign Secretary, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is languishing in an Iranian prison on a trumped-up charge of teaching journalism&#8212;as if that was something that should not be done.</p> <p pid="b194.2/5">I have four questions to put to my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, and I hope he will be able to answer. First, will the subject of media freedom be on the G7 agenda for Cornwall? Secondly, will the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom">Government of the United Kingdom</a> be prepared to use Magnitsky sanctions in cases of breach of media freedom? Can my right hon. Friend assure us that the BBC&#8217;s World Service funding, which at the moment is under an extension due to end in September, will be continued? That contribution to media freedom is vital. Finally, will the Government of the United Kingdom be prepared to back the call from Reporters San Fronti&#232;res for a UN special representative for the safety of journalists?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b195.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Ms Ghani. I pay tribute to <a href="/mp/?p=24744" title="Our page on Damian Collins - 'the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins)'">Damian Collins</a> for securing this debate. It is appropriate that we celebrate <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Press_Freedom_Day">World Press Freedom Day</a>, because  press freedom is fundamental to our democracy. It is a basic right. We all know that knowledge is power and that, equally, its absence endangers us. Press freedom allows us to expose totalitarianism, often in the face of danger, as other Members have said.</p> <p pid="b195.0/2">I was privileged to know <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Pringle">James Pringle</a>, who returned to my old <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> to vote in the Scottish referendum back in 2014. He regaled me with tales about, first, having served in the Dominican coup and then having been the first western journalist into <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia_under_Pol_Pot">Cambodia under Pol Pot</a>, after the atrocities of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a>. I pay tribute to his courage.</p> <p pid="b195.0/3">Press freedom is vital to democracy. I remember reading Professor Henry Milner&#8217;s book, &#8220;Civic Literacy&#8221;. It is a study of what motivates turnout in elections. A critical factor is not whether it is as easy to vote as to buy a tin of beans in a supermarket; what matters in particular is understanding, and a quality media is fundamental to that. If people do not understand the issues, they will not participate and vote. That factor is normally shown in this country in turnouts being higher in referendums, when there is a clear understanding of the issues, than in wider elections, where turnout can be significantly lower.</p> <p pid="b195.0/4">As other Members have said, there are obviously ongoing issues&#8212;in Saudi Arabia and Belarus, and indeed closer to home, with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange">Julian Assange</a>. I sympathise and agree with the points made by others across the political divide that these people require protection.</p> <p pid="b195.0/5">I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe, who was correct to point out the changes that have happened in the media. I have been writing for the Scottish media for several years now. The decline is significant. There are actions we have to take to address that and to protect the valuable newspapers that are undermined by other platforms. We should also remember that in many instances now, social media is just as important as the mainstream media.</p> <p pid="b195.0/6">We have looked in this country at what happened in the Arab spring. It was not the mainstream media that was the outlet letting people know, both within the countries that were part of the Arab spring, and in the wider world. It was not the papers, held by the regimes. It was social media bloggers and just people tweeting, or writing on their Facebook pages or whatever else. The hon. Gentleman was right to warn about dangerous disinformation and the challenges that we face as a society to protect our democracy. Equally, we also have to remember that it is important that we support that.</p> <p pid="b195.0/7">That brings me to my own situation within my own jurisdiction of Scotland. It is many years since I first studied law. I have had 20 years practising as a lawyer and seven and a half years as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Secretary">Justice Secretary</a>. I never thought I would face a situation where I was condemnatory of actions that have been happening against the press in my own country.</p> <p pid="b195.0/8">Since the days of learning about the Gordon Airs case, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Advocate">HM Advocate</a> v. Airs, I always assumed that those who were seeking to put forward information that was appropriate and fair would be protected. Yet in Scotland, in the fallout from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Salmond">Alex Salmond</a> affair, we have seen <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hirst">Mark Hirst</a>, a journalist, prosecuted. The case, in which he was supported by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUJ">NUJ</a>, was rightly rejected by the presiding sheriff in the borders. We have seen <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Murray">Craig Murray</a>, a blogger and former British senior civil  servant, now facing a prison sentence of eight months. That is not only shocking, but drives a coach and horses through a position brought in by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government">Scottish Government</a> that there be a presumption against a sentence of imprisonment for less than a year. Their absence of criticism and their failure to comment has been quite shocking.</p> <p pid="b195.0/9">It is not simply cases brought by the Crown. It is the cases that have been pursued by the police, where people so much as tweeting anything that might be seen as possibly identifying a witness have faced a knock on the door from the police. That is fundamentally damaging to Scottish democracy. It is not what I expect and it has not come about by happenchance. It has been deliberate. It has been targeted. It is being driven by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Office">Crown Office</a>. If we are to have a free press, there has to be free reporting. That has to apply to bloggers as much as it applies to the mainstream press.</p> <p pid="b195.0/10">That people have been charged in Scottish courts and have faced possible terms of imprisonment for simply doing exactly the same as the mainstream press has done but not faced prosecution is simply unacceptable. There is also a reason that I am required to raise it here: it is that the position of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Advocate_of_Scotland">Lord Advocate of Scotland</a> is no longer tenable. There has to be a separation of powers of having one individual who is both a legal adviser to the Scottish Government and also the head of the prosecution service in Scotland. That is no longer appropriate and I am disappointed that the First <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> did not seek to make it faster. It is something that has to come back to this Chamber because as a result of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_Act_1998">Scotland Act 1998</a>, the Lord Advocate is enshrined in statute by this Parliament. Action must be taken here as well as in Holyrood.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b197.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Ms Ghani. I welcome this debate called by the hon. Member on world press freedom. We should be proud to live in a democracy where the press exercises a high level of freedom to highlight the truth and hold the Government to account. That does not mean we do not still face challenges in relation to the press in the UK and their reporting, in particular towards Muslims and minority communities.</p> <p pid="b197.1/2">Thankfully, we do not live in a nation where the regime in Government blows to smithereens the towers housing internationally renowned journalists such as in the AP building. Yes, I am speaking about the callous and totalitarian attack by the Israeli military a week or so ago in the tower housing both AP and al-Jazeera journalists. Much will be said in this debate about world press freedom relating to China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, North Korea or Iran, for instance, all of which our nation and I too share concerns about in regards to press freedom. However, just over a week ago, we watched the Israeli military blow up a mainstream media outlet, which the US <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> Antony Blinken said he had he seen no evidence for. Despite such a devastating attack on press freedom, given the scale of the attack, the response by the so-called defenders of free speech was deafening in its silence, and the outright condemnation by our Government seemed to be written in invisible ink.</p> <p pid="b197.1/3">The latest siege on Gaza and targeted Israeli air force attacks have destroyed the premises of 23 Palestinian and international media outlets, according to some reports, in a single week. A statement by the nine experts to the United Nations Human Rights office stated:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b197.1/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;The indiscriminate or deliberate bombardment of civilians and towers housing civilians in Gaza and Israel, as well as media organizations and refugee camps in Gaza, are war crimes that are, prima facie, not justified by the requirements of proportionality and necessity under international law. All parties who engage in such attacks must bear individual and State responsibility as appropriate.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b197.1/5">Let me state just one example. At approximately 4.30 am on Wednesday <phrase class="date" code="2021-05-19">19 May</phrase>, Israeli war planes targeted with three successive rockets, without prior warning, the fourth and fifth floors of the home of Muhammed Abdul Qadr Muhammed Abu Hussein, 63, consisting of five floors over an area of 120 square metres and located on Al-Gala Street near <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Radwan">Sheikh Radwan</a> junction north of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City">Gaza City</a>. Yousef Muhammed Abdul Qadr Abu Hussein, 32, a journalist who worked as a broadcaster for the local Voice of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa">Al-Aqsa</a> radio station, a husband and a father of three, was killed in that attack.</p> <p pid="b197.1/6">All that I have stated is a reality of Israeli regime in only the last few weeks. Even after the ceasefire, AP reported that 17 journalists in Gaza had confirmed their <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp">WhatsApp</a> accounts had been blocked. When 23 media houses are obliterated, journalists killed and social media networks blocked, where is press freedom? The question is whether the Government will still support the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court">International Criminal Court</a> investigation into the situation in Palestine, given Israel&#8217;s repeated attacks on media outlets and journalists. I also remind the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of a statement from his colleague <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Ahmad">Lord Ahmad</a> on the matter of press freedom. He said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b197.1/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Ultimately, we need every country to recognise that attacks on media freedom are beyond the pale. And just like any assault on human rights, and I speak as the UK Human Rights Minister, we must hold abusers accountable, both legally and financially.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b197.1/8">I agree that we need every country to recognise that attacks on media freedom will not be tolerated and legal and financial accountability will be the consequences. I say to the Minister that the mounting evidence of the Israel&#8217;s alleged crimes is before him. If the Government truly want to support press freedom worldwide, they should support the investigation by the International Criminal Court into Israel&#8217;s actions.

Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins)'">Damian Collins</a> on securing this important debate to mark <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Press_Freedom_Day">World Press Freedom Day</a> 2021. It could not be more pertinent at a time when attacks on press freedom across the world and in parts of Europe are intensifying. Authoritarian Governments across the world have yet again demonstrated that, before all other things, they fear the power of the written word.</p> <p pid="b198.0/2">I start by paying my respects to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Protasevich">Roman Protasevich</a>, a Belarusian blogger and journalist who was captured by the Lukashenko regime in an aeroplane hijack last Sunday. Roman faces charges of terrorism in his native country for the pivotal role that his Nexta blog played  in instigating and co-ordinating the peaceful pro-democracy protests of last year. Belarus is the only country in Europe that retains the death penalty, which is a very real threat that Roman may now be facing. I believe all Members present share my deepest concern for Roman&#8217;s wellbeing, and I insist in the strongest possible terms that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> do everything in their power to help secure his immediate release.</p> <p pid="b198.0/3">Thirty-four journalists are now in prison in Belarus, and dozens of independent media outlets are being prevented from operating freely. This week, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko">Alexander Lukashenko</a> signed a decree that erects even more explicit legal barriers to the freedom of the press, including a prohibition on news outlets making live reports on unauthorised mass gatherings, new powers for the information ministry to order the closure of media outlets, and a ban on the publication of opinion polls that are unauthorised by the Government. The Belarusian police recently raided and shut down <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUT">TUT</a>.<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BY">BY</a>, the largest independent Belarusian media outlet, as a follow-up to revoking its media credentials last year.</p> <p pid="b198.0/4">There have also been reports of personal blackmail and the intimidation of journalists, such as the journalist Arina Malinovskaya, who works with the Belarusian independent <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV">TV</a> channel Belsat. Arina, who is currently abroad, is reported by the Polish newspaper <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazeta_Wyborcza">Gazeta Wyborcza</a> to have received threats from the Belarusian police that unless she returns to Belarus and presents herself at a police station, her sister and grandparents will suffer the consequences. Such tactics are designed to silence and intimidate even Belarusians in exile, and to prevent them from reporting systemic human rights violations in their home country. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_August">In August</a> last year, the Government in Belarus removed the accreditation of two BBC journalists, meaning they are no longer able to work for the BBC legally. They are both Belarusian nationals who have worked for the BBC for a number of years. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BBC">The BBC</a> has called on the Belarusian authorities to revoke the decision and to allow the two journalists to continue to do their jobs.</p> <p pid="b198.0/5">Another part of the world where press freedom is undergoing a catastrophic deterioration is Hong Kong. Since the introduction of the national security law, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China">Government of China</a> have been accelerating a full-scale crackdown on <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> political activity and press. Last month, journalist Choy Yuk-ling was found guilty of making false statements and obtaining public information as part of an investigation into the perpetrators of a violent attack on protestors in a subway station in 2019. Choy was collecting the data as part of a documentary for the public broadcaster <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTHK">RTHK</a> that also explored the conduct of Hong Kong police during last year&#8217;s protests. Chris Yeung, the chairman of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Journalists_Association">Hong Kong Journalists Association</a>, expressed himself plainly when he said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b198.0/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;The government sent a reporter to the dock, she was found guilty and the fourth power is under threat. Press freedom in Hong Kong is dying.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b198.0/7">As citizens of a liberal, democratic state, we are privileged in many ways to have access to an independent press and extensive civil liberties, and to have the freedom to use our voice to speak up for those whose voice has been denied. I hope that we are able to reflect, as parliamentarians today, on how we can assist the many thousands in Hong Kong, Belarus and across the world whose voices are being silenced.</p>            </div>

I congratulate <a href="/mp/?p=24744" title="Our page on Damian Collins - 'the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins)'">Damian Collins</a> on securing this important debate.</p> <p pid="b200.0/2">Press Freedom Day comes at an important time: not only have we just witnessed the bombing of the building of two major outlets&#8212;al Jazeera and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press">Associated Press</a>&#8212; we have also just witnessed the latest example of wide- spread misreporting on the crisis between <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_Palestine">Israel and Palestine</a>. The systemic violence against Palestinians and the continued illegal Israeli occupation is an international atrocity. Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestine territories have been identified by the United Nations as being in breach of international law, but across the British and western media landscapes the crisis is too often reported as a conflict, yet it is not a conflict between equals. It is about the occupier and the occupied. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gaza">The Gaza</a> strip is effectively an open-air prison, with 97% of the population having no access to clean water, and each bombing campaign further eroding living standards. It is a colonial war. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_British">The British</a> empire was instrumental in the displacement and subjugation of the Palestinian people.</p> <p pid="b200.0/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> and western press either fail to report on atrocities against the Palestinian people, or label the abuses as clashes and consistently misreport the systemic aggression, dispossession and violence directed at Palestinians. Such framing serves only to legitimise and obscure the scale of oppression in occupied Palestine. It is encapsulated by the case of US journalist <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Wilder">Emily Wilder</a>, who was sacked by Associated Press after it was unearthed that she had previously supported Palestinian rights. I urge the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Press_Standards_Organisation">Independent Press Standards Organisation</a> to do much more to ensure the accurate, contextualised and fair reporting of the crisis. A strong, diverse and independent media is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy and society.</p> <p pid="b200.0/4">I am also concerned by the continued imprisonment and attempted extradition of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange">Julian Assange</a>. That case presents a real danger to the freedom of the press. It extends the judicial reach of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Government">US Government</a>, and it deploys the US Espionage Act against a journalist for the very first time. We must oppose this attempt to criminalise journalism that involves reporting on classified information. If not, it could set a chilling precedent with grave implications for the functioning of our democracy. I believe that the US Government must drop the attempted prosecution, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a> must do all they can to halt a process from which there can be no satisfactory outcome for the freedom of the press.</p> <p pid="b200.0/5">A free press is essential for our public life, but sadly much of our press is really not free at all. A 2019 study by the Media Reform Coalition found that just three companies&#8212;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_UK">News UK</a>, the Daily Mail group, and Reach&#8212;dominate 83% of the national newspaper market, and that has actually increased by 11% in just four years. Looking at who owns those outlets, the right-wing bias in our media ecosystem becomes clear: five billionaires own around 80% of all UK media, and two billionaire press barons own half of the UK&#8217;s top ten daily newspapers. The fact is that since 1979&#8212;a period spanning 11 general elections&#8212;no party has been able to reside in Government without the explicit backing of a newspaper owned by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a>.</p> <p pid="b200.0/6">Polling shows that the British press is the least trusted press in Europe. That is corrosive for our democracy. It is crucial that we support public interest journalism, including through charitable status for some local, investigative and independent media outlets. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BBC">The BBC</a> is of course an important institution, which we must defend from privatisation, but as recent weeks have shown, the BBC is far from perfect and much must be done to make it more democratic, representative and independent. The BBC must also be wary of amplifying the world view that is shared among the right-wing press. In the light of funding cuts and the loss of investigative reporters, too often it is billionaire-owned media outlets that set the agenda for our public service broadcaster.</p> <p pid="b200.0/7">I fully support the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Union_of_Journalists">National Union of Journalists</a> and the rights and conditions of workers in our media. Empowering journalists, such as by enabling them to elect editors and have seats on boards, is beneficial for our entire public discourse. To see a world defined by  the imbalance of wealth and influence propped up and obfuscated by a compliant media system is intensely disempowering. Let us take as an example yesterday&#8217;s explosive testimony from the former chief adviser to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>. It should not have taken a disgruntled Government employee to expose this Government&#8217;s deadly handling of the coronavirus. That was a damning indictment of our media ecosystem and revealed the cosy relationship between Government and client journalists. I believe that must end. Following this year&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Press_Freedom_Day">World Press Freedom Day</a>, let us strive to build a vibrant media that is democratic, representative and truly independent.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b201.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairship, Ms Ghani. I am grateful to <a href="/mp/?p=24744" title="Our page on Damian Collins - 'the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins)'">Damian Collins</a> for securing this debate to celebrate <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Press_Freedom_Day">World Press Freedom Day</a>.</p> <p pid="b201.0/2">The debate comes at an important time. Mere weeks ago, the world watched in horror as the Gazan offices of al-Jazeera and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press">Associated Press</a> were razed to the ground by Israeli bombs in a brazen attack on the media. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_of_Journalists">International Federation of Journalists</a> reported that, at the same time in Jerusalem, Israeli police were deliberately and systematically assaulting, beating and firing stun grenades at Palestinian media workers. Today, I add my voice to the calls, including by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFJ">IFJ</a>, for an end to impunity for these war crimes and for the shameful attempt to silence the media and reporting on the ground. These events followed two complaints submitted by the IFJ to the UN special rapporteurs in December 2020 about Israel&#8217;s systematic targeting of journalists working in Palestine and its failure properly to investigate killings of media workers&#8212;reminding us that the threats to journalists working in Palestine are consistent and stretch beyond the bombing campaigns.</p> <p pid="b201.0/3">The diversion of a flight and the arrest of journalist <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Protasevich">Roman Protasevich</a> just days ago in Belarus, bringing the country&#8217;s number of detained journalists to 24, further increases the urgency of this debate. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Lukashenko">President Lukashenko</a> has also taken action to harass and block the country&#8217;s most popular news website and has passed authoritarian measures relating to the media law.</p> <p pid="b201.0/4">Will the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> call on the Government of whom he is a member to use every means at their disposal to compel the Israeli and Belarusian authorities to bring  an end to the attacks on journalists? It is the case that 2,658 media workers have been killed globally in the last 30 years; that is about two every single week. And 84% of journalists who were killed in 2020 were knowingly targeted and deliberately murdered; that was a significant increase from 63% in 2019. In nine out of 10 cases, the killings remain unpunished.</p> <p pid="b201.0/5">Press freedom in conflict zones is an absolute necessity, but concerningly there is an increasing trend of journalists being killed in countries considered to be at peace; it accounts for 68% of all those killed. We can say in no uncertain terms that this is a crisis of impunity. In the last year, Turkey, Belarus, India, Myanmar and China implemented brutal crackdowns on their media. Nearly 400 journalists and media workers were being held in detention at the end of 2020. That is a historically high level. The number of women journalists imprisoned in 2020 increased by one third.</p> <p pid="b201.0/6">At home, the UK is ranked 33rd out of 180 countries in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Press_Freedom_Index">World Press Freedom Index</a>, with our own record marred by restrictions on freedom of information, the detention of Wikileaks publisher <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange">Julian Assange</a>, and active threats to the safety of journalists in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. These figures are shocking, and a concrete solution is desperately needed to reverse this dangerous trend. Will the Minister take up calls from the IFJ  and media representatives on every continent for the establishment of a UN convention on the safety and protection of journalists, to ensure implementation of existing UN mechanisms, hold states accountable for their obligations, and end the impunity with which attacks on the press are currently conducted?</p> <p pid="b201.0/7">I will conclude by paying tribute to the bravery of journalists across the globe who work in dangerous circumstances to keep power in check. We must not mark World Press Freedom Day merely with words, but renew our efforts to ensure that threats to press freedoms everywhere are combated with decisive action, because press freedom protects us, and we must strive every day to protect press freedom.</p>            </div>

Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins)'">Damian Collins</a> on having secured today&#8217;s debate. In the heart of Europe today, a brave young man named <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Protasevich">Roman Protasevich</a> languishes in jail. His face is now familiar to all of us from a video he was forced to make by his thuggish captors: puffed and swollen from beatings and looking scared, he told us that he was being treated well. Journalism at its finest speaks truth to power; that is why tyrants the world over hate journalists. Lukashenko, the Belarusian dictator, was so desperate to silence Roman Protasevich that he was prepared to hijack a plane and force it to land in Minsk, the capital of his dark regime.</p> <p pid="b202.0/2">I am proud to be a journalist. It is all I ever wanted to be, so sometimes I am a little bit surprised to find myself here, offering opinions and certainties rather than asking questions. My dad remembers that as a kid, I used to lie on our tenement hall floor and read the broadsheets. Too wee to hold them, I would lay them flat and read them column by column, poring over reports from far-away, impossibly exotic places. I remember reading the fearless reporting from Vietnam, and also fearless  journalism of a different type from Watergate. I loved the writing of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Ascherson">Neal Ascherson</a>, the taut forensic skill of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Walden">Brian Walden</a>, and the flamboyant showmanship of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Day">Robin Day</a>. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wheeler">Charles Wheeler</a>&#8217;s lugubrious delivery heightened the brave passion of the civil rights movement. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Morris">James Morris</a> wrote about war as a man and then, as Jan, inspired as a woman, writing with grace about her transition.</p> <p pid="b202.0/3">I have done a bit of foreign affairs correspondence, and I have anchored some dramatic moments, none more memorable than the horrors of <phrase class="date" code="2021-09-11">11 September</phrase>. I was on air when the twin towers were attacked, and had to find the words to describe the unspeakable brutality and cruelty of the unfolding events. I kept my cool, I think, during the hours of live broadcast, but I wept when I got home. Some of the images that we could not show that day, such as the people jumping from the towers, will be forever seared into my mind. However, my work has mostly been confined to political correspondence&#8212;a safe place for journalists, even at Westminster.</p> <p pid="b202.0/4">Journalists working elsewhere in the world have very different experiences. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporters_Without_Borders">Reporters Without Borders</a> reports that only 12 countries worldwide are rated &#8220;good&#8221; for press freedom. Almost three quarters of countries have constrained press freedom. Fifty journalists were killed last year, and 387 were held in detention, which is a historic high. Unsurprisingly, the worst offenders are the most brutal, despotic regimes, with Saudi Arabia and China leading the rogues&#8217; gallery. Fourteen journalists are currently detained for telling the truth about covid, and more than 1,000 have died of it.</p> <p pid="b202.0/5">Not only did the recent onslaught by Israel against the Palestinians trapped in the Gaza strip see the slaughter of 67 innocent children, who were killed outright or buried alive by bombs fired by a military superpower that claims that it uses precision bombing, but that same Israeli bombing campaign targeted journalistic outlets that were determined to report on the carnage. Israel&#8212;a country that describes itself as a western democracy&#8212;used fighter jets to bomb the building housing <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press">Associated Press</a> and al-Jazeera in Gaza. No journalists in the building were killed, but we remember that in a previous Israeli onslaught in 2003, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Miller">James Miller</a>, a freelance Welsh cameraman, was killed by Israeli troops who continued to fire on him even after the reporter he was with shouted, &#8220;We are British journalists.&#8221; An inquest concluded that he had been murdered, but no Israeli soldiers were prosecuted.</p> <p pid="b202.0/6">There have been so many killings of journalists that it seems almost invidious to single out individuals, but we all remember <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Colvin">Marie Colvin</a>, the celebrated <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Times">Sunday Times</a> correspondent who was killed when Assad troops, who were almost certainly targeting her, shelled the building in Homs where she was sheltering as she covered the Syrian regime atrocities. Closer to home, it took the shooting of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyra_McKee">Lyra McKee</a> by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRA">IRA</a> thugs in Derry to get <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>&#8217;s recalcitrant political leaders to issue a joint statement condemning her murder as an attack on the political process and democracy. Although Frank Gardner, the BBC security correspondent, survived an al-Qaeda attack, we are forever reminded of the price he paid when we see him on our screens, reporting uncomplainingly and with grace from a wheelchair. They are brave and fearless, every one of them. Armed only with a pen, microphone or camera, they were killed by cowards bombing and shooting from afar.</p> <p pid="b202.0/7">Of course, as we have heard, the threat to journalists takes many forms. The spread of disinformation through social media, and attacks on professional journalism, are perhaps the most insidious new ones. The lies disseminated by Putin and Assad, to spread disinformation about the murder of journalists and political opponents, to disguise their responsibility for gas attacks and to blacken the name of, among others, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Helmets">White Helmets</a>, are amplified online by the malevolent and the naive.</p> <p pid="b202.0/8">Here today, we honour a fine craft. I hope that, whatever our politics, we as parliamentarians resolve to affirm the right of journalists, whether at home or abroad, to scrutinise and examine, and to probe and uncover, without fear or favour.</p>            </div>

In an unusual opening gambit for a <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, may I first pay tribute to the Minister who, in <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> as well as in Government, has made this issue a priority? I know it is something that he really believes in.</p> <p pid="b204.0/2">I also pay tribute to my good friend, <a href="/mp/?p=24744" title="Our page on Damian Collins - 'the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins)'">Damian Collins</a>, who gave a fantastic opening exposition. He spoke about news deserts, and other hon. Members also spoke about the problems of local news and media. He also mentioned the importance of not forgetting online news and disinformation, on which I know he has done so much work in the past. It was a fantastic introduction.</p> <p pid="b204.0/3">Let me say first of all that we have to get our own house in order, starting here in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>, in Westminster. Too often, there is a tendency to attack journalism. It is still a matter of shame for me that four or five years ago, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Kuenssberg">Laura Kuenssberg</a> felt that she had to have a bodyguard to attend the Labour party conference. Once again, I send my apologies to her for that. More recently, a Conservative Minister caused the Twitter pile-on of a journalist who was asking perfectly innocent questions, and we have heard some unhelpful comments from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> attacking all journalists. We have got <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNP">SNP</a> Members who attack the BBC because they do not like the way it covered the independence referendum. Plenty of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_MPs">Conservative MPs</a> are always undermining the BBC and calling it for it to be defunded. We have <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Unionist">Democratic Unionist</a> party MPs who have a beef with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nolan">Stephen Nolan</a> and attack the BBC and its integrity. Those attacks need to stop. By all means complain about individual broadcasts, but stop undermining independent journalism.</p> <p pid="b204.0/4">As my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25803" title="Our page on Kim Johnson - 'the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Kim Johnson)'">Kim Johnson</a> mentioned, the UK is ranked 33rd out of 180 countries in the 2021 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Press_Freedom_Index">World Press Freedom Index</a>. Restrictions on freedom of information and active threats to the safety of journalists in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> continue to mar the UK&#8217;s press freedom record. We heard about the murder of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyra_McKee">Lyra McKee</a> and her search for the truth. She was shot in 2019 during the riots that took place in Derry. It is truly shocking that on our shores journalists still face such a hostile environment.</p> <p pid="b204.0/5">The situation in Northern Ireland, incidentally, is becoming increasingly hostile. I heard recently the horrific story of Patricia Devlin, who has been subject to continuous and serious threats and abuse in recent years. In 2019, she reported receiving a Facebook message&#8212;I hesitate  to say this, but I will&#8212;that suggested threats of rape against her baby. That is to a journalist in the UK. In a case in Barrow-in-Furness, Amy Fenton was run out of town by far-right gangs. We still have something to do in the UK. We need to make that a priority.</p> <p pid="b204.0/6">The focus of the debate is international. Numerous hon. Members referred to the disgraceful case of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Protasevich">Roman Protasevich</a>, which, frankly, was an act of piracy by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarusian_Government">Belarusian Government</a>. To those who would suggest that Mr Protasevich is not a journalist but merely a citizen blogger, when all the press in Belarus is so tightly controlled and not independent, citizen bloggers become the only source of independent information and, as has been mentioned, an essential independent voice.</p> <p pid="b204.0/7">In the debate, we heard that the number of journalists being killed is at an all-time high, with 387 being detained and 50 journalists killed around the world in 2020. The hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe mentioned the gunning down of the three female media workers in Afghanistan. In fact, the past decade has been the deadliest one for the profession, with a total of 1,059 journalists killed in the past 10 years simply for doing their job. That has to stop. Every year, every statistic, has a human side&#8212;the death of a mother or father, a brother or sister, a community left without information, denied that human right to be properly informed.</p> <p pid="b204.0/8">Let us not forget that the threat does not come only from authoritarian Governments. My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10133" title="Our page on Jeremy Corbyn - 'the Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)'">Jeremy Corbyn</a> talked about Mexico, a country that he knows well. Journalists have been murdered for investigating powerful organised crime groups and drug cartels. Reference was made to the murder of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphne_Caruana_Galizia">Daphne Caruana Galizia</a> in Malta, with suggestions that elements of organised crime were working in concert with Governments. I ask the Minister for us to do more than simply condemn the detention and killing of journalists all around the world. More must be done to support those who are being silenced.</p> <p pid="b204.0/9">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_World_Service">BBC World Service</a> does a fantastic job of projecting and promoting not just British values, but truthful and honest journalism. That is known throughout the world. Given those who say that we need to cut the BBC licence fee, I remind hon. Members in the Chamber and elsewhere that 70% of World Service funding comes from the licence fee&#8212;be careful what you wish for.</p> <p pid="b204.0/10"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BBC">The BBC</a> World Service is under threat. In China, the BBC <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_News">World News</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV">TV</a> channel has been banned by the Chinese authorities. In Hong Kong, the BBC World Service has been removed from the airwaves, after criticism of the BBC for its reporting on coronavirus and the persecution of the Uyghurs. World News distribution in mainland China was limited to international hotels; nevertheless, its loss is symbolically significant. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sudworth">John Sudworth</a>, the BBC&#8217;s China correspondent whose reporting exposed truths about the Xinjiang detention camps, including sexual violence against Uyghur women, has now had to move to Taiwan, following pressure and threats from the Chinese authorities.</p> <p pid="b204.0/11">In Myanmar, BBC Burmese correspondent Aung Thura was taken away and detained along with a colleague towards the end of March, while reporting outside the court in the capital. The licences of media companies have been revoked and nightly internet shutdowns  have been used to restrict news coverage and access  to information.</p> <p pid="b204.0/12">Russia is also becoming an increasingly hostile environment for journalists. In recent years, many independent news organisations have closed down or curtailed their operations. Legislation governing the media is extensive and strict. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Russian">The Russian</a> authorities have made it clear that any action taken against the Russian state-backed TV channel RT in the UK will result in similar measures being taken against the BBC in Russia. Of course, there is the problem of the continuing harassment of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Persian">BBC Persian</a> staff, and their families, by Iran. It is deeply troubling and continues to escalate. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Iranian">The Iranian</a> authorities have targeted Persian journalists, the BBC and their families since the service launched satellite television in 2009. Intimidation of the family members of BBC Persian staff in Iran is a regular occurrence. This takes various forms, including arrests, detention, questioning, threats that jobs or pensions will be lost, confiscation of passports and asset freezes. I ask the Minister to reflect on the situation of BBC Persian journalists, and ensure that they and their families in this country and abroad are safe.</p> <p pid="b204.0/13">I refer briefly to the question on the bombing of the news premises in Gaza, mentioned by my hon. Friends the Members for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_East">Leicester East</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Webbe">Claudia Webbe</a>) and for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool,_Riverside">Liverpool, Riverside</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Johnson">Kim Johnson</a>), my right hon. Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islington_North">Islington North</a> and many others. What happened is an absolute outrage. The building was deliberately targeted and that cannot be allowed without massive criticism of the Israeli air force.</p> <p pid="b204.0/14">Finally, I reflect on an increasingly problematic matter, mentioned by <a href="/mp/?p=24744" title="Our page on Damian Collins - 'the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins)'">Damian Collins</a>, the question of SLAPPs&#8212;an acronym that I think came first and the words to fill it after&#8212;strategic lawsuits against public participation. It is a real problem. Legal threats against journalists are far from a new phenomenon. Yet increasingly, media outlets and freelance journalists&#8212;even those with no links to the UK&#8212;report receiving letters from London law firms acting on behalf of the people they are investigating. The high costs and long time periods involved in fighting legal threats in the UK pile significant pressure on individual journalists or media outlets to withdraw or refrain from publishing their investigations, even if they believe them to be accurate and in the public interest. Taken usually by powerful or wealthy individuals and entities, the intention is not to address a genuine grievance, but to stifle investigations into matters of public interest through intimidation, and by consuming the target&#8217;s financial and psychological resources.</p> <p pid="b204.0/15">These types of vexatious legal threats can also come hand in hand with orchestrated smear campaigns, offline surveillance and other forms of harassment against journalists. Some of the recent examples include lawsuits filed by Russian billionaires against <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Belton">Catherine Belton</a>; by the allies of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_Prime_Minister">Malaysian Prime Minister</a> against <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Rewcastle_Brown">Clare Rewcastle Brown</a>; and a lawsuit filed against <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCCRP">OCCRP</a> and its co-founder <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Radu">Paul Radu</a>, by an Azerbaijani politician. Perhaps even more shocking is the involvement of UK legal companies who actively advertise such services to their clients. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> is the leading international source of these threats, almost equivalent to those stemming from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU">EU</a> countries and the US combined.</p> <p pid="b204.0/16">To protect media freedom at home and abroad, the UK must take action to address two interlinked trends&#8212;first, the role that London continues to hold as an international libel capital, despite reforms to English  and Welsh law in 2013, and the impact of such legal action, or even the threat of it, in the UK on journalists around the world; and secondly, the impact that the UK&#8217;s facilitation through its financial and legal systems of illicit finance links to political elites in countries with poor democratic records has on media freedom there. It is not surprising that countries with higher rates of corruption tend to have the fewest protections for journalists and the media. The so-called SLAPPs damage the UK&#8217;s reputation as a haven for free speech, and I urge the Minister to look into that issue.</p> <p pid="b204.0/17">It is clear that press and media freedoms are under threat around the world. For a country that is part of the global Media Freedom Coalition, there is a long way to go to promote and protect press freedom. I know that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Union_of_Journalists">National Union of Journalists</a> advises that there should be a new convention, which is stronger than the demand solely for a special representative. A new convention would systemise and detail existing obligations, enhance the visibility of the journalists and the protection required for journalism, and codify multiple texts into one comprehensive document. We need to value journalists and their contribution, protect their livelihoods and stand up for universal rights and freedoms, democracy and the rule of law everywhere, and against violations wherever they take place. That must support freedom of expression, and specifically media freedoms.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b207.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Ms Ghani. I congratulate my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24744" title="Our page on Damian Collins - 'the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins)'">Damian Collins</a> on securing the debate and on his work to promote media freedom. I am particularly grateful to him for taking over as chair of the all-party parliamentary group on media freedom, which I chaired until February 2020.</p> <p pid="b207.0/2">A lot of Members have focused on dreadful abuses of media freedom in different countries around the world, and so to some extent Members might have expected a response from a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> who has specific responsibility for the subject is my noble Friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Ahmad">Lord Ahmad</a>, the Minister for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia">South Asia</a> and the Commonwealth, who is doing a great job championing media freedom internationally. He is obviously prevented from taking part in this debate in our House, but I work with him closely.</p> <p pid="b207.0/3">It is encouraging that there has been widespread recognition across this Chamber that media freedom is a crucial component of an open, democratic society. We may not always like or agree with what is written about us in the press, but the role of a free media in holding Government to account, in exposing corruption or malpractice and in providing trusted, reliable information and reporting has never been more important. However, media freedom is under increasing threat across the world. A number of Members pointed out that 50 journalists were killed last year while doing their job. According to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporters_Without_Borders">Reporters Without Borders</a>, which does a terrific job of monitoring that and campaigning, already this year 13 more journalists or media assistants have been killed, and there are currently 439 in prison. The summary analysis of its <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Press_Freedom_Index">World Press Freedom Index</a> 2021, published in April, said that journalism is completely or partly  blocked in 73% of the 180 countries ranked in the index; that the coronavirus pandemic has been used by Governments as cover for blocking journalists&#8217; access to information; and that journalists find it increasingly hard to investigate and report sensitive stories, especially in Asia, the middle east and Europe.</p> <p pid="b207.0/4">I join a number of those who have contributed in paying tribute to the courage of journalists working in some of the most difficult, dangerous and challenging parts of the world. <a href="/mp/?p=25281" title="Our page on John Nicolson - 'The hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire (John Nicolson)'">John Nicolson</a> reminded us of our own <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Colvin">Marie Colvin</a>, who was killed in Syria along with her photographer, French journalist R&#233;mi Ochlik, in 2012. I am sure he heard, as I have, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Conroy">Paul Conroy</a>, who was also badly injured at that time, talk about how the shelling that killed Marie Colvin and her colleague was deliberately aimed at them because they were journalists.</p> <p pid="b207.0/5">It is because media freedom is so important that the Government have championed the cause of media freedom around the world. As has been mentioned, in July 2019 the UK hosted the Global Conference for Media Freedom, which led to the establishment of the Media Freedom Coalition of like-minded countries that pledged to collaborate to improve the media freedom environment across the world. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> continues to co-chair the coalition. It is still a relatively young body, but it is growing and currently has 47 members. This year the coalition has already issued statements about China, Belarus and Myanmar, as well as a statement marking <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Press_Freedom_Day">World Press Freedom Day</a>. We are working on giving the coalition more impact on the ground by encouraging local collaboration in countries with those who are better able to engage with Governments and lobby them directly.</p> <p pid="b207.0/6">A number of countries have been mentioned, but I think it is important to speak about the most recent appalling example of the danger faced by journalists, which is of course the hijacking of an aeroplane and then the detention of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Protasevich">Roman Protasevich</a> in Belarus. In 2018, I led an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Parliamentary_Union">Inter-Parliamentary Union</a> delegation to Belarus. There was no question: the country was not democratic or free, and journalism was under terrific pressure. We met independent journalists operating there. Reporters Without Borders has assessed Belarus as the most dangerous country in Europe for media actors. I am pleased that the Government are supporting independent media organisations in that country, and we have already committed &#163;2.7 million of support for independent media in Belarus. Alongside the Government, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPU">IPU</a> has been very active in championing media freedom and organising conferences, and I can remember listening to the relatives of journalists operating for the BBC&#8217;s Persian Service. The Persian Service is not able to operate in Iran. Its journalists broadcast from London on the BBC, but their relatives in Iran are being subjected to harassment and intimidation. We will continue to high- light that and to put pressure on the Iranian Government to respect their freedom.</p> <p pid="b207.0/7">As I said, the World Press Freedom Index, which several Members have referred to and which was published in April, showed that the UK had risen by two places, to No. 33. It is obviously good news that we have gone up in the rankings, but to some extent that is because other countries have gone down. It demonstrates that we undoubtedly still have a lot of work to do. The death of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyra_McKee">Lyra McKee</a>, a journalist in Belfast, is happily a very  rare example of where a journalist in this country has lost their life in the course of their work, but there is no question that journalists in the UK still suffer dreadful harassment and abuse.</p> <p pid="b207.0/8"><a href="/mp/?p=25411" title="Our page on Chris Matheson - 'The hon. Member for City of Chester (Christian Matheson)'">Christian Matheson</a> mentioned Amy Fenton. I have met and talked to her about the abuse that occurred, which led her to have to seek police protection. It was for that reason that we established the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Committee">National Committee</a> for the Safety of Journalists, which brings together senior figures from law enforcement, the police, the prosecuting authorities, the campaigning organisations, the Government, and both the Society of Editors and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Union_of_Journalists">National Union of Journalists</a>. The aim was to demonstrate a shared commitment to ensure that journalists are free to carry out their vital role without threats of violence.</p> <p pid="b207.0/9">We have now published the first ever national action plan for the safety of journalists, which sets out the actions that all the partners will take to protect journalists. Every police force will have a dedicated officer to whom journalists can make a complaint, or whom they can contact in the event of abuse against them. The police will be trained, particularly about the importance of safeguarding journalists. Employers will provide extra training, and the platforms where a lot of the abuse occurs have said that they will establish designated journalism safety officers.</p> <p pid="b207.0/10">There is still more to be done, and one of the first things that we want to do is to get more evidence about the scale of the problem. We will shortly be publishing the call for evidence, and I hope that any journalist operating in the UK who has suffered in such a way will respond to it. I am delighted that our work on that has already been praised at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_Conference">Stockholm Conference</a> on Media Freedom in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSCE">OSCE</a> region, and has perhaps contributed to the promotion in the ranking of the UK on the World Press Freedom Index.</p> <p pid="b207.0/11">In response to my right hon. Friend the Member  for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Thanet">North Thanet</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Roger_Gale">Sir Roger Gale</a>), I can confirm  that the UK is using our presidency of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a> to highlight the importance of media freedom. We will be asking G7 members to reconfirm their commitment to defend media freedom and to provide practical, technical and programmatic support to journalists and media, including through the global media defence fund. The fund was set up with the help of the UK and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO">UNESCO</a>, which currently manages it, and we continue to support it. In 2019, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> pledged &#163;3 million to the fund over the next five years, and we are delivering on that commitment. To date, the fund has supported a variety of activities, such as pursuing strategic litigation with the goal of challenging <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> and regulations that infringe on media freedom in Zanzibar, and investigative journalism that is focused on cases of threatened, prosecuted, imprisoned, attacked or assassinated journalists in the Philippines.</p> <p pid="b207.0/12">I thank the High Level Panel of Legal Experts on Media Freedom for its contribution to international efforts to promote media freedom. We are now working through all the recommendations of its report, with a view to responding.</p> <p pid="b207.0/13">Just before I finish, I will touch on an issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe and by the right hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islington_North">Islington North</a>&#8212;the threat to sustainable journalism, especially traditional media, as a result of the growth of social media and the  power of the online platforms. My hon. Friend is absolutely right to highlight that issue; it is a matter of considerable concern. As he well knows, we have received a number of reports highlighting the need for action. He will also be aware that we recently established the Digital Markets Unit in the Competition and Markets Authority, which will bring in mandatory codes of conduct to ensure that the relationship between publishers&#8212;in other words, media&#8212;and the platforms is not abused by the over-dominance and anti-competitive practice of the platforms.</p> <p pid="b207.0/14">There is still a lot of work to do, but I am determined that this country should address the concerns that have been rightly expressed today about what happens in the UK, and I am also determined that we should continue to champion media freedom wherever it is under threat across the world. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe for giving us the opportunity to show that this House is united in that ambition.</p>            </div>

We have heard many harrowing stories of attacks on individual journalists, many of whom have lost their lives, for seeking to speak truth to power, to make citizens aware of abuses of power, and to campaign for change.</p> <p pid="b210.0/3">In my 11 years as a <a href="/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a>, I can think of so many issues that I have been involved with, personally or as a member or Chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, and coverage of so many of them was initiated by the work of investigative journalists, bringing to the attention of Parliament and politicians serious issues that needed to be addressed. So journalism is a vital part of a vibrant democracy, and we should take any attack against the media and journalism anywhere in the world incredibly seriously.</p> <p pid="b210.0/4">A number of Members, and indeed the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, too, raised the serious challenges that exist in the digital world. As the Minister said, it is right that we create the infrastructure to safeguard journalism in the future, through the operation of the draft <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Safety_Bill">Online Safety Bill</a> and in particular through the Digital Markets Unit, to ensure that there is not an abuse of market power that will undermine media and could effectively turn journalism into a behind-closed-doors product that a few people pay for but many citizens are simply not exposed to at all. That would be a terrible outcome.</p> <p pid="b210.0/5">The final point that I will make, which I and others&#8212;particularly <a href="/mp/?p=25411" title="Our page on Chris Matheson - 'the hon. Member for City of Chester (Christian Matheson)'">Christian Matheson</a>&#8212;made during the debate, is the important one about abuse of the legal system in the UK to shut down legitimate journalism and legitimate inquiry with lengthy and expensive lawsuits. We have seen examples of that and it is another important area where we need to safeguard journalism in the UK, too.</p> <p pid="b210.0/6">Question put and agreed to.</p> <p pid="b210.0/7">Resolved,</p> <p class="indent" pid="b210.0/8" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House <br><strong>has</strong> considered <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Press_Freedom_Day">World Press Freedom Day</a> 2021.</p> <p pid="b210.0/9">Sitting suspended.</p>            </div>
