Members want to know about, because they want to know what is going on in their constituencies. Last week, the Leader of the House said that there is regular scrutiny and debate, but that is not true, is it? Without the hybrid proceedings, many of our colleagues are excluded from taking part in debates on legislation, so the Government cannot have it both ways.</p> <p pid="c519.0/10">Let us look at the statutory instruments. Some of them are made through the negative resolution procedure, which means they are signed into law and are debated only if they are prayed against. Mostly, they are administrative and technical, but extending pre-trial custody from 56 days to 238 days deserved a debate, and in any event, the Government decide whether there   is time for a debate. What about affirmative SIs? They are laid before the House only after they are signed into law.</p> <p pid="c519.0/11">Can the Leader of the House say why the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of the regulations have been made under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Health">Public Health</a> (Control of Disease) Act 1984, which is meant for emergencies, and not the coronavirus legislation, with its safeguards? Will he guarantee that we will have a debate or even a short statement on any new regulations that are proposed? We want it in the House, not in No. 10 from behind a lectern.</p> <p pid="c519.0/12">May we have a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2020-10-16">16 October</phrase>, a sitting Friday? The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council">European Council</a> will meet on <phrase class="date" code="2020-10-15">15 October</phrase>. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> needs to give a statement to the House on the next phase of the negotiations.</p> <p pid="c519.0/13">That lack of transparency is everywhere. In the Government&#8217;s <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> on planning, they are  removing the requirement to place planning application advertisements in local newspapers. That is already happening in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, where <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walsall_Council">Walsall Council</a> has decided, without any consultation, that it will not do an environmental impact assessment for one of the most important projects there, the route for a sprint bus. It is totally discredited; there will be more traffic; and no one wants it apart from the current Mayor.</p> <p pid="c519.0/14"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Speaker">Mr Speaker</a>, you mentioned someone who is really good at transparency, and that is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hutton">Mark Hutton</a>. I, too, agree with your statement and want to pay tribute to Mark Hutton. He has been in this House for 35 years. As you say, one of his greatest legacies is &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erskine_May">Erskine May</a>&#8221; online, and he was the co-editor, with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_David_Natzler">Sir David Natzler</a>, the 25th edition. In fact, his nickname was &#8220;Erskine&#8221; Hutton. He always saw the potential of digital, and his advice was quite strategic across the House, both on procedure and how it related to the legal side and on how the House works. When he was at university, apparently he liked directing plays, so obviously he came to work here, because he likes the drama. He has left a great legacy.</p> <p pid="c519.0/15">The Leader of the House and I were on the Governance of the House Committee, which was very controversial at the time, but Mark managed to get us through that. Also, we agreed the report digitally, and it went through in record time. Mark has not only left online &#8220;Erskine May&#8221;; he has patiently taught the next generation of Clerks. Mark, we will miss you. Thank you for your work. The House is very grateful, and we hope to see you when you get back&#8212;and when we all get back, maybe at a do in Speaker&#8217;s House. [Interruption.] We hope you do, Mr Speaker; we are looking forward to your dos.</p> <p pid="c519.0/16">It is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_History_Month">Black History Month</a>. Tomorrow is the anniversary of the birth of Gandhi, and it was lovely to see a photo of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Martin_Luther_King">Dr Martin Luther King</a> in his dining room with picture of Gandhi. Both of them worked for justice in a non-violent way. Today is also the mid-autumn festival for the Chinese community.</p> <p pid="c519.0/17">Finally, on behalf of the whole House, I want to send our very best wishes to my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=11531" title="Our page on Andrew Gwynne - 'the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)'">Andrew Gwynne</a>, who is jumping out of a plane on Sunday, weather permitting, for six year-old Florence, who has a life-limiting disease and a rare genetic condition. He is not on the call list today, but we hope will see him next week at business questions, hopefully without a plaster cast.</p>            </div>

Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)'">Andrew Gwynne</a> and, of course, Florence well. It is a brave thing to do.</p> <p pid="c521.0/2">I used to live in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, and the mid-autumn festival was a public holiday, so I am sorry that I cannot tell the House that we will have a public holiday similarly.</p> <p pid="c521.0/3">The right hon. Lady began by mentioning the dual nationals and the need to keep their names at the forefront of the national debate, which she has been doing fantastically every week, so that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazanin_Zaghari-Ratcliffe">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</a> and Anousheh Ashouri and Luke Symons are remembered. The Government are made aware of this every week: the right hon. Lady mentions it to me, and I mention it to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a>. It is known. We are trying our best, but, as was found with hostages before, it is very difficult to get obdurate states and obdurate organisations to move.</p> <p pid="c521.0/4">On parliamentary scrutiny of the coronavirus&#8212;the issue that the right hon. Lady focused on&#8212;I note that Labour Members did not actually take part in large numbers. I think a very small number of them voted yesterday. It is a bit worrying if, when we actually have a vote, the official <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> sit on their hands, so they call for something and then they are absent without leave. They do not formally need leave, of course, under the procedures of the House; it a long time since attendance was demanded. The right hon. Lady asks but the Whips Office does not necessarily want.</p> <p pid="c521.0/5">On the debates that we are bringing forward and have brought forward, we have had 40 oral statements in relation to covid in this House, in addition to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=19" title="An Urgent Question, formerly a Private Notice Question (PNQ), is a question..." class="glossary">urgent questions</a> that Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a> has facilitated. This week, we had a full day&#8217;s debate. The whole of Monday after questions was devoted to a covid-19 debate, and of course we had the renewal of the orders yesterday. Next week, we will have a vote. We had a vote yesterday, but Labour Members did not take part. [Interruption.] The right hon. Lady is heckling&#8212;it is unlike her to heckle&#8212;saying, &#8220;Vote, vote.&#8221; Well, they did not vote. It is not my fault they did not vote. I cannot make Labour Members vote. I have no influence over the Labour Whips Office to get them to turn up and do their job. If they want to sit at home idling away the happy hours not voting&#8212;not going through the <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">Division</a> Lobbies&#8212;what can I do? I can appeal to your good offices, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Speaker">Mr Speaker</a>. I can ask the Doorkeepers to encourage them. We have set things out in a covid-safe way. But Labour Members decide not to turn up when we give them a vote, which they keep on asking for.</p>            </div>

He has been an absolutely authoritative source of advice on procedure and parliamentary privilege. Parliamentary privilege is one of the most interesting topics of discussion: it is such an important part of how we do our work. He has obviously  been a distinguished Clerk of the Journals. He has been very ready to give advice to Members on knotty procedural problems. He has been involved with three editions, two as deputy editor and then as co-editor, of &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erskine_May">Erskine May</a>&#8221;. I must confess that his career is practically what I might like to have had, so in paying this tribute to him, I am a little bit envious of his distinction, his learning and his capability. I served&#8212;I think the right hon. Lady may have done as well&#8212;on the Committee chaired by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Straw">Jack Straw</a> looking into the governance of the House. That Committee was handled by the two of them with such effectiveness and subtlety that it came up with a very good answer. I would like to record my gratitude to him, not just personally but also on behalf of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty">Her Majesty</a>&#8217;s Government.</p> <p pid="c521.2/3">The right hon Lady mentioned that this is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_History_Month">Black History Month</a>. I am a great encourager of all history. As the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> said yesterday, for countless generations, people of African and Caribbean descent have been shaping our nation&#8217;s story, making a huge difference to our national and cultural life and helping to make Britain a better place to be.

I do wonder if we are devoting enough urgency to looking at how we can revise and improve participation by remote means in our discussions, given that large parts of the country are now again in lockdown and that these measures may intensify in the weeks and months to come.

It is now clear&#8212;it is no longer a matter of speculation&#8212;that the devolved Administrations of the United Kingdom will not give consent to this ridiculous piece of legislation, and I want to know if we can find the time to debate in this Chamber the consequences for the devolution settlement of that being the case and of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Government">United Kingdom Government</a> choosing to ignore the wishes of the devolved Administrations and steamroller the legislation through anyway.</p> <p pid="c522.2/4">For my final point, on the job support scheme, I refer the House to my entry in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests.

Gentleman has continued to ask for us to change our procedures and to do things more remotely; it is worth noting that yesterday the remote voting system in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a> fell down and therefore it will have to redo the votes on the business it was supposed to be doing. I think we have to press on with our important business in serving the country, ensuring that we have the debates that are asked for. From the point of view of Government business managers, we have the demand, on the one hand, for debates and votes, quite rightly, and on the other, that we should not be here. People cannot have it both ways. The technology did not provide satisfactory scrutiny and has fallen over in voting in the other place. When we had a problem in our <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">Division</a> Lobbies, we had a fall-back solution and we could carry on with the business. Losing a day&#8217;s votes on Report stage of a Bill makes proceeding with Government business exceptionally difficult.</p> <p pid="c523.0/2">As regards <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Hall">Westminster Hall</a>, the hon. Gentleman says that most Members will not be able to attend, but most Members do not attend Westminster Hall anyway; very few debates are full in Westminster Hall, and although there will be formal limits, considering the numbers who are at most Westminster Hall debates, those formal limits will not be unduly stretched. The resources of our broadcasting teams are being used in other ways, and there are limited resources. Again, people wanted Westminster Hall back, and we have got Westminster Hall back, and that presents an opportunity to hold the Government to account; I think this is a good thing and the right thing to be doing.</p> <p pid="c523.0/3">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Internal_Market_Bill">United Kingdom Internal Market Bill</a> is a fantastic Bill. It is one of the best pieces of legislation passed by the House in recent times. It also devolves 70 powers to the devolved Administrations. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNP">SNP</a> Members are modelling  themselves on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Twist">Oliver Twist</a>&#8212;they are always asking for more. They cannot have more on this occasion. They have a great deal of devolution coming through that Bill, and the Bill will ensure that we have a functioning internal market. The hon. Gentleman effectively asked for further debates on the Bill. It is worth noting that two of the days in Committee were not completely used, so Members are on stronger ground complaining when the time provided by Government has been used up.</p> <p pid="c523.0/4">I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s support for the job support scheme. I remind the House that &#163;190 billion of taxpayers&#8217; money has gone to support the economy so far. That is a very substantial amount. As the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> has said, not everything can be protected, but an enormous amount has been protected.</p>            </div>

Friend is right that the spending of taxpayers&#8217; money should always be open and accountable, and I am glad that he is making it accountable by asking his question. The Government rightly have given taxpayers&#8217; money un-ringfenced to local councils, but local councils have a responsibility to their communities to spend it wisely, and MPs have a right to hold them to account for how it is spent and bring it to the House when they feel it is not spent well; I am sure my hon.

More than 1,600 police officers have paid this terrible price while serving their country. I come from a policing family and I know what it is like to hear about the death of a police officer on the news and wonder for a moment whether it is a family member. We cannot bring PC Ratana back, or others such as PC Andrew Harper, but we can ensure that in future families such as theirs get justice. Will my right hon.

May his soul, and the souls of all the faithful departed, rest in peace. The Government are committed to improving and strengthening sentencing for violent criminals. The justice system exists to keep the public safe. The Government recently published the sentencing <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>, which outlines our approach to sentencing, including the introduction of tougher sentences for murderers and a review of the use of whole-life orders.

On <phrase class="date" code="2020-09-27">27 September</phrase>, Armenia mobilised forces and attacked Azerbaijan, and I understand that they are regularly launching rockets from Armenia into Azerbaijan to provoke Azerbaijan to react. All this has the potential for dragging both Turkey and Russia into a much more extended war. May we have a statement from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> early next week on what actions the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> will take at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</a> to broker a ceasefire and prevent Armenia from creating a potentially very serious war?</p>            </div>

These people are heroes who went into work every day while we were all locked down at home, and ensured that we had food and provisions; yet, the thanks that many get is to be abused and assaulted by customers. As somebody who worked for Asda for 12 years before entering the House, I feel very strongly that the despicable people who assault shop workers should face much tougher sentences from the courts. Can we have a debate to see whether the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament.

Shop workers have been fantastic, phenomenal and brave, because they all stayed at work at a point when we knew much less about the disease than we do now and thought that it might have been much more risky even than it has turned out to be; they were a real frontline emergency service. Without them, the crisis would have been infinitely worse, so I am grateful to my hon. Friend for the tribute he has paid to them. I can reassure him that there are already offences that cover assaults against any worker, including those in the retail sector, such as common assault, actual bodily harm and grievous bodily harm. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_July">In July</a>, the Government published the findings of a call for evidence on violence and abuse towards shop workers, and we will continue to work with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Retail_Consortium">British Retail Consortium</a> and other partners to stop these crimes. I pay tribute to the British Retail Consortium for the work that it has been doing to highlight this important issue, and encourage my hon. Friend and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRC">BRC</a> to continue raising it.</p>            </div>

She is right to campaign for better dentistry provision in her constituency. It is a devolved matter, and the Welsh authorities are responsible&#8212;they are, of course, socialist-run Welsh authorities&#8212;but I am afraid there is a problem with the provision of health services by the devolved Welsh authorities, which do not manage to run their affairs as well as they should. The good news is that there is going to be an election in May. Next May, people can vote Conservative, and then they will have better, cleaner, fresher teeth&#8212;and if they use Aquafresh, their teeth will be cleaner still.</p>            </div>

Debates do not run properly when people are remote and interventions are not possible. The support given to Wales by taxpayers is a total of &#163;4 billion, protecting 400,000 jobs under the furlough scheme and 110,000 jobs under the self-employed scheme. What has been done for Wales is very significant, and if the hon. Gentleman wants to come to the House to sing the praises of the Government for what they have managed to do, we will lay out the red carpet for him.</p>            </div>

Yesterday, a review and audit of art across Parliament by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_of_Art_Committee">Works of Art Committee</a> was announced. At the height of the global coronavirus pandemic, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham_County_Council">Durham County Council</a> launched a similar review, spending days of officers&#8217; time on a pointless exercise looking at works of art across <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Durham">County Durham</a>. We all want to see the very best of Britain showcased in this Parliament and see the context of historical pieces. However, does the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a> agree that, at this time of the global coronavirus pandemic, Parliament can do better than following a panicked Labour-led Durham County Council in bending the knee to woke political agenda?</p>            </div>

The Government are committed to supporting and reviving Britain&#8217;s high streets, many of which are in real  need of regeneration. As I understand it, officials from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Housing,_Communities_and_Local_Government">Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government</a> are meeting Stoke-on-Trent council leaders to discuss the town&#8217;s progress in applying for towns fund investment. The Government welcome proposals from local authorities for towns fund investment, which will be assessed on the quality of their business case. There is another round of money forthcoming, and I am sure my hon. Friend will encourage the local authority to apply. This is a fund of &#163;3.6 billion in England.

It is the policy of the Government to devolve, to centralise and to give more power to local communities. Building on the programme of mayoral combined authority models, conversations on further devolution are continuing. Lincolnshire is unquestionably a great county, and I think that bringing counties back together is always welcomed by the people who live within them.</p>            </div>

Member for Walsall South (Valerie Vaz)'">Valerie Vaz</a> of being from the hard left&#8212;not today, at any rate. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising this matter. The homelessness legislation guidance sets out that in the first instance local authorities should try to place homeless households within their own area, and when this is not possible they should place them as near as possible to the original local authority area. We are clear that local authorities should, as far as possible, avoid placing households outside their borough. We are aware that, on occasion, in some areas where there is a limited supply of suitable accommodation, it is necessary to place households in temporary accommodation outside the local area, but this should be a last resort. If a local authority places a household in accommodation in another local authority area, it is required to notify that local authority of any placement. My hon. Friend is right to raise this issue and to put pressure on the relevant local council to do better.</p>            </div>
