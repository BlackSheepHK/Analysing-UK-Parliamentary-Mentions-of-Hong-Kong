At this meeting agreement was reached that the alternatives listed in the Declaration of Intent made by the Community in 1963 would be open to certain African countries, namely Gambia, Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. I remind the House that these alternatives comprise association under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaounde_Convention">Yaounde Convention</a>; other association agreements with mutual rights and obligations, particularly in matters of trade; or commercial agreements to facilitate and expand trade between the Community and these countries.</p> <p>
The Community said that it could only state its position with regard to other Commonwealth developing countries in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> and Pacific, and the Caribbean, for which we proposed that the same options be available, in the light of discussions taking place with

respect to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Sugar_Agreement">Commonwealth Sugar Agreement</a>.</p> <p>
The conference also discussed further the basis of Gibraltar's customs arrangements with the Community following the agreement already reached&#8212;and reported to the House on the 29th October&#8212;that the provisions of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rome">Treaty of Rome</a> would apply to Gibraltar under Article 227 (4). It has been accepted that as Gibraltar is not a part of the United Kingdom's customs territory there would be no reason to include Gibraltar in the customs territory of the enlarged Community.</p> <p>
I again expressed the hope that the Community would shortly be able to make known its views on the arrangements to be made for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>.</p> <p>
The principles of the United Kingdom admission to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Investment_Bank">European Investment Bank</a> were agreed.</p> <p>
In the course of a statement I made dealing with the question of transitional measures, I proposed on behalf of Her Majesty's Government a transitional period of five years for adaptation in both the industrial and agricultural fields and for adaptation to the Community's rules regarding capital movements and fiscal harmonisation. I stressed that, in putting this proposal forward, we thought it essential that, within the common period of five years in the four fields, effective provision should be made for arriving at a mutual balance of advantage between the United Kingdom and the existing Community.</p> <p>
In the industrial field, we thought this could be done if we could provide for a suitable accelerated rhythm for tariff rates and adaptations. For agriculture and horticulture, we should require that the adaptations be made with reasonable flexibility over five full years.</p> <p>
I said that the five-year period should not, in our view, apply in the cases of Community finance, New Zealand butter and cheese and sugar from developing Commonwealth countries, nor to the European Coal and Steel Community and Euratom.</p> <p>
The Community noted our proposals upon industry and agriculture with satisfaction and said that they would examine our suggestions on capital movements and fiscal harmonisation in a positive


spirit. Deputies were instructed to pursue the discussion of all these questions in preparation for the next Ministerial meeting.</p> <p>
The Community said that it would establish its position on all of these questions within a global framework. This is naturally our own position. The agreements reached hitherto must all be regarded as provisional pending the outcome of the negotiations as a whole.</p> <p>
At the meeting I also outlined certain considerations which we believe the Community should take into account in dealing with the question of the British contribution to Community finance. I pointed out that the United Kingdom would be likely to enjoy only relatively small receipts as a result of Community expenditure in its present form. I recalled also that the existing members of the Community had had an extended transitional period in which to move to the agreed Community system of financing, and that correctives had been provided for governing member countries' contributions during a period of years after the final stage of Community direct income had been started. I noted that the Commission had stated in its observations on our estimates of the effect of Community financing upon the United Kingdom that, should unacceptable situations arise within the present Community or an enlarged Community, the very survival of the Community would demand that the institutions find equitable solutions.</p> <p>
I said that we would be making detailed proposals in this field as soon as possible.</p> <p>
Finally it was agreed that Ministerial meetings should take place next year on 2nd February, 16th March, 11th May and 22nd June, and that the timetable of meetings could be speeded up if necessary.</p>            </div>

Is the right hon. and Learned Gentleman also aware that any of our comments or questioning, approving or otherwise, is without prejudice to our right to judge the package as a whole if and when it emerges? With that proviso, will he tell us if he has been able to secure any special treatment for horticulture and hill farms within the agricultural context? Did he consult the N.F.U. before accepting the five-year period? Does that meet with its approval?</p> <p>
I thank the right hon. and learned Gentleman for the stand he is taking on behalf of the Commonwealth sugar producers and New Zealand. Will he make the other negotiating parties aware of what is not immediately obvious as a point of the highest importance from the political standpoint for historical and other reasons, but which is regarded in this country as a matter of the utmost importance&#8212;the protection of New Zealand and Commonwealth sugar interests?</p>            </div>

I can give him the assurance he asks for in the final question he asked. I do not think that there is any need for dispute on the subject in our proposals in regard to Community finance. As I said, I will be making these as soon as possible. The Community understands the position. Its document was an important one but technically it has not yet been delivered to us. In the last statement I made to the House, I requested the Community to reserve its position until it had heard our detailed case. This is a crucial matter and I am sure that we shall approach it in that light.</p> <p>
I referred specifically to horticulture in my statement. I have been very much concerned about it, as has my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of Agriculture. We are concerned that there should be full flexibility within the full five years for which I have asked. Of course, particular regard must be paid to horticulture. We have also reserved from the beginning the position of the hill farmers&#8212;and I have a personal interest in this. We will be going into that in detail in relation to Community finance and fiscal measures. There is also the question of the contribution we receive from Community funds in relation to matters of that kind. My right hon. Friend has been in close touch with the National


Fanners' Union throughout these negotiations.</p>            </div>

As under the terms of the E.E.C. policy fishing is covered by the common agricultural guidance and guarantee fund, can he,

firstly, say whether the five-year period for agriculture will cover fishing? Secondly, would he bear in mind that it was a Conservative Government which imposed the 12-mile limit, which was of immense value to our inshore fishermen, and that our inshore fishermen are confident in the hope that the 12-mile limit will be retained; otherwise they will be up the spout?</p>            </div>

Price:</p> <p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman made a passing reference, in a few words, to our relationships with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>. Did the right hon. and learned Gentleman make it clear to his opposite numbers in Brussels that we in this country have been at the receiving end for far too long of the cheap imports from Hong Kong, particularly textiles? Two-thirds of our textile industry has been destroyed by unfair competition from Hong Kong and other Eastern countries, and 40 per cent. of our home market is occupied by the exports of that part of the world to this country. Will he make it clear on a suitable occasion when this matter is being ventilated, as it is bound to be, that whilst we have been on the receiving end of these vast imports of cheaply-produced goods, to the destruction of our industry, the Six have been taking only about 5 per cent., against the 45 per cent, absorbed by Britain? When may we have some equity in this matter if we are expected to be partners and not merely slaves?</p>            </div>

On the matter of the fisheries regulation, at an early stage I said to the Community that it might make things difficult if the situation were to change in a serious way while we were negotiating, and we have subsequently agreed that we shall have close regard to the way in which policies which we have to apply independently while negotiations are going on are affecting the outcome.

What we put forward as an opening bid, indicating what we thought was a reasonable period of adjustment, was three years for industry, six years for agriculture, and one year for Euratom and for coal and steel. The Community replied, "You want to get all the industrial benefits before you come in fully on the agricultural side." We foresaw that that point of view might be expressed. The suggestion which I put forward for five years and five years is designed to protect the position of agriculture and horticulture, and we feel that it is an adequate period. It is a period which, all being well, and assuming the success of the negotiations, will run from 1st January, 1973, to 1978. Any problems of substance that are likely to be thrown up within certain spheres of agriculture or horticulture will have been met and dealt with in that period.</p>            </div>

The chances are that in the Community for a period of years up to 1978 some things will go out of surplus and new things will go into it. We have been concerned to express the definite dependence of New Zealand on its exports of dairy products, butter and cheese, and we have put forward proposals accordingly. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The right hon. Gentleman asks about lamb. My right hon. Friend who is now the <a href="/glossary/?gl=99" title="The chancellor of the exchequer is the government's chief financial..." class="glossary">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, in his initial statement, as did <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_George-Brown">Lord George-Brown</a>, as he now is, in 1967, emphasised the importance of New Zealand's lamb exports. Provided that there is no sheep meat regulation which might change the position, in which case we would have to reopen the matter, and as things stand we see no difficulty about New Zealand's exports of meat.</p>            </div>

I cannot precisely forecast the timetable. We still have some difficult issues to resolve. As I said in my statement, we have fixed meetings for next year up to June, but we have also agreed that we can speed up the meetings if we have accelerated progress. I suggested that we might need extra days in June and in April, but the Chairman of the Community suggested that we might need an extra day in March if things are progressing rapidly. I hope that that will be so.</p>            </div>
