                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>In raising this matter relating to the 71 aircraft now located at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Tak">Kai Tak</a> airport, Hong Kong, which have been handed over to the People's <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China">Government of China</a>, I do so in the hope that what I have to say will be restrained, because I have no desire to say anything to make the situation, which is already complicated, more difficult than it is at the moment. The only

reason I am raising this matter is that a considerable proportion of the equipment has already been shipped away to the People's Government of China.</p> <p>
I asked the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for the Colonies some two weeks ago about this matter, and I was not satisfied with the reply. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Question">The Question</a> and answer were fully reported in the "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Telegraph">Hong Kong Telegraph</a>" on 18th March. Had this been a British newspaper in this country, I believe&#8212;because I have taken advice&#8212;that it might have been a question of breach of privilege. I do not propose to make a point of that, because I think that one should not be over-sensitive about these matters, and that it might be of embarrassment to the Chair. For the sake of record, I will quote what the report says:
<q>Air-Commodore Harvey may have been the unsuspecting victim of high-pressure lobbying, for it is no secret that strenuous efforts have been made to bring influence to bear on <a href="/glossary/?gl=101" title="Whitehall is a wide road that runs through the heart of Westminster,..." class="glossary">Whitehall</a> to interfere with what the British Constitutions holds most sacred&#8212;the rule of law.</q>
I agree that the decisions of the judges of this country and of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Colonies">British Colonies</a> are final, so far as that goes. I wish to assure the House, however, that I have not been guilty of receiving high-pressure lobbying, and I have no interest in this matter whatever except with regard to the points at issue, although perhaps I should tell the House that I worked in an aviation business in China for a good many years, but that was a long time ago.</p> <p>
On 9th November last year, nine aircraft belonging to the China National Aircraft Corporation and two belonging to the China Air Transport Corporation had cleared the Customs at Hong Kong for Nationalist territory, presumably for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_Formosa">Island of Formosa</a>, but the two managing directors who were part of the crew, or passengers, had a deep-laid plot. They did not go to Formosa but went in the opposite direction to the People's Government at Peking. In fact, they flew to the other side. The aircraft arrived in fact at Peking, but there remained on the ground at Kai Tak 71 modern aircraft&#8212;Skymasters and numerous others&#8212;which I contend are potential war equipment. It is no good saying that because an airliner is now a passenger aircraft that it is not potential war equipment. It can be modified to carry bombs, or it can be used to drop paratroops, and for many other purposes in war.</p> <p>
Following that incident, on 17th November, the Chinese Nationalist <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Yeh, interviewed the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Hong_Kong">Governor of Hong Kong</a>&#8212;I imagine for guidance&#8212;and asked for the protection of the assets which he rightly believed belonged to his Government. That was part of the holding owned by General Chennault, the man who flew with the airlift in the Far East during the war, who had bought 20 per cent. of the holding belonging to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_American_Airways_Corporation">Pan American Airways Corporation</a>.</p> <p>
The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_Government">Nationalist Government</a> Minister of Communications, presumably in Formosa, grounded the 71 remaining aircraft. I presume that they had been grounded because they were not in a condition to fly because of lack of servicing. He informed the Director of Civil Aviation at Hong Kong of his action and the aircraft registrations were suspended. To all intents and purposes, these aircraft ought not to be moved. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_Government">Peking Government</a> then, as I understand it, informed the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Government">Hong Kong Government</a> that they would hold the local Government in the Colony responsible for the property because it was guarded by their loyal subjects. I never knew that there was any such thing as loyalty in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party">Communist Party</a>.</p>            </div>

The local representatives of C.N.A.C. requested the Deputy-Director of Civil Aviation at Hong Kong to cancel the passes of the defectionists on the airfield. He thought that the right thing to do was to keep these men off the airfield, and that that would simplify the problem enormously. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Director">The Director</a> of Civil Aviation said that he had no instructions from higher authority to carry that out, and that it would be difficult to recall the passes because they were not regularly inspected, and he had not sufficient staff to do so. C.N.A.C.'s representative saw a senior official of the Government and requested guidance. They were in some difficulty to know what to do in this matter. They were referred to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney-General">Attorney-General</a>, whom they saw in the presence of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_Police">Commissioner of Police</a>.</p> <p>
Everyone quite rightly wanted to avoid making the trouble worse than it was. I understand that they were told that if a court order was obtained it would be implemented. It never was. The two Corporations concerned instituted proceedings against certain of the leading defectionists for trespass on and damage to what they considered to be their rightful property. The defendants then obtained an order restraining the plaintiffs from removing the property. There was switching backwards and forwards, with advertisements in the local Press, both sides claiming the property and trying to get the better of the other. The question of the passes at the airport was again taken up, because that was felt to be the crux of the problem, but the assistance asked for was not forthcoming. The Director of Civil Aviation was again interviewed, but he said that he had not the machinery to withdraw the passes.</p> <p>
On 20th December representatives of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Air_Transport">Civil Air Transport</a> Incorporated&#8212;that is the new company formed to take over the assets of the two air corporations in China&#8212;informed the C.N.A.C. solicitors that they had purchased the assets of the two companies, and they naturally claimed possession of the property. The officials of C.N.A.C. and C.A.T.C. were appointed by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_Government">Nationalist Government</a> and General Chennault and Mr. Willaner, and they were quite willing that the new company should have possession of the assets, to clarify the difficult position. But a body of men who claimed that they owned the company again advertised in the local papers on 1st December that they had severed their connection with C.N.A.C. and C.A.T.C., and that they remained in possession of the assets, with their passes to the airport.</p> <p>
As I see it, the point is that the People's <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China">Government of China</a> was recognised by Britain on 6th January, 1950, and then claimed that the defectionists at Hong Kong on the airport, or other persons, were holding assets on their behalf. They claimed that they were immune from the jurisdiction of the courts&#8212;which may be right legally. On 15th March, a short time ago&#8212;and this is my main point&#8212;5,777, cases of aircraft engines and air frame parts, valued at about three million dollars, were shipped from Hong Kong in a British steamer. There were enough parts there to main-


tain these aeroplanes for something like two years.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>Tsingtao, in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_China">North China</a>. It was reported in a local paper which was sent to me that the ship in question was trailed by a Nationalist destroyer and a British destroyer. Whether it has ever arrived at its destination, I do not know. In the meantime, the new company applied for an injunction and a summons for preservation of the assets, but this was refused by the Chief Justice in Hong Kong last Tuesday. I have no doubt that the Chief Justice was quite right legally, but my contention is that all the procrastination which led up to this refusal to withdraw the passes, and so on, has led to a situation in which a judge has had to make this very important decision. What will happen now that all this equipment has gone out? It seems extraordinary that when we are accepting aid from our friends in the United States we should be handing over equipment in this way.</p> <p>
I would not mind if the People's <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China">Government of China</a> had responded to the recognition which this country gave them, but instead of that we are being insulted almost daily; the British people in Shanghai have had heavy fines levied on them week after week, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bury (Mr. W. Fletcher) pointed out in the House this week. It strikes me that this matter has been handled in a most extraordinary way. I feel that the various departments in Hong Kong have carried out their duties in a negative manner.</p> <p>
When I asked that a commission should go out to Hong Kong to investigate this matter, I intended no slight on the legal authorities in the Colony; I only wanted some action taken to see that this valuable equipment did not get into the hands of the Communists because, firstly, I do not think that would be a good thing, and secondly I do not think it belongs to them. Had the equipment been moved in time&#8212;it probably could not have been, for various reasons&#8212;they would not have got it. It was only because the Communists were recognised by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a> on 6th January that they are in the fortunate position of holding this equipment.</p> <p>
I do not want to add to the difficulties of the situation, but I should like an assurance from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of State for the Colonies that something will be done to prevent this equipment leaving, because I think it highly dangerous that it should leave, and I hope that action will be taken even at this late hour.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Air-Commodore Harvey) has done well to raise this matter, as he has done with both moderation and restraint. I am sure the Government will appreciate the difficulty of this situation. I want, not exactly to expand on the background of the case, which was largely dealt with by my hon. and gallant Friend, but, as the Rules are wide on an <a href="/glossary/?gl=119" title="An adjournment debate is a short half hour debate that is introduced by a..." class="glossary">Adjournment Debate</a>, to look at the question of these 71 planes and the spare parts and stores against the wider picture of the political and military situation in the Far East.</p> <p>
The latest information that I have been able to obtain about these 71 planes was in the "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a>," contained in a report from Hong Kong sent on Wednesday, I feel that it might be useful to hon. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members">Members</a>, who cannot be fully in touch, if I read this short report to show the present situation. It says:
<q>Mr. E. H. Williams, Acting <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_Hong_Kong">Chief Justice of Hong Kong</a>, yesterday dismissed an application by the American-registered company <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Air_Transport">Civil Air Transport</a> Inc., seeking an injunction to prevent the Peking-controlled <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_National_Aviation_Corporation">China National Aviation Corporation</a> and the Central Air Transport Corporation from removing 71 grounded planes and other assets from the colony.</q><q>Civil Air Transport is operated by Gen. Chennault, the former commander of the '<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Tigers">Flying Tigers</a>' volunteer air force in China. Control of the 71 aircraft was given to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_Government">Peking Government</a> under a recent <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court">Supreme Court</a> decision. Gen. Chennault, who claimed them, said he had purchased them from their former Nationalist owners.</q><q>The planes are still intact at Kaitak airfield, on the outskirts of Kowloon, opposite Hong Kong island, and no move has been made to get them ready for flying. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Communists">The Communists</a> have removed some spare parts and miscellaneous equipment by sea"&#8212;</q>
my hon. and gallant Friend told us there were nearly 6,000 crates taken away&#8212;
<q>but there is no indication that they intend to dismantle the aircraft for shipment.</q>


Then it concludes:
<q>Although Gen. Chennault has indicated that he intends to appeal against the Supreme Court decision, he has not yet taken any legal action.</q>
Therefore the matter is not now <i>sub judice,</i> as he has not made any appeal.</p> <p>
In these circumstances, I should be the last person to criticise the legal decision, as a legal decision, which has recently been taken, and it is no part of my intention to do so. But I do ask the House to look at this question against the broader military and political situation which we see in the Far East. I must add here how much I and most of my hon. Friends hope that an early opportunity will be found to Debate in this House the whole situation in the Far East, and to get some real statement of Government policy&#8212;a thing we have not had for five years. I very much hope that that Debate will soon come off, and that we can examine the wider question for a whole day in the House.</p> <p>
The active part that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Eastern">Far Eastern</a> Cominform is playing in the whole situation in the Far East is not generally recognised, and certainly not by the general public. After all, for five years we have been a major participant in what so many people call the cold war. But in the Far East the war is by no means cold. There is war in Burma, and only today I read in the newspapers that the Communists have achieved startling successes and are now in occupation of Prome, which lies astride the oil pipeline, and that that key town has been lost to the Government. They are apparently achieving considerable military success, and all this time of course the British taxpayers are paying out millions of pounds, as are our Dominions, following on the decision of the Columbo Conference to support the Burmese Government. That is a part of the picture.</p> <p>
Then in Malaya, everybody knows that for two years now very large British forces, Malayan forces and the police have been locked in a deadly battle with the Communists, who of course are inspired and organised by the Far Eastern Cominform. Everyone knows that. Then, of course, the French have had very grave military troubles and are engaged in a war in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Indo-China">French Indo-China</a>. Everyone knows how closely connected

with the whole military situation in the Far East is that situation in Indo-China.</p> <p>
It is quite absurd, therefore, to suggest that the Chinese situation and the whole situation in the Far East can be looked upon merely as part of the cold war which has been going on for five years. It was in 1920 that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshal_Stalin">Marshal Stalin</a> said:
<q>England's back will be broken, not on the banks of the Thames, but on the Yangtse, the Ganges and the Nile.</q>
That was the directive laid down by Marshal Stalin in 1920, and that is the directive which is now being so efficiently carried out. In confirmation of that, I saw this report in the "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Worker">Daily Worker</a>."
<q>In a statement made on the new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_People">Chinese People</a>'s Democracy, issued on the 28th anniversary of the Chinese party, Mao Tse-tung says:</q><q>'One is either on the side of imperialism or the side of Socialism. Neutrality is a camouflage, and a third road does not exist. The present need is to push forward industrialisation as fast as possible. To this end, capitalism in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_China">New China</a> will not at present be eliminated, but it will be restricted. We want to trade. There has to be trade. We oppose only those domestic and foreign reactionaries who hamper us from doing our business, and we do not oppose any other people. Let us give thanks to Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin who gave us the weapons. These weapons are not machine guns, but <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism-Leninism">Marxism-Leninism</a>.'</q>
As a matter of fact they are machine guns as well, but he did not disclose that.</p> <p>
I do not want to go further afield than is necessary. But this is the background against which this situation must be seen. So far as the trading situation is concerned, about which the Government have had no clear policy since they won the <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">General Election</a> in 1945, it is relevant to underline what my hon. and gallant Friend said about the difficulties foreign merchants are having in China. These difficulties should be seen in the light of the remarks I have just quoted. I see "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist">The Economist</a>" says:
<q>Foreign merchants in China have been having a very difficult time. Trade has fallen to about a third of a year ago; profits have been cut to below the minimum, so that, in the case of British firms, extra capital has had to be sent to China in order to keep the businesses going; the Peking Government have imposed a number of arbitrary taxes and in one way or another have even made it impossible for those firms who would like to do so to close down their business and leave the country.</q>


The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of State knows that we are still running after the Peking Government and arguing with them on the recognition terms, whereas recognition was given on the very eve of the Colombo conference without consulting the Dominions, a most disgraceful act on the part of the Government, which was calculated to start off the conference in the worse possible atmosphere.</p> <p>
In view of the fact that these 6,000 crates of valuable military stores have already left the Island, and in view of the fact that further stores are likely to leave in the near future because of the court decision, I feel that I must ask the Minister whether he thinks;&#8212;</p>            </div>

The matter concerns certain property in Hong Kong as to which there appear to be three claims, the claimants having brought actions before an established court of the Colony. That would appear to be a matter which is <i>sub judice</i> and, being before a British court, out of order to be discussed here. Assuming that a stage is reached in this case, which has not yet been reached, that a decision is come to, then the successful party will be allowed to execute his judgment and can be prevented from doing so only by legislation. Therefore, on that aspect too, is it not out of order to discuss something over which the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> has no executive power and which can be dealt with only by legislation?</p>            </div>

It is quite possible under existing legislation for an export prohibition to be imposed. My hon. and gallant Friend was arguing that a commission of inquiry should go out to find out what is the situation, in view of the background my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Lewes (Major Beamish) has brought to the notice of the House, namely, that the Communists are attacking us in the Far East.

<q>General Chennault has indicated that he intends to appeal against the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court">Supreme Court</a> decision, but has not yet taken any legal action.</q>
Therefore it seems perfectly clear that the question is not <i>sub judice,</i> although it may be one day.</p>            </div>

There is an action in which the American companies are plaintiffs, an action in which the Communist authorities are plaintiffs, and an action in which the individuals who I think would be described as the people who were "sitting in" are the plaintiffs. It is true that one of these actions has resulted in what we call interlocutory proceedings for an injunction being taken. That injunction has been granted, and an appeal against it has been lodged. That is the only interlocutory proceeding in the main action which continues.</p>            </div>

The equipment is leaving, and I cannot see in those circumstances how the matter can be <i>sub judice.</i></p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>Surely we should clear our minds as to what is <i>sub judice.</i> Let us assume for one moment that someone is claiming the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London">Tower of London</a>. That is <i>sub judice,</i> but it does not prevent us from discussing the future of the Tower of London. There are three claimants to these aeroplanes. It is quite possible to discuss the different questions as to what administrative action the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> should adopt with regard to these aeroplanes. It is not as if we were considering the question of a man who is appealing to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=9" title="The Privy Council goes back to the earliest days of the Monarchy, when it..." class="glossary">Privy Council</a> against a death sentence imposed in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa">West Africa</a>. If we discuss

whether he should or should not be pardoned or whether some action should be taken to interfere or reverse or bring in legislation to alter the court's decision, we would be discussing something that is <i>sub judice.</i> But the mere fact that one aspect of these aeroplanes is under discussion in the courts, does not preclude a general discussion at this stage of what administrative action the Minister should take with regard to the prevention of the export of what we on this side of the House call war material.</p> <p>
That is, in my submission, a perfectly proper question to discuss, and need not interfere in any way with the decision of the court. As the right hon. Gentleman has said, we have got to accept that the courts are ready to say that the Communist Government are immune from the Statute and could not be touched in the courts. However, that is not the question. For instance, in America what happened at the beginning of the 1939 war? A lot of actions were pending about war material, but the executive Government prevented the export of the war material from the United States, and it is that administrative action, which the right hon. Gentleman could take under existing legislation, which we think he should take.</p>            </div>

With regard to the spares, I can only repeat that there are no powers by which those spares can be prevented from leaving the country. As regards the planes, the court ruled on 23rd February that the property was in the possession and control of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_People">Chinese People</a>'s Government and that it would be a violation of the rights of a foreign Sovereign Power to make an order directing that the property in its possession and control should be delivered over to a receiver appointed by the court.</p> <p>
An appeal against this decision has been lodged, as I said before, by the side representing Chinese Nationalist and United States interests, and that appeal is


due to be heard on 28th April. As regards the question of the spares, we have no administrative powers, and the matter would require legislation. As regards the question of the planes going, it is <i>sub judice</i> until 28th April.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>Some hon. Gentlemen opposite think that this may be a valuable subject to discuss. Everyone will agree that the points of Order have been a little confusing. I hope I am right in saying that it appears now that any legislation that might be involved would be legislation in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_of_Hong_Kong">Colony of Hong Kong</a>, and that on those grounds there is no question of this discussion being out of order. I think it is also agreed that not only have nearly 6,000 crates of valuable aircraft spares and parts left Hong Kong but that other spares and parts are likely to leave in the future.</p> <p>
I was attempting to deal with the question of the destination of these spares and the use to which they might be put. If I remember, I was in the middle of a sentence when this last rumpus occurred. I think I was drawing attention to the speech which I have tried to make by summing up and by describing the way in which the Far-Eastern Cominform, which is, of course, controlled directly by the Politbureau in the Kremlin, is in charge of these Communist activities which are causing the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Pact">Atlantic Pact</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Union">Western Union</a> Powers such very great trouble in the Far East. About that there can be no <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> of doubt.</p> <p>
That leads me to take the opportunity of drawing the attention of the Government to the point that the fact that these spares are leaving the Colony of Hong Kong is only underlining the fact that since 1945, when the Socialists became the masters, there has been no indication at all of any coherent policy regarding <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East-West">East-West</a> trade. The most frightful example of all was when <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls_Royce_Nene">Rolls Royce Nene</a> jet engines were sent to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a>. That showed a grave lack of co-ordination between Government Departments. I cannot credit that when the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of Supply, who I believe was responsible for this, gave instructions and allowed them to go, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a> had any real knowledge of it. All these Communist countries are increasingly locked together by trade agreements, whether they are in the Far East or in Europe. All agreements between Communist countries contain secret clauses. The last agreement between Czechoslovakia and Russia contained only one sentence simply saying that a trade agreement had been signed.</p> <p>
Against this military and political background, I feel sure that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_State">Minister of State</a>, without commenting on any legal decision that has been taken, can but regret the fact that these valuable military stores are going to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_China">Communist China</a>. It is no good saying that these spare parts and stores are only suitable for civil planes. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> knows perfectly well that any large modern aircraft, or even a small aircraft, in the conditions of war which exist, for example, in Burma, is invaluable to either side. The use of a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_Hart">Hawker Hart</a> with a bucket full of Mills bombs in it would be invaluable to the Communists who are at present in occupation of the aerodrome at Prome in Burma. It is most unpleasant to have a bucket full of Mills bombs on one's head, no matter how small or ancient the plane may be from which they are dropped. I have not had personal experience of that, and I hope that I never do.</p> <p>
I am sure that the Minister will not indulge in the argument that these spare parts and stores, or indeed the aircraft, are civil equipment. The machines are suitable for parachutists or for carrying airborne troops, or even for carrying bombs in one way or another. I appeal most sincerely to the Minister to consider the whole question against the general and deteriorating military and political background throughout the whole of the Far East. It is obvious that if the Government were looking for a legal loophole through which these stores which are of a military nature could be provided to Communist China, it would not be difficult for them to find one.</p> <p>
I suggest that this is a far wider and more important issue. In view of the fact that what is happening at the moment has been the subject of adverse criticism in the United States and bearing in mind the other reasons which I have outlined, the very least the Minister can do is to assure us that the whole question will be re-examined in the light of the wider picture which I have tried to paint and the most able case put by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Macclesfield.</p>            </div>

The issues that have now been raised in the speech of the hon. and gallant Member for Lewes (Major Beamish) go very far beyond the subject originally stated by the hon. and gallant Member for Macclesfield (Air-Commodore Harvey). What has now been raised is the whole question of the relationship of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Powers">Western Powers</a>, and particularly the relationship of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Great_Britain">Government of Great Britain</a>, to the Communist Powers throughout the world.</p> <p>
I regret that this much wider issue has been raised in this fashion, because it is of completely fundamental importance not only to Great Britain but to every country in the whole world. It seems unfair that this should be sprung on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> when he is obviously in a position where he cannot possibly give any effective reply.</p>            </div>

As events have turned out, it has been proved that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> was wrong on the subject of legislation. It was legislation in the Colony, and not in this country, which was required.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I do not think that this touches the point I was making. It is undesirable that a <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> should be asked, without warning, to commit the Government in a statement upon these extremely difficult and dangerous questions. Everybody realises how explosive these questions can be. It is all very well for myself as a back-bencher without Governmental responsibility, or for hon. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members">Members</a> opposite as back-benchers, to express views freely upon matters of this kind, as I hope that we all will, but it is an entirely different matter to expect a Minister to stand up on the spur of the moment and to deal with matters of this quality on an occasion such as this.</p> <p>
I turn to some of the comments of the hon. and gallant Member for Lewes. It must have been obvious to the House, when he was developing the argument about the military uses of these spares upon which attention has now been pinned, how completely one-sided the presentation of his views was. He said, quite properly, that a civil airplane can, at very short notice and with a minimum of preparation, be turned into an effective weapon for war offensive. Even those of us who have no technical knowledge about aeroplanes know that. It is obvious, therefore, that these spare parts upon which the Debate has been pinned and which have been sent out from Hong Kong to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_China">Communist China</a> may play some part in military operations within the territory of that power or within any other territory which the planes may reach.</p> <p>
That is true, but was it not a significant thing that the hon. Member was emphasising in that argument that, while he was so anxious to deprive Communist China of even spare parts that might

have potential military uses, he had no word whatever to say about the actions of the Government of Chiang Kai-shek in Formosa in using American bombers and dropping American explosives on the territory and people of Communist China whom he is so anxious to deprive of the effective means of defence. Had he been really concerned for the peace of the world in the Far East, he would surely have shown wisdom by protesting against the use of American planes by General Chiang Kai-shek as well as against the use of spare parts exported from the British <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_of_Hong_Kong">Colony of Hong Kong</a>.</p>            </div>

Since we are raising this issue in this wide form, it is necessary that we should speak plainly about it. The Government of Chiang Kai-shek is engaged in a series of piratical and destructive raids upon the territory of a Government with which we ourselves are in friendly relations, and I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that, since he raised these issues, he should try to look at them in an objective manner.</p> <p>
If hon. Gentlemen opposite deplore the use of spares from Hong Kong for this Government, with whom we are in friendly relations, and if they deplore their use for military purposes, they ought to be frank and sincere enough also to express their distaste of the use of bombing planes by General Chiang Kai-shek in Formosa, but we have not heard a single word about it. I am not referring to the hon. and gallant Member for Macclesfield, but to the argument which I heard from the hon. and gallant Gentleman who spoke last, and I suggest that we have to make up our minds, not only on the question whether it is wise to allow these spares to go from Hong Kong to General Mao, but also on the question of what our attitude is to be to the far more important issue of our relations with Communist powers in the Far East and elsewhere.</p> <p>
The logic of the argument from the other side is not merely that we should disrupt the friendly relations which we


have established with General Mao and his Government, but that we should disrupt our friendly relations and contacts with every Communist Government and people throughout the world. Every word uttered by the hon. and gallant Gentleman was not merely an argument against friendly relations with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_China">Communist China</a> but also an argument against friendly relations with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Russia">Soviet Russia</a>.

The hon. and gallant Gentleman, after all, cannot possibly come to this House and endorse a full-scale attack being made upon a country with which we are in friendly relations, though it has a Communist Government, just because of the fact that it is a Communist Government&#8212;because, after all, that was the reason for his attack&#8212;and, at the same time, imagine that he can also advocate, at one and the same time, friendly relations with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Governments">Communist Governments</a> in the Far East and elsewhere.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>Hon. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members">Members</a> will see the logic of the argument. What the hon. and gallant Gentleman is trying to do, whether he admits it or not, is to deprive <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_China">Communist China</a> of any means whatever of helping in its own defence against air attacks from the piratical Government established by General Chiang Kai-shek in Formosa. That is what he has been arguing, and that is the logic and the meaning of it, and we may as well face it.</p> <p>
I do not want to continue to debate this point at any length. I want to finish on another point. I hope, by the way, that this discussion will convince my hon. Friends on this side, and particularly my right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a>, that the time has gone by, and very long gone by, when we should have had a really full-scale Debate on these enormously important issues which affect the whole of the Far East. I hope my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=8" title="The government chief whip, whose official title is parliamentary secretary..." class="glossary">Chief Whip</a>, who has now resumed his seat on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>, will convey those sentiments to the Leader of the House so that we may have such a Debate before very long.</p> <p>
The subject upon which I wish to conclude is this. In all these important matters, we have to make up our minds on one great central issue. We have to make up our minds whether, in this enormously difficult matter of putting a measure to the advance of Communism in the Far East and elsewhere, it is a wise and statesmanlike thing to meet it everywhere with an <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> that can only be a vain opposition, or whether we should try, as we are trying to do in


China, to establish normal friendly relations which will at least&#8212;[<i>Interruption.</i>] I see that the hon. Member for Northwich (Mr. J. Foster) has now arrived with material to fortify his argument, but I hope that he will not be fortunate enough to catch Mr. <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>'s eye until I have departed for lunch.</p> <p>
My point was that we have to make up our minds whether it is the wise and statesmanlike thing in the situation, not only in the Far East but throughout the world <i>vis-&#224;-vis</i> Communism and Communist Powers, to try to detach them from the central Communist Power of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Russia">Soviet Russia</a> by maintaining friendly relations with them so far as that is possible and giving them the friendly help which they are entitled to expect from us, or whether we should maintain towards them an attitude of open or concealed hostility, refusing to have any kind of normal relations with them and refusing them the technical and other assistance which they require from us, therefore forcing them willy-nilly more strongly and more closely into the orbit of Soviet influence.</p> <p>
That is the decision we have to make. I have no hesitation at all about the direction of my choice. I am all for friendly relations, for establishing contact and for co-operating in raising the social and economic conditions of the peoples of the Far East who have now succumbed to the Communist dogma. I believe that to be the only real and effective way in which we can finally erect a barrier against the continuous spread of Communist influence.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>His Majesty's Government have recognised <i>de jure</i> the Communist <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China">Government of China</a>, but so far the Communist Government of China have not been able to decide whether


they should recognise His Majesty's Government. That is hardly a very good reciprocal gesture of friendship on their part. If the hon. Member will refresh his memory as to the relationship between the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Powers">Western Powers</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a> and its satellites during the last four and a half or five years, he will find that the many acts of hostility, both open and covert, which have been committed have not been committed on this side of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Curtain">Iron Curtain</a>, whether it be here or in the Far East.</p> <p>
I hope that when he replies the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of State will so frame his speech as to deal with one or two specific points. This <a href="/glossary/?gl=119" title="An adjournment debate is a short half hour debate that is introduced by a..." class="glossary">Adjournment Debate</a> should not become a lawyers' field day because, although the legal position is important, much wider points are at issue than these. First of all, if it is necessary for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_of_Hong_Kong">Colony of Hong Kong</a> to introduce legislation to prohibit the despatch of spare parts or, still more important, the aircraft from the Colony to Communist hands, I should like to know whether the right hon. Gentleman anticipated this position, whether he has been in communication with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Hong_Kong">Governor of Hong Kong</a> and whether he has given any advice; or has he just sat back and done nothing at all until this extremely difficult situation has arisen?</p> <p>
Secondly, while we all wish to carry out both the letter and the spirit of international agreements and obligations on any legal point, I have not noticed that the Communists, either in Asia or in Europe, have been over-meticulous in carrying out international obligations in relation to British subjects who have been put under arrest and accused of fantastic charges. I have not noticed any legal observance 'of the Soviet obligations in respect of the clauses of various peace treaties, notably those which concern the Balkan countries. We ought, therefore, to be a little careful how widely we interpret our own legal obligations in respect of the Communist-controlled Government of China.</p> <p>
I also hope that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_State">Minister of State</a> will frame his reply against the general background of the cold war, because it is no good denying that there is a cold war which is splitting the world in two. Happily at this end of the world the war is still cold, but in Malaya and elsewhere

it is far from cold. To allow these aircraft and the spare parts for them&#8212;whether they be civil or military is really splitting hairs at this juncture against the background of the extremely tense situation&#8212;to be dispatched without any attempt to hold them up pending further clarification of the legal position, seems to be most unwise.</p> <p>
What sort of effect will this action&#8212;or inaction&#8212;on the part of the Government have upon the United States, the Dominions, the British troops so gallantly fighting in Malaya and the unfortunate planters and other inhabitants of Malaya who go in daily fear of their lives? What sort of impression is this going to make on the morale of the civilian population in Hong Kong? It is easy enough for us here, thousands of miles away, to talk about friendly relations, but it is quite a different matter for those who are living in close contact with Communist forces, or Communist-controlled forces, and know what banditry and kidnapping mean.</p> <p>
I should like the Minister to address himself to the psychological effect of the inaction of His Majesty's Government. One cannot put a cold war into watertight departments. One cannot separate the plan in Malaya from the plan in China or in Burma or any other theatre. They all fit together. The pieces of the mosaic make one whole pattern. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Only">The Only</a> way to combat these tactics is for His Majesty's Government and the United States and the Dominions to get together and work out a similar plan of co-ordination. That is just what His Majesty's Government have not done, otherwise we should not have got into this extremely humiliating position of offering unilateral recognition to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_China">Communist China</a>&#8212;to the dismay of the United States and the Dominions&#8212;without, in turn, receiving recognition ourselves. Will the Minister of State address himself to these points, with particular reference to the release of aircraft and spare parts, because that is part and parcel of the same sorry story?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>The hon. Gentleman is entitled to his view, but I claimed from Mr. <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, and I think I had his agreement at the time, that so much had been said by Friends of the hon. Gentleman about the general issue of the situation in the Far East that the matter could be referred to from this side of the House. I am intervening because the Debate has run along that course.</p> <p>
I suggest that in all Chinese issues in the last half century this country, for the most part, has been embarking upon policies that very soon after it discovered to be entirely mistaken and it has had to retrace its steps. I became convinced of that truth a good many years ago when I sat on the Committee upstairs that dealt with the Boxer indemnity from China. We had imposed on China conditions of which we became ashamed, and we were very glad to retrace our steps and make available to the Chinese the indemnity that we had sought to extract from them earlier.</p> <p>
I feel that, with the type of argument they have pursued today, hon. Gentlemen opposite are making just the same sort of mistake about China. Later on, some Government will have to undo that mistake. For example, in their desire to condemn the Communists and to call us to a policy that will deal with the Communists as outcasts, hon. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members">Members</a> opposite forget entirely that in their military reactions, not merely in Russia but in China, the Communists are actuated by the conditions from which they them-

selves suffer. I am entirely in accord with the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Mr. J. Paton) that we ought not to connive at the situation in China for a moment.</p> <p>
The situation is that a Government, which is now an outcast Government on an island off the shores of China, is endeavouring to build up an aerial force to be used in acts of banditry&#8212;let us make no mistake about it&#8212;against the Government which we have admitted to be responsible for China. I repeat that we should not connive at that for a moment, but hon. Gentlemen opposite, either directly or indirectly, by their constant innuendos against Communism in Asia, fail to recognise that, at its worst, Communism in Asia is the result of a policy that is being pursued in Formosa. On all sides of the House we should make it quite clear that we cannot support that policy for a moment.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>It is not necessary for the purpose of my argument. All I know is that what is taking place in Formosa at present is an attempt by a Government, which we no longer admit to be the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China">Government of China</a>, to win the position by force. And they are using that detestable kind of force which our people deeply resented when it was used against this country. It is a kind of force that always will be resented. Because of that attitude in Formosa the people and Government of China take an attitude very different from that expressed today by hon. Gentlemen opposite.</p> <p>
I know that it is necessary for us to be very careful what we say when we speak about this matter. I know the Americans are taking a different point of view from the one I am expressing. For example, I know that they look with a greater element of sympathy than I can look upon what I call the bandit government of Formosa. I know that where China is concerned they feel the need to proceed with care in the matter of the future development of international policy. But I still think that it is necessary to protest so vigorously from these Benches&#8212;and


I had hoped that hon. Gentlemen opposite would have seen it to be necessary&#8212;that even Chiang Kai-shek might understand.</p> <p>
Someone said just now that he was not likely to be influenced very much by anything said by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North. I think he would be influenced if there were a united expression from all Benches in this House that we cannot approve for a moment an attempt to undermine the Communist Government of China by reverting to war and methods of violence and force. That is all the more important in view of the mistakes and wickedness for which Communism has become responsible in the East. I agree that the Communists have put themselves out of court by many of the actions which they have pursued, but I maintain that they are out of court very largely because of the things from which they have suffered. We have to make an all round approach to this problem if a new situation is to be induced in China and in the East generally.</p> <p>
I realise that I cannot expect right hon. Gentlemen on the Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> to say very much about this, but I do maintain that if we are to get a new situation in China it will not depend very much on what happens in the matter of spare parts for aeroplanes. That is a very small matter. The big issue in China at the moment is: how are the people to be fed? Never mind the spare parts. How are we to get food to the people of China? Any <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_in_China">Government in China</a>, whether a Communist Government or the Chiang Kai-shek Government, which could obtain our help in alleviating that situation&#8212;and that is the main problem in China today&#8212;would be far more likely to be won into friendly and better relations with us than by our insistence on ascertaining what has happened to the spare parts of aeroplanes.</p> <p>
Hon. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members">Members</a> have suggested that we are being watched very carefully by America, by the Malay people and by our Dominions. We are, but I believe that if we could direct our attention along the lines I am suggesting&#8212;and, as far as I can make out, the Government intend to do so&#8212;we would be far nearer than we are at the moment to a peaceful solution of the problems in the East. I am sure

the Government intend to act on those lines if possible. If my hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of State cannot say very much about this question I appreciate the limitations of a Debate of this sort. I hope that the time will soon come when we shall be able to debate in full the whole issue of the East, and the policy we ought to adopt towards the Communists if we are to have friendly relations with them.</p>            </div>

The hon. and learned Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget) tried to restrict the scope of this Debate by what we all regard as a lot of legal "falderals." Then the Minister made two propositions. First of all, he said that the matter is


<i>sub judice.</i> I think he is wrong. It is not possible to argue that matter now, but I ask him to examine his own conscience after the Debate as to whether he is right or not. Secondly, he had the effrontery to state that the matter is the subject of legislation. When I asked him a specific question, he continued his objection. I went out to get a lot of books, and when I came back I found that he had recanted. I suppose he had heard that I was getting some ammunition from the Library.</p> <p>
Surely he should agree that when he makes a statement which is accepted by the Chair he should be doubly careful. It is monstrous that he should try to restrict the scope of the Debate by saying that the matter is the subject of legislation, when he ought to have known&#8212;I do not say he must have known&#8212;that that argument was not valid. If he does not apologise to this House for having said that, I shall think very much less of him. He may have apologised when I was away from the Chamber,</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>The hon. Gentleman still does not apologise. He made an objection to your predecessor, Mr. Deputy-<a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>. He said that this Debate could not go on because the matter is <i>sub judice,</i> and it is the subject of legislation. That point of order very nearly won the day and he nearly succeeded in his object of depriving the House of the opportunity of discussing this important subject. He still has not apologised for raising a false point of order. I do not expect he will. I think it is monstrous. He has a special duty to the Chair to be very careful when making statements which are accepted by the Chair, and to be quite sure that those statements are correct. He should check his statements and he should be doubly careful. It is only when the matter developed and it became clear that he was going to be exposed that I understand he recanted. I make that protest because Ministers should realise that on points of order they must not be partisan. The Chair and the House expect their statements to be accurate.</p> <p>
We all ought to be indebted to my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Air-Commodore Harvey) for raising this matter. The question is

whether aircraft and spare parts should be made available to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_China">Communist China</a> and, therefore, directly or indirectly to Russia. I agree with a good deal of what was said by the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. J. Hudson), but this Debate is not concerned with any attempt by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members">Members</a> on either side to support acts of banditry. The question is whether the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> thinks that the ban which exists in the West against allowing the Russians to obtain materials of war&#8212;and I include aeroplanes and spare parts in that category&#8212;should be extended to the Far East. Surely that must be so, because if it is logical in the West it is logical in the East.</p> <p>
All that we on this side are doing is to raise the question whether the Minister can prevent this equipment from going to the Russian side. There is no question of taking sides as between Chiang Kai-shek's Government and the Communists. We have recognised the Communist Government, but we must be realistic about the matter. We can make a friendly gesture and assist the millions of starving people in China, but hon. Members opposite must surely agree that it is unwise to allow the Communist China-Russia alliance to benefit from valuable spare parts and aeroplanes.</p> <p>
That is the simple question in this Debate. It is no good the hon. Member for Ealing, North, trying to score a point against hon. Members on this side by suggesting that we are advocating acts of banditry on the part of the government based in Formosa. That is not the question. We are saying that equipment situated in Hong Kong should not be allowed to go to the Russians; that is what it boils down to. Of course, I appreciate what the Minister said about there being very difficult diplomatic matters involved and I think it behoves us not to complicate the task, except for raising the simple question which has already been raised.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> probably knows that in dealing with the Communist r&#232;gime we have to steer a course between, on the one hand, being firm and, on the other hand, never closing the door completely to some understanding, perhaps on a very high level. It is no good trying to placate Communist r&#232;gimes by giving way here or there. What they understand is a firm policy with a definite objective, and our


objective and our policy with regard to the points which are the subject of this Debate, namely, spare parts and aeroplanes, should be to keep them on British territory so that they do not fall into the hands of the Russians. That is quite plain and it will not exacerbate the feelings of the Russians or of the people in this country&#8212;</p>            </div>

There is only one thing I think I should add. I think the argument used by the hon. Member for Ealing, North, is a little dangerous. I accept the view that he is unalterably opposed to Communism, but he uses the argument that Communism in China is accounted for by the very low standard of living and the terrible conditions which obtain in that country. That may or may not be true, but it is not an argument which should be used to affect our policy.</p> <p>
Perhaps he can explain historically that the situation which obtained in China, where the social standard of the population was not high enough, was the main reason for the rise of Communism, but that is quite irrelevant when we are deciding whether we shall let them have spare parts and aeroplanes. The Communist r&#232;gime is there, we know it is allied to the Russians and we know that the Russian r&#232;gime is a menace to democracy, freedom and the peace of the world. We hope that the Russians will see reason and will ultimately come to some agreement with us; but in the meantime, as long as they do not, it is our job to see that they do not get either materials of war or materials which could be used for war purposes. That is the simple issue which has been raised so usefully by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Macclesfield.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I am not so sure that the issue is quite as simple as the hon. Member for Northwich (Mr. J. Foster) has made out. The point which he puts is this, that it is our business to prevent arms likely to be used by Communist Powers from falling into the hands of the enemy. Of all the places in the world about which to discuss this

issue, we choose Hong Kong! I can imagine no <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a> in the world which is less defensible from a military or a strategic point of view, yet to this isolated little outpost in the Far East presumably we have sent quite a substantial amount of military material and, if the policy of hon. and gallant Gentlemen opposite is carried to its logical conclusion, we shall send more war material in the future. For what purpose? Inevitably to fall into the hands of the Communist enemy.</p> <p>
One would think that we had never lost Hong Kong. What happened to all the stores of materials which went into Hong Kong during the war with the Japanese? What happened to the British soldiers who were in Hong Kong? Inevitably we found, when it developed into a major war, that they were lost. Some of my constituents were imprisoned in Hong Kong. Scots soldiers were imprisoned as a result of being locked up in Hong Kong and vast amounts of military equipment in the last war fell into the hands of the Japanese. Presumably, indeed, some has even filtered through to Malaya to be used to kill Scots soldiers there.</p>            </div>

I hope it will not. I do not say for a moment that the hon. Member for Northwich wants war, but I say that the logical outcome of all this insistent propaganda about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_and_West">East and West</a> will inevitably lead to the possibility of war.</p> <p>
We have heard that American opinion is exercised about this matter, but that, surely, is rather curious because America has already tried the experiment of arming the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_Government">Nationalist Government</a> of China. I understand that the greater part of the enormous modern military equipment which was used by the Nationalist forces in China was supplied to Chiang Kai-shek by the Americans


and was captured by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communists">Chinese Communists</a>. I need only remind hon. and gallant <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members">Members</a> opposite that the guns which were used in the shelling of the "Amethyst" were captured by the Chinese Communists from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Nationalists">Chinese Nationalists</a>. I submit that when America has been forced to recognise that it is no longer possible to arm the Chinese Nationalists, we should by no means be taking much account of what reactionary opinion in America may think about this question of Hong Kong.</p>            </div>

Mr. Deputy-<a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, that it takes one Scotsman to understand another. I have no doubt that the point I was making would have penetrated into the mind of the hon. and gallant Member for Macclesfield at a later stage of my argument, but I am obliged to you. Surely there is nothing far-fetched in that analogy. We are dealing with our attitude towards a Government which has been captured by the Communists, and we now know that in that war we sent a very large amount of military equipment to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Whites">Russian Whites</a> which was duly captured by the Russian Reds. I submit that that historical lesson should be very carefully appreciated by the House before it agrees, by silence or argument, to support what the hon. and gallant Member for Lewes (Major Beamish) called "the background." We are not so interested in the technical or the legal question here, and people outside do not appreciate the fine point of Order raised by the hon. and learned Gentleman; and certainly it will not be appreciated by the Chinese.</p> <p>
What we have to remember is that when the reports of this Debate are read in Hong Kong&#8212;there are British newspapers published there&#8212;the Communists there will read the arguments adduced by the hon. and gallant Gentleman and suppose that in this House the argument is being used that Hong Kong is a base in the strategy of the cold war, and that it is being used as a base against the Communists in China. That is an exceedingly dangerous assumption. I do not know whether the hon. and gallant Member for Macclesfield quite realises what this means. I, for one, do not believe that we should let it go out to the world that we are arguing that Hong Kong should be used as a base for distributing arms to the people engaged in fighting Communism in China.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>Oh, well, now we are getting on. The hon. and gallant Gentleman agrees that we should not supply arms to either side engaged in the cold war. As we appear to be also in the cold war, the hon. and gallant Gentleman is gradually being converted to the point of view put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Mr. J. Hudson) and me. We cannot have a war against Communism without arms. I understand that the hon. and gallant Gentleman now agrees we should not supply arms to either side, and I am hopeful that the arguments that I have been adducing have at last penetrated.</p> <p>
I want to know when we are coming out of Hong Kong. I do not believe that, from a military point of view, Hong Kong can possibly be defended. I look with some alarm, from the point of view of the British taxpayers, at the amount of money being spent in Hong Kong. If it comes within the purview of the reply that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> is to make, I should like to ask a question about the aerodrome in Hong Kong. How much money is being spent on it? I understand that the hon. and gallant Member for Macclesfield has argued at <a href="/glossary/?gl=25" title="Question Time is an opportunity for MPs and Members of the House of Lords..." class="glossary">Question time</a> that we are not spending enough. I should prefer that the money being spent in Hong Kong&#8212;as I believe, being wasted in Hong Kong&#8212;to be spent more profitably on airfields in this country. I can mention one that is near your <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, Mr. Deputy-<a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, and mine. I should like to see the money spent on the aerodrome at Prestwick, rather than being invested in a very precarious manner in Hong Kong. Then we have our soldiers in Hong Kong. I have failed to elicit from any Minister exactly the cost of our military preparations in Hong Kong at the present time.</p> <p>
I share the view of the hon. Member for Ealing, North, that we are not taking up the right attitude towards the Communist <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China">Government of China</a>, and that we are not justified in inflicting pinpricks. We have to remember that the Chinese are entitled to patriotic feelings, too. What would the hon. and gallant Mem-

ber for Macclesfield say if the Chinese were in the Isle of Wight?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I do not know whether the British colony in Hong Kong is entitled to speak for the great <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of the people in Hong Kong. However, I am trying to get the hon. and gallant Gentleman to put himself in the position of patriotic Chinese. Geographically speaking, Hong Kong is related to China in the same way as the Isle of Wight is related to Britain. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese">The Chinese</a> see in Hong Kong what they regard as a foreign Power.</p> <p>
I quite agree that the Chinese have everything to gain by retaining Hong Kong as a trading centre, and I believe that the Chinese have everything to gain by retaining their commercial association with the people of this country; but from the trading point of view I do suggest that a trade agreement with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_People">Chinese People</a>'s Government would be immensely more valuable than trying to pretend that, in the event of a world war, we could possibly hold the Island of Hong Kong against the Chinese, when we could not hold it against the Japanese. That is the reality.</p> <p>
There has been expressed in this Debate a policy of pinpricks. Whether we like Communism in China or not, whether we like <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism_in_Russia">Communism in Russia</a> or not, the fact is that it is there. It would be an immense undertaking, which this country could not afford, to let this cold war develop into a hot war. We cannot even contemplate the possibility of using Hong Kong in a war with the People's <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China">Government of China</a>. I emphasise what was said by the hon. Member for Ealing, North&#8212;that we should in every way possible make it clear to the Chinese that we have abandoned the old fashioned policy of imperialism, that we have


abandoned it in India, and that we are going to abandon it in China. When the Chinese understand that, a way will be open for peace and understanding between the two peoples, as the people of goodwill in all countries earnestly desire, and as they also desire an end to the cold war and its frightful possibilities.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Debate">The Debate</a> seems, as was probably intended, to have gone very wide of the original subject. I do think that what has just been said by the hon. Member for Ayrshire, South (Mr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emrys_Hughes">Emrys Hughes</a>) should not go un-contradicted. Purely from the point of view of the Chinese people in Hong Kong, the worst thing that could happen would be for Britain to get out of Hong Kong. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nationalist">The Nationalist</a> forces control an area of sea far around, and they have a fair number of aircraft, and Hong Kong would immediately become a focal point of attack by the Chinese Nationalist forces. There would be chaos. There would also be destruction of great British interests&#8212;apart altogether from imperialism&#8212;legitimate commercial interests that we have there, which, however they were built up, are of great importance to this country in the economic scheme of things.</p> <p>
But to go back to the main point. I really think that the argument is a little far fetched, that a few cases of aeroplanes and spare parts or something of the kind ought not to be permitted to go through because of their potential value to Russia. This really is carrying the argument to an absurd conclusion. We hear constantly complaints, apparently well founded, about the terrific aircraft industry that Russia has. The implication, that a few cases going through Hong Kong would be of material benefit to Russia, just does not hold water.</p> <p>
What is important is that we have recognised as the <i>de facto</i> Goernment&#8212;not the <i>de jure</i> Government&#8212;of China the Chinese Communist People's Government. I am satisfied that if we had adopted a different attitude to Russia in 1917, the affairs of Europe might have gone in a different mould. We do not want the same sort of thing to happen again. It is these prejudices that we are worried about. We have recognised the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>, as we have been obliged to, because it is the only efficient Government, and the best thing to do is

to be on the most friendly relations with them that we possibly can. If the Chinese people want it, it is their affair in the last analysis.</p> <p>
It may be argued that the Chinese Communist Government do not want to be friendly with us. We have a lot of sniping going on in Britain and in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>, and these things are obviously noticed by the Chinese people. It is not much good holding out the hand of friendship, with a fist clenched behind one's back. That is the sort of prejudice created by the type of controversial speeches which we hear against the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_People">Chinese People</a>'s Government. I think that it is wrong to regard <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_China">Communist China</a> as being entirely and necessarily within the sphere of influence of Russia. It will be if we continue, while pretending friendship, to act in an unfriendly manner. We have to do the best that we can. It is a pity that an issue which is relatively small has been raised in order to indicate that there is a good deal of prejudice against the present only real and legitimate <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_in_China">Government in China</a>.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>The hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrshire_South">Ayrshire South</a> (Mr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emrys_Hughes">Emrys Hughes</a>) asked "How would we feel if the Isle of Wight was Chinese?" I should say that the answer would entirely depend upon the circumstances. If instead of having good-humoured controversy across the Floor of this House, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party">Conservative Party</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party">Labour Party</a> were engaged in shooting each other up all over the country, and we had a number of wars between neighbouring constituencies, then I think that everybody in England would be grateful for an island where law and order was maintained, where people who wanted a little peace could find sanctuary, and where the essential trade of both sides could be provided for.</p> <p>
That is really the position of Hong Kong so far as China is concerned. In circumstances of anarchy, there has been a sanctuary of good order, a place where people whose lives were otherwise forfeit and would be like hunted beasts can live in peace, and where all the various areas of China can find an entry for their trade. I think that the general run of Chinese have every reason to be grateful for our long presence in Hong Kong. Let us remember


that this is not any recent thing. In fact my grandfather was a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Hong_Kong">Governor of Hong Kong</a>.</p> <p>
The next point which my hon. Friend made is, I think, an extremely varied one. There is no better way of arming Communists than by attempting to arm weak nationalist or semi-quisling organisations. I remember a good many years ago when we were sending arms to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_China">Nationalist China</a>. I was a great deal interested to know how the arms got there. I was told by someone, whose name I shall not mention but of very good authority, that there was no difficulty about that at all&#8212;the arms went through the Japanese lines. I said, "Isn't that a little curious?" He said, "Not at all; the Japanese generals fully understand that generals must live, and they know that no Chinese general would be fool enough to use them against them." That was the sort of situation we had, and one which we do not want to repeat.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>This was about 1940, very shortly before the Japanese entered the war against us, when they were busy fighting the Chinese. I had it on good authority. If the hon. and gallant Gentleman wishes, I will tell him privately where I got it.</p> <p>
With regard to this particular issue of the aeroplanes, I do not think that the hon. and gallant Gentleman has done a service by raising it. It is a very awkward situation indeed. It is awkward diplomatically. One has to weigh the considerations of a good many businesses of ours in China which we hope will survive. We have to weigh the importance of the rule of war. We have to weigh relations with America&#8212;all sorts of awkward questions&#8212;and I do not think that the situation is in the least improved by it being discussed here. I very much hope that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will decline resolutely to say a word about these aeroplanes, because I do not think that a Government statement in this House on the subject, at this point, when the matter is before the courts in Hong Kong, can do anything but harm.</p> <p>
Finally, there is one thing which I think wants clearing up. It is again a statement by my hon. Friend below the Gang-

way which ought not go out unchallenged, and that is the statement that Hong Kong is indefensible; that we lost it to the Japanese and it is only a question of again losing it to the Chinese Communist. That, I am convinced, is quite untrue. The situation in defending Hong Kong when we have command of the sea and air superiority, even if it be a carrier-borne air superiority, is wholly different from an attempt to defend Hong Kong without either sea or air superiority.</p>            </div>

No serious-minded person the moment that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbour">Pearl Harbour</a> affair happened and sea power was lost in the Pacific, even thought that it was remotely possible to hold Hong Kong. On the other hand, when we have sea and air power there, I can only say that people who are in a very good position to know something about the defence of Hong Kong have told me that they have not the slightest doubt that they can hold it against any forces the Communists can put against it.</p> <p>
We all hope that we shall be able to settle down with the Chinese and that they will not in fact come under Russian domination, that it will be a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communism">Chinese Communism</a> which will probably develop on quite different lines to European Communism, and that it will be possible to get decent neighbourly relations. We shall not immediately, but we hope that it will settle down on those lines, and that there will not be any war. But do not let it go out from here that we have any doubt at all that we can hold Hong Kong if there is a war, because all the information I have received is that we can.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I do not want to be drawn into that, because any attempt at this moment to criticise another Power, with whom I hope we may enter into early and protracted negotiations about the peace of the world, might exacerbate the situation&#8212;whatever may be our individual thoughts&#8212;and might indeed prove unhelpful. The point I want to make is a positive one: that as far as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_in_Hong_Kong">British in Hong Kong</a> are concerned, it is the policy of our Government, not only to have harmonious relations with the coloured and native peoples all over the world, but also to enter into association with them for the mutual benefit of this country and themselves, on the basis of trade and of improving their general standard of life and conditions. That is reciprocal, and will not only confer good upon them, but will also help our own country.</p> <p>
The policy of the Government in many places&#8212;in India for example&#8212;has been far-seeing and admirable. At one fell swoop we gave to 400 million Indian people the right to be independent, and at the same time of their own volition to come into the Commonwealth&#8212;a stroke which I think history will confirm as one of the grandest and finest gestures any Government could have made, and which will be entirely vindicated with the passage of time.</p> <p>
As to the Chinese people, it is a moot question to what degree a country like China, with perhaps 400 or 500 million

people, backward mechanically and scientifically, would be susceptible to Communist propaganda. The fact remains that, this Government, and indeed public opinion in this country outside the Government, have taken a realistic view of the situation, and decided to recognise at any rate the present Communist <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China">Government of China</a>, not on the basis of their Communism, but on the basis of the situation&#8212;namely, that they are there&#8212;<i>J'y suis, j'y reste.</i> We must recognise that.</p> <p>
On the other hand, I have seen in some weekly papers criticisms of our good friends the United States in respect of the help they are alleged to have given to General Chiang Kai-shek, who I understand has his headquarters in Formosa. There were criticisms&#8212;I do not know to what extent they were justified&#8212;that the General was using American aid or money, or hoped to, for the purpose of bombing helpless Chinese. That is a question upon which we have not a lot of information. Whatever sympathies there may be in this House for General Chiang Kai-shek, he is no longer a potent force; and, whether we like it or not, we must recognise the facts as they are&#8212;that almost a quarter of the people of the world, are under a form of Government which has been largely established throughout the whole of China.</p> <p>
I do not often share the opinions of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Northampton, but for once in a while I agree with him that there seems to be no immediate cause for pessimism because a preponderance of Chinese people have one form of Government, and that jutting out like a peninsula&#8212;I am not sure of the exact geographical description of Hong Kong&#8212;</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>Well, very often a point of view which is put forward at a carefully timed and strategic moment&#8212;suddenly thrust forward, as it were&#8212;may have an ulterior motive, apart from the intrinsic merit of the proposal. On the broad issue that the people in high authority should get together for the purpose of making more secure the peace of the world, I think most intelligent people, in these islands at any rate, would be in accord. The part that Britain can usefully play would be to do all she can, consistent with her legitimate and rightful interests, in seeing that peace is maintained between the leading Powers of the world, for if we do not take that point of view it is quite obvious we must throw up our hands in utter despair and disavow our faith in mankind.</p> <p>
On the other hand, I do not necessarily take that pessimistic point of view. We should be eternally vigilant and bear in mind all these complexities, but at the same time, if we spread the idea that all Communists must necessarily be wicked and evil, that they are people who cannot be trusted, and that everything anti-Communist must, by the same process of reasoning, be pure, unalloyed and sincere, then I think we are overstating the case on both sides. I am not a Communist although I have been wrongly accused of being tarnished by that creed. I recognise, however, that sooner or later there are <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members">Members</a> in this House who


will be very pleased to enter into negotiations with Communists to ensure a respite, at any rate, from the present intolerable position.</p> <p>
I do not claim any particular knowledge, unlike other. Members whose faculty of self-appreciation is inordinately well-pronounced and often in inverse ratio to their knowledge of the subject but I have endeavoured to put a point of view, in a very humble capacity, that is worthy of consideration and may commend itself to a few enlightened people, whom we hope still exist in this confused world. We have to get down to this matter instead of scoring cheap debating points. The issue is above party. It is an issue for mankind, an issue for the future, and an issue for the whole world to take seriously to heart.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>This Debate has covered a very wide field, and it is right that it should, being an Adjournment discussion, but I am afraid that I do not intend to stray into all the topics that have been raised. I do not intend, for instance, to discuss at great length the question of Prestwick or whether Hong Kong or the Isle of Wight is an island or a peninsula. On the general question, I think that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget) has expressed most admirably the reasons why it is essential that we should remain in Hong Kong, and why it is desirable that we should remain there. I will only say that the Government have never at any time, and do not contemplate now, leaving Hong Kong. There is no question whatever about that.</p> <p>
The hon. and gallant Member for Macclesfield (Air-Commodore Harvey) said that the departments in Hong Kong had carried out their duties in a negative way. That is not so. They have carried them out in a strictly judicial way and have not tried to be on one side or the other, and it is right that that should be so. The hon. Member for Windsor (Mr. Mott-Radclyffe) said that they had made friendly gestures to the Communists. That is totally untrue. They have made no more friendly gestures to them than to the American companies. They have been perfectly fair on both sides.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I am very glad to hear that.</p> <p>
The hon. Member for Northwich (Mr. J. Foster) said that we must keep these aeroplanes from the Russians. I gather that he thought that this was our principal duty. I am surprised to hear that coming from him as a lawyer, because I think our principal duty is the vitally important one of preserving something which we in England and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire">British Empire</a> are very proud of, and that is the rule of law. We think that is of vital importance, even in such a matter as the cold war, because if it once becomes known that the rule of law in this country does not matter, that people do not mind about it and are abrogating it, it will be a major loss apart from any other losses.</p> <p>
The hon. Member for Windsor said the question of whether these planes were military or civil was splitting hairs. I submit that it is not. It is very important that these are civil planes and not military planes. I have no doubt that any aeroplane can be used to drop something out of it, but all <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members">Members</a> will agree that there is a fundamental difference between civil and military aeroplanes. Not only is that so, but the law deals with the export of ammunition and arms, and civil planes do not come into that category.</p> <p>
I think it might be as well, in view of the discussion that has taken place, if I were to give a purely factual statement as to the situation regarding these aeroplanes. Some 70 civil aircraft have been grounded at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Tak">Kai Tak</a> aerodrome in Hong Kong for the last four months. They have been the subject of litigation in the courts of the Colony between certain employees of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_National_Aviation_Corporation">China National Aviation Corporation</a> and Central Air Transport, a department of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>, and persons representing the interests of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_People">Chinese People</a>'s Government, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, persons representing the interests


of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Nationalists">Chinese Nationalists</a> and certain United States interests who, on 12th December, which is since the proceedings were begun, signed a contract with the then Chinese Government purporting to purchase all the Corporations assets. The employees, since the commencement of the proceedings, have been in physical possession of the aircraft on the airfield. They claim to hold them on behalf of the Chinese Government.</p> <p>
Injunctions restraining both sides from removing the aircraft were imposed by the courts, but these injunctions were lifted following a ruling by the courts on 23rd February that the property was in the possession and control of the Chinese People's Government, and that it would be a violation of the immunity of a foreign sovereign power to make an order directing that the property in its possession and control should be delivered over to a receiver appointed by the courts. The courts based this finding on the fact that the aircraft were in the physical control of employees who declared that they held them on behalf of the Chinese People's Government and accepted orders from high officials of that Government.</p> <p>
Since then, an appeal against the courts' decision has been lodged by the side representing the Chinese Nationalists and United States interests, and the hearing has been fixed for 28th April. In the meantime, the aircraft are still at Hong Kong. Applications for further injunctions against their removal were refused by the Hong Kong court on 28th March. That is the position at present. The Government have no intention of taking any steps in this case, beyond those designed to ensure that their obligations under the Hong Kong law and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Convention">Chicago Convention</a> of International Civil Aviation, as well as under international law in general, are complied with. It would be highly improper for the Government to make any attempt to influence the Hong Kong courts in regard to a matter under consideration by them, or to take any executive action which could be justifiably interpreted by either side as partial.</p> <p>
The situation in regard to these aircraft is, I understand, one that is entirely without precedent. There has never been anything remotely resembling

it before. They are affected by the Chicago Convention and the Air Navigation Orders of Hong Kong. So complex is this question that we are taking legal advice, and until that legal advice has been given we are not absolutely certain as to the exact interpretation of this extremely complicated matter. We feel that it would be improper to do anything other than leave the situation as it is now, and that is that the aeroplanes and the equipment shall remain subject to the decision of the courts on 28th April. If we do that, we consider we shall be doing our best to maintain the rule of law, and that is the most important aspect of the whole case.</p>            </div>

It might have been realised by both sides that this question might arise. It was not realised apparently, and the situation was allowed to drift on. It would have been very much better if it had been realised at an early date, but that was not the case with either of the parties concerned. As regards His Majesty's Government taking legal advice, this is a matter which has to be carefully, slowly and deliberately considered, and we are, in fact, taking opinion on it.

It relates to this question of the aircraft spares and stores. I understood from what he said that the aircraft would be remaining on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Island">Hong Kong Island</a> until some further decision was taken by the courts. But he did not make it clear whether these spares and valuable stores are going to be shipped away, partly by the Communists. Perhaps the Minister would completely stay further activity on the aircraft and stores until some decision has been taken as a result of the legal advice now being sought.</p>            </div>
