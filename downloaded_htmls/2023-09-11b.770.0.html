As you would expect me to say, it would therefore be inappropriate for me to comment on any specific aspect of the active investigation itself. I would, however, point the House to what the Metropolitan police said in their own statement:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b763.1/4">&#8216;The investigation is being carried out by officers from the Met&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_Terrorism_Command">Counter Terrorism Command</a>, which has responsibility for investigations relating to allegations of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Secrets_Act">Official Secrets Act</a> and espionage-related offences&#8217;.</p> <p pid="b763.1/5">Of course, any decision on whether to proceed with a prosecution under the Official Secrets Act, and related legislation, would be a matter for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prosecution_Service">Crown Prosecution Service</a>.</p> <p pid="b763.1/6">It remains an absolute priority for the Government to take all necessary steps to protect the United Kingdom from any foreign state activity which seeks to undermine our national security, prosperity and democratic values. The Government have been clear that China represents a systemic challenge to the United Kingdom and to our values. That has been evidenced in China&#8217;s continued disregard for universal human rights and international commitments in Xinjiang, its erasure of dissenting voices and stifling of <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> under its new national security law in Hong Kong, and disturbing reports of Chinese coercion and intimidation in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea">South China Sea</a>. We are clear-eyed about that challenge, and we must be able to look the Chinese in the eye and call out unacceptable behaviour directly, just as our <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> was able to do this with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Li">Premier Li</a> at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20">G20</a> summit in New Delhi this weekend&#8212;an approach that has also been taken consistently by our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a> allies.</p> <p pid="b763.1/7">Actions speak louder than words, and that is why I took the decision to instruct departments to cease deployment of all surveillance equipment subject to China&#8217;s national intelligence law from sensitive government sites in November last year. It is one of the reasons why I banned TikTok from government devices; the Government investigated and called out the so-called Chinese overseas police service stations and, as my <a href="/glossary/?gl=214" title="Right Honourable is a form of address used within the House of Commons, for..." class="glossary">right honourable</a> friend the Security <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> set out in a Statement to this House in June, instructed the Chinese embassy to close them; we significantly reduced Chinese involvement in the UK&#8217;s civil nuclear sector, including taking ownership of China&#8217;s stake in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sizewell_C">Sizewell C</a> nuclear power project; and, as Digital Secretary, I took the action to ban Huawei from our 5G networks.</p> <p pid="b763.1/8">This afternoon the Procurement Bill is being debated in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>. The Bill will include national security debarment provisions that will enable us to act when we see malign influence in our public procurement. In taking this approach, we are aligned with our Five Eyes allies and other <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a> partners&#8212;indeed, every single G7 partner.</p> <p pid="b763.1/9"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> will deploy, again, an aircraft carrier to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pacific">Indo-Pacific</a> in 2025; we have announced <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUKUS">AUKUS</a>, a new security partnership that will promote a free and open Indo-Pacific that is secure and stable; and we will work with Italy and Japan through the global combat air programme to adapt and respond to the security threats of the future, through an unprecedented international aerospace coalition.</p> <p pid="b763.1/10">These <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houses_of_Parliament">Houses of Parliament</a> stand as a monument to the freedoms of expression and belief that underpin our values, but just as these institutions have provided the paradigm for so many modern democracies, there are still those who fear such freedoms, and who seek to undermine them and to interfere in our society. We maintain constant vigilance in our efforts to understand and root out that interference, and we will always take action to address it, whatever its source.</p> <p pid="b763.1/11">In 2022, the Government established the Defending Democracy Taskforce, a group that works to co-ordinate across Government to protect the integrity of our democracy from threats of foreign interference. It is engaging across government, with Parliament, the UK&#8217;s intelligence community, the devolved Administrations, local authorities, the private sector and civil society on  the full range of threats facing our democratic institutions. Those threats include any foreign interference in the electoral process, disinformation, physical and cyber threats to democratic institutions and those who represent them, foreign interference in public offices, political parties and our universities, and transnational repression in the United Kingdom.</p> <p pid="b763.1/12">Earlier this year, Parliament passed the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Act">National Security Act</a>, which has overhauled legislation applicable to espionage, sabotage and any persons acting for foreign powers against the safety and interest of the United Kingdom. The measures in the Act will enable our law enforcement and intelligence agencies to deter, detect and disrupt the full range of modern-day threats, including threats from China. New offences in the Act will enable the disruption of illegitimate influence conducted for, or on behalf of, foreign states, whether designed to advance their interests or to harm the United Kingdom. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Government">United Kingdom Government</a> will do whatever it takes to protect our national security and this nation&#8217;s democratic institutions, which have stood for centuries as a beacon of liberty&#8212;from wherever the threat may come.</p> <p pid="b763.1/13">I commend this Statement to the House.&#8221;</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b765.0/1">My Lords, I thank the Lord Privy Seal for repeating the Statement in a timely way on the same day as it was made in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>. I have often said from this <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> that the first duty of any Government is to ensure the safety and security of its citizens, but, when you look at it, it is more than that. In doing so, we must ensure that we uphold the integrity of our democracy and values.</p> <p pid="b765.0/2">I am sure that everyone in your Lordships&#8217; House can recall where they were when we heard the news of the attacks on the twin towers, 22 years ago today. It is an appropriate time to recognise and pay tribute to the work of the intelligence and security agencies, who work alongside the police and other public sector organisations. I thank them for their work to protect us, in which they face unprecedented challenges and risks. Those risks are evolving in size, volatility and complexity. Security threats now appear through threats to our economy and technological systems, at our borders and through interference in our democracy. It is a huge challenge, and our security response must evolve to ensure that it is cohesive, comprehensive and able to adjust to face the changing nature of those threats.</p> <p pid="b765.0/3">In the last week, we have heard of two serious security issues: the escape from prison of a man facing charges for terrorism and the serious allegations of espionage on behalf of China. The police, intelligence agencies and justice system have our support in carrying out their investigations and should be left to do so. That also means that we have to be honest about the challenges faced and mistakes made; we have to recognise where there are gaps and take action to address them.</p> <p pid="b765.0/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_Privy_Seal">The Lord Privy Seal</a> will understand that there is some incredulity that a man suspected of terrorism was able to escape from a category B prison under a van. It is extraordinary that he was in a category B  prison&#8212;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMP_Wandsworth">HMP Wandsworth</a>&#8212;in the first place, that he had access to an area from which he could escape, and that it was not immediately noticed that he had absconded. I doubt that the Lord Privy Seal will be able to answer questions on this matter today, but I am sure that he recognises the importance of those questions that need to be investigated. Can he say whether the review into the security status of national security prisoners has been completed?</p> <p pid="b765.0/5">In response to the arrests made for espionage, there are questions about the actions the Government are taking to combat the threats posed by other states which seek to interfere in our democracy. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI5">MI5</a> issued an alert about Chinese attempts to influence Parliament 20 months ago. Our security services have long warned about interference in our democracy and in our elections, and there have been previous alerts and warnings about foreign actors seeking to penetrate parliamentary security. Can the Lord Privy Seal say anything about the actions they are taking in response to those specific warnings, and are they observed across government by both Ministers and those in their departments?</p> <p pid="b765.0/6">The Lord <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a> mentioned it in his introduction, but I ask the Lord Privy Seal to clarify whether the two men who have been arrested, and, I understand, charged with espionage, have been released on bail.</p> <p pid="b765.0/7">MI5 has also warned about commercial espionage from China, cyber risks and the threat to supply chains. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a> has noted the Government&#8217;s lack of a long-term strategy towards China and is currently waiting for a response to the report it published in July. Can the Lord Privy Seal say anything more today about the specific threat posed by China? Can he more specifically say when the Government&#8217;s response to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC">ISC</a> report will be published?</p> <p pid="b765.0/8">We must be able to work with China on key issues, such as climate change, but at the same time we must protect our national security and oppose attempts to infiltrate our democracy. In your Lordships&#8217; House, we on the Labour Benches introduced an <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> to the National Security Bill to create stronger checks on donations to political parties which would have closed a loophole that allows shell companies to be used to hide political donations. The Government opposed that amendment. Can the Lord Privy Seal explain why, and will the Government now reconsider their position?</p> <p pid="b765.0/9">We know that the threats are not limited to China. For example, we saw the attack from the Russians in Salisbury, and we know there have been further cyberattacks and misinformation campaigns. In response to the shocking and terrible attacks on 9/11, the then <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> created a comprehensive strategy in response to state threats to national security. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> counterterrorism strategy Contest established new links between the counterterrorism police, intelligence agencies and our public services, with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> and the Government at the centre at the helm. The scale of the response that is needed today is certainly no less than that which was needed 22 years ago.</p> <p pid="b765.0/10">We are committed to extending this approach, if we are fortunate enough to be in government, by creating an equivalent strategy today to deal with such state threats. I can assure the Lord Privy Seal that the Government  would have our support if they were to commit to introducing such a strategy and response now. I am not asking him to answer that at the Dispatch Box today, but will he commit to take this back to his <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> colleagues and report back to your Lordships&#8217; House?</p> <p pid="b765.0/11">I end where I started. Nothing is more important in government than ensuring the safety, security and well-being of citizens. To fulfil that obligation, we need the right policies, strategies and collaborations. If we are to protect our democracy, we need to have a strategy in place, but we also need our citizens to have confidence in our democracy if they are to properly and effectively participate in it. This should be a joint endeavour across all parties and both Houses, and I hope the Lord Privy Seal will be able today to reassure us on the actions the Government are taking, and commit to going forward on this in a way that protects our democracy and security and unites the country, rather than creating <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">division</a>.</p>            </div>

            </h2>


                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b767.0/1">My Lords, there are two distinct but related aspects to this Statement. The first relates to the arrest of two people on charges of conducting espionage on behalf of China. The second relates more generally to our posture towards the security risks which China poses to the UK.</p> <p pid="b767.0/2">On the charges, I fully understand why it is inappropriate to comment at this stage. However, I confess to be bemused as to the nature of the spying which the parliamentary researcher might have undertaken. According to media reports, one of his crimes seems to be to have organised regular drinks sessions at a Westminster pub. This may not be a meritorious activity but it is hardly a serious offence. I think everybody will be fascinated to discover, if charges are pursued, exactly what kind of secrets the parliamentary researcher might have had access to. But for today, we must simply compose our souls in patience until further details of any charges emerge.</p> <p pid="b767.0/3">There is the more serious question of whether parliamentarians should have been told about the arrests at an earlier stage, so that they could take particular care in their dealings with China and Chinese entities. It is not clear when the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a> and <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> were aware of this case and why they decided to remain silent about it with parliamentary colleagues. Perhaps the noble Lord the Leader can enlighten us.</p> <p pid="b767.0/4">The broader issue which this case exemplifies relates to our overall posture towards China. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Statement">The Statement</a> says that the Government believe that China presents a systemic challenge to our values. It lists a number of actions which they have taken to counter these challenges, but it fails to convince. In July, Parliament&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a> issued an excoriating report on China which said that the Government do not have a &#8220;clear strategy&#8221; on China and have not devoted sufficient resources to tackling the threat that it posed. The actions listed in today&#8217;s Statement do not constitute such a strategy. The Government should be making protecting our democracy a national security priority&#8212;something, incidentally, which they have already consistently failed to do in respect of Russia&#8212;and accept the recommendations of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC">ISC</a>&#8217;s China report.</p> <p pid="b767.0/5">More generally, the Government&#8217;s record on standing up to China is weak. From the genocide against the Uighurs to Hong Kong, and from Taiwan to interference in our democracy, the Government have failed to take China seriously. The Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> may have meetings in Delhi with his Chinese counterpart, but the suspicion is that he is more interested in trade, rather than these broader concerns.</p> <p pid="b767.0/6">Developing a clear overall approach to China should now be an urgent priority. One specific question which such a strategy must cover is the extent to which we designate China formally as a security threat. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> originally claimed that China was such a threat during the Conservative leadership contest&#8212;and on this we agree&#8212;but since then, he has back-pedalled. The spying case illustrates the broad challenge which China now poses to the UK, yet the Government have failed to take Chinese interference seriously. They surely must now do so.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b768.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful for the general tone of the response. It is invidious to choose, but although I am grateful for the response of the noble Lord, Lord Newby, I am particularly grateful for the very statesmanlike tone of the noble Baroness. I of course underline her tribute to the work of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Service">Security Service</a>, and indeed all the law enforcement services. On the day of 9/11, I was occupying the office which is now that of the Lord Convener, and I remember vividly watching what was going on in a position of disbelief. We must support their work, which sometimes, of its very nature&#8212;often, perhaps normally&#8212;has to be done on a confidential and secret basis. I think all noble Lords understand that matters cannot be avowed and addressed in detail while cases are ongoing.</p> <p pid="b768.0/2">I heard what the noble Baroness said about the prison escape and, fortunately, the individual concerned was recaptured&#8212;after I had had a sleepless night as the police helicopters circled over <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Park">Richmond Park</a>. I did not resent that at all; it was essential that that man be retaken.</p> <p pid="b768.0/3">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=263" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Chancellor" class="glossary">Lord Chancellor</a> certainly said that these matters would be looked into. I shall not expand on that; nor would I want to anticipate where the examination of those events might lead. I will make sure that the Lord <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> is made aware of her comments on that.</p> <p pid="b768.0/4">On the question of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI5">MI5</a>&#8217;s alerts and concerns, of course we are concerned about China. I thought a disappointing aspect of the response from the noble Lord, Lord Newby, was that he rather belittled the range of action taken by this Government in relation to China. I repeated that in the Statement and do not wish to weary the House by repeating it again but a look at Hansard will see the significant actions we have taken, which, in addition to those in the Statement, include reducing Chinese involvement in the UK&#8217;s civil nuclear sector by taking control and ownership of China&#8217;s stake in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sizewell_C">Sizewell C</a> project. We have also passed the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Act">National Security Act</a>, which I referred to in the Statement.</p> <p pid="b768.0/5">The director-general of MI5&#8212;since MI5 was referred to specifically&#8212;called this</p> <p class="indent" pid="b768.0/6">&#8220;a game changing update to our powers&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b768.0/7">Those are his public words. He said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b768.0/8">&#8220;We now have a modern set of <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> to tackle today&#8217;s threats&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b768.0/9">These will give law enforcement and intelligence agencies new and updated tools to deter, detect and disrupt foreign influence, including a foreign influence registration scheme that criminalises those acting covertly for states that pose the greatest threat to the UK.</p> <p pid="b768.0/10">There were various comments and I have to say that not everything said in this House derived from newspaper reports was entirely accurate. But I shall not be led to comment on what was or was not. I think all noble Lords will understand that this is an ongoing investigation and it is extremely important that we do not jeopardise any proceedings that may follow.</p> <p pid="b768.0/11">I was asked about the response to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC">ISC</a> report. I think it may not be the first time I have been asked that very legitimate question. I was told that I was permitted to say &#8220;very shortly&#8221; in response. I am now telling everybody not to betray secrets but I did say that I could not say that again and was assured that &#8220;very shortly&#8221; really does mean &#8220;very shortly&#8221; in this case. My noble friend Lady Neville-Rolfe will have heard those comments.</p> <p pid="b768.0/12">Information to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a> is again a matter for the relevant authorities. I shall not go down that road or say who knew what when. Noble Lords will have heard the Lord <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a> assure the House that:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b768.0/13">&#8220;The extremely small number of people who needed to know about this issue were immediately briefed on a strictly confidential basis&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b768.0/14">That was held to be the responsible approach.</p> <p pid="b768.0/15">The noble Lord, Lord Newby, said that our approach to China does not convince. The noble Baroness also said that we must have a serious response to China. I believe that was implicit in the Statement and explicit in the Statement made by my <a href="/glossary/?gl=172" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to another MP of..." class="glossary">right honourable friend</a> in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>. I underline what he said and what the House feels: China is a country that&#8212;sadly&#8212;has fundamentally different values from us and therefore represents a systemic challenge to the world order.</p> <p pid="b768.0/16">I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Newby, that China&#8217;s behaviour is increasingly concerning. It is becoming more authoritarian at home and more assertive overseas. We are alert to that challenge and I would say, as I often say in this House, how much we feel fortified by the support across the Chamber. We must take the necessary steps to stand up for our values and protect our interests.</p> <p pid="b768.0/17">On the other hand, China is also a permanent member of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a>. It is the second largest economy in the world and has an impact on almost every global issue of importance to the UK. Our overall approach, therefore, must be rooted in our national interest and co-ordinated with like-minded partners, as I referred to with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUKUS">AUKUS</a> arrangements, the long-standing <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a> arrangements and the work on a new aerial provision with Italy and Japan. We will go on working with like-minded partners. We are sending the aircraft carrier presence to the East again to assure our allies there that we will go on working with them to maintain a stable international order. The integrated review refresh set out a new approach and measures to respond to the increasingly concerning actions of Chinese authorities.</p> <p pid="b768.0/18">I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Newby, that it is an epoch-defining challenge for our country and the world. We have been clear that China remains the biggest long-term question and threat to the UK&#8217;s economic security, but it is not smart foreign policy to reduce our entire approach to China to one word. Our approach should be measured in our actions rather than our words. We in the Government are confident that, with the support of the party opposite and others, we are taking the right actions to keep the United Kingdom safe and prosperous.</p>            </div>

Here at home, we have spoken&#8212;as many have today in the House in the preceding debates&#8212;about issues such as forced organ harvesting and the surveillance state that comes through the installation of cameras by companies such as Hikvision and Dahua, in which the noble Lord himself has taken such a keen interest.</p> <p pid="b770.0/2">In the light of all that, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a> will not be surprised to hear me reiterate a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Newby. In <a href="/glossary/?gl=112" title="During a debate members of the House of Commons traditionally refer to the..." class="glossary">another place</a> earlier today, my good friend Tim Loughton MP, who is also one of those who has been sanctioned, expressed surprise that those of us who had been put in this invidious position were not told anything about the activities that were said to be taking place across the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Estate">Parliamentary Estate</a>. Will the Leader look at that issue again and have some regard to those who obviously have a direct interest in this?</p> <p pid="b770.0/3">The foreign influence registration scheme contains a power to place a foreign power in the enhanced tier. That will require parliamentary approval. What is the proposed timetable? Can it be accelerated? Will the Chinese Communist Party regime be on that list? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leader">The Leader</a> referred to the &#8220;very shortly&#8221; assurance that he was asked to give concerning the excellent report from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a>, which says that China has penetrated</p> <p class="indent" pid="b770.0/4">&#8220;every sector of the UK&#8217;s economy&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b770.0/5"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_House">This House</a>&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Relations">International Relations</a> and Defence has also said that China is not a strategic competitor but a threat. Although it cannot be reduced to one word, as the Leader of the House said, surely it is time for us to schedule a debate. I hope that, as soon as the response from the Government is forthcoming, we will have in government time the chance to discuss the Intelligence and Security Committee&#8217;s report, along with our own reports.</p> <p pid="b770.0/6">Finally, will the Leader urgently consider establishing a small Joint Committee of both Houses to review infiltration, espionage, the subversion of our democratic institutions, the effects on places such as our universities, and these attempts to silence those of us who have been sanctioned by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCP">CCP</a> and our families?</p>            </div>

I am talking about the current practice, which is well known to all noble Lords&#8212;this is not a personal point at all&#8212;of noble Lords&#8217; spouses and partners being issued with security passes without any security vetting. Due to the overlap between these issues, which is a rare circumstance, I ask my noble friend the Minister whether this review gives us an opportunity to think about whether we need to reconsider that policy in light of the matters raised, particularly the safety of our staff and the fact that we are well aware of how clever and wily our enemy is. We need to make sure that any loophole or avenue is closed off.</p>            </div>

Some people suspect that I am part of the usual channels. but I am not going to say from this <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> whether there will be a debate on this subject.

Some of the facts on the ground were different. The nature of the Chinese regime has evolved since those times and the nature of our response is evolving. It is often easy to be wise after the event, but as my <a href="/glossary/?gl=172" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to another MP of..." class="glossary">right honourable friend</a> said in the Statement, we are very open-eyed about this and clearly recognise the nature, scale and uniqueness of the position of China, led by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party">Chinese Communist Party</a>, with its ambitions, not all of them potentially pacific.

What reassurance, services and support are the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> planning to provide to ensure that people know where to go if they have had a concerning, dangerous or worrying experience on social media or in person?

I propose that procedures of verification and enhanced vetting be considered. As a matter of course, and for the purpose of disclosure and information, is the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> aware that the press have been referring to a spy</p> <p class="indent" pid="b774.0/2">&#8220;at the heart of power&#8221;?</p> <p pid="b774.0/3">In doing so, they were referring to Parliament. I was concerned, and ask what explanation there is, that a Russian spy now expelled from the UK&#8212;and so presumably known about&#8212;was at a high-level reception, including ambassadors from a range of countries friendly to the UK, at which I was also present. That person was expelled shortly after the meeting to which I refer. I bring this to the attention of the Leader only so that all these matters be considered by the relevant authorities as we clean up what is going on.</p>            </div>
