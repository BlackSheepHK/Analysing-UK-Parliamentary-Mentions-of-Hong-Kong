He subsequently initiated a reconsideration of the long-standing policy of Her Majesty's Government towards these Far East prisoners. Owing to the complexity of the issues involved, that review took time to carry out but it has now been completed.</p> <p class="indent" pid="a.1391.2/3">"I am very pleased to be able to inform the House that as a result of the review the Government have decided to make a single ex gratia payment of &#163;10,000 to the surviving members of the British groups who were held prisoner by the Japanese during the Second World War, in recognition of the unique circumstances of their captivity. Where a person who would have been entitled to this payment has died, their surviving spouse will be entitled to receive it instead.</p> <p class="indent" pid="a.1391.2/4">"As honourable Members will recall, on a number of occasions in recent months this House has debated the situation of those who were held prisoner in the Far East during the Second World War. The reason we have done so is that what happened to those prisoners was often so appalling that for many it has remained with them for the rest of their lives. Many Members will be aware of the stories told by now frail constituents about that terrible time; members of the public will be familiar with the books and films about it. However, if we look back at the histories, we come across a simple, stark fact that makes clear to everybody the enormity of what happened. Of the 50,016 British service personnel who were reported captured by the Japanese, 12,433 died or were killed in captivity. In other words, conditions were so bad that one in four did not survive.</p> <p class="indent" pid="a.1391.2/5">"We are all very thankful that such a situation did not occur anywhere else during the Second World War and has not recurred since. The unique nature of the Japanese captivity in the Far East was recognised in the 1950s, when those who had been held became eligible for modest payments from assets, made under the provisions of the 1951 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Treaty">San Francisco Treaty</a> of Peace with Japan. As noble Lords are aware, the maximum payment available at that time was &#163;76.10s.</p> <p class="indent" pid="a.1391.2/6">"In the intervening years, the former Far East prisoners pursued the issue of additional compensation with Japan. More recently, they have also campaigned for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a> to make a payment. However, as Members of both sides of the House will be well aware, it has been the policy of successive governments over many years not to make payments in such circumstances.</p> <p class="indent" pid="a.1391.2/7">"We are now making an exception for the British groups that were held prisoner by the Japanese during the Second World War in recognition of the unique circumstances of their collective captivity. Those who will be entitled to receive the payment are former members of Her Majesty's Armed Forces who were made prisoners of war, former members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_Navy">Merchant Navy</a> who were captured and imprisoned and British civilians who were interned. Certain other former military personnel in the colonial forces, Indian army and Burmese armed forces who received compensation in the 1950s under United Kingdom auspices will also be eligible. As I said earlier, where a person who would have been entitled to this payment has died, their surviving spouse will be entitled to receive it instead.</p> <p class="indent" pid="a.1391.2/8">"We estimate that up to 16,700 people may be eligible for these ex gratia payments, which will accordingly cost up to &#163;167 million to make. I shall not now go into detail about the new payment scheme, except to say that this single ex gratia payment will not be taxable, nor will it be taken into account for benefits purposes. We intend to make these payments as quickly as possible, although it will take a little time for the appropriate regulations to be made. However, we expect everything to be in place by February.</p> <p class="indent" pid="a.1391.2/9">"Further details of the scheme are being published today in a leaflet by the War Pensions Agency, which will be administering it. A copy will be <a href="/glossary/?gl=252" title="This phrase is often used in written answers to indicate that a minister..." class="glossary">placed in the Library</a> of the House. The leaflet and a claim form will also be available on the agency's website.</p> <p class="indent" pid="a.1391.2/10">"The Government recognise that many <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> citizens, both those serving in the Armed Forces and civilians, have had to endure great hardship at different times and in different circumstances. But the experience of those who went into captivity in the Far East during the Second World War was unique. We have said before that we believe the country owes a debt of honour to them. I hope that I am speaking for everyone here when I say that today something concrete has been done to recognise that debt."</p> <p pid="a.1391.2/11">My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>            </div>

While nothing can ever compensate the men and women who suffered at Japanese hands during the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War">Second World War</a>, it is excellent that the Government have recognised their plight and have made a generous offer, which, as I understand it, extends to both widows and civilian internees.

First, what is the position of those who are now citizens of Hong Kong who were previously subjects of the United Kingdom, who suffered equally from internment and who, in some cases, were members of the Armed Forces? For reasons quite outside their control, some of them are now Hong Kong citizens--and therefore citizens of the Republic of China--rather than British citizens, but their position, their plight and the suffering that they underwent was not very different from that of the citizens to whom the Minister has referred.</p> <p pid="a.1393.1/4">Finally, can the Minister say a little more about the section in the Statement that deals with those who served with us from Commonwealth countries, particularly those from India, Burma and the colonial forces? Perhaps he can say how far the settlement will extend to them. He mentioned them, but he did not say in precise terms who would qualify and who would not.</p> <p pid="a.1393.1/5">May I again say how grateful we are that the Government have recognised the desperate position of those who served and then suffered so much at the hands of the Japanese during the Second World War?</p>            </div>

I shall certainly pass them on to her. We hope that she will return very quickly.</p> <p pid="a.1394.0/2">The remarks of the noble Lord were well meant and genuinely appreciative of the move that has now been made. I am sure that he will wish to join with the Government in celebrating the fact that we have now been able to do what needed to be done--perhaps many years ago--for these people.</p> <p pid="a.1394.0/3">The noble Baroness added her welcome to the Government's decision. She asked about civilian internees. As I understand it, that group involves a number of people. They will, of course, be recognised. Should any of those she mentioned fall outside the scheme, I shall write to the noble Baroness with details. Similarly, I expect those colonials--from wherever they came--who were part of this group, and who were prisoners of war during that period on our behalf, to be recognised.</p> <p pid="a.1394.0/4">So far as concerns those who were imprisoned or interned for other reasons--for instance, as the noble Baroness mentioned, those from states such as Hong Kong-- details are not yet fully available on this issue. I shall ensure that the noble Baroness is informed of the position of such people.</p>            </div>

One of my former clergy was in action against the Japanese; he was captured and suffered grievously at their hands. Throughout the remaining years of his ministry after he returned to this country, the effect on that and his family life was terrible to see. I believe that what hurt him most was his feeling that all that he and so many others had gone through was not really appreciated by those of us back home. I welcome what the Government have said and I understand why the payment has been so long in coming. This afternoon I feel for the dead priest and the fact that this has come, sadly, too late for him and for many others.</p>            </div>

I know that during the 55 years since his release he has been very much looking forward to the day when the plight of the prisoners would be recognised. I know that while he bore in stoic silence his astonishment at the treatment meted out after their release--a payment of &#163;76.10s--he was very active in seeking redress for colleagues worse afflicted than he was.</p> <p pid="a.1396.0/2">I am sure that he will be enormously relieved to know that the surviving spouses of his PoW colleagues who died in the intervening years will be the beneficiaries. Would it not be appropriate that with their payment they receive a letter from the Government thanking them for their great patience in waiting for this compensation?</p>            </div>

On the question of benefit for Indian troops and colonials who became prisoners of war, I understand that there is a record of most of those who were involved. I believe that the organisations concerned also have a record. There will be an effort on behalf of the Government to ensure that all groups are contacted so that those who are entitled to payments receive them. That includes the group that the noble Lord mentioned. I believe that there are presently about 100 people on the record.</p>            </div>

But there were also people who were called up and who fought for King and country in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaya.

However, I should like to discharge a debt. Noble Lords have referred to the privations that prisoners of war underwent. When I was a 14 year-old schoolboy, in 1956, I was taught by a man of extreme gifts--one of those teachers who have a profound influence on one's life. One afternoon, as a result of an episode in a classroom, he burst into tears. He had spent three years on the Burma railway and the episode had brought back to him some of the extraordinary privations he had undergone. He died a bachelor some years ago. I feel that I owe it to him to say that we have all allowed far too much time to elapse--it is 58 years since my schoolmaster was captured in Singapore--before righting this grievous wrong.</p>            </div>
