I am grateful for what he said about the two days that I have managed to find for the important debates on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> and China and on foreign affairs. I hope that it is for the convenience of the House to hold separate debates on those two subjects next week.</p> <p>
I recognise that we have had a number of debates on the Health Service; it is a subject to which we shall return from time to time, but I cannot promise a debate on the Health Service with particular reference to Wales. I know that my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> would welcome a debate on the subject in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Grand_Committee">Welsh Grand Committee</a>, but its timing should be left to the usual channels.</p> <p>
I have nothing to add to what I told the hon. Gentleman some time ago about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Affairs_Select_Committee">Scottish Affairs Select Committee</a>. I explained that I have been considering the points that some of his hon. Friends raised with me in the course of a useful discussion. I have to confirm that I do not see an easy solution, but I am still looking into the matter.</p> <p>
With regard to the Griffiths report, we are now finalising our proposals on community care and my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Health very much hopes to be able to make a statement announcing our conclusions next week. As I have said before, there will be a debate in Government time at a suitable point thereafter.</p> <p>
As I said last week, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science and I have made it clear that we would welcome a debate on top-up loans. Again, its timing is best left for discussion through the usual channels.</p>            </div>

It has attracted 61 signatures to date.</p> <p>
Although it may appear to be just a local problem, is the right hon. Gentleman aware that the workers involved have gone through the democratic rules laid down by the Government to obtain trade union recognition, but have been ignored by the reactionary management of that company?

Friend's concern about the grave inconvenience caused to many of his constituents and about the strike generally. The strike is for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail">British Rail</a> and the unions to resolve, and I hope


that they will do so quickly in the interests of all commuters. The Government have done what they can to assist commuters to get to work. The extra measures that we announced last week were generally a success. Emergency parking in central London was well used, without creating significant extra congestion, and we are considering the use of further park-and-ride sites.</p> <p>
We urge the public to use car-sharing more and to stagger their journeys, so that more people may get to work. By far the most satisfactory way out will be for the union to recognise its responsibilities and to reach agreement with the employers.</p>            </div>

Member for Langbaurgh (Mr. Holt).</p> <p><i>[That this House congratulates the BBC's staff for their courageous action in striking.</i></p> <p><i>That this House notes that there is no intention on the part of the BBC strikers to improve productivity or efficiency and that the action taken has hit hardest at the elderly, house bound, lonely and low paid who struggle to pay the present exorbitant licence fee.]</i></p> <p>
Will the right hon. Gentleman arrange for a debate&#8212;short or otherwise&#8212;on both early-day motions, which may allow the hon. Member for Langbaurgh to explain his somewhat contradictory views, which clearly must have been tendered in the spirit of mockery? Such a debate would allow right hon. and hon. Members to express their undistorted views about the opinions of BBC staff, as opposed to those of BBC management. It would also provide an opportunity to pass comment on the summer of discontent that the Government have undoubtedly provoked in a desperate quest to regain some form of electoral advantage.</p>            </div>

and decisions are made, but there is no debate in the House. Is not the position even worse, because in the meantime, people's rights to justice deteriorate as the legal aid system provides less support. A person who needs justice must be either very rich or have little money&#8212;otherwise, too often, the courts are not available. Surely we must have a debate on legal reform and legal aid before the recess. Can the right hon. Gentleman promise at least that?</p>            </div>

Of course, these are matters for debate, but that point should not be overlooked.</p> <p>
The Government have issued a <a href="/glossary/?gl=221" title="A Green Paper is a tentative report of British government proposals without..." class="glossary">Green Paper</a> for discussion of the procedures. A final decision has not been made. When the Government decide what to do, there will be ample time to discuss the matter.

Friends the Members for Clwyd, South-West (Mr. Jones) and for Ogmore (Mr. Powell). There is serious concern all over Wales about the future of the Health Service and the Government's review proposals. The subject has produced a large mail bag for me and all other Welsh Members. I was heavily involved in the by-elections earlier this year in Pontypridd and Vale of Glamorgan and I know that the Health Service is the main issue in politics today for thousands of people. We should have an opportunity in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Grand_Committee">Welsh Grand Committee</a> to discuss the effect of the proposals on Wales. We normally have four Committee sittings a year, but this year we have had only three. Why do the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Wales and the Government not allow us the opportunity to discuss the Health Service in the Welsh Grand Committee?</p>            </div>

I hope, therefore, that you will make it clear that the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Heeley and the early-day motion did not constitute an unprovoked attack on the integrity of the hon.
