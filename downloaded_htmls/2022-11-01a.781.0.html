It is a great pleasure to be here on my first outing at the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> to speak about something that, as the House will know, I take extremely seriously. Reports of undeclared police stations in the United Kingdom are, of course, extremely concerning and will be taken seriously. Any foreign country operating on United Kingdom soil must abide by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> law. I have discussed this matter with the police and I am assured that they are investigating allegations of unlawful activity. It would be inappropriate for me to comment further on operational matters.</p> <p pid="a779.3/2">I will take the opportunity, however, to reassure the House of the Government&#8217;s resolve to take the matter seriously. I will also shortly make a statement to the House on safeguarding our democracy. The protection of people in the United Kingdom is of the utmost importance. Any attempt to illegally repatriate any individual will not be tolerated. This egregious activity is part of a wider trend of authoritarian Governments perpetrating transnational repression in an effort to silence their critics overseas and undermine democracy and the rule of law. For example, we have been aware for some time of efforts to interfere in our academic freedoms and university sector, and we have been taking steps to protect our institutions.</p> <p pid="a779.3/3">This Government are committed to tackling the challenge of transnational repression wherever it originates. It would be unacceptable for any foreign Government to feel able to operate in that way in the United Kingdom, and it must be stopped. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> works closely with Departments across <a href="/glossary/?gl=101" title="Whitehall is a wide road that runs through the heart of Westminster,..." class="glossary">Whitehall</a> and with devolved Administrations to ensure that our national security is protected and that, in particular, those who have chosen to settle here are free to engage in our democratic society without fear of the regimes that they have tried to leave behind.</p> <p pid="a779.3/4">Through our excellent police forces and the agencies that work with them, we take a proactive approach to protecting individuals and communities from all manner of threats. Where we identify individuals who may be at heightened risk, we are front-footed in deploying protective security guidance and other measures where necessary. I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10180" title="Our page on Iain Duncan Smith - 'the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith)'">Sir Iain Duncan Smith</a> and particularly my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25906" title="Our page on Alicia Kearns - 'the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alicia Kearns)'">Alicia Kearns</a>, who has taken over the best job in Parliament as Chair of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a>. They have worked tirelessly on this issue, including with our close international partners.</p> <p pid="a779.3/5">The upcoming National Security Bill will strengthen our legal powers to deal with transnational repression. Coercion, harassment or intimidation linked to a foreign power that interfere with the freedoms of individuals  will be criminalised under the new foreign interference offence in the Bill. Existing criminal offences against a person, such as assault, may also have sentences increased using the state threats aggravating factor in the Bill where they are undertaken for, on behalf of or with the intention to benefit a foreign power. The Bill will introduce a new foreign influence registration scheme, for which many hon. Members have campaigned, including my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton. That will provide greater transparency around foreign interference in our society.</p> <p pid="a779.3/6">It is clear, however, that we can and must do more. I have therefore asked officials to step up the work to ensure that our approach to transnational repression is robust, and I have asked our Department to review our approach to transnational repression as a matter of urgency. I will provide an update on that work to the House in due course.</p>            </div>

I take this opportunity to welcome my right hon. Friend to his place and say how reassured I am to have someone of his expertise leading on this important area for our national security.</p> <p pid="a780.0/2">There are troubling reports of a widespread network of Chinese police stations operating worldwide, including three in our country in Croydon, Hendon and Glasgow. Publicly, those stations are harmless administrative centres for Chinese nationals, but reports suggest that they are actually used to hunt down dissidents and alleged Chinese criminals. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> have admitted their existence, so I have some questions for the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>. What is the legal basis for their operations on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> soil? Are Chinese officials involved in their administration? I welcome that the Minister has tasked an investigation, but will he commit to update the House on it in due course?</p> <p pid="a780.0/3">Finally, the British national overseas scheme was world leading, but we have a duty to protect those who come here and seek refuge on our soil. Does he agree that, following the Chinese consul general&#8217;s attack on a Hongkonger only a couple of weeks ago, we are playing a dangerous game in sacrificing our sovereignty and the safety of not just British nationals, but refugees at the altar of not wanting to upset an authoritarian state?</p>            </div>

Friend has done over recent weeks, in particular, and years in alerting this House and the country to the threats that we have faced from authoritarian regimes around the world. I pay particular tribute to her leadership of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Research_Group">China Research Group</a>, on which I was honoured to work with her before.</p> <p pid="a780.1/2">The reports that my hon. Friend mentions are not exclusive to this country. Sadly, we have seen authoritarian states exercising repressive tendencies abroad and seeking to extradite, or indeed inveigle, citizens of their own country back to their homeland to extract punishment. That is simply unacceptable. The protections of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> state need to apply to all those in the United Kingdom and it is absolutely essential that those protections are afforded to all. That is why I am working, and will work further, with the police and agencies to ensure that we are on top of this offence and that, should evidence be shown and proof be given, action will be taken.</p> <p pid="a780.1/3">I also thank my hon.

She is right that that was not only world leading but essential for protecting British nationals in the face of an authoritarian dictatorship, and that those who come here under the scheme should be afforded the same protections, rights and dignity as all British nationals everywhere.</p>            </div>

I am grateful to <a href="/mp/?p=25906" title="Our page on Alicia Kearns - 'the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alicia Kearns)'">Alicia Kearns</a> for securing the urgent question. As we have heard, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safeguard_Defenders">Safeguard Defenders</a> report alleges that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist">Chinese Communist</a> party has set up parallel policing mechanisms around the world. The report identifies three such stations in Hendon, Glasgow and Croydon that purport to offer services for Chinese nationals abroad. There have been multiple reports, however, that those stations are cracking down on Chinese political dissidents, including Hong Kong ex-pats and Uyghur refugees.</p> <p pid="a781.0/2">According to the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, people from Hong Kong relocating to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> are being</p> <p class="indent" pid="a781.0/3" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;followed, harassed, attacked and intimidated&#8221; by operatives based at the Glasgow station. The recent unacceptable conduct that we witnessed outside the Chinese consulate in Manchester makes it clear that we have to act to safeguard those in the UK from increasingly belligerent measures being undertaken by those acting on behalf of the Chinese state.</p> <p pid="a781.0/5">With the Minister&#8217;s predecessor, <a href="/mp/?p=24888" title="Our page on Stephen McPartland - 'the right hon. Member for Stevenage (Stephen McPartland)'">Stephen McPartland</a>, we discussed in the National Security Bill Committee that the harassment of dissidents was becoming an increasing concern. What assessment have the Government made of these stations and what action have they taken to disrupt these damaging activities? The foreign influence registration scheme is long overdue, as he and others have said, so can he put on record exactly when it will be introduced?</p> <p pid="a781.0/6">The Government previously stated that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> and the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities have drawn up plans to protect those arriving from Hong Kong from surveillance and harassment. Can the Minister elaborate on what those provisions are? The rule of law and freedom of expression are fundamental principles in our democracy and we must act to make it clear to any overseas regime that only UK police forces undertake policing in this country&#8212;with absolutely no exceptions.</p>            </div>

Lady for the tone with which she has approached not just the urgent question but the National Security Bill Committee, and for the openness and frankness with which she has enabled us to work on a truly cross-party basis on what is fundamentally a national security question for our whole country. I am extremely grateful for the way she has addressed these questions.</p> <p pid="a781.1/2">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safeguard_Defenders">Safeguard Defenders</a> report that the hon. Lady cites certainly raises some very serious concerns. Those are being looked into. Of course, it would not be the first time an authoritarian dictatorship had claimed powers that it does not have, so we are looking into the  assessment and, as I say, we will come back to the House with a report when and if action needs to be taken.</p> <p pid="a781.1/3">On <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRS">FIRS</a>, the hon. Lady is absolutely right that this is a matter that many of us have raised on numerous occasions. As soon as the National Security Bill is through the House&#8212;as she is well aware, that will, I hope, be very soon&#8212;those powers will be able to be used to defend not just this country but Members of this House against the intimidation or influence of those who seek to lobby or influence, masking the fact that they are doing so for a foreign state.</p> <p pid="a781.1/4">On protections, the hon. Lady is, again, absolutely right. The reality is that there is no police force in this country that has jurisdiction except the police forces of the United Kingdom. She is absolutely right that no foreign force should have abilities to influence, detain, hold or pressurise citizens of our country, except those that are agreed to by law.</p>            </div>

Indeed, the suggested international scale of these activities across 30 countries on five continents is actually pretty shocking. Given the international perspective, what discussions are the Minister and his counterparts having with colleagues in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU">EU</a> and beyond about how they can co-ordinate on this matter?</p> <p pid="a782.3/3">What steps can the Minister say have been taken to ensure that law enforcement and security services have the skills and resources to tackle the matter?

This is truly a United Kingdom issue, and the way to address them is for the United Kingdom to work together.</p> <p pid="a783.0/2">The hon. Member is absolutely right that there are wider dimensions, which include our friends and allies around the world. The Government have already been working with Governments around the world to make sure that we deal with the repression and oppression that we are seeing in different places. He will remember well the way in which the United Kingdom stood so clearly with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Canada">Government of Canada</a> to call out the illegal detention of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Spavor">Michael Spavor</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kovrig">Michael Kovrig</a>. I am delighted to say that that will continue.</p> <p pid="a783.0/3">The hon. Member is right that working with police forces across the United Kingdom&#8212;including <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Scotland">Police Scotland</a>, which does excellent work&#8212;is really important, but it is also important that they have access to the resources that we are able to bring as the United Kingdom. The agencies that do so much to support us all are essential.</p> <p pid="a783.0/4">I am grateful for the hon. Member&#8217;s kind words about the National Security Bill. His support on that Bill has been incredibly important and demonstrates that this truly is a cross-party, cross-nation effort to keep the whole of the United Kingdom safe. He can be absolutely assured that I will not hesitate to use the powers in the Bill should they be required.</p> <p pid="a783.0/5">The hon. Member&#8217;s question on the community is also really important. We need to make it absolutely clear that what we are resisting here is authoritarian Governments seeking to influence free people. We welcome people from across the world. We welcome people from communities that may be repressed at home but can be free here. It is essential that we champion those who can enjoy freedom here, and the Hongkongers are a clear demonstration that this Government and this country welcome those seeking freedom.</p>            </div>

Although the stations are what has grabbed the headlines and attention of many, the broader issue, as has been mentioned, is the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist">Chinese Communist</a> party using all the instruments of its international architecture, including the Confucius Institutes, to harass, intimidate and track down people. Do the Government now intend to review any and all co-operation agreements they have with law enforcement bodies in China; I am not calling for them to be scrapped at this stage, but will they at least be reviewed, if they do exist? As my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25301" title="Our page on Stuart McDonald - 'the Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East (Stuart C. McDonald)'">Stuart C. McDonald</a> mentioned from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>, the devolved Administrations have responsibility for policing but also for education. They need to have a seat at the table and be part of a broader strategy in unpicking this reliance on Chinese cash&#8212;let us be honest, that is what it is down to. Lastly, given <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI">FBI</a> expertise in this area and the success in the US of closing down these stations and closing off opportunities to harass and intimidate people, have the Government at least been in touch with their counterparts in the FBI to tap into their expertise?</p>            </div>

It is essential that all students have those rights.
