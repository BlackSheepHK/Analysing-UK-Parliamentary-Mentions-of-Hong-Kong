                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>With permission, Mr. <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, I will make a statement on the reorganisation of the cotton industry.</p> <p>
In recent years the cotton industry has been exposed to formidable and increasing competition from textile industries established inside its traditional export markets. Moreover, Commonwealth countries have emerged as large exporters to the United Kingdom itself where they meet no tariff barrier. These changes have brought distress and anxiety to Lancashire. The result is a situation complicated and worsened by the existence of a large volume of surplus and obsolete equipment. The outlook, however, is by no means all black. The growing purchasing power in industrialised economies opens up excellent prospects for the better fabrics and made-up goods. Special measures are, therefore, called for to make the industry compact, up-to-date and efficient.</p> <p>
Following the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> undertaking to limit exports, the industry has been working out plans to adapt itself to changed conditions and to reorganise and re-equip its capacity. Leaders of the different sections have been discussing with me a contribution from the Government which they feel to be essential to the success of their plans.</p> <p>
The Government have no doubt that the circumstances of the cotton industry which I have just described justify the exceptional course of direct financial assistance from public funds. Accordingly we shall seek powers from Parliament to meet the industry's request for help.</p> <p>
The first step must be to remove surplus capacity. The Government are ready to contribute from public funds two-thirds of the cost of bringing this about under schemes to be approved by the Board of Trade. The balance will be met by the industry by statutory levy. A severe time limit will be set for qualifying for assistance and, in order to start without delay, arrangements will be made whereby, subject to the fulfilment of the necessary conditions, a firm which scraps machinery after today can qualify for assistance.</p> <p>
The Government have agreed to bear a high proportion of the cost of eliminating surplus capacity on the clearly understood condition that the industry itself will compensate operatives faced with loss of employment as a result of the schemes. This is a matter for the employers to settle directly with the trade unions concerned. The Government will do everything in their power to assist those displaced by the reorganisation schemes to find alternative work.</p> <p>
After the elimination of surplus capacity, the next step is to encourage re-equipment. Provided that the Board of Trade is satisfied that enough surplus capacity in the industry will be eliminated, the Government will be prepared to pay a grant of one quarter of the cost of modernising existing machinery and providing new machinery. Orders for machinery placed after today will be eligible for this grant, subject to the fulfilment of the condition to which I have referred, and to the granting of powers by Parliament. Re-equipment and modernisation completed during the next five years will rank for this assistance.</p> <p>
It is not possible to estimate at present how much the total charge on public funds will be. This depends on the extent to which the industry takes advantage of the assistance now offered and on such factors as the terms which are settled for eliminating surplus capacity. I can only say that, given a favourable response from the industry, the cost to the Exchequer


might well be about &#163;30 million over five years.</p> <p>
These arrangements will require detailed administration. For this purpose the Bill which we propose to introduce will contain provisions for setting up a special agency under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Board">Cotton Board</a> to carry out the schemes in accordance with directions from the Board of Trade.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> will see that this set of proposals forms a comprehensive whole. We shall meet with problems that we cannot see in advance, but with good will from both sides of industry they can be solved. I know that the employers will bring the trade unions into the fullest possible consultation at all stages. The Government will follow closely the reorganisation schemes and will do all they can to maintain the impetus to carry them through speedily and effectively. These joint endeavours will reshape our cotton industry and equip it to compote in the expanding markets of the world with the types of cloth that are wanted wherever living standards are high.</p>            </div>

They did not bring <a href="/glossary/?gl=226" title="A group of workers who have united to promote their common interests." class="glossary">trade union</a> representatives with them. They were considering only their own capital structure. But we told them that we made it a firm condition that they should

agree compensation schemes for displaced workpeople and, as a matter of fact, the discussions are going on now&#8212;and going on well, according to my information. We shall look at those schemes for compensation for the workpeople before any Government grants are paid, because, as the right hon. Gentleman will have heard that is a condition of the whole plan.</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman asked me whether the central agency would have a say in the selection of the surplus capacity to be eliminated. I think that the answer must be "No", because the main object of this exercise, without which we shall not have a prosperous cotton industry, is to make it efficient and at the same time to take care of the workpeople who are displaced. I do not think that there will be very many, because the industry has told me that it should be able to absorb a good number of them.</p>            </div>

We have always thought that the cotton industry, with its very long tradition and its immense variety, was not the kind of industry in which any form of compulsion would succeed, even if it were part of our political principles to try compulsion. It has always been our firm conviction that it would not work. It is a voluntary scheme from start to finish.</p> <p>
As for the second part of the supplementary question, the unit price will have to be worked out by the agency in consultation with the industry, and will have to be approved by the Board of Trade


and the Treasury. We have had preliminary discussions on this matter and I do not think that we are very far apart.</p> <p>
I assume that by his third question my hon. Friend wanted to know how payments of public funds would be treated for taxation purposes. The present law raises a number of complicated questions in regard to balancing charges, and what happens when a firm goes wholly or partially out of production. We have examined this question, and my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=99" title="The chancellor of the exchequer is the government's chief financial..." class="glossary">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> is authorising discussions to take place. We shall apply the law&#8212;but not change it&#8212;as sympathetically as we can towards the cotton industry.</p>            </div>

Gentleman aware that the industry has been rapidly contracting for the past seven years, and that half of the mills have closed down in the last seven years without a public cry that they should do so; and that there are many towns in Lancashire, two of which I represent, where cotton is virtually the only industry and the contraction of that industry would mean the virtual debarring of many hundreds of workers from earning their livelihood at all?</p> <p>
