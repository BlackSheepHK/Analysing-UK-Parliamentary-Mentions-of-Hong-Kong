                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a492.3/1">One of the first things we knew about coronavirus as it began its dismal spread across the world was that it reserves its greatest impact for those who are physically weakest, especially the old. In the UK, 89% of all deaths have been of those aged above 65. From the start, we have worked hard to protect those in social care. In early March, we put &#163;3.2 billion into social care&#8212;half through the NHS and half through local authorities&#8212;and we have repeatedly set out and strengthened guidance for infection control and support.</p> <p pid="a492.3/2">For anyone who has a loved one living in a care home and for all the residents and staff, I understand what a worrying time this has been. I am glad that we have been able to protect the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of homes, and we will keep working to strengthen the protective ring that we have cast around all our care homes. As I said in the House yesterday, last week we set out a further &#163;600 million to strengthen infection control, and this comes on top of a substantial programme of support.</p> <p pid="a492.3/3">First, on testing, from the start we have tested symptomatic residents of care homes, even when testing capacity was much lower, and this has always been a top priority. We are now testing all care home residents and staff in England&#8212;those with symptoms and those without&#8212;and this is being done according to clinical advice, starting with the most vulnerable, and extending to working-age residents, too.</p> <p pid="a492.3/4">Secondly, we have strengthened the NHS support available to social care. We are putting in place a named clinical lead for every care home in England and have brought NHS infection-control expertise to the sector.</p> <p pid="a492.3/5">Thirdly, we are making sure that local authorities play their part. Councils are conducting daily reviews of the situation on the ground in local care homes, so that every care home gets the support that it needs need every day.</p> <p pid="a492.3/6">Fourthly, we are supporting care homes to get the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPE">PPE</a> that they need.</p> <p pid="a492.3/7">Fifthly, we have increased the social care workforce during this crisis and provided more support. Altogether, this is an unprecedented level of support for the social care system. I thank colleagues across social care for their hard work.</p> <p pid="a492.3/8">We have also broken down some of the long-standing barriers, including between health and social care, and we have learned the importance of making sure that money for social care is ring-fenced specifically for social care, as the &#163;600 million agreed last Friday has been. On top of that, we are requiring much better data from social care, because partial data has bedevilled the management of social care for many years and made  policy making more difficult. Regular information returns are required in return for the latest funding, and we are looking to change the regulations to require data returns from every care provider, so that we can better prepare and support social care.</p> <p pid="a492.3/9">Our elderly care homes provide for people towards the end of their life. They do an amazing job and deserve the praise that they have received from the public during this crisis. Residents are looked after when they need care the most: their hands are held, their brows are mopped and they are made comfortable. As a collective result of our efforts&#8212;especially the efforts of care colleagues throughout the country&#8212;62% of care homes have had no reported cases of coronavirus.</p> <p pid="a492.3/10">The figures released today by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics">Office for National Statistics</a> show that the number of deaths in care homes has fallen significantly and is down by a third in just the past week, from 2,423 to 1,666. This morning&#8217;s statistics confirmed that 27% of coronavirus deaths in England have taken place in care homes, compared with a European average of around half, but whatever the figures say, we will not rest in doing whatever is humanly possible to protect our care homes from this appalling virus, to make sure that residents and care colleagues have the safety and security they deserve.</p>            </div>

This virus is the biggest health challenge of our lives, but Ministers have been too slow to tackle the problem in care homes, social care has not had the same priority as the NHS, and these services have not been treated as inextricably linked.</p> <p pid="a493.1/2">Will the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> explain why guidance saying that care homes were &#8220;very unlikely&#8221; to be infected was not withdrawn until <phrase class="date" code="2020-03-12">12 March</phrase>, given that the chief medical officer warned about community transmission and the risks to the elderly on <phrase class="date" code="2020-03-04">4 March</phrase>? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_England">NHS England</a> rightly asked hospitals to free up at least 30,000 beds to cope with the virus, but will the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> explain why there was no requirement to test those being discharged to care homes&#8212;the very group most at risk&#8212;until <phrase class="date" code="2020-04-15">15 April</phrase>? Care providers had serious problems getting personal protective equipment, as their normal supply was requisitioned by the NHS, when both are equally important. Why did that happen?</p> <p pid="a493.1/3">It took until mid-April for the Government to produce a social care plan, until the end of April for them to say that all residents and staff should be tested, and until <phrase class="date" code="2020-05-11">11 May</phrase> for them to set a deadline for achieving this&#8212;and that deadline still is not until <phrase class="date" code="2020-06-06">6 June</phrase>. Will the Secretary of State explain how he squares all that with his claim that Government have thrown a &#8220;protective cloak&#8221; around care homes right from the start? Despite all the warnings, care homes in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> told me over the weekend that they cannot access the Government&#8217;s new online testing portal, that tests are not being picked up and that it is often weeks until they get results back. When will this be sorted out?</p> <p pid="a493.1/4">Finally, the Government have said that the NHS will get whatever resources it takes to deal with this virus. Will the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> now make the same commitment to  social care and guarantee that no provider will collapse because of this virus? No one denies how difficult this is, but instead of denying problems and delays, Ministers should learn from their mistakes so that they can put the right measures in place in future and keep all elderly and disabled people safe.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a494.0/1">I welcome the hon. Lady to her post and to her first question in this new role. I know that she enjoys a good working relationship with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Care, my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25398" title="Our page on Helen Whately - 'the Member for Faversham and Mid Kent (Helen Whately)'">Helen Whately</a>, and that cross-party working during this crisis has gone on throughout. I thank her for that and for the approach that she is taking. She is right and perfectly reasonable to ask questions about how we can further improve the support that we are giving to the care sector, and, as I have said from this <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> before, and before her appointment, we have made social care a priority from the start. The first guidance went out to social care in February. She referred to the <phrase class="date" code="2020-03-13">13 March</phrase> guidance. That was only a matter of days immediately after the risk to the public was raised on medical advice. The guidance that was in place until then, as she probably knows, explicitly stated that that guidance was in place while community transmission was low and that it would be updated as soon as community transmission went broader. That is exactly what we did.</p> <p pid="a494.0/2">More importantly, the hon. Lady raised the question of discharges, and I understand the questions that have been asked about discharges into care. It is important to remember that hospital can be a dangerous place for people. As well as saving lives, it can also carry risks, and does so, so it is an appropriate clinical decision in many cases for people to be discharged from hospital, and safer for them to go to a care home. What is important is that infection control procedures are in place in that care home, and those infection control procedures were put in place at the start of this crisis and have been strengthened, exactly as she says, as we have learned more and more about the virus all the way along. As the clinical understanding of coronavirus has strengthened, so too have we updated and strengthened our guidance.</p> <p pid="a494.0/3">The hon. Lady asked about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPE">PPE</a>. As she and every Member of the House knows, there has been an enormous global challenge with the global shortage of PPE and the need to get PPE distribution out to tens of thousands of settings. The guidance that we have put out again, which is guided by clinical expertise, states the level of PPE that is required, and we are now delivering against those standards. We have processes in place so that all care homes that have shortages&#8212;the numbers are coming down, I am glad to say&#8212;can get in contact with their local resilience forum and make sure that they can get that PPE. Those processes are in place. It has been a huge challenge. It was called the biggest logistical exercise of the last 40 years by the head of <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a>, and I think he was right.</p> <p pid="a494.0/4">The hon. Lady also asked about resources. Of course, if more resources are needed, we are open to those discussions. The fact that we put through &#163;600 million more that will go directly to social care&#8212;it will not be able to be held by councils; rather, it will go directly into social care&#8212;is right, but we have also learned some really big things about social care, confirming some of  the things many of us thought before. For instance, it is true that we need to have a more co-ordinated policy between health and social care. These social care reforms, which are long overdue and have not been put in place by Governments of all colours, absolutely must happen.</p>            </div>

They have worked much better over the last few months than they had hitherto. We need to make sure that that coming together&#8212;in a very difficult circumstance, which has broken down boundaries&#8212;continues.

That is why across England and Scotland, and indeed the whole UK, we use home tests, which are an important part of our testing regime.</p> <p pid="a495.3/2">The hon. Lady asks about the increased number of deaths, sadly, that there have been in care homes. She is absolutely right that there has been an increase. We analyse the causes of all the different factors that may have had an impact, which is something our clinical advisers are looking at. The same is true in Scotland, and I am sure that the Scottish medical advisers are looking into the same.

That is in addition to the testing and protective arrangements, not as a replacement.

Secondly, the supply, once the equipment is in the country, out into the care homes and where it needs to be is improving all the time. The number of care homes reporting that they are within 48 hours of a stock out, which is the measure we use, has been falling and is less than half what it was a month ago, but we of course keep working to get that number down. When a care home is within two days of a stock out, we immediately work to get it the PPE that it needs.</p>            </div>

Gentleman makes a really important point and it comes to the nub of the challenge around care home policy. I do want to congratulate Brent. I think that the work it did was important, but, of course, formally and in the law responsibility for care homes is for local councils and some local councils, like Brent and others, have done a magnificent job. However, I also understand that it is a reality of political life and our constitution that I as <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Social_Care">Health and Social Care</a> am also responsible, and I take that responsibility very seriously. However, when it comes to longer-term reform, this does bring a conundrum because the policy levers that I have as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> are only through councils, which themselves have to then act.</p> <p pid="a498.4/2">On the funding side we have seen this challenge. We put in &#163;1.6 billion at the start of this crisis through councils without a ring fence, and there are questions being raised about how much of that has got to the frontline, so for the &#163;600 million we put through on Friday we have put in a very firm ring fence, so it must be paid in a timely manner through to care providers.  I think this actually raises a question not just for the crisis but for the longer term. When I am held accountable at this <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> for the actions of local authorities, I can give support, but we do not have the direct levers. We have not even had the direct data flows through to the centre, and we are putting that right too.</p>            </div>

I would be happy to look into the specifics if she writes to me with the details. Of course, the shielding programme is there for the protection of the shielded. If somebody who is being shielded would prefer to do things differently, that is not clinically recommended, but so long as it is within the broader social distancing guidelines, of course we understand why that might be the case. In particular, people coming to the end of their life may want to consider ensuring that they enjoy their last few weeks and months as much as they can. A proportionate approach is required here, and one that is guided by the individual clinical circumstances of that person. I very much hope that the  care home will take a proportionate approach. I am sure, as the hon. Lady says, that it has the best intentions at heart, and I would be happy to take up that individual case.</p>            </div>
