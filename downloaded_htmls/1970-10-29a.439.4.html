Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=99" title="The chancellor of the exchequer is the government's chief financial..." class="glossary">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> made his report as <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Lancaster">Duchy of Lancaster</a> on 23rd July.</p> <p>
During the period since I assumed my present office, I have had contacts with many Commonwealth Governments on the subject of the negotiations, which I believe to have been of great mutual benefit. I thought it right to visit Hong Kong, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand">Australia and New Zealand</a> during September in order to see for myself, on the spot, the nature of the problems which might arise; and I was able to have extensive discussions with representatives of all three Governments. I have also had the pleasure of meeting Ministers of Canada, Fiji and Commonwealth Caribbean Governments in London. In addition, I am in the course of making visits to all Community capitals. I have already been able to meet several of my Community colleagues, including the president of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=234" title="The European Commission is the politically independent institution that..." class="glossary">European Commission</a>.</p> <p>
I turn now to the progress of the negotiating conference. As my right hon. Friend explained in his statement on 23rd July, fact-finding work was instituted on a broad range of subjects by the Ministerial meeting on 21st July. As has been recognised by the Six themselves, this phase is now over.</p> <p>
Four useful meetings have taken place at the deputies' level in the meantime, largely concerned with preparing the ground for the Ministerial meeting which I attended this week.</p> <p>
I am happy to report that, as a result of this preliminary work, it was possible to record on 27th October the first agreements of the negotiations.</p> <p>
At previous meetings, we expressed some concern whether the Communities' existing arrangements would be adequate, in the circumstances of the enlarged Community, to ensure stability in the markets for pig meat and eggs and to allow adequate supplies of liquid milk. On 27th October, the Community recorded its agreement with our understanding of the possibilities that will be open to us and which would ensure the provision of adequate supplies of liquid milk to meet consumer demand throughout the country and throughout the year; they accepted our views on the importance and characteristics of the bacon market in an enlarged Community and the need for keeping the situation under careful review during the transitional period and thereafter; and they recognised the desirability of stability for pig meat and eggs. We concluded, therefore, that no further points need be raised on these items during the negotiations, except in the general context of transitional arrangements.</p> <p>
We were able also to reach agreement on procedures for an annual review of the economic conditions and prospects of the agricultural industry in the enlarged Community. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commission">The Commission</a> will draw up this review for the <a href="/glossary/?gl=205" title="An informal reference to the Council of the European Union." class="glossary">Council of Ministers</a> on the basis of all the relevant information and after contacts with the agricultural organisations. These arrangements will ensure effective contacts with producers.</p> <p>
The Community confirmed that, in principle, they saw no objection to British dependencies being associated with the enlarged Communities under Part <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV">IV</a> of the Treaty of Rome and that Gibraltar would be covered by Article 227(4) of the Treaty, which covers European territories of member states. On the other hand, they indicated that they did not regard the case of Hong Kong as comparable with other dependencies and that it posed special problems which would have to be examined in greater depth. In


reply, I stressed the importance of providing for Hong Kong's interests. The question of Hong Kong will, therefore, need further discussion with the Six.</p> <p>
Finally, in response to a suggestion from the Community side, I confirmed that, as a member of the Community, we would accept the common commercial policy, subject to the development of that policy, and that we should be prepared to make every effort in the meantime to harmonise our policies. We agreed that a mutual exchange of information in this field would be of value to both sides.</p> <p>
These, then, are the results achieved at the meeting on 27th October. They indicate that the negotiations have got off to a serious and positive start. They represent an achievement reached by both sides working together towards a common objective. The political will to make the negotiations a success was evident. It was clear that all realised that a successful outcome is a major interest for Europe as a whole. This was shown not only by the agreements I have outlined but by the desire expressed by both the Community and ourselves to step up the pace. We have, in fact, agreed to tackle all the major issues before the end of this year and to continue to discuss them urgently in the coming months.</p>            </div>

We have noted, too, his arduous and extensive travels. While I should by no means underestimate the fortitude with which my hon. Friends will bear the absence of Ministers, individual or collective, however protracted, I think that they would wish me to express appreciation for the considerable personal effort which the right hon. and learned Gentleman has made to make contact with Commonwealth interests in the way he has. However, although these consultations before negotiation are important, will he assure the House that consultations during the negotiations are regarded by himself and his colleagues as of equal importance, and, in particular, will the right hon. and learned Gentleman tell the House whether he or the <a href="/glossary/?gl=99" title="The chancellor of the exchequer is the government's chief financial..." class="glossary">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> consulted the Commonwealth countries in relation to the recent statement about agricultural

support, which appears to have caused considerable anxiety and concern, and, indeed, protests from Australian and Commonwealth interests?</p> <p>
May we have an assurance that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> of the Duchy will not attempt to put these matters into water-tight compartments by some artificial argument, since, clearly, matters like the agricultural support policy are related with our proposed entry into Europe and are of great concern to Commonwealth interests?</p> <p>
As regards the dependencies, I am sure that my hon. Friends will welcome that the Community has accepted that, in principle, there is no objection to their association. May I take it that this has been accepted as regards the Caribbean dependencies as well as others? I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman has made plain the Government's position as regards the protection of Hong Kong's interests.</p> <p>
Finally, on this question may we have an assurance that no negotiations will be undertaken by the Government on behalf of Rhodesia so long as the state of U.D.I. is maintained?</p>            </div>

I assure him that there will be close and continuous consultation throughout the negotiations not only between ourselves and the Commonwealth countries affected but with other countries and our E.F.T.A. partners also.</p> <p>
As regards the changes in the agricultural support system, naturally, the Commonwealth and other countries concerned were informed of the position. I took the opportunity when I was in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand">Australia and New Zealand</a> to say that this was a change of policy which the Government had in mind whether or not we were successful in our negotiations to join the Communities. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that we shall not consider all these matters in water-tight compartments. They are part and parcel of our whole trading and future policy towards Europe and the rest of the world.</p> <p>
As regards the dependencies, subject to the point which I made about Hong Kong and a matter which has to be cleared up about free port facilities in Gibraltar, I think that no difficulties


should arise. In so far as we have to consider in the future the position of the independent developing members of the Commonwealth, I assure the right hon. Gentleman and the House that we shall have regard to their interests. The position of Rhodesia is a little complicated constitutionally in so far as a territory in rebellion raises certain problems, but there would be no difficulty, if an opportunity should arise, in putting forward the case of Rhodesia for special treatment.</p>            </div>

First of all, will he say that the principle of the bacon market sharing understanding which we negotiated, namely, that the United Kingdom producers will have a growing share of the home market, will be maintained? On milk, will he say whether milk includes milk products&#8212;that is to say, cheese and butter&#8212;which are of primary importance to the British producer? Will he say whether milk powder is included and that there will be some control of imports of milk powder from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community">European Economic Community</a> into this country? On the part where he referred to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_Review">Annual Review</a>, lest there be any misunderstanding in the farming community in this country, will he make it quite clear that he is not referring to the possibility of no annual Price Review if and when we enter the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Market">Common Market</a>?</p>            </div>

of the negotiations by taking unnecessary action in the negotiating period. I hope that we will keep the negotiating period as short as possible so as to remove these uncertainties altogether.</p>            </div>

Of course the issues raised by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Report">Werner Report</a> are of great importance to us. They are not directly matters for negotiation as such but certainly there will be discussions, and I would imagine discussions in depth, about the implications for the future. The matters which we raise in relation to economic and monetary integration are not for tomorrow, they are matters which will arise when we are members of the Community&#8212;[HON. MEMBERS: "No."]&#8212;and therefore in a position to express a view.</p> <p>
We have said, and I should make this clear, that we have no objection to the long term objectives which the Community has in mind. In these matters we are prepared to go as far and as fast as they are. All this will take a very long time and there may be great disagreements about the ultimate form and the steps by which we proceed to those objectives.</p>            </div>

If they fail then these problems will not arise and that would be a pity for us all. But that is by the way.
