Yet I fear that the prevailing view in government and among those with commercial interests in Hong Kong is not to challenge China as strongly as we should and almost to turn a blind eye to the ongoing crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, on the free press and on civil society in this once proud possession of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Crown">British Crown</a>.</p> <p pid="d428.2/2">The announcement by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International">Amnesty International</a> on <phrase class="date" code="2021-10-25">25 October</phrase> that it intends to close its two offices in Hong Kong as a result of the national security law should concern us all. It is further evidence of the shrinking space for civil society in a city that once boasted to be an open international financial centre. Sadly, Amnesty International is not alone: at least 35 civil society organisations have disbanded since the introduction of the national security law.</p>            </div>

The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Secretary">Justice Secretary</a> stated that gestures, words and signs could lead to convictions, and the Security <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> cautioned that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kongers">Hong Kongers</a> who cast blank ballots or boycott the upcoming <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Council">Legislative Council</a> elections could be violating this draconian law.</p> <p pid="d429.0/4">No one looking at these developments can be under any illusion whatsoever that the old Hong Kong that guaranteed freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, freedom of association and freedom of religion or belief, and upheld the rule of law, exists today: that has gone. The two trials we have seen under the national security law have already demonstrated the export and establishment of China&#8217;s judicial system in Hong Kong, with suspects denied bail on spurious grounds, judges hand-picked by Beijing and one individual receiving a sentence of six and a half years in jail simply for carrying a flag with a pro-democracy slogan on it.</p>            </div>

Gentleman pre-empts what I was going to say later, and he is entirely correct that we should not be giving any legitimacy to this regime any longer.</p> <p pid="d429.2/2">The crackdown is clearly undermining the business environment in the city and Hong Kong&#8217;s status as a global financial centre, as British-based banks and businesses fear the extension of Beijing&#8217;s foreign anti-sanctions law which would require them to ignore <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US">US</a> sanctions, and new requirements under the national security law force them to become even more complicit  in the crackdown by disclosing the property of suspects. The growing number of US firms reported to be leaving the city and the warnings about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Government">Hong Kong Government</a>&#8217;s dwindling surplus are key indicators of this contagion.</p> <p pid="d429.2/3">So, what should the UK as a co-signatory to the joint declaration do in response to what the former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24815" title="Our page on Dominic Raab - 'the Member for Esher and Walton (Dominic Raab)'">Dominic Raab</a> has labelled China&#8217;s &#8220;ongoing non-compliance&#8221; with upholding its international commitments to the people of Hong Kong?</p> <p pid="d429.2/4">First, the Government need to look at what more can be done to support civil society in Hong Kong, which is currently under dreadful assault. In particular, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> should outline what plans the Government have to ensure the flow of information and reporting on the human rights situation now that both Amnesty and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> have been forced to close down.</p> <p pid="d429.2/5">Secondly, Ministers must reconsider the participation of sitting UK judges on the Hong Kong court of final appeal. As the human rights situation continues to deteriorate at a worrying pace, it is clear that these judges are powerless to moderate Beijing&#8217;s behaviour. Instead, they are offering political cover for a Government in Hong Kong who have lost all legitimacy.</p> <p pid="d429.2/6">Thirdly, Ministers need to stop dragging their feet when it comes to using the Magnitsky sanctions against the Hong Kong and Chinese officials responsible for these abuses. What signal does it send to our closest allies and partners in the region when the UK is unwilling to sanction individuals who have violated an international treaty with the United Kingdom and are systematically abusing human rights?</p>            </div>

Like many  Members, I fully supported the introduction of the scheme, but it cannot be right that nearly 200 Hong Kongers are now in the UK asylum system, many of whom have at least one parent who is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a>.

The question on everyone&#8217;s minds is, what will the UK do about this? We cannot stand by in silence. We cannot watch it continue and take no action.

I thank all those other hon. Members who have intervened tonight. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Asia, my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25350" title="Our page on Amanda Milling - 'the Member for Cannock Chase (Amanda Milling)'">Amanda Milling</a>, would have been delighted to take part in the debate, but she is currently hosting the premiers of the overseas territories at a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Ministerial_Council">Joint Ministerial Council</a> event, so I will respond on behalf of the Government. I will make some background points and then address some of the specific questions that my hon. Friend raised.</p> <p pid="d431.0/2">This continues to be the most concerning period in Hong Kong&#8217;s post-handover history. I acknowledge and share the deep concern of this House. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese">The Chinese</a> and Hong Kong authorities have taken a number of actions to stifle dissent and to suppress the expression of alternative political views in Hong Kong. Those include the imposition of the national security law in June last year, the mass arrest of politicians and activists, the disqualification of electoral candidates, and changes to Hong Kong&#8217;s own election processes.</p> <p pid="d431.0/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2021-10-25">25 October</phrase>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International">Amnesty International</a> announced that it would withdraw from Hong Kong by the end of this year. Amnesty says that the national security law is making it impossible to work freely without fear of Government reprisals. We have also seen the enforced closure of other non-governmental organisations and prosecution of their members under that law. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_Chinese">Mainland Chinese</a> and Hong Kong authorities have used the law to curtail freedoms, to punish dissent and to shrink the space for <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a>, free press and civil society.</p> <p pid="d431.0/4">Since 2016, the UK has declared four breaches of the Sino-British joint declaration in response to Beijing&#8217;s actions. The joint declaration was registered with the UN on <phrase class="date" code="2021-06-12">12 June</phrase> 1985. It is a legally binding international treaty that remains in force today. The joint declaration made it clear that Hong Kong&#8217;s high degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms would remain unchanged for 50 years from 1997. China undertook to uphold those freedoms of speech, of the press and of assembly, but the mainland Chinese authorities have shown an increasing propensity to breach their obligations in relation to Hong Kong. The national security law imposed on Hong Kong by Beijing in June 2020 contains a slew of measures that directly undermine those rights and freedoms. China&#8217;s own basic law for Hong Kong makes it clear that the territory should put forward and enact its own security legislation, but the direct imposition of the national security law clearly contravenes that.</p> <p pid="d431.0/5">Last year, China&#8217;s National People&#8217;s Congress <a href="/glossary/?gl=248" title="In a normal session there are up to ten standing committees on bills. Each..." class="glossary">Standing Committee</a> imposed new rules to disqualify elected legislators in Hong Kong. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_March">Last March</a>, the National People&#8217;s Congress unilaterally decided to change Hong Kong&#8217;s election system. The changes give Chinese authorities greater control over who stands for elected office. Last month, 55 district councillors were disqualified and over 250 were pressured to resign for political reasons. This is a systematic and determined effort by Beijing to bring Hong Kong under its control, erasing the space for alternative political views and for legitimate political debate.</p> <p pid="d431.0/6">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> are committed to holding China to account. We responded quickly and decisively to the enactment of the national security law. Following its introduction, the UK declared China to be in breach of the joint declaration, and we have declared two further breaches since then&#8212;that is three breaches in the space of just nine months. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> now believes that China is in an ongoing state of non-compliance with the joint declaration.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d433.1/1">Let me turn to exactly that point and to the specific points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Romford, starting with sanctions.</p> <p pid="d433.1/2">Since establishing the global human rights sanctions regime in July 2020, we have imposed sanctions on 78 individuals and entities involved in serious human rights violations or abuses, including in Belarus and Myanmar, as well as in Xinjiang in China. On <phrase class="date" code="2021-03-22">22 March</phrase>, the former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> announced that under the UK&#8217;s global human rights sanctions regime, the UK imposed asset freezes and travel bans against four <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> officials, as well as an asset freeze against one entity responsible for enforcing the repressive security policies against many areas of Xinjiang. Those measures were taken alongside the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US">US</a>, Canada and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU">EU</a>, sending a clear message to the Chinese Government that the international community will not turn a blind eye to such serious and systematic violations of basic human rights. Those listed face travel bans and asset freezes across the US, Canada, the EU and the UK. Together, we make up a third of global <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a>, which amplifies the impact and reach of our actions.</p> <p pid="d433.1/3">We will, of course, continue to consider sanctions, but I cannot speculate here who may be designated for sanctions in future, as that very speculation could undermine  the impact of the designation, if it happens&#8212;I hope that my hon. Friend understands exactly what I mean by that point. We will continue to consider them, but we cannot speculate because to speculate would undermine the impact.</p> <p pid="d433.1/4">My hon. Friend mentioned the participation of British judges in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Court_of_Final_Appeal">Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal</a>. British judges have played an important role in supporting the independence of Hong Kong&#8217;s judiciary since handover, but it is for the judges to make their own decisions about their continued service in Hong Kong. It is right, however, that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Supreme_Court">UK Supreme Court</a>, in discussion with our Government, continues to assess the situation in Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="d433.1/5">My hon. Friend raised concerns about young Hongkongers accessing the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> scheme. I reiterate that nearly 65,000 had applied for the BNO scheme by June, which shows how valuable it is. The BNO route reflects the UK&#8217;s historic and moral commitment to those who retained ties to the UK by taking out BNO status at the point of Hong Kong&#8217;s handover to China in 1997. Those with BNO status and eligible family members can come to the UK to live, study and work on a pathway to citizenship. Those who are not eligible for the BNO route may consider other UK immigration routes that are available. These include the new points-based system and the youth mobility scheme, which is open to those aged between 18 and 30.</p> <p pid="d433.1/6">My hon. Friend also raised the issue of those who had served with the armed forces&#8212;loyal Hongkongers who served Queen and country&#8212;and, like him, I have huge respect for the service they have given. He mentioned amendments that have been tabled to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality_and_Borders_Bill">Nationality and Borders Bill</a>. I am afraid I cannot answer those questions on asylum and immigration here at the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> because they will be for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a> to answer, but I thank him for putting those matters on the agenda this evening.</p> <p pid="d433.1/7">Let me be very clear: there is a stark and growing gulf between Beijing&#8217;s promises on Hong Kong and Beijing&#8217;s actions. We will continue to stand up for the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. We will continue to bring together like-minded partners, call out violations of Hong Kong&#8217;s rights and freedoms, and hold China to the obligation that it willingly undertook to safeguard the people of Hong Kong and their way of life.</p> <p pid="d433.1/8">Question put and agreed to.</p> <p pid="d433.1/9">House adjourned.</p>            </div>
