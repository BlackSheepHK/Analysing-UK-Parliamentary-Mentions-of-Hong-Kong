Gentleman&#8217;s first urgent question. He is an ever present ray of sunshine in Parliament, and we love him for it.</p> <p pid="a779.3/2">As the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> made clear yesterday, the arrest of a BBC journalist while covering the recent protests in Shanghai is a deeply disturbing and wholly unacceptable situation. Journalists must be able to do their job without fear of arrest of intimidation. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BBC">The BBC</a> has stated that the journalist was beaten and kicked by the police during his arrest, and was held for several hours before being released. In response, we are calling in the Chinese ambassador to make clear the unacceptable and unwarranted nature of those actions and the importance of freedom of speech, and to demand a full explanation. We have also been in close touch with the journalist and the BBC throughout to gather the facts and provide consular support.</p> <p pid="a779.3/3">We recognise that the covid-related restrictions in China are challenging for the Chinese people. We urge the Chinese authorities to respect the rights of those who decide to express their views about the situation. Moreover, as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> made clear yesterday in his <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansion_House">Mansion House</a> speech, the media&#8212;and, for that matter, our parliamentarians&#8212;must be able to highlight issues without fear of sanction or intimidation, whether in calling out human rights violations in Xinjiang and the curtailment of freedom in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, or in reporting on the recent protests.</p> <p pid="a779.3/4">This, of course, follows the recent incident in Manchester. As we have previously made clear to the House, the apparent behaviour of staff at the Chinese consulate general was wholly unacceptable. In view of the gravity of that incident, we summoned the Chinese charg&#233; d&#8217;affaires on <phrase class="date" code="2022-10-18">18 October</phrase> and delivered a clear message through our ambassador in Beijing. There is now an ongoing investigation and it would be wrong to pre-empt the findings.</p> <p pid="a779.3/5">More broadly, we recognise that China poses a systemic challenge to our values and interests, which, again, the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> highlighted yesterday. That challenge grows more acute as China moves towards greater authoritarianism. That is why we are taking robust action to protect our interests and stand up for our values. That includes imposing sanctions, leading action at the UN and strengthening our supply chain resilience. Let me assure Members that, as  part of our frank relationship with China, we will continue to raise our human rights concerns at the highest levels.</p>            </div>

I welcome the news that the Chinese ambassador has been summoned by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCDO">FCDO</a> to account for this arrest. I encourage the Minister to share&#8212;hopefully he can&#8212;all the justifications that will be given at that meeting. The reason given to the BBC by the Chinese authorities was that they had arrested <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Lawrence">Edward Lawrence</a> for his own good in case he caught covid from the crowd. Wow, what a pathetic answer! My goodness. Such was their concern for him, a senior journalist in the BBC and a British citizen, that the Chinese police beat him and kicked him as he tried to lawfully cover a peaceful protest in Shanghai. He had all the necessary permits and licences, and is a veteran reporter in China.</p> <p pid="a780.0/2">The first question we need to ask is: what assessment has the FCDO Minister made of the safety of British journalists in China following this assault? It is important to remember that the arrest and assault of Edward Lawrence is not the first attack on freedom of speech, but just another example in a long line of journalists and human rights defenders who have been silenced, arrested or simply disappeared by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist">Chinese Communist</a> party. This is the sixth urgent question granted in this parliamentary term on human rights abuses by the Chinese Communist party. We have seen the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCP">CCP</a> establishing incognito police stations in the UK, the assault of Bob Chan outside the Chinese consulate in Manchester, the Xinjiang police files highlighting horrendous crimes against the Uyghurs, and the arrest of pro-democracy activists in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>. This is unprecedented and needs urgent action.</p> <p pid="a780.0/3">This incident is part of a clear pattern of behaviour of increased crackdowns and restrictions on Chinese people within China and on British soil in the run-up to, and following, the 20th national congress of the Chinese Communist party last month. Last night at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Mayor">Lord Mayor</a>&#8217;s banquet, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> gave a speech stating that the &#8220;golden era&#8221; of China-UK relations was over. I welcome the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister">Prime Minister</a>&#8217;s commitment, which is worthy of saying. The director general of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI5">MI5</a> said that China represents</p> <p class="indent" pid="a780.0/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;the biggest long-term threat to Britain and the world&#8217;s economic and national security&#8221;.</p> <p pid="a780.0/5">Clearly, tougher action is needed to protect British citizens, human rights defenders, pro-democracy activists, and religious and ethnic minorities targeted by the CCP.</p>            </div>

The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> is reviewing our approach to transnational repression, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Security">Minister for Security</a> has committed to providing an update on that work to the House in due course. The hon. Gentleman rightly says that there are wider concerns about the increasing authoritarianism and muscular foreign policy of the Chinese, and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> rightly set out a new era of robust pragmatism, which we have seen grow over recent years, but which was clearly articulated by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister">Prime Minister</a> yesterday.</p>            </div>

Sadly, this is the approach and tone that we have come to expect from an increasingly authoritarian Chinese regime. That has been further demonstrated this week by the case in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> of the independent media outlet, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Daily">Apple Daily</a>, whose founder, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Lai">Jimmy Lai</a>, faces court cases in Hong King on basic freedom of expression for local people. We must show solidarity in that terrible situation, not just in Hong Kong but across the People&#8217;s Republic of China.</p> <p pid="a781.3/3">I welcome the fact that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> has summoned the Chinese ambassador, as well as the consular support that has been provided for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Lawrence">Mr Lawrence</a>.  The robust response is a welcome change to the Government&#8217;s previous handling of Chinese overreach in Manchester, which the House thought did not match the severity of the violence outside the Chinese consulate. Our support for the work of the press must be unified, and we stand squarely behind the Government in making it clear to Chinese officials that their treatment of journalists doing their job is not and never will be acceptable. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> have made it clear that the BBC must be protected in its crucial work abroad, tackling disinformation and providing reliable, accurate reporting&#8212;I am sure the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> agrees with that.</p> <p pid="a781.3/4">I have one question for the Minister. We are in the middle of profound cuts to the BBC World Service, including of Chinese journalists. Will the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office say on the record today that it will not defund Mandarin-speaking journalists, because, particularly in covid lockdown, it is crucial that individuals can listen to good journalism on our BBC World Service?</p>            </div>

He raises an important point about Manchester, about  which an investigation is ongoing. Unlike the Chinese, we will see that process through before we take action&#8212;and we will. On his broader point about the action that we will take, we have put sanctions in place in relation to the atrocities in Xinjiang, so action is being taken. We are also refreshing our integrated review, which will help us to create the framework in which further action can be taken as appropriate.</p>            </div>

Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)'">Jim Shannon</a> on securing this urgent question and I thank you, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, for granting it. It is important for the House to take account of the issue. Journalists deserve a special status anywhere: they tell the truth, they shed a light and they do a public service. They need support, so we express our support for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Lawrence">Edward Lawrence</a>. I am glad to hear that the ambassador will be summoned to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCDO">FCDO</a>, but, frankly, I would like to hear about more consequences. Bluntly, the Manchester investigation also seems to be taking longer than it needs to; I think the House would support consequences on that.</p> <p pid="a783.1/2">There is a wider issue at play. I am deeply concerned about the pressure that is building within China. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Communist">The Communist</a> party has boxed itself into a zero covid strategy that has been coupled with a terrifyingly low vaccine uptake, particularly among the elderly. That huge pressure could tend towards greater authoritarianism and a more violent crackdown. What assessment has the FCDO made of the risk to UK nationals in China? Does the advice need to change? On a humanitarian level, is there scope for assisting the Chinese state, for all its faults, with a catch-up vaccine roll-out? That might go some way to alleviating the humanitarian pressure that could tend towards worse consequences for the people of China.</p>            </div>
