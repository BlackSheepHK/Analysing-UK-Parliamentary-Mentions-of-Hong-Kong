It is fair to say that nobody needs to get into a small boat to reach safety. France is a safe country with a fully functioning asylum system, and the same applies to Belgium, Germany and countries across the European Union.</p> <p pid="c289.0/2">All people do by getting into a small boat is hand over significant sums of money to evil individuals who treat people as cargo and have no regard for human life. We have to bring it to an end, which is precisely what we seek to do with this Bill. I look forward to my right hon. Friend&#8217;s support in the Lobby, as we have had throughout the Bill&#8217;s passage.</p> <p pid="c289.0/3">Government amendments 19 to 25 to <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 12 make small technical amendments to apply the provisions in the clause to asylum seekers or failed asylum seekers who are supported under existing legislation if and when uncommenced provisions come into force.</p> <p pid="c289.0/4">Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 26 to clause 15, in respect of a &#8220;reasonable period&#8221;, will amend the provisions relating to the inadmissibility of asylum claims from claimants with a connection to a safe third country. As I have set out, the Government are clear that people should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach, rather than make dangerous journeys to the UK to claim asylum here. Inadmissibility is a long-standing process designed to prevent secondary movements across Europe. Inadmissibility measures are being moved from the immigration rules into primary legislation to support the process. We acknowledge that there are circumstances in which it may be appropriate to consider such cases here in the UK. We are removing the power to consider an asylum claim that has been declared inadmissible in the UK where it is unlikely to be possible to remove the claimant to a safe third country within a reasonable period. Instead, this will be set out in the immigration rules.</p> <p pid="c289.0/5">Amendments 27 to 38, 44, 45 and 91 to 93 relate to the evidence notice and the priority removal notice. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Asylum">The Asylum</a> and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Act 2004 requires decision makers to take into account certain behaviours that may be deemed damaging to a claimant&#8217;s credibility when they assess a protection of human rights claim. Those behaviours include concealing information, obstructing or delaying the handling of a claim, providing late evidence, and not acting in good faith, along with behaviours that are designed or are likely to mislead. It is right that all decision makers, including the tribunal, should clearly set out when and how they have taken into account the claimant&#8217;s credibility when they assess a protection of human rights claim.</p> <p pid="c289.0/6">The remainder of the Government amendments in the group are minor and technical and make sure that all the measures that relate to the priority removal notice operate in the manner intended.</p>            </div>

The length of time it takes to process claims is unacceptable and we need to improve the situation. The Government&#8217;s intention is clearly stated: to improve the way we process claims. We expect individuals who seek to claim asylum in this country to comply with the requirements, but of course safety nets are in place, for good reasons, so that it will be taken appropriately into account if people cannot meet the deadlines. We believe that progressing on the basis of processing claims more quickly and removing those with no right to be here will make quite a significant difference. Importantly, it is also about the work that we do not just with our nearest neighbours in, for example, France and Belgium&#8212;that collaboration is important and is delivering results, and we want to secure a returns agreement that will help to build on that&#8212;but further upstream in removing those with no right to be here back to source countries.</p>            </div>

One of the things we have been very clear about is that we want to expand community sponsorship in particular, but a number of schemes that are already being delivered are making a considerable difference. We should not forget that 15,000 people were airlifted out of Afghanistan over the summer. Nor should we forget that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> route in relation to Hong Kong is a valuable and important route that is helping to provide sanctuary to many individuals. That is an ambitious offer that we have made.</p>            </div>

The revised text, which reflects wording in the primary legislation that sets the statutory framework for tribunal rules, specifies that judges should only remove an appeal from the accelerated or expedited process where there is no other way to secure that justice be done.</p> <p pid="c292.4/3">Amendments 48 to 50 are minor and technical amendments to <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 34 on internal relocation. They clarify the ambiguity in the current drafting that has the potential to be interpreted in an unintended way, where an individual could only be internally relocated within a country where they had previously been in that part of the country.</p> <p pid="c292.4/4">The purpose of amendments 51 to 59 is to increase the maximum penalty for the existing statutory offence of overstaying, which is currently six months&#8217; imprisonment. That maximum penalty dates back to the original legislation&#8212;the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_1971">Immigration Act 1971</a>&#8212;and is no longer considered sufficient for the present day. Given how  much the world has changed over the past 50 years, the existing penalty hinders our ability to deter overstayers, and we consider that raising it would encourage better compliance. Clause 39 introduces a new maximum penalty of four years to align with illegal entry and other similar offences that have already been amended during the passage of the Bill.</p> <p pid="c292.4/5">In Committee, I promised to bring forward amendments to protect <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_National_Lifeboat_Institution">Royal National Lifeboat Institution</a> individuals rescuing persons at sea and those in charge of vessels who find stowaways on board. I am pleased to say that this is now set out in amendments 60 to 63. I am grateful to Members across the House who have raised concerns in relation to this matter, and I am delighted to be able to put it beyond doubt this afternoon.</p>            </div>

Friend, who makes the case so eloquently for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNLI">RNLI</a>, and sets out the incredible work that its volunteers and others do to protect life at sea, along with many other agencies, such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty">Her Majesty</a>&#8217;s Coastguard, which works tirelessly around the clock, often in very difficult circumstances. I certainly join her in placing on record the Government&#8217;s thanks and appreciation for everything they do, and for the individuals in her area who do this tireless work, day in, day out, and week in, week out.</p> <p pid="c293.1/2">We have made the clear and unambiguous statement that people do not commit an offence of facilitation if the act is done by, on behalf of, or co-ordinated by Her Majesty&#8217;s Coastguard or an overseas equivalent. This provides protection not only for organisations such as the RNLI, but individual seafarers who respond to mayday relays.</p> <p pid="c293.1/3">I end by addressing amendments 94 and 95, which are among a number of measures that we are bringing forward in the Bill to strengthen our efforts to tackle clandestine migrants seeking to enter the UK in vehicles. We will work with representatives of the transport industry to devise and set out new regulations that detail how to secure a vehicle, conduct checks on vehicle security, report attempts of unauthorised access, and keep evidence of steps taken to prevent unauthorised access to the vehicle. These changes are necessary, as a high proportion of drivers and hauliers continue to fail to secure their vehicle properly, and often run the risk of being targeted by migrants who rely on going undetected. There is a human cost to this traffic. Criminal gangs are preying on vulnerable people and shipping them across the UK border like human cargo. We must all take responsibility for preventing that.</p> <p pid="c293.1/4">With that, I draw my remarks to a close. In the wind-up, I will be happy to pick up on the various other points that will no doubt be raised.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c294.0/1">This Bill is a sham. It does nothing to create safe routes for resettlement, nothing to garner international support for breaking people-smuggling gangs, and nothing to support victims of modern-day slavery. Instead, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality_and_Borders_Bill">Nationality and Borders Bill</a> creates unworkable policies, lets down victims who have been trafficked, and breaks our international obligations. The Bill is a smoke-and-mirrors trick, designed to deflect attention from the Government&#8217;s failings and incompetence in the area of asylum and refugee protection.</p> <p pid="c294.0/2">It is shameful that since the abandonment of the Dubs <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>, the UK has turned its back on unaccompanied child refugees and young people in need of protection. Young people are having to turn to people-smuggling gangs. We need to make sure that the model is broken. People have died during dangerous crossings, and it is important that we tackle the criminal people-smuggling gangs. To do that, we need international co-operation and greater security, and that is why Labour Members have tabled new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 50, which would make advertising people-smuggling routes via social media an offence. If the Government are serious about tackling the gangs, we cannot see why they would have any problem supporting the new clause.</p> <p pid="c294.0/3">Smugglers and trafficking gangs are putting people&#8217;s lives at risk, and they use social media to promote, encourage, advertise and organise these dangerous crossings. Too often, when the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Crime_Agency">National Crime Agency</a> asks Facebook, TikTok and others to take down dangerous material, they refuse. We have to strike at the heart of this illegal and dangerous operation. That is why we propose a new, additional criminal offence; it would not replace existing offences. The new offence would make it clear beyond doubt that such material is illegal and dangerous, that we will prosecute those responsible for it, and that we expect social media companies to take it down.</p> <p pid="c294.0/4">It is well known that people-smugglers promote dangerous routes on social media platforms including Facebook and TikTok. They often promise easy journeys at an extremely high cost. Those who are interested may be told to send private direct messages to the smugglers, because they know that private conversations are encrypted and much more difficult for police and intelligence agencies to access. If the Government are serious about tackling the criminal gangs profiting from people&#8217;s desperation, they must take urgent action to tackle the problem online. At the moment, they talk tough, but the policing and intelligence response is failing to keep up. The Government should back Labour&#8217;s new clause 50 today. Those seeking to profit online from people&#8217;s desperation must be made to feel the full force of the law.</p> <p pid="c294.0/5">As everyone in the Chamber knows, the Dubs amendment was passed in May 2016 by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron">David Cameron</a>&#8217;s Government in the wake of an increase in refugees arriving from Europe. It required Ministers to relocate and support asylum-seeking children from the continent. It was initially envisaged that the Dubs scheme would offer settlement to 3,000 children, but the number of places was capped at 480. In May 2020, it emerged that the smaller quota had been filled, and the scheme was abandoned. Ever since, Members from across the political spectrum have warned that this bad decision would force hundreds of vulnerable children to turn to people-smuggling gangs for assistance in travelling to Britain, placing them at greater risk of trafficking.</p> <p pid="c294.0/6">The Government&#8217;s inaction has been deeply depressing. Ministers have shown a callous disregard for the plight of children. When debating these issues, Ministers have made the shameful claim that so-called pull factors for refugees are a reason not to help unaccompanied children to safety.</p>            </div>

It is well known that family reunion leads to better outcomes in terms of the ability of people to integrate. It is also well known that it is only with international co-operation that we can expect other countries to accept the safe return of individuals, where appropriate. We believe that new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 49 is a sensible and proportionate measure to tackle the issues we face.</p> <p pid="c296.6/3">This brings me on to new clause 51, which does two things. First, it places the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme on a statutory footing to make sure that it is fully implemented. Secondly, it calls on the Government to draw up the scheme in a way that helps prevent people from being exploited by people traffickers and smugglers. The Government have accepted that safe and legal routes are important as an alternative to dangerous routes run by criminal gangs, but they have not implemented or designed safe and legal routes. That is why we propose that the resettlement scheme be designed in a way that allows those fleeing persecution in Afghanistan who have family in the UK to apply to be included in the resettlement scheme. There would be a specified opportunity for family members to apply under the scheme. The Government have already consulted on ensuring that these family members do not end up being exploited by criminal gangs, and have promised them a route to reuniting with their family members, so we see no reason why the new clause should be controversial, or why the Government would not open the scheme and allow family reunion within it.</p> <p pid="c296.6/4">It has been absolutely shocking to hear at first hand the stories of desperate people who are eligible to come here from Afghanistan being effectively abandoned. I have had Chevening scholars contact my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> office who have been left without any support at all, and  without any prospect of a safe route from that country. Other MPs have told me about people who have worked closely with the British but have also been left vulnerable&#8212;interpreters, women who worked as lawyers, and many others whose lives are under threat from the Taliban. Again, if the Government are serious about drawing people away from the people smugglers and offering them safe routes, then they need to get a grip of this situation.</p>            </div>

That is absolutely integral to making sure that we have the measures in place to deal with the problems we face.</p> <p pid="c297.5/2">Ministers have talked a lot about the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme, but where are the results? We have been waiting since August for the scheme to be implemented, and it still has not been. People are dying. They do not have four years to wait. It is time for action, not words.</p> <p pid="c297.5/3">We should be looking after people who put their lives on the line by loyally serving the nation. It is nothing short of outrageous that visas for foreigners who served in the UK armed forces cost &#163;2,389. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_2020">In 2020</a>, there were 5,110 Commonwealth citizens serving in the armed forces. Each year, about 500 of them choose to leave, and those who choose to stay in the UK are compelled to pay extortionate visa fees. A Government consultation has, as we know, proposed scrapping the fees for those who have completed 12 years&#8217; service in the armed forces. Labour has campaigned long and hard for that change, but we believe the proposed qualification period is far too long, and we call on the Government to right that wrong and change the period of qualification. I am grateful to the two largest veterans charities, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_British_Legion">Royal British Legion</a> and Help for Heroes, for their campaigning work on this issue. They are clear that they believe the current situation is gravely unfair, and it is time the Government started honouring their promise to the armed forces.</p>            </div>

We very much support waiving the fees for them to become British citizens.</p> <p pid="c298.5/2">I will move on. <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 11 is a particularly pernicious part of the Bill. As well as creating two tiers of refugees, it seeks to criminalise some refugees according to how they arrive in the UK. Criminalising people who are seeking our protection is a clear breach of the refugee convention and our obligations under international law. Let us consider the implications of that. Under clause 11, it is possible that an Afghan national facing persecution from the Taliban, Uyghur Muslims facing persecution in China, or a Syrian national facing persecution in Syria, could be criminalised. They could be criminalised merely for the way they arrive in the UK, yet their claim for asylum due to the persecution they faced has not lessened because of their means of arriving in the UK&#8212;of course it hasn&#8217;t. While the Government do little to secure safe and legal routes for persecuted groups, it is cruel to criminalise people who are escaping torture or death. Moreover, no evidence has ever been produced to suggest that such a measure will deter those irregular journeys, as the Government claim.</p> <p pid="c298.5/3">As a report by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee_on_Human_Rights">Joint Committee on Human Rights</a> pointed out, the Bill is littered with measures that are simply incompatible with human rights law and the UK&#8217;s obligations under international treaties. That is one reason why Labour believes that amendments 105 and 98 are necessary. By removing the term &#8220;for gain&#8221;, the Government are creating a situation where anyone in the channel who helps people in distress, as is their duty under maritime law, could be criminalised. That is clearly wrong, both morally and legally, and we strongly  urge the Government to accept <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 105. It is equally the case, as stated in amendment 98, that there should be safeguards against endangering life at sea. As the Joint Committee on Human Rights recommended, it must be made certain that maritime enforcement powers cannot be used in a manner that would endanger lives.</p> <p pid="c298.5/4">This is a bad Bill, and we hope that the Government will take heed of the amendments we support. Only through international co-operation, safe and legal routes, and targeted measures against criminal gangs can we, with our international partners, improve the current situation.</p>            </div>

There has been wide, broad, and deep support for action on this issue over the past few days, including from people who really do not like to get involved in politics. Whether it is the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_British_Legion">Royal British Legion</a>, Help for Heroes and the veteran community or beyond, in our communities up and down the country, people recognise the morality behind the issue of charging those who serve to live in this country.</p> <p pid="c299.0/2">I speak to all sorts of people in the veterans community. Last night, I had a conversation with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry">Prince Harry</a> about this. He has contributed hugely to the veterans debate and I wanted his view. He said to me, &#8220;It&#8217;s not only morally right but would mean so much to those who have given so much.&#8221; That is not a political <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>; it demonstrates the moral purpose of this measure. It is an almost &#8220;effortless change&#8221;, as he said, for this Government to make, for us to finally see through what we have said to these people for so long. We owe it to them. They are our brothers and sisters. They have served with us over many years. I recognise that there are things going around today saying how we should not be doing this in primary legislation, for lots of reasons. I will come to that in a minute, but this has been going on for 20 years for these people, and at some point we have to grasp the nettle and make sure that we look after them.</p> <p pid="c299.0/3">The money is meaningless. I will address the figures that have been put out by the Government and others. On Monday, I was told that the Government could not do this because it would cost &#163;160 million. That is garbage. Do not take my word for it; look at the Royal British Legion, which has campaigned on this issue for many years. I pay tribute to Members across the House, including those on the Conservative side, who have been <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Ministers">Defence Ministers</a> and have tried to deal with this problem but have hit the same issues we are hitting at the moment.</p> <p pid="c299.0/4">On that &#163;160 million, the Royal British Legion has studied the figures. If someone who served in the military in this country applies for a visa, all their dependants use a special code. Someone can only use that code if they have served or they are a dependant, so we can pull the data between 2016 and 2020. It has never cost more than &#163;1 million a year, so the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of those fees are profit&#8212;a charge on our service personnel to stay here.</p> <p pid="c299.0/5">Let me address the consultation issue and the 12-year period. I do not want to air dirty linen in public, but I was there when that 12-year figure was decided on. It was done on a visit. It was plucked out of the air. There is no evidence whatsoever to back it up. There is evidence in the Department that someone from a foreign or Commonwealth country who serves in the military is likely to serve between six and seven years. Twelve years is well outside that. It is well beyond what our peer nations do, it is well beyond what our allies do, and it is incredibly unkind to these individuals who have worked and served for so long.</p> <p pid="c299.0/6">I have given the moral case and the financial case, but ultimately this decision comes down to Conservative Members. The whole country is aligned on this issue, and it has been for a very long time. All the political parties will support new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 52 except the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a>, and we are the ones who made a promise that we would do something about this. That is unconscionable. Colleagues can of course take the calls from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Secretary">Defence Secretary</a> and others, with these figures that I have demonstrated are not true, or they can think about what they are here to do.</p> <p pid="c299.0/7">I am here to represent the Fijian family in Plymouth who left the military after nine years having fought in Afghanistan and Iraq; they may have been members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Special_Forces">United Kingdom Special Forces</a> group&#8212;a relentless operational tempo. Finally they leave, their kids go to school and they save up for a house, but they have to pay a &#163;10,000 bill to stay in this country that they fought for over so many years. Can colleagues really look that family in the eye and say, &#8220;No, you have to pay; we have to make a profit out of you for you to stay in this country, despite the fact that you were prepared to commit so much to the privileges and the freedoms we enjoy&#8221;?</p> <p pid="c299.0/8">Finally, I say to colleagues that the tide changes very quickly in politics. This issue has been around for 20 years now, and the tide changes. I know what it is like when people put the screws on and ask you to vote a certain way, but the tide changes. All we can do is what we think is right on the day. The moral and financial case for this measure has never been clearer, and I urge colleagues to consider it carefully before they cast their vote.</p>            </div>

Indeed, there are a range of new clauses from both sides of the House, from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Benchers">Back Benchers</a> in particular, that seek to add safe routes, and they all have our support. For our part, we have tabled new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 35, which would expand refugee family reunion in a way that this House supported in 2018 in the private Member&#8217;s Bill introduced by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=12004" title="Our page on Angus MacNeil - 'the Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Angus Brendan MacNeil)'">Angus Brendan MacNeil</a>.</p> <p pid="c301.0/2">Our other proposals try once more to limit some of the harm that the Bill will do at every stage in the asylum process. However, let me first welcome the amendments from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee_on_Human_Rights">Joint Committee on Human Rights</a> and others regarding the appalling maritime pushback clauses and the criminalisation of rescuers&#8212;provisions that risk serious harm even before an asylum seeker is able to enter the asylum process.</p> <p pid="c301.0/3">For those seeking asylum in the UK who do get here, is it not outrageous that they will be criminalised under an offence in clause 39 punishable by up to four years in prison? That is why our <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 116 states clearly and simply that if Afghans, Syrians, Uyghurs, Christian converts or others are at risk of persecution in their countries of nationality, their mere entry or arrival for the purposes of seeking asylum is not a crime. Is it not extraordinary that that very idea has to be debated?</p> <p pid="c301.0/4">Clause 11 means that, having faced the criminal justice system, our Afghan and his colleagues will be stuck in one of the Government&#8217;s asylum warehouses. We say that we should not go down that path&#8212;a path that the Irish have just rejected as utterly failed and that brought shocking results at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napier_Barracks">Napier Barracks</a>&#8212;and that we should make community dispersal work. Our new clause 36 would ensure that dispersal authorities get the funding they need to undertake their vital role.</p> <p pid="c301.0/5">Clause 15 means that, stuck in that warehouse, the Syrian and his colleagues will have to wait for months on end before their asylum cases are looked at, because their claims will be deemed inadmissible under a ludicrously broad range of criteria that will allow the Home Secretary to say that another country should take responsibility&#8212;even if there is not the remotest chance of that actually happening, there is no real reason why it should happen or there are strong reasons, such as family ties, why the claim should actually be considered here. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> could even insist that a human rights-abusing country that pays no more than lip service to the refugee convention should take charge, even when our Syrian or Afghan has absolutely no connection to that country whatever.</p> <p pid="c301.0/6">Amendments 132 to 142, drafted with advice from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a>, seek to put the necessary safeguards and restrictions in place. We are not saying that it is never appropriate for other countries to be asked to take over responsibility, but crucial safeguards must exist, and they are absolutely nowhere in this Bill. Already this year, 7,000 or so people  have had their claims put on hold through inadmissibility procedures. Just 10 were removed. The remaining 6,990 are either still waiting or have been moved into the asylum process. They have been waiting for absolutely no good reason at all and almost certainly at a cost of tens of millions of pounds to the taxpayer. The whole set-up is absolutely ludicrous.</p> <p pid="c301.0/7">Having toughed out the additional delays, the Uyghur and his colleagues will find that it is the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> that finally considers their asylum claims, but we ask why. Time and again the Home Office has shown itself as not fit for purpose, which is why new clause 37 asks us to look to the Canadian model of an independent asylum decision-making body, to ensure that protection claims no longer suffer from political interference and politically motivated targets. Sadly, far from supporting independent decision making, a whole series of pernicious clauses in the Bill would see this Parliament telling decision makers what inferences to draw about evidence provided as part of a claim. We say, &#8220;Leave assessments of evidence to the decision makers who actually see it. We don&#8217;t get to see it.&#8221; That is why amendments 118 to 120 seek to remove clauses 18, 21 and 25.</p> <p pid="c301.0/8">By redefining parts of the refugee convention in this Bill, the Government make it more difficult for our Christian convert and his colleagues to prove their need for international protection. Amendments 144 and 147 seek to fix two of the most dangerous examples of that. The impact of clause 31 is that if a decision maker is 49% sure that a person is a Christian convert, and 100% sure that they will be persecuted and tortured to death in their home country if they are, that person will no longer be recognised as a refugee because the balance of probabilities test at the first stage is not met&#8212;49% sure that a person will be tortured to death, yet they are not recognised as a refugee.</p> <p pid="c301.0/9">Amendment 144 scraps that horrendous test and reverts to the existing test of a real risk of serious harm. Likewise, amendment 147 fixes provisions in clause 32 that seek to overturn important and established case law and would make it harder for people to make claims based on membership of a particular social group.</p> <p pid="c301.0/10">Most outrageously, the Afghan and his colleagues might have their claims considered not here at all, but at a so-called offshore centre, replicating one of the most disgraceful episodes in Australian policymaking&#8212;an episode that saw human rights abuses rife, health and wellbeing massacred, exponential costs, utterly inadequate capacity and a total policy failure that led to its abandonment. We fully support the amendments to take those provisions out of the Bill.</p>            </div>

Friend adds helpfully to that.</p> <p pid="c303.0/2">Despite all that, our Syrian, Afghan and Uyghur will almost certainly be recognised as refugees, but let us say that the persecuted Christian convert is refused because the judge is only 49% that he will be murdered on removal. Of those who challenge refusals, around 40% have been successful on appeal in recent years, but in this Bill appeal rights are restricted yet again, and certain appeal processes are accelerated.</p> <p pid="c303.0/3">Our <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 121 would delete the Government&#8217;s attempt to reinstate the detained fast-track process, which was previously ruled unlawful. Amendment 145 removes another expedited appeal process. It is the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> that needs to address delays, not our tribunals. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_SNP">The SNP</a> is also fully behind cross-party attempts to place time limits on the use of detention.</p> <p pid="c303.0/4">Even if our persecuted Christian, after appeal, joins the others in being recognised as a refugee, the misery this Bill will inflict on them is far from complete. The group will now face all the discriminatory measures heaped on by <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 11, which empowers the Home Secretary to punish recognised refugees through the insecurity of temporary residence, through no recourse to public funds, through limited family reunion and any other form of discrimination or punishment she thinks fit. It is a truly astonishing and outrageous provision. Amendment 114 specifically exempts Afghans, Syrians, Uyghurs, Christian converts and other refugees from such disgraceful treatment, and we fully support amendment 8 to remove the clause altogether.</p> <p pid="c303.0/5">If our Afghan or any of the others happens to be a young person whose age is challenged, the Bill risks making life especially difficult for them, thanks to the provisions of part 4, rammed into the Bill in Committee against the advice of numerous organisations and experts. The clauses will ramp up the use of age assessments by altering established guidance on when assessments are required, requiring them even when there is no reason to doubt a child&#8217;s age. They will allow the Home Office to meddle in an area that should be a matter for child protection and safeguarding teams, and to introduce new, unsupported, inaccurate and unethical scientific methods of assessment. Our amendments 122 to 126 seek to undo the damage of those provisions and leave those with expertise, not an anti-refugee agenda, in charge.</p> <p pid="c303.0/6">Finally, our new clause 32 simply requires the Bill to be interpreted so far as possible in line with the refugee convention. If the Government maintain there is nothing contrary to the convention in the Bill, surely they will have no problem with that new clause? The reality is, as numerous published legal opinions show, that these provisions are a blatant assault on the refugee convention, and the most vulnerable in the world will suffer. Our amendments seek to ameliorate some of the most outrageous aspects of the Bill, but the truth is that the whole thing needs to be canned.</p>            </div>

They then bring their families across and, with the benefits that they claim&#8212;not to mention education and housing&#8212;they enter what they believe to be the land of milk and honey. The returns are negligible because of the human rights legislation, as it stands.</p>            </div>

The Government have provided a remedy partially in this Bill but not yet regarding the full legal framework of the Human Rights Act, the European convention on human rights, EU retained law and the refugee convention of 1951, as amended with universal application in 1967 by a protocol. On EU retained law alone, I have found on the Government&#8217;s website in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives">National Archives</a> that this amounts to as many as 123 directives and regulations, spelling out masses of <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> relating to asylum and immigration that originated in EU law and are now on our statute book, although a few have been revoked.</p> <p pid="c304.2/3">The official <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> policy guidance for asylum screening is still essentially based on the same law, and it makes for dismal reading. It is essential that that is changed. At present, an asylum claim must be registered where an individual fears persecution or serious harm of persecution for any given reason on return to their country. How to evaluate a fear varies with every individual and can in many cases be deliberately exaggerated.</p> <p pid="c304.2/4">To be recognised as a refugee under the UN refugee convention, the claimant can assert that they have a well-founded fear of persecution and be not only unable, but unwilling, to go back to their country of origin or habitual residence. That can be invoked on grounds which include mere political opinions. Furthermore, they can claim that they are within the judicial sphere of &#8220;the humanitarian protection policy&#8221;, and the discretion as to whether an asylum claim should be accepted is  heavily weighted in favour of asylum, even if the claimants do not even use the term &#8220;asylum&#8221; when they arrive on our shores.</p> <p pid="c304.2/5">A paper by the highly distinguished former professor of law at Oxford, John Finnis, and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Murray">Simon Murray</a> explains in graphic terms the law and case law in more than 100 pages of detailed analysis. They conclude that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=199" title="Also referred to as the ECHR, the European Court of Human Rights was..." class="glossary">European Court of Human Rights</a> has wrongly circumvented fundamental principles originated in the European convention on human rights and the 1951 refugee convention. They also argue that, properly interpreted, the UK and other signatory states have no obligation to let in refugees arriving at our borders en masse, have no legal or treaty obligation to accept refuges at all, and have no obligation to provide asylum for dangerous refugees, such as criminals and terrorists.</p> <p pid="c304.2/6">The European Court, by radical and unwarranted interpretation, has used the article 3 provisions on torture and inhuman treatment and the article 8 provisions on the right to private and family life to extend the ambit of claimants to encourage them to engage in unlawful immigration. That has been done through the formula of so-called living instruments and recent UK judicial rulings that have continuously expanded claimants&#8217; rights within the judicial system. Claimants are granted repetitive appeals that bring the immigration system under intense pressure at monumental expense to the taxpayer, with grave political consequences on the doorstep.</p> <p pid="c304.2/7">We need to pull the rug from under the traffickers&#8217; feet, save the lives of those who are exploited by them, and protect our own manifesto promises. Despite the Government&#8217;s good intentions in aspects of the Bill, we must solve the fundamental problems presented by the human rights legislation and the legal framework of the provisions that I have mentioned. We cannot continue, with unwarranted interpretation and judgments by the judiciary, to allow illegal immigration.</p> <p pid="c304.2/8">I seek robust assurances today from the Government to resolve the matter by legislation, and I will press my <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> unless I get them. We cannot go on kicking the can down the yellow brick road. The journey has begun, but the question is where it ends. The yellow brick road is not only in disrepair, as it was in &#8220;The Wizard of Oz&#8221;, but littered with political precipices.</p>            </div>

We also concluded that there should be no immunity from prosecution if criminal offences are committed by border  officials, particularly where they lead to loss of life; our amendment 100 would deal with that. I hope that the Government will accept both amendments.</p> <p pid="c305.0/4">Our amendments 96 to 99 would deal with the major issues relating to pushbacks. The Bill provides greater powers for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Force">Border Force</a> to &#8220;board, divert and detain&#8221; vessels. The Government acknowledge that crossings are perilous; this debate takes place in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> of the 27 people who drowned in the channel. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> was clear in his evidence to the Joint Committee that he does not want Government action to be the cause of yet more lives lost. Of course not.</p> <p pid="c305.0/5">Our amendment 97 would circumscribe the new powers to ensure that they could not be used against unseaworthy vessels such as dinghies. Our amendment 98 would ensure that they could not</p> <p class="indent" pid="c305.0/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;be used in a manner&#8230;that could endanger life at sea.&#8221;</p> <p pid="c305.0/7">Our amendment 96 would ensure that they could be used only in a way that complies with international maritime law, which the Government say they want to comply with. The Minister said in evidence to us that that is the Government&#8217;s intention and that they would make that intention clear in operational directions&#8212;but if the power is in the Bill, so should the protections be.</p> <p pid="c305.0/8">Given the Government&#8217;s intention, what reason could they possibly have to oppose the amendments? The Government have a big <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> and can whip to vote them down, but the amendments have been tabled by a cross-party Committee of both Houses, they have been expertly drafted by our legal counsel, and they represent what the Government say is their intention.</p> <p pid="c305.0/9">The Minister is new and enthusiastic in his role. He was very forthcoming in his evidence to our Committee, and he and I have spoken about the subject privately, for which I am grateful. I offer him a bit of advice: not to be the Minister who votes our amendments down just because he can, not to be the Minister who makes his <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Benchers">Back Benchers</a> vote against ensuring that lives are not endangered&#8212;that is not the right thing for him to do&#8212;and not to be the Minister who gives new powers to Border Force that cost lives at sea.</p> <p pid="c305.0/10">Our amendments allow for the new powers, but make them compliant with international law and make them safe. The Government have no reason to oppose the amendments, so I hope that the Minister will say to his colleagues and his civil servants that he wants to reflect on them because he does not want to stand in the way of putting the Government&#8217;s intentions on the face of the Bill. If the Government do oppose the amendments, we will seek to press amendment 98 to a <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing.

May I also say what a particular pleasure it was to hear my old friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> make such a measured and balanced case? I was very proud of him. That does not mean that we are going to agree on everything, as he will hear in a minute, but I think that he put a very good case.</p> <p pid="c306.0/2">The current asylum system is broken not just for us but for most of Europe; we should understand that this is not simply a national issue. It rewards smuggling  gangs who prey on the desperate, it punishes those with genuine needs through bureaucratic impediments and it pushes the most vulnerable into harm&#8217;s way. We know, of course, that thousands have arrived across the channel and dozens, at least, have died as a result. We must find a system that destroys the criminal network underpinning this crisis, vigorously pursues enhanced co-operation with the French and other European parties, and distinguishes properly between economic migrants and those fleeing persecution. At present, we do not do that properly.</p> <p pid="c306.0/3">I believe that the Home Secretary is entirely committed to these approaches but, unfortunately, while I think that this is a very good Bill in many ways, one element of it&#8212;offshoring&#8212;sacrifices our long-term values to short-term political expediency, with fairly little chance of success.</p>            </div>

My right hon. Friend is right about the pull factor, and there are many other things we can do. I have had discussions with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> about, for example, improving our surveillance. The irony is that at the moment Frontex, using British surveillance operations, does a better job in the Mediterranean than the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> does in the channel. There are many things we can do, and yes, I will look at all available options, as long as they are humane.</p> <p pid="c307.1/2"><a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 28 and schedule 3 grant the Home Office the legal powers to create an offshore processing system. I am afraid I must say to those on this side of the House that it is based on something of a mythology. It is based on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government">Australian Government</a>&#8217;s approach in 2013. Its scope would allow children, modern slavery victims and torture survivors to be detained offshore, in a place where we have little legal control. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian">The Australian</a> model of offshoring was seriously problematic on a humanitarian level, and the supposed deterrent effect of the policy was really down to an aggressive push-back policy. What the Australians did was push those ships back effectively into the middle of the Pacific, or Indonesian waters in the Pacific. That was the biggest impact. It relates to the point made by my right hon. Friend about the attractiveness of these things.</p> <p pid="c307.1/3">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_Council_of_Australia">Refugee Council of Australia</a> has documented the gut-wrenching sexual, physical and mental abuse that has pushed vulnerable children toward suicide. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_14">A 14</a>-year-old girl, held offshore for five years, doused herself in petrol and tried to set herself alight; fortunately, she was stopped. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_10">A 10</a>-year-old boy attempted suicide three times. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_12">A 12</a>-year-old boy, held offshore for five years,  had to be medically transferred to Australia because he had tried to starve himself to death and had reached the point at which he could not even stand up because he was so weak.</p> <p pid="c307.1/4">Members might think that these are isolated cases, but tragically they are not. From May 2013 to October 2015, there were 2,116 documented assaults, sexual abuse cases or self-harm attempts. More than half of them applied to children. I say that more than half applied to children; only one fifth of the asylum seekers were actually children. So that is an astonishing humanitarian record for that policy.</p> <p pid="c307.1/5">I know there is a lot of doorstep politics involved in this, but if this were to happen on our watch, just imagine how the public would respond to serious harm being done to a child nominally in our care. Remember what happened when the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Kurdish">Iranian Kurdish</a> child of four was shown drowned on a Greek beach? It would be something like that, but in our own control. I do not want to see any <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a> of any persuasion facing that.</p>            </div>

I do not except anybody from that. What I am trying to do here is to let people know what will happen, before we are fixed with the system and then find ourselves defending something that may turn out to be indefensible. That is my real concern about this element of the Bill, and in my view, the biggest argument is on humanitarian issues.</p> <p pid="c308.1/2">Also, as <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a>, we should think about the cost. By any measure, this will be eye-wateringly expensive. At the moment, we spend &#163;1.4 billion annually on asylum costs. That is about &#163;11,000 per asylum seeker. Australia has spent &#163;4.3 billion on just over 3,000 asylum seekers. That is about &#163;1.38 million per person. As an ex-<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Accounts_Committee">Public Accounts Committee</a> Chairman, I looked rather askance at that and went through it with a fine-toothed comb, and I can tell the House that it is right. If we applied that cost to our asylum situation, we would be talking about something like &#163;34 billion or &#163;35 billion, which is the size of the Government Department. Let us imagine that we were twice as effective as that: the cost would still be &#163;17 billion. Are we really talking about doing something like that? The reason for this is, of course, that we would effectively have to bribe the country that would take the asylum seekers.</p>            </div>

Remember the hostile environment policy that we lived with for a long time? It did not work. We tried it and it brought our reputation down, so thank you for that. My hon. Friend is right to talk about the pull effect and the deterrent effect. They are all important, but we have to do this in such a way that we can stand by and be proud of it at the end of the policy.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c309.1/1">I am in favour of a number of amendments, but for the purposes of time I will largely keep my comments to new clauses 12 and 13 in my own name and new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 14 tabled by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25856" title="Our page on Bell Ribeiro-Addy - 'the Member for Streatham (Bell Ribeiro-Addy)'">Bell Ribeiro-Addy</a>. New clause 12 would provide recourse to public funds to everyone holding a valid UK residence permit. New clause 13 would repeal the sections in the 2014 and 2016 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Acts">Immigration Acts</a> that restrict undocumented migrants&#8217; access to work and services. New clause 14 seeks to abolish the immigration health surcharge. I am pleased these new clauses have received lots of support from Members across the House.</p> <p pid="c309.1/2">It will perhaps be obvious to colleagues that these new clauses are about addressing the unjust suffering caused by the Government&#8217;s hostile environment, a term used to describe all the policies that make life difficult for migrants living in the UK by explicitly and deliberately treating them as less deserving of dignity and humanity than British citizens.</p> <p pid="c309.1/3">My new clause 13, in particular, seeks to overturn the denial of basic human rights. Members will know from their <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> casework that the consequences are brutal and wide-reaching. The hostile environment deters people from reporting crime to the police or from calling out unsafe conditions and exploitative practices at work. It undermines <a href="/glossary/?gl=226" title="A group of workers who have united to promote their common interests." class="glossary">trade union</a> rights and pushes people into poor-quality and dangerous accommodation and homelessness. As new clause 14 highlights, the hostile environment even denies access to healthcare by scaring people from going to the doctor for fear of being charged or being reported, detained and deported.</p> <p pid="c309.1/4">No recourse to public funds, which new clause 12 addresses, abandons some migrants to having no safety net. It leaves children hungry, it pushes families into poverty and unsafe, overcrowded housing, and it means women, in particular, who flee abusive partners are not entitled to access mainstream refuges. It is breathtakingly cruel and unjust.</p> <p pid="c309.1/5">The disproportionate suffering that has been inflicted on migrants during the pandemic is well known, if apparently forgotten by this Government. Not only does the hostile environment produce a culture of fear that often risks the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a> being unable to do its job, but it puts all our communities in danger. Although such policies try to incentivise us to be suspicious of one another, they are not in the interest of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of people. It should   be no surprise that the Bill is another horrifying extension of such an approach. It undermines human decency and must be opposed in every way.</p> <p pid="c309.1/6">The fact this is all in the context of the ongoing tragedy of people drowning in the English channel is chilling. That such people now potentially face jail sentences if they survive such precarious journeys, as well as an even more hostile environment, is catastrophically wrong.</p> <p pid="c309.1/7">I emphasise the humanity that runs through the amendments I am supporting today. We have to stop the political immigration game of misinformation and cynicism that has such horrendous human cost. There is no doubt that one of the reasons we are seeing scenes of desperate people trying to cross the channel is the lazy but deadly anti-migrant political agenda that closes off safe routes to the UK.</p> <p pid="c309.1/8">One of the biggest myths perpetuated by politicians is that they are too afraid to talk about migration when, in fact, the opposite is true. The more politicians talk about being tough on migration, the more they just talk about being tough on migration. For decades the rate of lawmaking in this area has exceeded the rate of lawmaking in every other social policy area.</p> <p pid="c309.1/9">When people repeat half-truths and inaccuracies and attempt to utilise society&#8217;s fears, prejudices and anxieties for opportunistic so-called political gain, a climate of acceptance is created for such ideas at all levels of society. The mainstream media must also reflect on the role of their focus on numbers and their use of words such as &#8220;flood,&#8221; &#8220;influx&#8221; and &#8220;waves.&#8221; I am sorry that <a href="/mp/?p=10095" title="Our page on Bill Cash - 'the hon. Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)'">Sir William Cash</a> used the word &#8220;tsunami,&#8221; which is a disgrace.</p> <p pid="c309.1/10">Yet it is simply untrue that Britain takes in more refugees than everywhere else, and research shows that two thirds of asylum seekers crossing the channel in boats, for example, are finally granted asylum by the Government&#8217;s own measurements. Yes, we need solutions to the soaring inequality, the suffering and the frightening covid death toll over which this Government have presided, but we do not need suspicion and scapegoats. Wherever we are from, we all need a roof over our head, food to eat, healthcare and basic human kindness and solidarity. Surely the true measure of a civilised society is not in its hostility but in its humanity.</p> <p pid="c309.1/11">I commended these new clauses to the House.</p>            </div>

It includes a cross-party group of MPs who, to follow on from the comments made by <a href="/mp/?p=25914" title="Our page on Apsana Begum - 'the hon. Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Apsana Begum)'">Apsana Begum</a>, absolutely seek to take the toxicity out of this debate, to find consensus, to be careful in the language we use, and to find agreement and, indeed, pragmatic solutions. When it comes to crossing the channel in small boats, we certainly need pragmatic solutions.</p> <p pid="c310.0/2">I absolutely commend my hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for his comments about seeking to smash the evil trade in people. That is what we must do, because the traffickers regard human life as absolutely worthless. They seek to provide crossings to the highest bidder, and no consideration  whatever is given to people&#8217;s safety. I thank my hon. Friend for his engagement on this subject, and for listening to my real concerns about some of the clauses.</p> <p pid="c310.0/3">It is interesting that when we talk about immigration, we often find ourselves with strange bedfellows&#8212;I will be completely candid about that. It is not often that my right hon.

Friend the Minister about whether the offshoring policy will apply to children. I very much hope that an assurance that it will not will be included in the Bill, and that we will not seek to remove vulnerable young people to any other country, whether it is a member of the refugee convention and signatory to the European convention on human rights or not. I also seek assurances from my hon. Friend that we will not seek to offshore women, who will perhaps be pregnant women. If pregnant women are making these dangerous crossings, what are we doing to make sure they are safeguarded and not shipped off to another country? That is crucial.</p>            </div>

Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will not mind my instantly picking up on the fact that he very specifically said that &#8220;unaccompanied&#8221; asylum-seeking children would not be sent offshore, and that we would not split families. I also seek his assurance that we will not send whole families to have their claims decided offshore, and a further assurance that unaccompanied asylum-seeking children who have been accepted into the asylum process will not fall out of it again once they turn 18. To me, it is absolutely imperative that if somebody&#8217;s claim is to be decided here, it should be decided here, not diverted midway through the process because they pass an arbitrary age.</p> <p pid="c311.1/2">I have real concerns about the creation of two tiers of asylum seeker. I tend to use this illustration. We saw horrific scenes in Afghanistan when female judges and female <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a> sought to flee that country. We have put in place some schemes&#8212;it is important to emphasise that they are not yet up and running&#8212;around the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme. Let me draw for the House the image of one female judge who comes to this country under that scheme when it is up and running. She is accepted into our country and is promptly given indefinite leave to remain and the right to work. A second female judge arrives on a small boat, but otherwise the circumstances are the same, in that she would be at risk if she returned to Afghanistan. We seek to offshore her. It causes me real concern that we will create a two-tier system in which people with identical claims to safety&#8212;at identical risk from the Taliban&#8212;are treated very differently.</p> <p pid="c311.1/3">I wish to raise concerns about where we might send people. I do not presume to know which countries the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> is in discussions with, but they might include Albania, which is in mainland Europe and not part of the European Union. There is already a well-established route from Albania to this country in the back of a van. We could be in a situation where we pay a third country a significant amount of money to accept someone into their asylum system&#8212;this is different from the model outlined by my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden&#8212;but they are then refused. At that point, what is there to stop that person seeking to come back to this country immediately? There could be some sort of circular trade, in which people end up back on our shores, whether in the back of a van or a small boat, and so the cycle goes round and round.</p> <p pid="c311.1/4">I have some experience as a former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Minister">Immigration Minister</a>, so I know full well that at this time of year, there is a very popular journey using the return flight to Tirana. [Interruption.] I can see that you want me to hurry up, Madam <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>, so I will. There is the question of whether people might see an opportunity to head off to a different country, and then end up back here, whether their claim was accepted or denied in that third country.</p> <p pid="c311.1/5">We must get the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme up and running, and make it effective. We should also fulfil the commitment we made to vulnerable people when the vulnerable persons resettlement scheme and the vulnerable children&#8217;s resettlement scheme came to their conclusion. We cannot talk about safe and legal routes unless we actually have some, and it is imperative that we have them.</p> <p pid="c311.1/6">I am now stretching your patience, Madam Deputy <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, but let me finally address the comments of <a href="/mp/?p=10260" title="Our page on Harriet Harman - 'the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman)'">Ms Harman</a> about push-back. I was the Immigration Minister who rejected that idea because I thought that it was too dangerous to do in one of the busiest shipping lanes in the country, with vulnerable and overladen boats carrying women and children, in choppy seas. We should think very carefully before going down that route, because no Minister at all wishes to be responsible for more loss of life in the channel.</p>            </div>

But the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> are not going to let small matters such as fundamental human rights, the rule of law and natural justice get in the way of their hostile environment, and their attempts to exclude practically anyone who is not a tax-dodging billionaire from settling on these shores. We keep hearing, &#8220;The asylum system is broken&#8221; from those on the Government Benches. Well, how did that happen? The Government have been in power for 10 years, and the environment has only become more hostile. Perhaps a different approach is needed.</p> <p pid="c312.2/2">It is for that reason that I support the right to work outlined in new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 45, in the name of my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25406" title="Our page on Carol Monaghan - 'the Member for Glasgow North West (Carol Monaghan)'">Carol Monaghan</a>. The right to work is a human right. It is in the universal declaration of human rights, and although it might be denied, it cannot be taken away. Lots of us heard that last week from people who had travelled from Glasgow and the Maryhill Integration Network to speak to us about the issue. They want to work, contribute and share their skills.</p> <p pid="c312.2/3">Instead of people being a cost to the system, we should let them contribute to the system. Instead of them receiving meagre, insulting support payments from taxpayer, we should let them become taxpayers, but that is not something that the Government are interested in. I do not know when a Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> last had to sit in a <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> surgery and look at a <a href="/glossary/?gl=254" title="A measured and/or recorded biological parameter. Example: passport-type..." class="glossary">biometric</a> card that says, &#8220;No right to work&#8221; or &#8220;No recourse to public funds&#8221;. It is one of the most heartbreaking things that Members of this House have to do, and it is a complete insult, because being able to work is a human right.</p> <p pid="c312.2/4">I also support new clause 9 on EU certification, which was tabled by <a href="/mp/?p=11605" title="Our page on Meg Hillier - 'the hon. Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Dame Meg Hillier)'">Dame Meg Hillier</a>, because it would correct another historical wrong. I have constituents who have had emails saying, &#8220;Congratulations, you have your settled status. By the way, this email is not proof of your settled status.&#8221; Quite how they are supposed to prove that status if they do not have the documentation is beyond me, but it is all part of a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> agenda that does not want people to make the United Kingdom their home.</p> <p pid="c312.2/5">The Government want to close borders, shut down routes to citizenship and send a general message that says, &#8220;Unless you have lots of money, you&#8217;re not really welcome here.&#8221; How can the UK ever be the first safe country of arrival? We are surrounded by water. It is simply not possible. That approach would mean that practically everyone turning up here to claim asylum&#8212;whether on a ship or small boat or at an airport&#8212;would become a criminal. That is rejected by people in Glasgow North and across Scotland. I look forward to the day when we can have an open, generous, accessible pathway to asylum and citizenship, for those who want to take it up, in an independent Scotland.</p>            </div>

Last year, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Accounts_Committee">Public Accounts Committee</a> reminded us that the immigration enforcement directorate has 5,000 staff and costs &#163;400 million a year to run, but that every year for the last several years, there have been fewer enforced removals and fewer voluntary returns. In 2019&#8212;the last year for which figures were available&#8212;there were only 55 convictions for all immigration offences, yet we know that there are probably 1.2 million illegal immigrants in this country. I therefore ask the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>: what is happening to the published aim of the immigration enforcement directorate, which is,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c313.0/2" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;to reduce the size of the illegal population and the harm it causes&#8221;?</p> <p pid="c313.0/3">The reason why I tabled new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 18&#8212;I much appreciate the support of the 17 colleagues who have signed it&#8212;it is that it would make it clear that it is a criminal offence to be in the United Kingdom illegally.  Most people find it amazing that it is not already a criminal offence. It is a criminal offence to watch a television without a television licence, but not to be in this country without authority. My new clause would change that and address the issue of all the people who are here unlawfully.</p> <p pid="c313.0/4">Sky News has suggested that there may be about 87,000 new illegal immigrants coming in each year. Very few of those, relatively speaking, are failed asylum seekers. There is a much bigger problem of clandestines&#8212;those arriving without documents&#8212;and there is a very large number, estimated to be 66,000, of people who stay beyond any visa entitlement. We have to deal with the wider issue of illegal migrants and enforce it properly.</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 9, I want to associate myself fully with the comments of <a href="/mp/?p=24809" title="Our page on Caroline Nokes - 'the right hon. Member for Romsey and Southampton North (Caroline Nokes)'">Caroline Nokes</a>. In normal times that might surprise people, but I think she put very eloquently the real challenges and issues of offshoring and pushing back.</p> <p pid="c314.2/2">New clause 9 calls on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> to fill the gap between the digital-by-default proof of status under the EU settlement scheme and the reality of people&#8217;s lives. It is typical of the Home Office to have set up a system that does not understand the interactions that people will have to have while proving their status. I thank the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for speaking to me about this, and for his letter of today.</p> <p pid="c314.2/3">Let me give some facts. I represent over 10,000 EU citizens in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackney_South_and_Shoreditch">Hackney South and Shoreditch</a>; my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10001" title="Our page on Diane Abbott - 'the Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)'">Ms Abbott</a> represents many thousands more. In my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, they are 8.5% of the population. Some 60% of Roma people are unable to access digital proof, and there are other groups who have real problems with digital access. Let me mention just some of the cases in my case load. An EU citizen living in my constituency who visits France weekly for work is interrogated by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Force">Border Force</a> every time she arrives back in the UK. Another constituent has parents in their 70s who struggle to understand the complex process of proving their status digitally. Another case involves a freelancer who has had to prove his identity to every new employer, which can be every five or six weeks. The website is sometimes down, and many employers just do not want to engage, so he has lost money.</p> <p pid="c314.2/4">Another constituent works for a charity working with the Roma; it gave the figure of 60% of Roma people finding it difficult to access digital proof. I thank the3million, which has written to me since I tabled the new clause and explained many of these situations, which I do not have time to go into, but I reiterate the concerns of my constituents.</p> <p pid="c314.2/5">I say to the Minister, whose job I did just over a decade ago, that we are not so far apart on this. I, too, support methods that take us away from the old <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Directorate">Immigration and Nationality Directorate</a> letters, which many of my constituents still come to surgeries with in their wallets, folded up until they are falling apart. They are not a  great way of proving one&#8217;s status in the UK. People lose passports. There are gaps in the system. We have seen with the covid app how we can make a difference by combining digital and paper.</p>            </div>

The amendments can be made outside legislation through immigration and nationality fee regulations, and when it comes to sums of money, it is important that it is done that way.</p> <p pid="c315.2/3">I remind Ministers that in that letter, I highlighted the point that the current situation</p> <p class="indent" pid="c315.2/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;irks many members of the public that our nation looks mean spirited to those who volunteered to join us&#8221;,</p> <p pid="c315.2/5">and potentially put their lives at risk. The letter was signed by 130 MPs, including three <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretaries_of_State">Secretaries of State</a> in the current Government, 10 Ministers, including the Veterans <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, my hon.

This letter&#8212;this belief&#8212;has a considerable amount of moral support around the House.</p> <p pid="c315.2/6">I suspect that the Minister will say that the Government need to respond to the consultation that they held earlier this year and that this is not the time to divide the House or to make rapid decisions, which I totally understand, but I hope that Ministers will confirm this  evening that they will look at this very closely, with a clear understanding of the support around this House for the moral principle at stake. I hope they will come back to the House when they respond to the consultation so that we can have a full debate on it then. I hope at that stage we will be able to support changes that they make that will enable non-UK citizens to carry on serving in our armed forces.</p>            </div>

I rise to speak in support of new clauses 10 and 11 and <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 8 in my name. I do not say this lightly, but there is a deep wickedness at the heart of this Bill, matched only by its stupidity, because of its reliance on a bogus narrative that we are being&#8212;whatever the language used&#8212;&#8220;swamped&#8221; by asylum seekers.</p> <p pid="c316.1/2">Let us have some facts that might help <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Benchers">Back Benchers</a> on the Government Benches. First, 2% of the world&#8217;s population lives in the United Kingdom, and 0.65% of the world&#8217;s refugees are in the United Kingdom. We are not taking our fair share; we are not overwhelmed. We take fewer the half the number of asylum seekers we did 20 years ago. We are 17th in the league table&#8212;lower mid-table&#8212;of countries in Europe when it comes to taking asylum seekers per head of population. Germany takes three times more and France takes two and a half times more than we do.</p> <p pid="c316.1/3">We hear from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> that our asylum system is broken. Yes, it is, but not because it is deluged by too many asylum seekers, because evidentially that is not true; it is broken because of incompetence on the part of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a>. The Government&#8217;s argument is the equivalent of blaming patients for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a> waiting lists. It is unacceptable and it is wrong.</p> <p pid="c316.1/4">The numbers crossing the channel are tragic and awful, and it is obvious why it is the case. It is because we have seen a clampdown, because of covid and security, on people crossing the channel through other unsafe routes, such as the channel tunnel and ferries. As the narrower routes across the channel have been more heavily policed, what have we seen people doing? We have seen people taking more dangerous routes. The evidence shows us that when a route is closed off, people find further, more unsafe routes, so the Government&#8217;s policy will see more people dead in the channel. That is clearly what will happen unless they introduce safe routes. [Interruption.] There is a whole lot of rhetoric about safe routes and no action whatever.</p>            </div>

This Bill is a charter for the people traffickers, and the only answer is safe routes. If we offer them the humanitarian visa as a safe route, we offer them the opportunity to do something that is not just morally right, but would actually solve the problem we are seeking to solve. The reality is  that we have here a room full of comfortable people creating a two-tier asylum system that will decide between the deserving and undeserving asylum seeker. That is not just morally wrong but against international law. It is undermining Britain&#8217;s international standing and weakening our position on a range of issues while doing something morally shameful and undermining everything it is to be British.</p>            </div>

Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10095" title="Our page on Bill Cash - 'the Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)'">Sir William Cash</a>, to which I am a signatory. Before I turn to that, I welcome Government amendments 60 to 63 and pay tribute to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Force">Border Force</a>, coastguard, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNLI">RNLI</a> and search and rescue organisations operating in Dover and Deal and across east Kent who, day after day, month after month and year after year put their lives on the line to save those at peril on the sea.</p> <p pid="c317.0/2">It is an uncomfortable truth but a truth all the same&#8212;and one on which <a href="/mp/?p=11923" title="Our page on Tim Farron - 'the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron)'">Tim Farron</a> is wrong&#8212;that every person put in peril by the people smugglers is already safe on land in France and in many other countries before France. When we remember the 27 people who recently died, as well as the many other lives lost, we must be united in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> to do whatever it takes to stop more lives being lost in the English channel.</p> <p pid="c317.0/3">The second uncomfortable truth is that, whatever <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members way wish to say, there are safe and legal routes to come to this country. The Bill shows compassion to those most in need of assistance and prioritises them over people who choose unsafe and illegal routes of entry. Clauses 29 to 37 make it clear that refuge will always be available to people persecuted by reason of their religious, political or other beliefs, their race, their ethnicity or their sexuality. It is right to prioritise protection of those most in need of it.</p> <p pid="c317.0/4">The third uncomfortable truth is that it is possible to have help for those people in greatest need and to have strong borders. It is possible to have help for those who need it and to ensure that our country has strong and secure protection. It is vital that that is supported in the Bill.</p> <p pid="c317.0/5">Finally, I turn to the refugee convention, which is now 80 years old and out of date. With some 80 million displaced across the globe, we need a new global compact &#8212;a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COP26">COP26</a> for the migrant crisis&#8212;to ensure that we finally work together globally to put an end to the migrant crisis and the small boat crossing routes that are leading to lost lives in the English channel.</p>            </div>

I rise to speak to new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 44 on safe and legal routes, which is tabled in my name, and new clauses 15 to 17 on a statutory limit on immigration detention, which I tabled with <a href="/mp/?p=24787" title="Our page on Richard Fuller - 'the hon. Member for North East Bedfordshire (Richard Fuller)'">Richard Fuller</a>. I pay tribute to him for his work on the issue.</p> <p pid="c317.2/2">New clause 44 goes to the heart of the Bill&#8217;s supposed objectives, which are predicated on stopping irregular arrivals of asylum seekers by encouraging those fleeing war and persecution to access safe and legal routes. However, the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme announced as urgent in August is still not operational, the Syrian scheme has closed, the gateway scheme is not operational and the UK resettlement scheme that opened in February with a commitment to resettle 5,000 people in year one has taken just 770 people. It is a cruel deceit to say that the Bill&#8217;s measures encourage the use of safe and legal routes if we have no such meaningful routes.</p> <p pid="c317.2/3">There is much in the Bill to be concerned about, such as differentiation of refugees in contravention of international law, offshoring of processing claims away from protection, pushing back rubber dinghies and risking lives. Importantly, the Government&#8217;s own impact assessment says that the evidence base for such measures is &#8220;limited&#8221; and that they</p> <p class="indent" pid="c317.2/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;could encourage&#8230;cohorts to attempt riskier means of entering the UK.&#8221;</p> <p pid="c317.2/5">However, that is all justified in the name of encouraging safe and legal routes. The Government must face up to their responsibility and deliver those routes.</p> <p pid="c317.2/6">On new clauses 15 to 17, we are seeking to place a statutory limit on immigration detention and to respond to a missed opportunity in this Bill. I was the vice-chair of a cross-party inquiry over eight months in 2014, with parliamentarians from both sides of the House and all main parties&#8212;there were more Government Members than there were <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members&#8212;as well as a retired <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Lord">Law Lord</a>, a former chief inspector of prisons and, of course, the hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_Bedfordshire">North East Bedfordshire</a>. Our recommendations, which included the limit on detention contained in new clauses 15 to 17, were endorsed by this House in September 2014, so it is disappointing that we are still debating them seven years on.</p> <p pid="c317.2/7">This is not a particularly controversial proposal. We are unusual in this country in having no limit. During our inquiry, we spoke to a young man who had been trafficked from the Cameroon-Nigeria border. He had been beaten, raped and tortured, and he had made an irregular route to this country on a false passport. He had been detained for three years in contravention of the stated aims of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> that those who have been trafficked should not be detained, that those who have been tortured should not be detained and that detention should be for the shortest possible period. Time and again, we were told that detention was worse than prison, because in prison someone knows when they will get out, but that sense of hopelessness and despair leads to hugely deteriorating mental health.</p>            </div>

Normally I agree with the Pope, and it is his job to stand up for the poor and the dispossessed of the world, but&#8212;leaving aside the fact that if Greece accepted 100 a day, 1,000 would come tomorrow, and that if it accepted 1,000 the next day, 2,000 would come the day after that&#8212;there are countries in the world in such an appalling mess, such as Syria, Iraq, Libya and Somalia, that there is no limit to how many people would want to come here.</p> <p pid="c318.1/2">The people crossing the channel are not the world&#8217;s poorest. They are paying &#163;6,000 or &#163;7,000 to get here. They are not the world&#8217;s poorest people; they are economic migrants. If we are weak as a Government, we are actually being inhumane. We are putting people&#8217;s lives at risk because more and more people will come to our shores and risk the channel. So to be kind, it may be a clich&#233;, but we have to be tough and we have to get rid of the pull factor. There is no point in going on blaming the French. Of course, we would like them to take people back, but they probably will not.</p> <p pid="c318.1/3">We have to get rid of the pull factor, and that is why I have put forward new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 23. The only way we are going to stop this is if we put economic migrants who enter this country illegally in secure accommodation. They know that they can vanish in the community, there is a minuscule chance of their being deported, and they have better chances and better job prospects here than in France and elsewhere, so the Government have to get firm and tough on this. By the way, according to the law of the sea, it would be perfectly legal for them to escort economic migrants back to the shores of France with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Force">Border Force</a> vessels. I say to the Government: act now, get tough, or people will die.</p>            </div>

It relates to electronic travel authorisations, and in particular what is going to happen about movement on the island of Ireland. These authorisations will be required for all non-Irish visitors who wish to enter the United Kingdom, including via the land border.</p> <p pid="c319.0/4">While the Government insist that there will be no routine immigration checks on the land border on the island of Ireland, these requirements will nevertheless create new bureaucracy and legal uncertainty for thousands of EU citizens&#8212;and, indeed, other non-British and non-Irish residents south of the border&#8212;who cross the border often on a daily basis, whether for family visitation, to work, to shop, for healthcare, for education or for leisure.

The potential repercussions could be as severe as people going to prison. This is not practical on the island of Ireland, and I urge the Government to reconsider what they are doing in terms of electronic travel authorisations.</p>            </div>

Many of the controversies around the Bill are about the operations, rather than the legislation itself. Having sat on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee_on_Human_Rights">Joint Committee on Human Rights</a> as we took evidence on a number of these issues, it is clear that there are matters of opinion about whether pushbacks, for example, which are freely used by Frontex, the European Union border agency in the Mediterranean, are for or against and within international law.</p> <p pid="c320.0/2">I share the concerns expressed about the methods currently available to science, and I agree we would not wish to see those used at present. I agree, however, that it should be open to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a>, should effective scientific methods be developed, to use such methods for the purposes of age assessments. I welcome the engagement of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, and other Ministers, on those issues.</p> <p pid="c320.0/3">I will conclude with two points. First, I agree strongly with my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25831" title="Our page on Natalie Elphicke - 'the Member for Dover (Mrs Elphicke)'">Mrs Elphicke</a> on the point about needing a new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COP26">COP26</a> on the issue of global migration. The world is changing, and the challenges faced by asylum seekers and the numbers on the move mean we must update the way we respond, in partnership with our allies. Finally, I will comment on some of those international obligations, which are often heavily criticised. The UK is rarely referred to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=199" title="Also referred to as the ECHR, the European Court of Human Rights was..." class="glossary">European Court of Human Rights</a> for any breach of our <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a>, and we are rarely criticised. Indeed, the findings of that Court are not binding on the United Kingdom. As a champion of human rights we should be proud of  the UK&#8217;s record in that respect, and we should renew our dedication to being a beacon of human rights in  the future.</p>            </div>

On the Afghan resettlement scheme, where is it? How can we trust the Government to deliver any of these programmes, or anything to fix our asylum scheme, if we cannot even come up with that scheme, after many months, and after all of us in the House having received desperate emails from people in Afghanistan who were under threat? I agree with new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 52, which would waiver visa fees for Commonwealth veterans. We ask them to put their life on the line as members of our country, yet we do not pay their pensions, and we do not allow them and their families visas to say that they are citizens of this country. What more can we ask?</p> <p pid="c320.1/2">I really want to focus on family reunion. I have stood in the camps of Calais and seen people smugglers wandering around, very maliciously. I have seen the people smugglers about whom so much is made, but it will not be measures in this Bill that sort them out. One missing area is that of family reunion. One of those 27 men, women and children who tragically died in the channel was Harem Pirot. He was fleeing for his life from Iraq, to reach his brother, Anwar, a Sheffield graduate living in Cambridge, who then had to go to Calais to identify his brother&#8217;s body. We could cut so many smuggling routes if we were to allow family reunion, yet there is nothing in the Bill about that. Such a measure was  promised after the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU_Withdrawal_Bill">EU Withdrawal Bill</a>, and I talked about it in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=143" title="Maiden speech is the first formal speech made by an MP in the House of..." class="glossary">maiden speech</a>. It was promised when we discussed the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Act 2020, and it was promised in the new plan for immigration that there would be a safe and legal route for refugees, and for people fleeing for their lives to whom we can offer safe harbour. Family reunion needs to be put back into the Bill for it to work in the way it is intended.</p>            </div>

Members for their contributions to the debate and for the way in which most of those contributions were expressed. We are dealing with difficult matters, on which Members have strongly and deeply held convictions.</p> <p pid="c321.2/2">As I have said, it is vital that we do everything in our power to break the business model of evil criminal gangs and reform the broken asylum system. I am conscious of the time constraints, but I will address a number of amendments that have sparked a lot of today&#8217;s debate.</p> <p pid="c321.2/3">Let me start by addressing <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 150 tabled by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10095" title="Our page on Bill Cash - 'the Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)'">Sir William Cash</a> on removal to safe third countries. My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10499" title="Our page on John Redwood - 'the Member for Wokingham (John Redwood)'">John Redwood</a> also raised that, and I know that my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10265" title="Our page on John Hayes - 'the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Sir John Hayes)'">Sir John Hayes</a> has been following it. My right hon. and hon. Friends are absolutely right in the sentiments that they have expressed in the amendment. I thank them for their full support on the policy intention, including on third country processing of asylum applications.</p> <p pid="c321.2/4">There is a recognition that certain existing <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> may prevent the Government from achieving our aim to remove those with no legal basis to remain in the country. The legal barriers associated with the removal of failed asylum seekers and foreign national offenders are well known. That is why there is work under way across the Government to look at the further legal barriers to removal.</p> <p pid="c321.2/5">I therefore reassure my right hon. and hon. Friends, and colleagues more widely, that there are no insurmountable domestic legal barriers to transferring eligible individuals overseas under an asylum processing arrangement. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schedule_3">Schedule 3</a> to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 allows the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> to remove an individual with a pending asylum claim from the UK to a safe third state if a relevant certificate is issued. The Bill amends section 77 of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality,_Immigration_and_Asylum_Act_2002">Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002</a> to make it easier to remove someone to a safe third country without having to issue a certificate.</p> <p pid="c321.2/6">Obviously, the Bill complies fully with our international obligations, but the Home Secretary fully agrees with the sentiment that is expressed through amendment 150 about the challenges that frustrate the will of the British people in terms of our ability to remove people with no right to be in the UK. I can therefore confirm that the  Government have imminent plans to consult on substantial reform of the Human Rights Act, which will be announced imminently in Parliament.</p> <p pid="c321.2/7"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> also recognises my right hon. and hon. Friends&#8217; concerns about aspects of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHR">ECHR</a> and other international agreements. I can therefore confirm that we are committed to reviewing and resolving these issues with the urgency that the situation warrants.</p>            </div>

We also remain extremely grateful for the contribution made by former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Hong_Kong">British Hong Kong</a> service personnel.

A response to that consultation is coming out shortly, but I recognise the strength of the hon.

To that end, I thank him and other colleagues for raising these matters, and I invite him and the hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth,_Moor_View">Plymouth, Moor View</a> to meet Ministers and the legion next week to make sure that the concerns and realities of non-UK service personnel dealing with the immigration system are fully understood.
