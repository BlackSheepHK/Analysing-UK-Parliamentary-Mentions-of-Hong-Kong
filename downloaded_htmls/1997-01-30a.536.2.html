conclude all outstanding matters as soon as possible? I am sure that such confirmation would not constitute a breach of the confidentiality of the Committee.</p> <p>
The House will have noted that there is to be a debate next week on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force">Royal Air Force</a>. While I am sure that no one objects to it, will the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a> ensure that Ministers who speak in the debate are able to explain in detail the possible consequences for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF">RAF</a> and other parts of the defence budget of the Government's decision to spend &#163;60 million of taxpayers' money on the new royal yacht?</p> <p>
Will the Leader of the House comment on the point of order that was raised yesterday by my hon. Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Perry_Barr">Birmingham, Perry Barr</a> (Mr. Rooker) regarding the answering of written parliamentary questions? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leader">The Leader</a> of the House may know that that parliamentary question has now been answered, but hon. Members should not have to make points of order in the House to elicit answers from Ministers. In view of my experience, can he say whether the normal convention of Ministers always meeting hon. Members to discuss local matters remains operational, following two refusals by Education Ministers to meet a delegation from Mirfield in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>?</p> <p>
Can time be found in the near future for a debate on an issue that the Leader of the House did not cover in his statement: the consequences of bus deregulation? I draw his attention to a report entitled "Making Connections" which was published yesterday and which the <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Evening_Post">Yorkshire Evening Post</a></i> summarised as saying:
<q>bus services will never improve while profits are put ahead of customers</q>
As the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for the Environment co-chaired the body that wrote the report, surely the House should debate the matter.</p> <p>
Finally, in view of his answers in recent weeks, has the Leader of the House considered making space in our <a href="/glossary/?gl=25" title="Question Time is an opportunity for MPs and Members of the House of Lords..." class="glossary">Question Time</a> rota for questions to the member of the Government who is usually known as the chairman of the Conservative party?

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>The hon. Lady will not be surprised to learn that I, like other hon. Members, welcomed the measured and balanced way in which Madam <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a> commented on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday">Monday</a> on behalf of the House on an issue about which we all feel strongly. Understandably, the hon. Lady asked me, as Chairman of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> on Standards and Privileges&#8212;she is a distinguished member of that body&#8212;to confirm that the Committee is making every effort to conclude consideration of the various matters before us. I certainly confirm that&#8212;with the wholehearted support of all Committee members. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Commissioner_for_Standards">Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards</a> is also playing an active role. Many of the matters are complex and extremely important and they must be considered properly, but we shall proceed with all possible speed.</p> <p>
I cannot predict the contents of the speech of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> who will speak in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force">Royal Air Force</a> debate, as I have not discussed it with him. However, I shall draw to his attention the hon. Lady's point about what she would like to be in it.</p> <p>
The hon. Lady referred to the point of order raised yesterday by the hon. Member for Perry Bar, who I see sitting, diligently, beside her. The hon. Gentleman knows that I took action as soon as he raised his point of order to ensure that, by the end of the day, his question had been answered. Indeed, he has received a letter of apology from my right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Secretary">Chief Secretary</a>. The implication of that is clear. I accept, of course, that such errors should not occur and that we should make every effort to avoid them. I think that it is clear from my right hon. Friend's letter to the hon. Gentleman that he, too, accepts that. To put it simply and straightforwardly, it was an error. Every effort will be made to prevent such an error occurring again.</p> <p>
In the end, individual Ministers must make judgments in particular circumstances on whether to meet delegations. I understand why the hon. Lady has raised the matter. I am not in a position to comment in detail, because I was hitherto unaware of the facts that she stated. I shall ensure that her concern is brought to the attention of my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_and_Employment">Education and Employment</a>.</p> <p>
I have not yet had a chance to study the report on bus deregulation. I have, however, seen some of the press reports. The Government's position is that we welcome the independent report. We shall be studying the recommendations carefully.</p> <p>
I thought that the hon. Lady gave a rather unbalanced account of the bus industry, but I shall not go on about that at length. There is no doubt, however&#8212;it is certainly observable in the areas with which I am concerned&#8212;that deregulation and privatisation have brought a great deal of innovation, including new types of bus, which in many instances have provided greater flexibility. Perhaps the hon. Lady should have mentioned that investment by the industry in new buses has increased in each of the past four years.</p> <p>
Finally, I shall take up the hon. Lady's rather ingenious point about the Wirral, South <a href="/glossary/?gl=45" title="A by-election occurs when a seat in the House of Commons becomes vacant..." class="glossary">by-election</a>. I am not in a position to add to what I said last week, which I accept was not very much. I have no plans for making changes in the questions rota for the remainder of the Parliament.</p>            </div>

Before we get into the <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a> campaign, will it be possible to have a debate on the independence of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics">Office for National Statistics</a>, which is regularly accused of being led by the Government and doing the Government's bidding, but probably no more so than in the article today that suggests that, yesterday, it had prepared for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health">Department of Health</a>, at the Department's request, statistics about health service spending which showed that official spending on the health service had decreased by &#163;1 billion in the past three years?

There is decreasing credibility in an office of government that is open to manipulation by the governing party of the day.

Members. The important independent ingredient&#8212;as many people thought&#8212;was injected by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Commissioner_for_Standards">Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards</a>.

It would be wrong to seek to interfere with those processes in the middle of an investigation. If we sought to revise those processes substantially, that would lead only to further delay.</p>            </div>

[<i>That this House deplores the attempt by Railtrack to close Wrexham Central Station in a bid to increase profits from the development of surrounding land; notes the findings of the RUCC for Wales following a recent public inquiry that the closure of the station and its replacement</i><i>by one some 400 yards further away from Wrexham town centre would cause hardship to the town and to rail users and should not be allowed to go ahead; further notes that Railtrack has ignored these recommendations and is seeking to persuade the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_Regulator">Rail Regulator</a> not to accept the RUCC findings; and calls on Railtrack to abandon its closure proposals, produce plans for development keeping Wrexham Central Station roughly in its present central position and to start behaving in a manner suitable to that of a rail company and not a property company.</i>]</p> <p>
The motion was tabled today and has already succeeded in attracting 113 signatures. If the right hon. Gentleman reads the motion, he will find that Railtrack is seeking to make development profits for its shareholders at the expense of the travelling public. The matter is serious, because we need to preserve our railway system. Will the right hon. Gentleman be able to find some time before the Session ends for a debate on the important matter to which the motion refers?</p>            </div>

Post-code areas are for the administrative convenience of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=124" title="http://www.postoffice.co.uk/" class="glossary">Post Office</a>, but their extensive use by Government Departments creates anomalies. For instance, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S12">S12</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S18">S18</a> areas in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> have not been triggered for cold weather payments, but the neighbouring <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S31">S31</a>, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S42">S42</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S44">S44</a>, which are further away, were triggered before Christmas because of the weather conditions. Different areas are linked to different stations. Some hold the peculiar belief that areas with a low number, such as


S12 and S18, are part of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yorkshire">South Yorkshire</a> and are not in Derbyshire.

we are told in the press that it will be this day or that day.

It is not only in Dewsbury that Ministers appear to be demob-happy.

[<i>That this House is concerned at the development of surrogate childbirth; believes that, whilst it is acceptable for surrogacy to be available in cases where natural conception and childbirth is not possible, it is unacceptable for surrogacy to be extended to commercial transactions or for the sake of personal convenience; and calls upon Her Majesty's Government to allow a full debate on the moral and ethical implications of surrogacy.</i>]</p> <p>
Although I am personally in favour of surrogacy in respect of couples with physical problems, moral and ethical considerations clearly need to be taken into account, especially in cases in which it may be economically convenient for one partner or the other to "rent a womb". There are considerable causes for disquiet here. As the matter is being discussed outside the House, surely we should debate it in the House.</p>            </div>
