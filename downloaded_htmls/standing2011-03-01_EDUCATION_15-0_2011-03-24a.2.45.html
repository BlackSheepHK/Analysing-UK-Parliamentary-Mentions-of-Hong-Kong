We have reached clause 20, on the requirement for schools to participate in international surveys.</p> <p>This is a probing amendment about the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>’s intentions on academies. The clause will give new powers to direct community, voluntary or foundation schools to participate in international surveys, and we will have the opportunity to talk about that proposal at length when we discuss the next amendment. But we seek absolute clarity on the Government’s intentions, given that the clause makes no reference to academies. For any survey to have the chance to give an accurate picture of educational performance in the country, a representative sample of academies must participate. I would be grateful if the Minister explained why he has not included academies in the clause, and how he will compel them to participate.</p>            </div>

I reassure the hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_West">Cardiff West</a> that academies will participate in international education surveys through the mechanism  of the funding agreement between the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Education">Department for Education</a> and individual academies. The principle is to ensure that academies are bound by minimal amounts of legislation, and that the contractual funding agreements with academies are used where necessary. As it stands, the clause supports that principle, while it allows us to secure academy participation via the funding agreement.</p>            </div>

Gentleman hints at the fact that academies created under the previous Administration will not have that provision in their funding agreement. If he looks at the participation of academies in 2009, he will find a high rate of participation: of the nine academies drawn in the sample, eight participated. One did not, which is not good. However, although the proportion of community, voluntary and foundation schools that participated is slightly lower, the numbers are alarming in absolute terms: of the 168 drawn in the sample, only 146 participated in the scheme, which means that a large number of maintained schools did not participate. Although the proportions between participation rates for academies and for foundation, voluntary and community schools are broadly similar, the fact that all new academies will have such a requirement in the funding agreement will tackle that small problem with academies. The main issue we have to address in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.

They want to capture all schools, including academies, but they are not able to do so, because they are not legislating to require all academies to participate. They are therefore accepting that that can be achieved only through the funding agreement, but existing academies will not have that requirement in their funding agreement and therefore will not have to participate. I do not want to prolong the discussion, but it would be sensible for the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> to try to seek a solution if he wants all schools to participate in surveys. If it is so important, it should be all schools and it should be funded by the state. It should not be some schools.

Frankly, because of his record of misusing and selectively quoting statistics.

It was puerile and superficial. [Interruption.] I think I can say that. I am not accusing him of anything unparliamentary.

If the Premier League in England, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A">Serie A</a> in Italy and the Bundesliga in Germany were combined, and instead of finishing in the top 10 of the premiership in one year, the very next year we finished lower down the table of the three championships combined, that does not suggest that the quality of our play had declined.

Gentleman, despite his distinguished chairmanship of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Committee">Education Committee</a>, is himself not giving the full picture in his <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>. In addition, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a>, which is responsible for compiling the statistics, has said that comparing the UK’s results between 2000 and 2009 is not statistically valid. The OECD has said that—not me. With this <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a>, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> may be trying to overcome the problems with sampling in 2000. There was not a statistically valid sample from this country in 2000. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> chose not to mention that in his comments on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>, although perhaps I am being unfair to the Secretary of State, as the Chair of the Education Committee has said. If <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA">PISA</a> is the only credible international evidence available to us, the Secretary of State had nothing else to call upon in making his arguments.</p> <p>Obviously, being the Secretary of State, and wishing to give full picture, he would quote all the international evidence from all credible surveys in his comments on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Reading">Second Reading</a>. From that, we might presume that PISA is the only international evidence that is available. Except, of course, that is not true. As we know, from a snippet towards the end of the Secretary of State’s speech, there is another significant international study, which he made a quick passing reference to and then moved on, conveniently choosing to ignore its findings.</p> <p>The other major international testing study, which was not cited, presents an entirely different picture for England than the PISA study. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trends_in_International_Mathematics_and_Science_Study">Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study</a>, which is better known as the TIMS study and which has been going longer than PISA, last reported in 2007. It showed that between  1995 and the last tests in 2007—I hope the Secretary of State’s officials are listening, because they should read it too—England’s primary school maths performance improved by a greater margin than any of the other 15 nations that had pupils taking tests in those years, including Singapore, Japan, the Netherlands, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Norway. Our score went from below the international average in 1995 to comfortably above it in 2007. Our ranking improved from 12th out of 16 countries in 1995 to seventh out of 36 countries in 2007. To use the earlier analogy, if we had combined the premiership, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A">Serie A</a> and the Bundesliga, instead of finishing in the bottom 20 in the smaller premiership, our team would have rocketed up the tables in the much larger international table during that period. I should have thought that the manager of that team would have wanted to brag about such a startling improvement.</p>            </div>

In science, the country was seventh most improved out of 16 in primary, its ranking moving from sixth out of 20 countries in 1995, to seventh out of 36 in 2007.

I am simply helping the Committee by providing it with information, which the Secretary of State neglected to do on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>. I hope such information is of interest to the Committee.</p> <p>I take on board what the Chair of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> has said about my not having the full list of countries in the tests. Nevertheless, in the 2007 science tests, in primary, English pupils finished ahead of countries including the United States, Germany, Australia, and Sweden. We do not hear much about Sweden from the Secretary of State since it has dropped down the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA">PISA</a> tables after introducing free schools. In secondary, English pupils we were ahead of those countries plus Russia, <span class="hi"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a></span> and Norway. Why did the Secretary of State say, on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Reading">Second Reading</a>, that the PISA statistics were ungainsayable? I remind the hon. Gentleman that “ungainsayable” was the word used.</p> <p>On Second Reading, towards the end of his remarks, the Secretary of State said that he could not find anything to celebrate in children’s achievements in our schools. Perhaps he did not want to find anything to celebrate; why else would he have ignored the findings of one of the studies that he is now legislating, in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a>, to compel our schools to participate in? In those remarks, in every other speech he has made, including to the world education forum earlier this year, and in the articles he has written on the subject he has chosen to completely ignore the evidence. That one-eyed selection of international evidence even formed the basis for the Government’s impact assessment for the Bill.</p> <p>The rationale for why we are legislating, as set out in that impact assessment, completely ignores the evidence. It states:</p> <p class="indent">“The Schools <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> set out how we are falling behind in the international league table”— singular—</p> <p class="indent">“of educational performance compared to competitor countries. The most recent PISA survey - the international league tables”— plural, there—</p> <p class="indent">“of school performance - reported that since 2000”—</p> <p>I pointed out earlier the problem with that; the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> says that it cannot be done—</p> <p class="indent">“we have fallen from fourth to sixteenth”.</p> <p>There is no mention of the alternative picture reflected by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIMSS">TIMSS</a>, which is ironic, given that TIMSS is a closer test of pure curricular knowledge of the sort about which the Secretary of State often enthuses, in that it is more traditional in its approach and testing methods  than PISA is. For the Government to seek to base their reform strategy on international testing evidence and yet ignore the conclusions of one of the world’s most prestigious testing studies because they do not fit with the political picture that they are trying to paint about their education reforms shows that the Secretary of State cannot be trusted on the statistics that he cites. No doubt, if future PISA statistics do not go his way, he will ignore them and cite TIMSS figures instead—if they go his way—seeking statistical comfort in some other statistical survey.</p>            </div>

The point is not where we rank in the tables but what our performance is, and, as statisticians and people involved in comparisons will tell us, as will Ofqual when it reports, often the difference in movement in the tables is statistically much smaller than the ranking shifts suggest.

Of course, the Leitch report was an indictment of many years of failure to provide basic skills to people, particularly in literacy and numeracy. A vast remedial programme was put in place to try to improve that. There was some success—although more so in literacy than numeracy. That is a more difficult nut to crack because it is sometimes almost unfashionable—sorry, that is the wrong phrase. It is perhaps not acceptable socially for someone to admit that they cannot read, which creates particular problems in dealing with adult literacy. However, sometimes people happily say, “I’m no good at maths” and accept that that is the way it has to be, which is not the case. That is a serious point. My <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> would not do what the hon.

The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_Republic">Kazakh Republic</a> was added. Is that a country we ought to be falling down behind? Other countries are Serbia, Moldova, the Kyrgyz Republic, Qatar and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>.

That makes absolutely no difference to my argument. If we delve more deeply, we might find other examples. As I pointed out, in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIMSS">TIMSS</a> tables we are rising above a lot of countries that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> sometimes quotes as being higher than us in other tables.</p> <p>The point is that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA">PISA</a> tables and the TIMSS tables use their own methodologies. As I mentioned, the TIMSS tables use more traditional methodologies, which the Secretary of State favours elsewhere. This country does well in respect of TIMSS. I am afraid it was the Secretary of State who did not give the full picture. I have accepted that PISA is an important international comparator. We will hear in a moment whether the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> accepts that TIMSS is. If he does not, he should say in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> that TIMSS is not statistically valid and therefore he will not compel our schools to participate in it. If he thinks it is rubbish, he should not be compelling our schools to participate in wasting their time.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> This has been an interesting and entertaining debate, but it would be more illuminating to look at the facts and figures. First of all, the hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_West">Cardiff West</a> is confusing problems relating to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA">PISA</a> surveys. He is confusing the 2000 survey with the 2003 survey, which we have not cited. In PISA 2000, England failed to reach minimum school participation rates, but because the pupil participation rate was met the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a>  included data for England as part of the UK’s results in its PISA 2000 report. However it was in PISA 2003, which the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> has never cited, that the OECD excluded results for the UK in its international report, because in England neither the required school participation rates nor the required pupil participation rates were met. That is where the problem was, rather than with the 2000 figures.</p> <p>It is interesting to note that Ministers at the time were very keen to cite the PISA 2000 survey results. I remember Schools Ministers and the then Secretary of State citing them and I will go on to quote the <a href="/glossary/?gl=179" title="A Permanent Secretary is a top civil servant- there is a permanent..." class="glossary">permanent secretary</a> at the time, who was also keen to cite them.</p> <p>In response to those issues, the previous Government commissioned the Southampton Statistical Sciences Research Institute at the university of Southampton to investigate the school and pupil samples for England, in order to look more closely into possible bias in both the 2000 and 2003 samples for PISA. The institute’s subsequent report concluded that the impact of possible bias on the position of England and the UK in any ranking of OECD countries was very slight and estimated that it would only have shifted England’s position by about one place in 2000.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Normington">David Normington</a>, who was the permanent secretary at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Education">Department for Education</a> in 2002, said:</p> <p class="indent">“For those doubters who constantly seek to run down (our education success), we now have the OECD/PISA study – the biggest ever international study of comparative performance of 15-year-olds in 32 countries – which shows UK fourth in science, seventh in literacy and eighth in maths. Only Finland and Canada are consistently ahead of the UK – and major countries like Germany, Italy and Spain are well behind”.</p> <p>Both officials and Ministers were very keen to cite PISA when it suited them.</p> <p>When we look at international surveys, it is important that we look at all of them and take them as a whole. The hon. Member for Cardiff West, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, failed to cite the progress in international reading literacy study, which is a reading and literacy survey, in which we dropped from third to 16th between 2001 and 2006. When the PISA survey, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIRLS">PIRLS</a> survey and the trends in international mathematics and science study survey are all taken together it is quite clear that there is a problem with us internationally. If we look at the 2009 PISA survey—</p>            </div>

Indeed, those first five countries are not just above us; they are significantly above us and there is a gap between them and Hungary in sixth place. England is in seventh place. Taiwan scored 598, Korea scored 597 and Singapore scored 593. We then come down to Hungary, which scored 517, and England, which scored 513. That is the problem. In China, which is represented by Shanghai in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA">PISA</a> 2009 survey, 15-year-olds are two years ahead of 15-year-olds in this country in maths.

We have cited all the available surveys and we seen the figures presented to us, and the problem that we have to examine is why it is that despite the effort, the net effect of all the surveys is that we are declining in international rankings. That is a serious concern, and we have to start to look at what is in the curriculum and in our exam system, and what it is about the system that is being forced on teachers that leads to children of the same age group in places such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai,_China">Shanghai, China</a> being two years ahead of us in maths, compared with 15-year-olds in this country.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> I never said that is what we should do; I said we should take a balanced look at all the surveys. I find things to worry about in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIMSS">TIMSS</a> survey, and I worry about the absolute figures. The hon. Gentleman’s quote stated that the absolute figures did not differ that much. In the TIMSS survey they do not differ much in England, where there is a clustering around the figure 513. However, there is an enormous gap between the first five in that survey, and the next batch down that includes Hungary, England, Russia, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">USA</a>, Lithuania and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic">Czech Republic</a>. That goes from Hungary’s score of 517 to between 570 and 598 for the top five countries. That concern is reflected again in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA">PISA</a> survey, where <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai,_China">Shanghai, China</a>, has a mean score of 600, compared with England’s mean score of 493. That constitutes two years of study and achievement, and we are trying to address that concern.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Schleicher">Andreas Schleicher</a>, the head of the PISA study, said that the picture for the UK was,</p> <p class="indent">“stagnant at best... Many other countries have seen quite significant improvement.”</p> <p>That is the point. Standards in our education system may have been maintained or even improved slightly, but compared with our international competitors we are declining. Even taking into account the fact that more countries have joined the PISA survey, we are still in decline over that period.</p>            </div>

The real context of our education performance is the massive increase in expenditure in our education system that took place over the first decade of the 21st century, and the fact that the gap between rich and poor has widened. I know that the whole House and all members of the Committee are committed to creating a fairer society in which opportunity and outcome are not determined by where a person is born. This debate is in the context of the widening gap between rich and poor, and massive investment, but yet there is stagnation. It is right for Ministers in the new Government to implement reforms, and to feel a certain level of indignation at our failure to do more until now.</p>            </div>

Problems highlighted by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA">PISA</a> survey included the wide gap between the top and bottom in our education system, the growing tale of underachievement and the huge gap in equality in our system. We come 55th out of 57 countries in terms of equality of system, and we have the biggest attainment gap between the maintained sector and the independent sector of most <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> countries. When those issues are taken together, the international surveys reveal a problem that urgently needs to be addressed. That is what the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> is seeking to do.</p> <p>The <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> would require the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Statistics_Authority">UK Statistics Authority</a> to approve, before it is published, any statement or report from the Secretary of State resulting from England’s participation in international surveys. The UK Statistics Authority’s main function is to provide international scrutiny of all UK statistics. It already has the power to monitor and comment on any statistics produced by the Secretary of State, but it is not within the remit of the authority to approve statements and reports before they are issued. The amendment would place a new function on the authority.</p> <p>I understand the hon. Gentleman’s concern to ensure that statements published by the Department make robust use of data and statistics. I assure the Committee that the Department works closely with data suppliers to promote data standards and robust system development. Thorough guidance is provided to ensure consistent interpretation and data quality indicators, and areas of improvement are fed back to data suppliers to enhance the quality of future collections. Specialist statisticians support the Department in using the data effectively. It is not a requirement for any other statements or reports issued by the Secretary of State or the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education">Department of Education</a> to be pre-approved and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be reassured that it is not necessary in this case and that he will withdraw his amendment.</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a>. If the Government had not put it in the heart of the Bill we probably would not be debating the importance of these international standards, whichever ones we use. Clearly there needs to be close statistical analysis of all these things but the important thing is that we also reflect our real success in this country with inclusive education. We try to ensure that we bring forward all children and develop the talents of all children, whereas in some other countries they focus on certain pupils and push them forward. I accept that we need to look at these measures but we should ensure that when we evaluate all these things our successes with inclusion are reflected.</p>            </div>

One of the overriding objectives of our education policy is to close the attainment gap between those from wealthier backgrounds and those from poorer backgrounds. That drives everything we are doing in education, whether it is the English bac or the pupil premium where we are increasing the funding for schools for children from poorer families—£430 per pupil this year, rising to £2.5 billion by 2014. This is a significant contribution to closing that attainment gap. We are also introducing measures in league tables that will evaluate the performance of schools in helping children from challenging backgrounds or with special needs.
