I have to confess that when I was obliged to announce the closure of a relatively small number of posts including, fatefully as it turned out, the consulate at Salonika, it served to provoke an immense explosion from my distinguished constituent who had been the chairman of the selection committee which had at last enabled me to secure a foothold in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>. I had forgotten, if I had ever known, that he had been for 50 years the president of the Salonika Veterans Association.</p> <p pid="b.747.1/4">This short and flatteringly crowded debate offers scope for discussion, I hope, of every item of the overseas budget. I can do no more than offer an illustrative framework. I look forward particularly to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=143" title="Maiden speech is the first formal speech made by an MP in the House of..." class="glossary">maiden speech</a> of my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Patten_of_Barnes">Lord Patten of Barnes</a>. He is himself almost, in his own modest words, "not quite a diplomat".</p> <p pid="b.747.1/5">I shall focus on two themes: first, the range of services which risk being damagingly reduced in the present situation; and, secondly, the quality of what has traditionally and rightly been known as the Diplomatic Service. Decline in those two respects would have very serious implications for the future. Why has that happened? Although the objectives of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office have remained broadly unchanged since they were first set out, for example, in the first annual report for the department by my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hurd">Lord Hurd</a>, they are much the same in the foreword written by the present <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> to the 2003 <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>, <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Kingdom">The United Kingdom</a>'s International Priorities</i> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CM">CM</a> 6052). The objectives and the purposes remain the same. But the burden of implementation has been and is being remorselessly increased for all sorts of reasons. There is a steady growth in the international community. When my noble friend Lord Carrington first went into office there were 126 members of the United Nations. When I left in 1989 there were 164. Today there are 191. That is an explosive growth in the nations with which we have to deal. Travel by Britons overseas has been growing on a similar scale, with 14 million visits five years ago and 15.4 million today. So, too, have the hazards of the world in which they travel, ranging&#8212;if I may offer shorthand definitions&#8212;from Bali to tsunami to Katrina&#8212;so that requests for consular services have doubled in that same period to 80,000 a year.</p> <p pid="b.747.1/6">The third factor which creates the difficulties is the presumption that there should be no increase in real terms of the core budget of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and that the Diplomatic Service is always ripe for reduction rather than for any other treatment. Two words are offered by way of guidance to the Foreign Secretary in this respect. The first is the obligation to reprioritise&#8212;not a very elegant word&#8212;which means to cut or discard some of what is already being done on the assumption that much of what was being done is expendable and can be disposed of. That is just not so. Some may be ripe for reduction but not on the scale expected.</p> <p pid="b.747.1/7">The second ugly word is to "delayerise". I shall come back to that later if I have to. Both of those words all too often mean to cut, to curtail, to scrap or to eliminate in circumstances where it is often not just imprudent, but unacceptable.</p> <p pid="b.747.1/8">I shall give some examples of reprioritisation in respect of non-departmental public bodies, as the jargon has it. My first example is the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Association">British Association</a> for Central and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe">Eastern Europe</a>. The noble Lord, Lord Radice, takes a particular interest in it, but cannot be here today. In December three years ago, a letter from the Foreign Secretary assured him that the Foreign Secretary had great regard for the experience and skills of great value in that centre and that it would remain in action. Yet, less than three years later, he was served with what is, in effect, a notice for the extinction of that body, although there is still much to do in the countries to the east of the European Union.</p> <p pid="b.747.1/9">Secondly, there is the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Foundation_for_Democracy">Westminster Foundation for Democracy</a>, in which I declare a conjugal interest because my noble wife was for some time a member of the board of that organisation. It, too, has been subjected to an examination by outside consultants, on the basis that it is for the organisation to prove its right to survive. At the end of it&#8212;as I understand it, but I have not yet seen it officially confirmed&#8212;it has been acquitted of the right to die, and is going to survive, but after the expenditure of a consultation fee of about &#163;50,000 on that exercise.</p> <p pid="b.747.1/10">Thirdly, there is the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_China_Centre">Great Britain China Centre</a>, in which I declare an interest as its president for all too many years. It has been in existence much longer than me and, as China has developed and marched further on to the world stage, it has been seen as invaluable by stakeholders in the Peoples' Republic of China as well as here. It could not be less appropriate for us to have been subjected to a similar scrutiny that has just drawn to a conclusion at a cost of &#163;30,000. We await the final verdict on our future with eager anticipation. I hope I am not wrong to be eager about the conclusion, because it would be folly indeed to do anything to threaten the survival of the centre.</p> <p pid="b.747.1/11">Another example, perhaps less important in some ways, is the pattern of sponsored visits to this country and the range of scholarships&#8212;Chevening scholarships and Marshall scholarships, for example&#8212;that seem to have been reducing in value, duration and scope in recent years, partly in order to fulfil, so far as possible, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s pledge that the numbers would increase, although the numbers appear to be diminishing as well. Sadly, this is often to the disadvantage of the smaller territories. I take as an example Guyana, from which the noble Baroness the Leader of the House comes, as does another distinguished individual, the former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General">Secretary-General</a> of the Commonwealth, Sir Sonny Ramphal. Smaller territories appear to be missing out in the attempt to take sufficient notice of the larger territories.</p> <p pid="b.747.1/12">A third example, and one that is perhaps most important in this context, is the treatment being given to language training and allowances in the Diplomatic Service. Until five years ago, diplomats were not only paid a language allowance at a level depending on their success in examinations while serving in the country where that language was spoken&#8212;which is still the position&#8212;but they also received the allowance at half the rate after leaving that country, provided they passed the relevant examination every five years. That allowance no longer exists. It is important to recognise its value. I experienced it when I visited Hungary a couple of months ago. I was reminded that on my first visit in 1983, our then ambassador, Sir Bryan Cartledge&#8212;I do not think he was then "Sir", but he was the ambassador&#8212;was a fluent Hungarian <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">speaker</a> and, as a Russian speaker, he went on to Moscow. On my last visit, I met Mr John Nichols, who is another Hungarian speaker. Every one of the four intervening ambassadors in that post has been able to speak Hungarian. In almost every case they have been the only head of mission in that capital who could speak the native language, which gave them a primacy of great importance. That is an illustration of what we mean when we talk about Britain punching above her weight&#8212;a phrase about which there has always been a degree of dissent between my noble friend Lord Hurd and myself. He seeks to disclaim its authorship but I am not reluctant to make such a claim, although I doubt whether I did. I dare say I got it from somewhere. It is a very good phrase anyway.</p> <p pid="b.747.1/13">In light of that, your Lordships will not be surprised to hear that at a leadership conference held in the Foreign Office about a year ago, at which many heads of mission were present&#8212;I dare say that the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, was there&#8212;one of them said that he regretted that we could not do for our successors what they had been able to do for us, to invest in the long-lasting skills and qualities of the Diplomatic Service.</p> <p pid="b.747.1/14">What about delayering? The noble Lord, Lord Triesman, will recollect that we discussed an example of that in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-02">2 November</phrase> at col. 195 when debating the replacement of the Director for the Americas. Robert Culshaw was one of my many former private secretaries, who although their numbers are diminishing are still strewn around the service. He has had a distinguished career as the noble Lord rightly said. At the age of 53 Robert Culshaw is leaving the service and is being replaced by Mr Steven Williams, whom I do not know, but I have no reason to doubt his qualities. Indeed, I am sure that they are fine. The post is being downgraded from director to head of department. As the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, was careful to point out on that occasion, Mr Williams has</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.747.1/15">"considerable experience of both Latin America and the Caribbean Department".&#8212;[<a href="/search/?pop=1&s=date:20051102+column:197+section:lords"><i>Hansard</i>, 2/11/05; col. 197</a>.]</p> <p pid="b.747.1/16">The noble Lord did not add that he had had no experience of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America">North America</a>, which is not necessarily an absolute disqualification, but coupled with the downgrading of the post, it is not the right signal to give, whatever the talents of Mr Williams. That is taking place in a setting in which a great many more things are being done to reduce the significance of our service. I shall not try to touch on every post that has been closed in the past couple of years. I have no time to speak about Madagascar, although others will surely have something to say.</p> <p pid="b.747.1/17">Since April 2003, in the Americas region no fewer than 10 posts have been closed, including four embassies and one High Commission. I have no doubt that my noble friends <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Garel-Jones">Lord Garel-Jones</a> and Lady Hooper will have something to say about that. The downgrading of the first example of the Americas has to be seen as part of the deliberate shrinkage of the service. It is delayering in response to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinson_Grant">Collinson Grant</a> report of January this year. I should like to know the cost of that consultation. There is not just a deliberate shrinkage of the service, but an equally deliberate replacement of the career planning structure, which has been part of the success of the service heretofore. It was the key to the achievement of the Budapest-style continuity, to which I have referred.</p> <p pid="b.747.1/18">That has been replaced in whole or in part by competitive advertising of jobs within and without the service so that a spell in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is in danger of being regarded as just a step or two in portfolio careers. That is in sharp contrast to the pattern sought but not always achieved in large multinational companies to have the right person in the right place to secure the full benefit of the training and experience that they have received.</p> <p pid="b.747.1/19">Sadly that concept of service, which also applies to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces">Armed Forces</a>, is not just about applying for jobs and getting them. A pattern of development is important. Up to 20 per cent of the senior management structure, of which Robert Culshaw formed a part, is now said to be following his example and seeking early retirement. If that is so it is a sad and damaging situation. It sits disturbingly alongside the objective proclaimed by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Secretary">Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary</a> in his foreword to his 2003 strategy document, when he said that,</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.747.1/20">"the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCO">FCO</a> must preserve the diplomatic expertise, knowledge and professionalism that are its core strength, rightly admired across the world".</p> <p pid="b.747.1/21">Of course, I am not arguing that there should not be planning and effective control of public expenditure, but I invite reconsideration of the balance between the three aspects of overseas expenditure&#8212;defence, development and diplomacy. To take one example of defence, not long ago the MoD produced its <i>Major Projects Report 2005</i>, which states:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.747.1/22">"The Department expects . . . its top 20 equipment projects will meet Key User Requirements"&#8212; that is at least reassuring&#8212;</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.747.1/24">"but at a cost of &#163;29 billion, some 10 per cent higher than the expected cost at approval".</p> <p pid="b.747.1/25">We understand why the MoD was never the favourite department in the Treasury when I was there. But think of that figure.</p> <p pid="b.747.1/26">DfID is of course important in itself, but enhanced only if it is accompanied by effective diplomacy. In the six years since 1999, DfID's budget has expanded from &#163;2,764 million to &#163;4,481 million. That is an expansion of &#163;1,717 million, which is almost twice the core budget of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office at the end of that period. So I remind the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and his representative here on Earth&#8212;the noble Lord, Lord Triesman&#8212;of the statement from which I have just quoted:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.747.1/27">"the FCO must preserve the diplomatic expertise, knowledge and professionalism that are its core strength, rightly admired around the world".</p> <p pid="b.747.1/28">Defence, development and diplomacy: of those three, diplomacy is not the least important. I beg to move for Papers.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.751.0/1">My Lords, I congratulate the noble and learned Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Howe_of_Aberavon">Lord Howe of Aberavon</a>, on securing this debate and I thank him for the typically comprehensive and thoughtful way in which he opened our discussion. Perhaps I may also thank him for all the help and advice that he has given me in the past. It is one of the great strengths of your Lordships' House that, whatever our political differences, those of us who share a common interest in a subject can and do share real and helpful exchanges on the matters of concern to us. Of course, we all look forward very much to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=143" title="Maiden speech is the first formal speech made by an MP in the House of..." class="glossary">maiden speech</a> of the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Patten_of_Barnes">Lord Patten of Barnes</a>. He is a distinguished and welcome addition to this House, is no stranger to the Foreign Office and is able to speak from experience.</p> <p pid="b.751.0/2">It is now more than 30 years since I became a civil servant. Since then, I have represented some of the most senior civil servants, some of whom often sit on the Benches in your Lordships' House. Latterly, I have spent eight years as an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCO">FCO</a> and MoD <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>. In all that time I have never known a government department which believed that it was resourced to do all that it was charged to do. It is the common currency of government departments&#8212;particularly their Secretaries of State and Permanent Secretaries&#8212;to fight tooth and nail for their departments' budgets in the annual scrap with the Treasury.</p> <p pid="b.751.0/3">The rules of the game are very clear. Departments argue ferociously for a great deal more money, describing the dire consequences if they do not get it. The Treasury argues every bit as fiercely to save taxpayers' money and points out that government departments can and do survive by constantly looking at their own procedures to ferret out that fat which certainly arises in all bureaucracies.</p> <p pid="b.751.0/4">That said, the Foreign Office has achieved some extraordinary results on a budget which is under more pressure now than I can recall at any time in the past eight years. According to this year's annual report, the core budget for the FCO is &#163;854 million&#8212;a sum which must cover all our subscriptions to international organisations and out of which the FCO pays for 233 diplomatic missions around the world. This year, the FCO has succeeded in securing the modest increase in real terms of 1.2 per cent.</p> <p pid="b.751.0/5">The FCO's annual report sets out comprehensively what it does with those resources, but perhaps I may speak from personal experience. First, foreign policy is not a niche activity. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Foreign_Office">The Foreign Office</a> is now a global network for the whole of UK government activity. The Foreign Office's links with DfID, the MoD and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTI">DTI</a> are of course well established in respect of overseas development, defence and trade. But, increasingly, the Foreign Office promotes policy on domestic issues which have become globalised: for example, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> on crime, immigration and asylum; the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health">Department of Health</a> on the diseases of poverty, malaria, tuberculosis and the scourge of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV">HIV</a>/<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS">AIDS</a>; Defra on the environment and climate change; and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Education_and_Skills">Department for Education and Skills</a> on international co-operation and exchanges, and, of course, our greatest export&#8212;the English language.</p> <p pid="b.751.0/6">The mainstreaming of domestic policy into foreign policy is a real change. It is a clear and growing part of our agenda that makes new demands upon our diplomats and on their resources. The second change is an obvious one: the increase in acts of terrorism and the threat of terrorism around the world. The Foreign Office's role in dealing with terrorism is pivotal in multinational forums and in our bilateral relationships. The resourcing implications are enormous. The FCO now has to spend a hugely increased budget to secure its people in our missions overseas. From our devastated and beautiful consulate in Istanbul to the measures we have now had to take in 167 of our posts overseas, we have a duty of care for all our staff, and the Foreign Office needs the resources to discharge that duty fully.</p> <p pid="b.751.0/7">That brings me to the third point. Preventive action is always better than dealing with the aftermath of a failure to act, not only in human terms but in terms of hard cash. Better by far to build up resources on counter-terrorism than to try to repair wrecked lives and the physical damage to buildings and infrastructure&#8212;and, yes, to our trade as well. Nowhere is this more obvious than in foreign policy. Of course, sometimes military action is inevitable, and we can all argue about the point at which such decisions are appropriate, but diplomacy can and does work, often by supporting and encouraging others to find a way to talk to each other. We can look at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_and_Pakistan">India and Pakistan</a> over Kashmir; diplomacy in Macedonia; the struggles to go forward in Sudan; the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3">E3</a> with Iran; and the huge and sustained efforts in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East">Middle East</a>.</p> <p pid="b.751.0/8">So prevention is always better than cure, but it is not cheap. It involves people of real experience who know the history and personalities of the countries involved inside out, and building that trust and experience takes years. When the going gets bad, it takes a lot to keep going. It involves not only all those attributes, but also good judgment and a touch of wisdom.</p> <p pid="b.751.0/9">One of the most regrettable outcomes of the recent publicity generated by the memoirs of one of our former ambassadors to Washington is the reawakening of an image of our diplomatic service as an overindulged, rather self-important glitzy clique that owes more to the 1980s than to the 21st century. My experience of the diplomatic community is very different: modest, discreet, full of good judgment and not given to blowing its own trumpet. It is to these people we owe the most, particularly the, often young, people who deal with our consular services.</p> <p pid="b.751.0/10">The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, has said that public expectations of what the FCO should be doing for Britons abroad has changed out of all recognition. It is the benefit that most British people expect from the FCO. They may not dwell on our policies in remote parts of the world, but they want, and believe they have a right to expect, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a> help if they get into trouble overseas. FCO responses have improved, particularly in the creation of the consular rapid deployment team for when disaster strikes. The FCO continues to learn hard lessons, however, and all of us who are debating today must consider whether the resourcing in this crucial area of consular support is adequate to meet the needs and legitimate expectations of the people of this country.</p> <p pid="b.751.0/11">My last point will perhaps be thought somewhat controversial, but one of the benefits of leaving ministerial office is that it has certain compensations. I cannot understand why ambassadors no longer have the budgets they used to, to deploy in pursuance of government policy in the countries in which they serve. The FCO is fizzing with ideas and projects. In the area I know best, the Middle East, I could have spent the meagre budget I had over and over again on global outreach, including the growth of civil society, encouraging democracy, dialogue between the religions, empowering women, promoting the rule of law and human rights&#8212;and, believe you me, that was even more true of my ambassadors. Instead, the money was in DfID, much of it channelled through UN agencies and into EU funds, which&#8212;and I know this is controversial&#8212;simply did not have the expertise that we had in our own Foreign Office back yard. I think that needs looking at.</p> <p pid="b.751.0/12">Having got that off my chest, I will finish with this. We all know that the best resource is people. That is a two-way street. We have terrific people in the Foreign Office. They give us great service, and they deserve to have us invest in them.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.754.0/1">My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Howe_of_Aberavon">Lord Howe of Aberavon</a>, for this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution made by so many different parts of the United Kingdom community, both governmental and non-governmental, to the promotion of our interests abroad. I also welcome the fact that we will be able to hear the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Patten_of_Barnes">Lord Patten of Barnes</a>, make his important <a href="/glossary/?gl=143" title="Maiden speech is the first formal speech made by an MP in the House of..." class="glossary">maiden speech</a> in this House.</p> <p pid="b.754.0/2">Your Lordships will not be surprised that I shall concentrate my remarks on the first of the noble and learned Lord's Ds&#8212;defence and the work of the British military&#8212;first, to recognise the extraordinary contribution that our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces">Armed Forces</a> make around the world; and, secondly, to express concerns about the extent to which they will be able to continue this work in the future.</p> <p pid="b.754.0/3">During the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defence_Review">Strategic Defence Review</a>, the noble Lord, Lord Robertson of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Ellen">Port Ellen</a>, made defence diplomacy one of the eight core tasks for the Armed Forces. I was included in the study for that review, specifically looking at defence diplomacy, and I have subsequently done research work at King's College London for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence">Ministry of Defence</a> on measuring effectiveness in this area. As we conducted field trips to look at training teams, at loan service personnel and at graduates of British military courses, I was surprised, as were my academic colleagues, at the sheer range of influence which the United Kingdom gains for remarkably small investment. Within the field of defence diplomacy, the training of international students within the United Kingdom also plays an important part, as I know from my time as commandant at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Defence_Studies">Royal College of Defence Studies</a>. That extends beyond senior military personnel to foreign government officials, who move on to leadership posts in their countries. The long-term pay-offs to British interests can be very high indeed.</p> <p pid="b.754.0/4">I particularly welcome the developing co-operation that has grown between the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office and DfID, despite what the noble Baroness, Lady Symons of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernham_Dean">Vernham Dean</a>, has just said about problems between the Foreign Office and DfID. This has happened since the establishment of the Global Conflict Prevention Pool and the similar pool focused on sub-<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saharan_Africa">Saharan Africa</a>. The arrangement has encouraged the departments to work together to seek the best joint way of promoting stability in difficult areas of the world. Success in this can bring great dividends for British influence.</p> <p pid="b.754.0/5">As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, said, the money allocated remains relatively small in defence terms, and the problems of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East">Middle East</a> are diverting a disproportionate amount of even those small resources. Your Lordships have often talked about the overstretch of British forces as they undertake the operational tasks in Iraq, increasingly in Afghanistan, still in the Balkans and elsewhere, and have to cope with the downsizing of all three services. When priorities must be chosen, it is not surprising if the immediate operational tasks get preference. Yet influence and trust overseas can be built only over a period of years. A training team in a difficult country will gain access only as it demonstrates continuing, sustained commitment. The operational overstretch makes it more difficult for the services to provide people for training teams, loan service, advisory posts, and even to leaven the international courses with British military officers at places such as the Royal College of Defence Studies.</p> <p pid="b.754.0/6">Disaster relief has also, unhappily, become a more frequent requirement for British foreign action. Rapid and generous help to devastated regions builds friends in those regions and increases the United Kingdom's standing both locally and internationally. Yet we have recurring problems with the mechanics of deploying defence assets in sufficient quantity and with sufficient speed. Air transport, both fixed-wing and helicopter, remain the key to rapid and effective relief operations.</p> <p pid="b.754.0/7">I am not making a plea for an increase in the defence budget: it has seen a marginal real increase in funds in recent years. Yet that money is not going towards these sorts of operations. Transport helicopters are already in short supply and have been in constant use for operational reasons. When I asked the Defence <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, about plans for increasing transport helicopter numbers, his Written Answer on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-24">24 October</phrase> made it clear that there will be no more transport helicopters over the next five years. The money is going to attack and reconnaissance helicopters. Given the role that transport helicopters have in every aspect of modern military operations, this is a very surprising state of affairs and one which affects the good that we can do around the world.</p> <p pid="b.754.0/8">In that respect, I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work done by three Royal Air Force Chinooks deployed to help with the Pakistan earthquake. It is clear from the reports that have come back that they have achieved an enormous amount. It is not just the lifting capacity of the Chinook, it is the military organisation that supports it. Loads are used efficiently and sorties are not wasted, because re-supply is what the crews and their Army and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF">RAF</a> support teams are trained for. In 28 days, those three helicopters moved 1,700 tonnes of food, shelter and medical supplies to inaccessible places. However, I had to look deep on the DfID website to find out that they ceased operations on the <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-25">25 November 2005</phrase>, after just 28 days. There was no fanfare of trumpets for them coming home. It would be helpful if the Minister could indicate why they have been withdrawn. Have all the problems gone away? Do they no longer need helicopters in the region? In the battle for hearts and minds in the Islamic world, these sorts of contributions are beyond price.</p> <p pid="b.754.0/9">The British military are but one resource that the UK has available to promote its interests around the world. Democracy is more likely to grow from our efforts in sustained security sector reform than in quick, offensive military operations. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Foreign_Office">The Foreign Office</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_International_Development">Department for International Development</a> should take a keen interest in the MoD equipment programme, and make their future needs clear. The &#163;5.5 billion that the Iraq adventure has cost the UK so far could have bought much greater influence throughout the world than has been the case. Let us learn from our mistakes.</p>            </div>

I think that I have quoted before in this House a remarkable tribute paid to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Diplomatic_Service">British Diplomatic Service</a> by a former French foreign <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">minister</a>, Monsieur Couve de Murville who described our Diplomatic Service as the second best in the world.</p> <p pid="b.756.0/2">I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Howe_of_Aberavon">Lord Howe of Aberavon</a>, for initiating this important debate. Having accompanied him, on at least three occasions, for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCO">FCO</a>'s annual public expenditure "scrap"&#8212;if I can call it that&#8212;with the Treasury, I have some experience of the difficulties which Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaries regularly face in trying to limit the damage imposed on the Diplomatic Service by persistent Treasury pressure on an FCO budget which, even including the sums allocated to the British Council and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_World_Service">BBC World Service</a>, is less than one-third of 1 per cent of overall government spending; one of the smallest budgets in <a href="/glossary/?gl=101" title="Whitehall is a wide road that runs through the heart of Westminster,..." class="glossary">Whitehall</a>.</p> <p pid="b.756.0/3">I hope that the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Patten_of_Barnes">Lord Patten of Barnes</a>, whose <a href="/glossary/?gl=143" title="Maiden speech is the first formal speech made by an MP in the House of..." class="glossary">maiden speech</a> we much look forward to hearing today, will allow me to quote the following from his book <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Quite_the_Diplomat">Not Quite the Diplomat</a></i>. He writes:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.756.0/4">"Foreign ministers are not very interested in budgets, which is one reason why they get pushed around so much by finance ministers who see foreign ministry resources as an easy target for cost-cutting".</p> <p pid="b.756.0/5">Since there have been several references to the differences between the FCO and DfID, I would like to pay a tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Patten, for having taken the initiative, when he was Minister for Overseas Development and I was <a href="/glossary/?gl=179" title="A Permanent Secretary is a top civil servant- there is a permanent..." class="glossary">Permanent Secretary</a> of the Foreign Office, of inviting me to join his policy meetings whenever I could. He made a significant difference to the relationship between our two departments.</p> <p pid="b.756.0/6">I was grateful for the assurance given to the House by the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-02">2 November</phrase> that it is still the policy of Her Majesty's Government to pursue a global foreign policy. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Secretary">Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary</a>'s statement of <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-15">15 December 2004</phrase> no doubt represents the outcome of some painful and agonising decisions on how to meet the continuing demands of such a policy within the inadequate resources allocated to the Diplomatic Service. Many of us will have personal reasons to lament the closure or downgrading of particular posts, but there are two aspects to post closures which I should like to draw to your Lordships' attention. The first is that diplomacy is largely about making, retaining and passing on personal contacts&#8212;what an American book once called making friends and influencing people&#8212;a process in which the reduced programme of sponsored visits plays an important part. Once a post is closed, that process of contact-making is severely curtailed until&#8212;as often happens&#8212;it is later decided, at considerable and unnecessary cost, that the post should after all be reopened. In this uncertain world, a post which appears unimportant today may turn out to be crucial for British interests tomorrow.</p> <p pid="b.756.0/7">The second point relates to our experience during the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War">Falklands War</a>. Although the diplomatic skills of our Ambassador to Washington and our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Representative">Permanent Representative</a> to the United Nations were rightly praised at the time, too little attention has been paid to the massive and persistent efforts by our diplomatic posts around the world, and in particular with the non-permanent members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council">Security Council</a> that year, such as Panama and Togo, to support our case.</p> <p pid="b.756.0/8">I do not propose today to rehearse my familiar criticisms of the Iraq war, but there is one lesson which I hope has been learnt from the many mistakes which have been made over the invasion of Iraq&#8212;and that is that wars cannot be waged solely by the military. I have no way of knowing whether <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Christopher_Meyer">Sir Christopher Meyer</a> is right in saying that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> was regularly bypassed in contacts between 10 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street">Downing Street</a> and Washington over the invasion of Iraq. But the extent to which the Pentagon excluded the skills and professional advice of American diplomacy and foreign policy over Iraq was largely responsible for the lack of adequate planning for the aftermath. Defence and foreign policy go hand in hand, and it would be a serious tragedy if inadequate resources for the Diplomatic Service were to lead to underperformance by the Foreign Office side of that partnership, both in offering experienced and professional advice to Ministers, and in having the right people in the right posts and, incidentally, speaking the right language, to promote British political, strategic, economic and commercial interests, quite apart from the consular capacity to help British subjects in trouble.</p> <p pid="b.756.0/9">I have much sympathy for my former colleagues&#8212;I suppose that I am their former colleague&#8212;who had to make these painful recommendations to their Ministers. I do not intend to question the Minister about particular post closures beyond asking him, as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Africa">Minister for Africa</a>, whether sufficient thought was given to the implications of closing three sovereign posts in that continent on the eve of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s much vaunted <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_Africa">Year of Africa</a>. I hope that the Minister will carry back to his colleagues in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Treasury a message from this House&#8212;that if we are to continue to conduct a global foreign policy there must be adequate resources to do the job.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.757.0/1">My Lords, all of us know that one of the consequences of the increase in public debt, the fall in the growth rate and the rather lame performance in productivity, to which the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> owned up at the beginning of this week, more or less&#8212;I think probably less rather than more&#8212;is that over the rest of this Parliament we will see rising taxes and a squeeze on public spending. It makes a mock of our intelligence to suggest other than that. What does that presage? One thing that it clearly presages is another assault on the budgets of the Foreign Office, the British Council and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_World_Service">BBC World Service</a>.</p> <p pid="b.757.0/2">It is a curiosity of public life in this country that we review so frequently and underfund so equally regularly the things that we do best and the institutions which are most admired around the world. There is another review in train on our public diplomacy. I am sure that the noble Lord responsible for it will conduct it extremely well, but I ask myself: what is wrong with our public diplomacy? The institutions of private and public diplomacy in this country are widely admired around the world. Where we are unpopular&#8212;for example, in parts of the Islamic world&#8212;it is not because of failings in our public diplomacy, but because of the policies that we have pursued. It is rather easier to change the policies than the institutions of public diplomacy.</p> <p pid="b.757.0/3">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, whose chutzpah we should, I suppose, rather admire, offers us the vision of a Gladstonian foreign policy for this country. It is a tad vainglorious to propose a Gladstonian foreign policy without the Gladstonian resources to follow it through. As my noble and learned friend said at the beginning of the debate, we cannot cut much of a dash in the world if we do not adequately resource the Foreign Office, the British Council and the BBC World Service. It is difficult to retain the enthusiasm for our national values if we assault, once again, the budget of the BBC World Service. I will say in passing that it is a rum old world in which Mr <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a> suggests that the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> probably prefers Fox News to the BBC.</p> <p pid="b.757.0/4">My second point is an institutional one, which has already been touched on rather delicately. Perhaps I bring to our discussion too much of the bruiser habits of <a href="/glossary/?gl=112" title="During a debate members of the House of Commons traditionally refer to the..." class="glossary">another place</a>, but we all know that the Treasury hates the Foreign Office, and has done so for as long as I can remember. The Treasury thinks that the Foreign Office is a waste of space. The mindset, if I may follow the noble Baroness, is that all ambassadors wear red socks and that their principal function is exchanging gossip at the glitzy cocktail parties to which the noble Baroness referred. I suspect that the present Chancellor's personal prejudices reinforce the institutional prejudices of the department that he leads.</p> <p pid="b.757.0/5">In addition, the Prime Minister, whose profound belief in his own diplomatic skills is not perhaps always borne out by what happens&#8212;one considers, in passing, the present discussion about the EU rebate&#8212;has brought into No. 10 a great deal of policy-making from the Foreign Office. The noble Lord who has just spoken touched on some consequences of that. Despite the abilities of the officials concerned, the results have not been conspicuously successful.</p> <p pid="b.757.0/6">What has happened as a result is that the Foreign Office has been pushed into a rather defensive posture. It seeks to justify itself not by what it does best, which is to define and pursue our national interest in both political and commercial terms, but by turning itself into a sort of glorified management consultancy. Almost every ambassador and senior official with whom I have spoken in recent years has grumbled about being drowned in questionnaires and choked in management guff. That is not good management of a great public service. Frankly, a lot of it is charlatanry, as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker">Peter Drucker</a> would have said; and charlatanry at the behest of the Treasury.</p> <p pid="b.757.0/7">The last point that I want to make will sound a little counter-intuitive. Yet in spite of the death and destruction from Haiti and Colombia, via west Africa and Sudan, to Iraq and Afghanistan, we have actually become better in the past few years at avoiding conflict. The number of conflicts has fallen dramatically, while the number of casualties as a result of conflicts has also fallen dramatically.</p> <p pid="b.757.0/8">When I was Minister for Overseas Development, I sometimes used to worry that our ability to deliver humanitarian assistance, often necessary because of political failure, was greater than our ability to prevent the political failure in the first place. But there has been remarkable progress in the past few years. We have done a lot better through proactive diplomacy in preventing conflicts. I have seen a great deal of that myself, in my previous job, for example, in the Balkans, where this country played a formidable role. It is equally the case in west Africa. It makes no sense whatever to cut back on the resources that are required to conduct that proactive diplomacy&#8212;the resources that are required to ensure rather greater peace and stability around the world. We can do better, but we need the resources to do the job.</p> <p pid="b.757.0/9">I have one further point&#8212;my noble and learned friend touched on it at the outset in discussing the origin of a phrase that we all use. It has been a feature of our debates about Britain's role in the world in the past 40 or 50 years to discuss how we can ensure that the rest of the world sees us as a great country even though we are no longer a great power. We often talk about how we can be seen to "punch above our weight" to borrow that expression again. I do not want to be seen to be borrowing from my noble and learned friend's previous use of sporting metaphors but it is very difficult to punch, let alone above your weight, if you do not have boxing gloves. I very much hope, for what it is worth, that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor will bear that in mind in the months and years ahead.</p>            </div>

He is well known to us all because of his commitment and his long career in public life.

He became the Governor of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> in 1992 and gained the respect of us all by the dignified way in which he handed over sovereignty.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.760.1/1">My Lords, we look forward to hearing the noble Lord on many occasions and benefiting from his wide experience and wisdom.</p> <p pid="b.760.1/2">A couple of weeks ago, some kind person in the Foreign Office sent me an invitation to a meeting in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portcullis_House">Portcullis House</a>. It was the annual get-together of the science and innovation department of the Foreign Office, the occasion when staff come to London and compare notes and experiences. I am not sure why I was sent the invitation. Perhaps it was because, five years ago, I had worked with the science attach&#233; in Washington when I was there on official business.</p> <p pid="b.760.1/3">I had assumed that the position of science attach&#233; in Washington was unique because science in America is a sufficiently important matter to justify an attach&#233;. Imagine my surprise, then, when I went to the meeting to find that there were 44 posts in 29 countries. They worked as a network. The scientists were young&#8212;mind you, everyone seems young to me nowadays&#8212;but they were not the kind of scientists who learn more and more about less and less. They were diplomats, too, and had a rounded view about the international importance of science. I was impressed.</p> <p pid="b.760.1/4">When the noble and learned Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Howe_of_Aberavon">Lord Howe of Aberavon</a>, tabled his Motion about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCO">FCO</a>&#8212;and I congratulate him on that&#8212;I thought that I would draw your Lordships' attention to the science and innovation network. It is a resource that is, and will continue to be, central to the promotion of our worldwide interests. It is central because much of what we want to achieve in our foreign policy is related to science. Let us take as an example an agreement on climate change, as mentioned by my noble friend Lady Symons. Such an agreement is being negotiated at the moment and is a stated priority of our presidency of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8">G8</a> and the EU. Diplomacy, foreign policy and science are closely intertwined in this matter.</p> <p pid="b.760.1/5">Next week, in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, we shall be discussing trade liberalisation with poor countries. The trade and development committee of the Doha round has special responsibility to build capacity in these countries, capacity to enable free trade. Central to this building of technical and scientific competence is the creation of a scientific infrastructure so that agriculture can be improved and industry can move into the modern knowledge economy. Scientific capacity is also needed to defeat <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS">AIDS</a> and malaria, to improve health generally in these countries, and, incidentally, to slow down international migration of skilled and trained personnel from third world countries. This is science and diplomacy working together.</p> <p pid="b.760.1/6">Guaranteeing our energy supplies requires science and diplomacy to work together. The world needs international science to help clean up the old sources of energy with clean coal technology and carbon sequestration, which are important to both China and the United Kingdom. We are going to need international scientific collaboration if we are to build a new, modern nuclear power station with minimum waste. And if thermonuclear is an important future energy source, then we will need to be part of an international reactor. These are global concerns which reflect the age we live in&#8212;a scientific and diplomatic global age.</p> <p pid="b.760.1/7">My noble friend Lady Symons and the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Garden">Lord Garden</a>, spoke of security. Scientific concerns are becoming ever more apparent where our security is concerned. There has to be international collaboration on various aspects of cyberspace, explosives of all kinds and dangerous toxins. We need diplomatic scientists to understand and control these things. It is right that these resources should come from the Foreign Office. The relationship is too close and the risks are too great for divided loyalties.</p> <p pid="b.760.1/8">Science and diplomacy also go together in regulation. There are worldwide different and conflicting views on regulating many matters: therapeutic cloning; the ozone layer; toxicity of everyday chemicals. Regulation of these matters requires both international diplomacy and scientific understanding to ensure that the international regulatory framework provides a level playing field that encourages innovation but prevents economic and commercial damage from free-riding low minimum standards. Science and diplomacy are a joint thread running through all of this.</p> <p pid="b.760.1/9">Perhaps the most important way in which science and diplomacy can promote the worldwide interests of this country is to use science to promote British business while at the same time promoting British science to attract new investment into the United Kingdom. This country has been a big investor in science. This Government really believe in the old saying, "If you think science is expensive, try ignorance". I have tried to show that we will benefit from this investment not only through innovation and new technology but also through diplomacy. Science is central to our foreign policy objectives.</p> <p pid="b.760.1/10">The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, spoke about cuts and de-layering. My noble friend Lady Symons spoke about resources under pressure. I therefore hope that my noble friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> can assure me that the science and innovation unit at the Foreign Office will receive care, attention and support from Ministers, because it is an important resource for the promotion of our worldwide interests.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.762.0/1">My Lords, when I was in Lesotho last month, I visited a small museum in Morija, a village about an hour's drive south of the capital, Maseru. On display were a variety of fascinating artefacts and literature about the country and the Basotho people. In the early 1800s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Protestant">French Protestant</a> missionaries were active among the local tribespeople. Later that century, the Basotho were in danger of losing control of their land to Boer settlers. After several wars, the land became a British protectorate. A letter on display in the museum, written by the Basotho chief, Chief Moshoeshoe, to the governor of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Province">Cape Province</a> in November 1869 caught my eye. Moshoeshoe, who had been unwell, wrote:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.762.0/2">"I feel a little better, and I won't delay any more in sending to our gracious Queen a token of my gratitude for the precious peace we enjoy since we have been proclaimed British subjects. Men, women and children join me in feelings of gratitude, and we pray the Almighty to bless and keep in his love the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Queen">Great Queen</a> who so kindly received us as her children".</p> <p pid="b.762.0/3">Possessing, he said,</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.762.0/4">"nothing worthy to be presented to a Great Queen," he nevertheless hoped that the gift of a leopard skin destined for Her Majesty would reach her.</p> <p pid="b.762.0/6">Seventy years later, over 21,000 Basotho citizens served with the British forces during <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II</a>. Many lost their lives in that conflict. But their commitment to the UK was still as great as in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s reign. They were proud of it. We were grateful for that support. Fast forward another 60 years. What do we find? At the Armistice service in Maseru which I watched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-13">Sunday 13 November</phrase>, all the custom and ceremonial of such moving occasions&#8212;the remembrance of sacrifice, of human tragedy; respect for the dead and wounded&#8212;were rigorously observed. It started with a two-minute silence and a trumpeter playing the "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Post">Last Post</a>".</p> <p pid="b.762.0/7">I spoke about this event two weeks ago in the debate on the Commonwealth. I also wrote to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> immediately on my return to London to question why there had been no formal British representative to lay a wreath. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_and_Queen">The King and Queen</a>, members of the Government and several other distinguished citizens all laid a wreath at the foot of the impressive war memorial. Further wreaths were laid by foreign diplomats, but none from Britain. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americans">The Americans</a>, the Chinese, the Libyans, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africans">South Africans</a>, the French, the Canadians, the Germans, the Irish and the Dutch were all represented by ambassadors, a high commissioner or consuls and laid wreaths. What a discouraging and discourteous message to send to a proud, now independent, nation that has given blood and loyalty to this country. One of a large number of World War II veterans present&#8212;there were well over 150, some still wearing their old uniforms&#8212;laid the final wreath. Flying prominently from his black beret was a small <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Jack">Union Jack</a> flag.</p> <p pid="b.762.0/8">I recount this story, not just to highlight the apparently insensitive way in which today's Government are treating Lesotho, but to draw attention to an even more important general point. Sudden, even small, changes of this nature send an adverse message to a much larger fraternity within the developing nations of the Commonwealth. Many such countries, including Lesotho, have much to offer as they grow&#8212;and grow they will. Clearly, with embassies or consular representation in Lesotho, the Chinese, the Americans, the Libyans and others, as well as international organisations such as the UN, the EU and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AU">AU</a>, whose representatives also laid wreaths at the memorial, all feel that there are commercial and other opportunities for the countries that they represent.</p> <p pid="b.762.0/9">It surprises me that this Government, presumably entirely for financial reasons, are disengaging and not seeking to promote British interests more strongly in the developing nations of the Commonwealth. As the <i>primus inter pares</i> of the Commonwealth of nations, surely it is right that the Commonwealth interests are strongly espoused by this country. While the loyalties of previous generations are being remembered by those who participated, we should not be retrenching and pouring cold water on the past.</p> <p pid="b.762.0/10">In the time available to me, perhaps I may mention one other aspect of our response to foreign events which falls short of what this country should achieve. I know from the horrific personal experiences of two British friends caught up by the tsunami in Thailand that they were offered far speedier and more relevant help from German diplomats than by staff from our own embassy, and that included the immediate offer of free flights back to Germany.</p> <p pid="b.762.0/11">Our response to the desperate need for helicopters following the recent earthquake in Pakistan was delayed because decisions to deploy were caught up in an interdepartmental wrangle about which of them should shoulder the costs. Our helicopters stayed for only a month, as the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Garden">Lord Garden</a>, mentioned, and they have now been withdrawn. We do not seem to have capacity to cope sufficiently with these sorts of disasters and the ongoing demands of Iraq and Afghanistan. It is not fair to blame service and civilian individuals who are trying to cope with the problems on the ground as they arise. It seems more a reflection of a systematic failure to appreciate the equipment and manpower limitations and the need to respond at the pace which such disasters demand.</p> <p pid="b.762.0/12">This is not a new problem; I have seen it happen time and again. The cost of sending <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF">RAF</a> helicopters to help Mozambique when that country was flooded in 2001 was disputed between the MoD and DfID, and departure was delayed. The public rightly expect the government of the day to respond to disasters. Money is said to be available, but those on the ground or those trying to get help into the area seem to be frustrated by a lack of rapidly delegated financial responsibility and the authority to get on with it.</p> <p pid="b.762.0/13">Interdepartmental bickering over which should bear the cost, or delays in authorising those on the spot to provide financial and other assistance, must be handled better. This is an endemic problem, and it does this country, and the many individuals who try to help, little credit. I hope that the Government will deal with it properly and be frank enough to admit to our limitations if they cannot.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.764.0/1">My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Patten_of_Barnes">Lord Patten of Barnes</a>, on his stimulating and challenging <a href="/glossary/?gl=143" title="Maiden speech is the first formal speech made by an MP in the House of..." class="glossary">maiden speech</a>, and I wish him many happy years on the Benches opposite.</p> <p pid="b.764.0/2">I say at the outset that I am an ardent supporter of all the institutions under discussion today&#8212;namely, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCO">FCO</a>, DfID, the British Council and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_World_Service">BBC World Service</a>. I welcome the fact that the noble and learned Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Howe_of_Aberavon">Lord Howe of Aberavon</a>, has initiated this debate, not least to dispel some misconceptions, some of which were mentioned by my noble friend Lady Symons. I also declare an interest as the British Council's parliamentary representative to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Federation">Russian Federation</a> and former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a>.</p> <p pid="b.764.0/3">Although I greatly respect the work of all the institutions I have mentioned, I do not really see that there is a crisis at the heart of this debate. Real funding for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a>, the British Council and the BBC World Service has increased. Overall, the FCO's budget has increased in real terms by &#163;143 million since 1999&#8211;2000. Following the 2004 spending review, like other departments, the FCO has to meet efficiency targets of 2.5 per cent per annum over three years. It will deliver &#163;86 million of savings by 2007&#8211;08, and those savings will release more funds for front-line activities.</p> <p pid="b.764.0/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> must respond to changing priorities. The FCO, for example, has opened 18 new sovereign and subordinate posts with UK-based staff since 1997, along with 13 locally staffed posts. Ten posts have been closed over the same period, and in this regard our record is better than that of France or Germany. There are now 268 posts compared with 266 at the time of the 1997 <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a>, before which the party of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, was in office. In the past three years alone, reflecting the new global realities, the UK has opened missions in Baghdad, Basra, Kabul and Pyongyang. By comparison, one of the sovereign posts closed was in Nassau in the Bahamas&#8212;hardly of the same order of geopolitical importance.</p> <p pid="b.764.0/5">The FCO's efficiency savings will also allow the UK to focus on its priority areas, including counter-proliferation, counter-terrorism, energy and climate change. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Africa">In Africa</a>, for example, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office plans to create new jobs to cover some of these issues across the region. There will be a new post in Nairobi to support work on climate change, one in Nigeria to cover energy, and one in Pretoria to cover regional issues.</p> <p pid="b.764.0/6">All these initiatives are to be welcomed, and they focus rightly on the UK's priorities in today's world rather than reflecting Britain's colonial past. All this was presaged in the December 2003 <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>, <i>UK International Priorities: A Strategy for the FCO</i>, which was mentioned earlier by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe.</p> <p pid="b.764.0/7">Although I do not have time to develop the argument, funding for both the BBC World Service and the British Council has also gone up. The former's budget has risen over the past year from &#163;225 million to &#163;239 million, and the latter's will increase from &#163;172 million to &#163;193 million in 2007&#8211;08. As has been said during the debate, of course there are always calls on further resources, and the Government must decide where their priorities lie. As has been mentioned, DfID's spending, for example, has dramatically increased over the past few years and reflects the Government's priorities in fighting global poverty and ill health. Who could argue with that? The Government's aim of achieving their target of raising overseas aid to 0.7 per cent of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a> by 2013 is laudable and should be welcomed by your Lordships' House.</p> <p pid="b.764.0/8">Coming back to the World Service, I argue that it is also right to try to shift the emphasis from eastern and central Europe to parts of the world where democracy and freedom are less in evidence. For that reason, I can see the logic of retargeting the vernacular language services away from Czech, Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Slovene, Bulgarian, Portuguese and Croatian. But Kazakh? There I have a question.</p> <p pid="b.764.0/9">In my view, axing Kazakh is a mistake. Kazakhstan under President Nazarbayev needs all the encouragement possible to become more democratic and less autocratic. Its people need to be able to hear the BBC, just as millions in the old Soviet Union used to tune in to London to listen to propaganda-light news and entertainment. When I go to Russia, people still tell me how during the Cold War they used to tune in, illegally in those days, to the BBC World Service and listen to the news from London. It was very important to them. One of the most famous journalists in Russia today is not Russian but a journalist based at the BBC in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_House">Bush House</a> who used to broadcast to Russia.</p> <p pid="b.764.0/10">I hope that when the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> replies he will reflect on my last point and accept my suggestion that the BBC World Service should think again before it abandons such a strategically important part of the planet.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.765.0/1">My Lords, I apologise for having arrived a few minutes late for this debate due to my train being late. I apologise, in particular, to my noble and learned friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Howe_of_Aberavon">Lord Howe of Aberavon</a>, the beginning of whose speech I missed. As other noble Lords have done, I congratulate him on initiating this debate.</p> <p pid="b.765.0/2">I declare an interest as a former member of the foreign service, which I served for 11 years. It is not surprising, therefore, that I agree with noble Lords who have supported that service. They are absolutely right. I think, in particular, of the speeches of the noble Baroness, Lady Symons of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernham_Dean">Vernham Dean</a>, the noble Lord, Lord Wright of Richmond, and my noble friend Lord Patten. They were not the only ones; I just select them because they come from different sides of the House and there has been support for that line of argument from both sides. I simply believe that the foreign service is the best organisation that I have ever had contact with.</p> <p pid="b.765.0/3">I remember 20 years or so ago attending a reception at No. 10 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street">Downing Street</a> given by the noble Baroness, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Thatcher">Lady Thatcher</a>, who was then <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, which was for a visiting team of members of the Chinese government. I think that there were five of them, rather remarkably. They came into the room and walked up to the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, whom they recognised, and shook her hand. They then looked around the room and they clearly did not recognise anyone apart from one young woman, Kathy Flower, who had been presenting a programme in the English language on Chinese television. They all knew her by sight. I guess that every other member of the Chinese government would have known her if they had been there.</p> <p pid="b.765.0/4">One of the problems with the Treasury's attitude towards the foreign service is that it is constantly going in for false economies, when it goes for economies, and they are not always the right ones. I served in Cambodia 40 years ago when Cambodia had just become independent after the end of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Vietnam">French Vietnam</a> war. Phnom Penh, which was a delightful little town, was inundated with new embassies. It had not had embassies before because it was only a province of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Indochina">French Indochina</a>. We had a vast American embassy, and we had a tiny British embassy consisting of seven Brits. Other countries had big embassies. That created an enormous housing problem, because houses for western or American people did not exist in any quantity. One of my main tasks as head of chancery was to find new housing for the staff, which was not at all an easy job. I used to drive around Phnom Penh, which fortunately had a grid system as Manhattan does, and stop at every crossroads and look down the road in each direction to see if there were any piles of bricks. If there were, that meant that a Cambodian was building a new house, so I followed that up.</p> <p pid="b.765.0/5">I was so impressed by the problem that I made a study of the costs that would be incurred if the British embassy bought a piece of land big enough to house the chancery and all the other necessary staff residences. I got a deal with a Cambodian general who owned some land, and he agreed that he would sell it if the British government would agree. The calculation that I made was that we would pay for the whole purchase of the land and the cost of construction in two and a half years. My house at that time&#8212;1956&#8212;which was in the Cambodian quarters, up on bricks, was costing us &#163;4,000 a month. I thought that was ridiculous, so I sent a report to London urging that we should follow up the idea of buying a property. It was turned down, no doubt because of Treasury <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a>. The Treasury's view was that it might only last for two and a half years; in fact it lasted for 20 years, and we still have it now after an interval during the era of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot">Pol Pot</a>. That is a great error. Soon after I came back to this country from Cambodia, I came across an ambassador who had raised with the then <a href="/glossary/?gl=99" title="The chancellor of the exchequer is the government's chief financial..." class="glossary">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derick_Heathcoat_Amory">Derick Heathcoat Amory</a>, the question of why we insisted on renting so many properties abroad and not building or buying. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a>'s answer was, "What policy?". Apparently no one had consulted him about that very expensive means of proceeding.</p> <p pid="b.765.0/6">The other thing that I want to mention is the tendency for the Government to abolish embassies and high commissions abroad. A list of eight small countries where we are closing or have closed embassies or high commissions was published in <i>Hansard</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-11">11 October</phrase> at col. <i>WS 13</i>. They are not important countries. Many of them are in the Pacific, which is a very large ocean and a lonely place. It is worth having a small staff in most of these missions for reassurance and in recognition of the fact that all of them have the same vote in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Assembly_of_the_United_Nations">General Assembly of the United Nations</a> as this country does. I am talking about eight countries in this latest bunch of calculations.</p> <p pid="b.765.0/7">It may be said that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> has displayed an interest in foreign affairs in his visits to South Africa and to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_East">Far East</a>. That is a sudden interest on his part, and I wondered whether it meant that there would be a change in his attitude towards the expenditure on the foreign service. I am afraid that I was struck by doubt whether it might in fact be intended to help the promotion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>            </div>

I also welcome the <a href="/glossary/?gl=143" title="Maiden speech is the first formal speech made by an MP in the House of..." class="glossary">maiden speech</a> by my noble friend Lord Patten. We are facing questions about whether Britain wants and needs a global diplomacy and whether we can afford it. The answer to both those questions is yes. By any yardstick, the United Kingdom is one of the four or five most important industrial nations in the world. We have interests. I hope without undue self-congratulation or being holier than thou, we can say that Britain represents certain values as well. We take seriously our position as the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world. Can we afford a global diplomacy? As the noble Lord, Lord Wright of Richmond, pointed out, the cost of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Diplomatic_Service">British Diplomatic Service</a> is about &#163;850 million per annum&#8212;that is out of a total government expenditure of &#163;521 billion. We are talking about 0.16 per cent of total government expenditure. Suffice it to say that last year alone two government departments overspent by more than that amount. No doubt the Treasury feels&#8212;I dare say that it is right&#8212;that it should go through an expenditure round with the Foreign Office, but the sums involved barely register on the radar screen.</p> <p pid="b.767.0/2">I propose to concentrate on Latin America. I have the honour of being president of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canning_House">Canning House</a>, a position in which I succeeded my noble friend Lady Hooper. Latin America has 21 countries, a population of 560 million, and a gross domestic product of $2.26 trillion. It is a continent where Spanish is the most widely spoken language. As noble Lords will be aware, Spanish is the most widely spoken language after English in what we used to call the free world. It is the most widely spoken language in the United States of America. Brazil, which does not speak Spanish, exercises an enormous cultural influence. One has only to look at the debates going on about the Doha round to see the importance of Brazil.</p> <p pid="b.767.0/3">They like us; we have a good history down there. It was <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Canning">George Canning</a> who first dispatched British troops to fight alongside Bolivar in the wars of independence. It was through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London">City of London</a> that most of the infrastructure that now exists in Latin America was financed and built. Names such as Cochrane, O'Higgins and Brigadier Wright are still commonly talked of in Latin America. How are we doing down there? Well, we have closed four embassies: Paraguay; Nicaragua; El Salvador; and Honduras. No doubt the Treasury even today is congratulating itself on a saving of no less than &#163;1 million. As the noble Lord, Lord Wright, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, have pointed out, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_American">Latin American</a> department at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> has been reduced by something like 40 per cent in the past two years. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, referred to Robert Culshaw, an outstanding Foreign Office official who retired early. The whole department has been reduced in rank.</p> <p pid="b.767.0/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heads">The Heads</a> of Mission Gift Scheme, to which the noble Baroness referred, has been cancelled. I just mentioned that we have closed our embassy in Paraguay, where there is one very good example of the Heads of Mission Gift Scheme. When we had an embassy there, out-of-use fire engines from the United Kingdom were brought to Asuncion, and there is now a fire station called the Grand Britannia fire station. While we may not have an embassy, at least there is a fire station with our name on it. When a tragic fire took place in Asuncion recently, that fire station played a sterling role.</p> <p pid="b.767.0/5">We are sliding almost unnoticed into the second <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">division</a>. I bow to no one in my desire and wish to see the European Union flourish but I can predict that, at the present rate, in 15 or 20 years' time we shall find ourselves with one embassy in Mexico, one in Brazil and in all the other 20 republics we shall no doubt be represented by the European Union. I do not think that that is good enough.</p> <p pid="b.767.0/6">I think that it is now possible to talk, without sounding faintly ludicrous, about the next Conservative government. Wisely, the new leader of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party">Conservative Party</a> has set up a series of policy groups to look at policy in all areas. That is precisely what my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Thatcher">Lady Thatcher</a> did in the late 1970s; indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Patten, was instrumental in many of those committees. I very much hope that they will look seriously at the way in which the Foreign Office is being funded. Just as in the 1970s the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> made a commitment to increase in real terms the defence expenditure by the incoming Conservative government over the first term of office, I hope that the policy committees will come to the conclusion that Britain is still a nation: that our interests and values need to be upheld throughout the world. If the Government decide to take that on board, they will enjoy the support of the Conservative Opposition, as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=175" title="The &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; is head of &quot;Her Majesty's Official..." class="glossary">Leader of the Opposition</a> said yesterday. If they do not, I hope that the next Conservative government will go into the election with a commitment over their first term in office to increase expenditure on our foreign service in real terms by between 3 and 5 per cent.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.769.0/1">My Lords, I have been in this House a relatively short time but during that time have learnt that sooner or later the opportunity to express a cherished view will arise. Just such an opportunity has arisen today and I thank the noble and learned Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Howe_of_Aberavon">Lord Howe of Aberavon</a>, for providing the occasion.</p> <p pid="b.769.0/2">I have spent quite a lot of my working life in underdeveloped countries where resources are scarce if not absent; and every time I visit those countries I am both taken aback and humbled by the esteem in which the UK is held. It is a rather curious phenomenon. Other countries may give more money, more technical assistance, more commercial opportunities and, possibly, more encouragement to young people to avail themselves of educational opportunities. But still the UK counts&#8212;and counts for quite a lot. What, I ask myself, are we doing to deserve this esteem, or perhaps what are we doing to preserve it?</p> <p pid="b.769.0/3">What we are doing is the British Council. For more than seven decades governments have continued to fund the British Council to seek and create enduring cultural relations&#8212;and long may that funding continue and increase. I declare an interest as a parliamentary ambassador for the British Council. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_British_Council">The British Council</a> is a good thing. It induces a warm feeling. It undoubtedly has the good housekeeping seal of approval. But how many really know what it does, the range and diversity of its programmes and its impact?</p> <p pid="b.769.0/4">Let us take Afghanistan as an example&#8212;a country devastated by wars, civil unrest, religious fanaticism and extreme poverty. The whole humanitarian world is now there, largely in Kabul, albeit in an unco-ordinated and sometimes inappropriate series of projects. But what do people, not governments, want? They want their children to be educated so that they can become part of the international community. They want to participate tangibly in building a new country and they want to forge friendships with the British and with their institutions. The council is working on several projects&#8212;for example, training and networking sessions for potential women parliamentarians and civil service reform&#8212;all of which will contribute to the development of a civil society culture in Afghanistan. In turn, that will provide the bedrock for democratic development.</p> <p pid="b.769.0/5">In Iraq, the British Council is creating a few oases of cultural freedom in the midst of chaos. The aim was to end that country's educational isolation especially at the higher and technical levels. Training and networking events have been held, leadership courses run and resource centres set up. The focus on capacity building is again the essential basis for the growth of democratic institutions; and there is now a partnership arrangement involving 14 colleges and institutions in Iraq linked with eight colleges of higher education in the UK.</p> <p pid="b.769.0/6">The diversity of programmes is remarkable. I first worked with the British Council on an earthquake recovery programme in Turkey in the 1970s and from 2000 until 2003 with an access to information programme which began in Peru, has now extended to several other countries in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America">South America</a> and has resulted in binding legal agreements and practical local initiatives to ensure that people participate in decisions that affect their lives and livelihoods. A recent US study suggests strongly that non-violent civic forces are a major factor in positive political change, but change initiated by the &#233;lite&#8212;a top-down democratic change&#8212;has little positive effect on democratisation. It is the British Council working with people at the local level and being the interface between what people want in cultural relationships, educational development and the government of that country which is so extraordinarily valuable.</p> <p pid="b.769.0/7">In the 109 countries in which the British Council works it contributes daily to the UK's international standing and reputation and to the development of civil society. It is hugely experienced in what it does; and its work is a powerful and synergistic combination of development, democracy and debate. We would have to invent it if it did not exist. The British Council, together with one or two other international outreach enterprises such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_World_Service">BBC World Service</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Parliamentary_Association">Commonwealth Parliamentary Association</a> and a few others, go some way to mitigate the loss of a comprehensive British diplomatic presence around the world.</p>            </div>

I hope that we shall hear a lot more of the robust "Patten-speak" which we heard.</p> <p pid="b.770.0/2">Once upon a time we had a Foreign Office which embraced foreign relations, culture and overseas aid. Diplomats in a long and varied career made friends in the countries in which they served and in other missions. Years later that investment paid off. In the 1950s, our ambassador in Moscow, William Hayter, and the US ambassador, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_Bohlen">Chip Bohlen</a>, were close friends&#8212;a friendship which survived even the impact of Suez. They had been Third Secretaries together in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a> before the war at the time of the great treason trials. Such friendships have often been made in difficult countries with exotic languages and have given us access to otherwise impenetrable regimes. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_British_Council">The British Council</a> and the World Service have also played a most valuable role as part of the political relationship. So, too, did aid.</p> <p pid="b.770.0/3">When this Government came to power everything changed. When asked his view of British foreign policy, the head of the foreign policy centre set up by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> said that he was shocked to discover that it was based on the promotion of <a href="/glossary/?gl=247" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_interest" class="glossary">the national interest</a>. We should not, he said, be talking to political leaders, moreover, but to the grass roots. DfID was created and its <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> thereafter made decisions, notably in Ethiopia, Uganda, the Congo and Zimbabwe with little or no perception of the political consequences. Giving aid was good; and that was enough.</p> <p pid="b.770.0/4">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_for_Africa">Commission for Africa</a> is full of DfID-speak and the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s vaunted friends on that body are the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Ethiopia">Prime Minister of Ethiopia</a>&#8212;who has recently been shooting down unarmed civilians who are not voting the right way and gearing up for another war with Eritrea&#8212;and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Museveni">President Museveni</a> of Uganda whose desire for a third term has led him to seize and imprison his chief political rival and threaten him with death for treason. According to the DfID profile on Ethiopia, our development assistance of at least &#163;60 million a year over three years is mainly in the form of budget support&#8212;that is, a direct grant&#8212;</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.770.0/5">"in response to the government's clearly stated preference for this form of financial assistance".</p> <p pid="b.770.0/6">Fortunately the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> has intervened to suspend further payments in the light of recent events.</p> <p pid="b.770.0/7">In the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRC">DRC</a> the Government have given over &#163;22 million to help with the supervision of elections and &#163;40 million to help rebuild the country&#8212;let alone the money given to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MONUC">MONUC</a>&#8212;all money down the drain. We should leave it to South Africa, which has major commercial interests there, to help the Congo.</p> <p pid="b.770.0/8">We are not only helping a number of African countries directly; we also contribute through the EU, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank">World Bank</a> and, above all, the United Nations with &#163;70 million in the DRC alone this year. In 2004&#8211;05, DfID contributed over &#163;330 million and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCO">FCO</a> budget over &#163;217 million to UN agencies. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN">The UN</a> is not noted for its efficient, or sometimes even honest, management of money. Why do we not give more of that money to our own posts to disburse?</p> <p pid="b.770.0/9">DfID spends a lot of money. Why not? Britain is rich compared to the countries of Africa, for instance. My quarrel is with the disastrous effects of the new order on our knowledge of, and therefore influence in, the world. The FCO has major responsibilities that are now threatened. It is responsible for the safety and well-being of British subjects abroad. That is becoming a more onerous task. DfID cannot get British subjects out of gaol, ensure the safety of a threatened British community in a coup, or rescue a British subject from a forced marriage. The FCO is responsible for the promotion of British economic and defence interests, which requires excellent local contacts and knowledge of the economic and political hazards. Not least, the FCO has a duty to report on the international terrorist threat, whether from Russia's still-undestroyed chemical weapons, which are vulnerable to terrorists, or from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a> in Africa. Eritrea, Sudan, Kenya, Somalia and even Malawi have all contributed to the terrorist threat in some way. We cannot cover that by an e-mail from No. 10, yet we have only minute diplomatic posts in those vulnerable countries, while DfID is expanding all over Africa.</p> <p pid="b.770.0/10">The FCO, which is responsible for reporting on international terrorism, the promotion of Britain's economic and defence interests and the security of British citizens abroad, is being weakened daily by the cutting of posts and resources. Yet, all around Africa&#8212;and not only Africa&#8212;you will find minute diplomatic posts and large, lavishly staffed, separate DfID offices. In the UN, every country's vote counts, as the Chinese, who are opening up everywhere, well understand. We, however, are wilfully reducing our influence in the name of a short-sighted economic drive. The Treasury has required the FCO to close nine embassies and 21 consulates and to retire 70 experienced diplomats, all to save &#163;6 million per annum in an overall target of &#163;86 million. Last year, the DfID budget for Africa alone was &#163;357 million, and that department had 348 UK-based staff in post.</p> <p pid="b.770.0/11">The work of the Commission for Africa, if it ever comes to anything, will not be done by closing posts in Africa, or by relying on DfID to assess the political risks or to estimate the political future of a leader such as Museveni. It concerns me that the chief responsibility for advising the Prime Minister on Africa in his strategic unit has gone to a relatively junior DfID representative, to whom all communications on policy from our African posts must go, whose political experience of Africa is probably minimal.</p> <p pid="b.770.0/12">In a further dilution of the influence on policy of the FCO, I understand that DfID is now to be represented on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIC">JIC</a>. In the recent <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>, it was truly said that having a post on the ground is the most effective form of diplomatic representation in a country. It is the proper representation of our country, not its philanthropic activity, and I believe it to be vital and at risk. DfID is a valuable entity, but it should be only one of the manifestations of our international policy. So long as the countries we support as donors through DfID perceive DfID missions, which are often quite large, as a separate policy-making entity, completely independent of the usually very small diplomatic mission, the diplomats will not be regarded as the voice of the UK, and they will not have appropriate political access and influence. The DfID mission, which is full of young technical specialists who often neither speak the language nor understand the culture and politics, will be seen as the seat of power and influence. That will rarely be appropriate. Her Majesty's Government should not forget that donors are rarely loved or respected, and are often perceived or represented as colonialist in their approach, whereas diplomatic relations confer dignity and imply equality. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Africa">In Africa</a>, this is not an issue to be ignored.</p> <p pid="b.770.0/13">A culture in this Government that fails to value trained professionals as a resource and allows the Treasury to play number games is having disastrous consequences. It is not unknown for a Prime Minister to want to be his own <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Minister">Foreign Minister</a>. In the past, they had the sense to read papers and use a superb professional machine, the Office. God help us if we ever have a Prime Minister who, in addition, regards the Office as just one more expendable, old-fashioned cottage hospital. Skills are not easily replaced.</p>            </div>

The MP who has moved,..." class="glossary">opening speech</a>. I congratulate, too, my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Patten_of_Barnes">Lord Patten of Barnes</a> on his <a href="/glossary/?gl=143" title="Maiden speech is the first formal speech made by an MP in the House of..." class="glossary">maiden speech</a> which, in accordance with the traditions of your Lordships' House, was, by his standards, wholly uncontroversial. He and I have shared many adventures in the past, and I hope that we shall share many adventures in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> in years to come. I congratulate him on his personal contribution to our public diplomacy through his books <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_and_West">East and West</a></i> and <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Quite_the_Diplomat">Not Quite the Diplomat</a></i>, which I gather are selling in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific">Asia-Pacific</a> region, if not like hot cakes, certainly like cold tinnies.</p> <p pid="b.773.0/2">I, too, bring a particular perspective to this debate, having been <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of State at the Foreign Office responsible for the Foreign Office budget when my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hurd">Lord Hurd</a> was <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>, and subsequently having been <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Commissioner">High Commissioner</a> in Australia, in which context, I turned poacher. There was a certain resonance in the expression "management guff" used by my noble friend Lord Patten, but I will not follow him down that route.</p> <p pid="b.773.0/3">In recent years, the volume and velocity of diplomatic activity has increased enormously. There are now 15 million British citizens living aboard, and 65 million overseas trips are made by British citizens every year. Demands for travel advice and consular, visa and passport services are constantly increasing. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Kingdom">The United Kingdom</a>'s worldwide interests are pursued through ever more direct contacts between heads of government and senior officials. There is ever more interchange with countries across the range of government activities and ever greater volumes of communication. The role of resident diplomats overseas has been enormously enhanced over the years. Diplomacy has become, as the noble Baroness, Lady Symons of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernham_Dean">Vernham Dean</a>, said, a whole of government activity. The communications revolution has broadened our horizons and our opportunities and hugely intensified the pressures on the Diplomatic Service.</p> <p pid="b.773.0/4">Although, as a nation, we are usually too modest to make vainglorious claims, as the noble Lord, Lord Wright of Richmond said, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Diplomatic_Service">British Diplomatic Service</a> is seen by its peers as the best in the world. Many of its members work today in exceptionally difficult and dangerous circumstances, and it is much too easy to take them for granted. Compared with other government departments, the numbers are small. The Diplomatic Service employs, I believe, fewer people than Harrods. As other noble Lords, including my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Garel-Jones">Lord Garel-Jones</a>, have pointed out, the budget is minuscule. Several years ago, I noticed that the ammunition budget for Bosnia was larger than the Foreign Office running costs budget worldwide. In pursuit of our strategic priorities, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCO">FCO</a> has had to become extremely adaptable in shifting resources. More and more tasks are laid on it, and levels of expectation, particularly of the consular service, continue to rise.</p> <p pid="b.773.0/5">The pressure on resources has gone too far. Opening new posts in the former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a>, developments in Afghanistan and Iraq and other activities have stretched the elastic too tight. The FCO's greatest assets are its people and its network of posts. Yet one in four jobs in the senior management structure is now being cut altogether, eight sovereign and 10 subordinate posts are to be closed in addition to those already closed and a further 11 subordinate posts are to be localised, all to save a mere &#163;6 million. Madagascar, where <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Tinto">Rio Tinto</a> is about to make a very substantial investment, is but one example of a seemingly less important country becoming more important in the wake of a post closure decision. Localisation sends a negative signal to the host country. Furthermore, locally engaged staff, however competent, cannot enjoy the same access as that enjoyed by career diplomats. It is also the case that no career structure is open to them, and I have seen able locally engaged people leave almost immediately for more exciting prospects. Localisation is an extremely insidious process.</p> <p pid="b.773.0/6">I salute the achievement of the Foreign Office in securing money from the Treasury to enhance the security of our overseas posts following the attack in Istanbul, but I fear that while the Foreign Office should examine its resource allocation with the same rigour as everybody else, a constant state of revolution, of continual salami-slicing, will do great damage to our interests.</p> <p pid="b.773.0/7">Devoting more resources to reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, climate change and energy security is clearly desirable, but it should not be at the expense of other priorities. If we are to continue to pursue a global foreign policy that actually achieves real outcomes I believe that the resources devoted to it should be realistic rather than exiguous, and I hope that this debate will contribute to that process and that outcome.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.774.0/1">My Lords, the starting point must be that the Foreign Office and our representatives abroad do a first-class job, one that we have all been justifiably proud of. Those of us who have travelled abroad on ministerial visits, in parliamentary delegations or leading trade missions have experienced this excellence at first hand.</p> <p pid="b.774.0/2">The perception now, as my noble and learned friend Lord Howe explained so clearly, is that budgetary constraints are taking their toll, jobs are being cut or downgraded and embassies closed, and distinguished diplomats are taking early retirement because the career structure which used to attract the <i>cr&#232;me de la cr&#232;me </i>of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Service">Civil Service</a> entrants seems to be disappearing. Moreover, the problem is exacerbated because <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTI">DTI</a> support for trade missions, which was so helpful in encouraging small and medium-sized businesses to seek new markets overseas, has been cut. British Council centres have disappeared and educational exchanges such as the Chevening scholarship programme, which has already been mentioned and is a particularly good and successful example, are suffering reduced finance, high visa costs and other restraints.</p> <p pid="b.774.0/3">That is happening not only in Latin America, a region in which I take a particular interest, but all over the world. We can all appreciate that, in these days of instant communication, Ministers are also able to travel the world and new embassies and offices have had to be opened in central and eastern Europe, central Asia and elsewhere because of the very welcome ending of the Cold War. Resources are therefore bound to be stretched. Perversely, however, what appears to be happening is that budgets are being cut. I find it incredible and incomprehensible. We must all be grateful to my noble and learned friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Howe_of_Aberavon">Lord Howe of Aberavon</a> for tabling his Motion and introducing the debate in his customary, thorough way. It gives us the opportunity to seek more clarification and to urge for more openness and transparency.</p> <p pid="b.774.0/4">What is going on? Is it all the fault of the Treasury, as my noble friend Lord Patten, in his splendid <a href="/glossary/?gl=143" title="Maiden speech is the first formal speech made by an MP in the House of..." class="glossary">maiden speech</a>, suggested? Do the Government prefer to direct resources in directions and to departments over which they may think they have more direct political control, as has also been suggested? Is it intended that the United Kingdom should join our European partners and be represented by European Union embassies in places such as Latin America?</p> <p pid="b.774.0/5">I am informed that the Foreign Office is moving from a geographic to a more sectoral approach. My Question on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-02">2 November</phrase>, to which reference has already been made, provoked a supplementary from the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, in which he asked the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> to put something on the website or to place a note in the Library to explain these changes. It would be helpful if the Minister would let us know whether that has happened.</p> <p pid="b.774.0/6">I recently entered into correspondence with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> at the instigation of a British individual living abroad who suggested that an international corps of Foreign Office volunteers should be established, composed mainly of expatriate Brits who could support embassies, particularly in cultural and social fields. The suggestion has received an extremely polite but not very encouraging response. But it shows what a pass we are in if people living abroad feel it necessary to, as it were, subsidise the Foreign Office in its activities.</p> <p pid="b.774.0/7">Nevertheless, in referring to the idea of voluntary support for our embassies, we should recognise the very valuable help and support given by organisations such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Speaking_Union">English Speaking Union</a>. It should also be said that the honorary consuls and consular wardens now appointed at certain overseas posts are doing an excellent job. I can vouch for that on a personal basis as I was in Paraguay in August. The British embassy there was closed in July. Incidentally, our ambassador in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, who has been appointed to cover Paraguay as well as Argentina, has not only not been given additional resources to do so but has in fact had his staff and budget cut.</p> <p pid="b.774.0/8">I am straying from the point that I wanted to make, which is that the honorary British consul in Asuncion, who is a Paraguayan of Italian and Spanish descent, is doing an important job together with the voluntary British-Paraguayan chamber of commerce in keeping the British flag flying. Fortunately, my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Garel-Jones">Lord Garel-Jones</a> has made more extensive references to Latin America and the historic links and goodwill which exist there for the United Kingdom than time permits me to do. I therefore look forward to hearing the Minister's reply and trust that he appreciates that most of the accusations for stinginess are being directed at the Treasury and not at the hard-pressed Foreign Office.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.776.0/1">My Lords, there is a variety of ways in which we can promote British interests&#8212;often by a small infusion of funds for very considerable dividends. I shall speak about five areas.</p> <p pid="b.776.0/2">The Diplomatic Service has featured first of all. The noble and learned Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Howe_of_Aberavon">Lord Howe of Aberavon</a>, whom we all thank for introducing the debate, has spoken knowledgeably and feelingly on this matter. I, too, worry about the loss or diminution of missions in Brisbane and the Bahamas&#8212;the old and new Commonwealth&#8212;and in Madagascar where <i>francophonie</i> is in recession and the English language is on the rise. Why do we not recognise the strength of the English language and exploit it for our purposes? Miami is the gateway to the Caribbean and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America">Central America</a>. Bordeaux is the home town of 24,000 Britons who are domiciled in the Dordogne. Frankfurt is the home of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank">European Central Bank</a> and a rival financial capital to London. We should be there on the <i>qui vive</i> for what is happening.</p> <p pid="b.776.0/3">I understand the Government's laudable desire to get the best value for money, but I have offered an alternative in this House before&#8212;an alternative route of collocation of embassies. Perhaps that could be with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">USA</a>, where the priority is for security purposes, or with our partners in the European Union, which is already happening and where the proper allocation of duties can be achieved to ensure that we and our own British embassies are more effective.</p> <p pid="b.776.0/4">Secondly, I refer to the established institutions for promoting British culture and the English language. The noble Lord, Lord Patten, whom we warmly welcome to this House, spoke about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_World_Service">BBC World Service</a>, and the noble Baroness, Lady D'Souza, talked about the British Council, run by the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock. We celebrate the work of the British Council. However, in the 10 years that I spent abroad, I was very conscious that there were other well-funded institutions of the same ilk such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goethe_Institute">Goethe Institute</a> and the Friedrich Stiftung Institute, which very effectively promote German interests and culture. Good luck to them, but we should be doing the same. We should approach institutions like the BBC and the British Council in a businesslike way. After all, those who learn English buy British.</p> <p pid="b.776.0/5">Thirdly, another British success is higher education and overseas students. A recent <a href="/glossary/?gl=191" title="The house of Lords is the upper chamber of the Houses of Parliament. It is..." class="glossary">House of Lords</a> report has, however, demonstrated that Britain has fallen to third place as the desirable destination for EU students wanting a higher education place, behind both France and Spain, homes to two other classic diplomatic languages. We should be trying to help and promote the strength of higher education and initiatives such as that which my own university, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Warwick">University of Warwick</a>, is establishing at a campus in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>.</p> <p pid="b.776.0/6">Fourthly, inbound tourism has been served well by the Government. Broadly speaking, tourism does not find favour with politicians. It should, however, because it has a vital role in promoting the United Kingdom and spreading British culture. The recent criticisms of the noble Lord, Lord Marshall, on the plurality of funding within the UK need to be properly addressed. We need a sharper, well-aimed strategy that is aimed at ruthlessly promoting Britain and the opportunities here.</p> <p pid="b.776.0/7">Fifthly, I turn to support for sport. Who can doubt the diplomacy shown by the noble Lord, Lord Coe, and our own <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> in securing the Olympics for London? We now aspire also to gain a football <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Cup">World Cup</a>. Those will not only bring people to Britain but take British ambassadors abroad under the auspices of sport. But we are very poor at recognising other areas of interest where we can use British ambassadors for our purpose. Although there are many examples I shall give just one from the world of chess. After all, London established the first-ever international chess tournament at the same time as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Exhibition">Great Exhibition</a> in 1851. Hastings later became the most established annual tournament for international chess players in the world. In 1895, the American, Harry Nelson Pillsbury, was supreme over all his continental opponents of that time. Now, we are in a very sorry state of affairs. I cannot remember the last time that there was an international tournament in London. Hastings is now a second-rate or perhaps a third-rate tournament.</p> <p pid="b.776.0/8">I point that out to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> because I hope he will embrace other areas than the Diplomatic Service, and recognise that we require a thought-out strategy on how to promote United Kingdom interests and that a little funding will go a long way in helping the myriad British ambassadors who go out and speak up on our behalf and whom we welcome in our ranks.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.777.0/1">My Lords, I should confess that when I was a relatively young man I had an ambition to join the Foreign Office. My real ambition was to be <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>. I was serving in the British fleet in the Mediterranean just after Suez when we were told that we were going to wave the flag in the Arab world. We went to Beirut where I learnt to water ski. I met <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Julius_Norwich">John Julius Norwich</a>, the third secretary&#8212;I was below third secretary level&#8212;and asked him what it was like in the Foreign Office. He said, "My dear chap, if I were you I wouldn't join a declining industry". I said, "Why?". He said, "Communication: we used to have a relatively free hand because no one from the office in London could get in touch with us and, of course, there were not many aeroplanes. But it will decline and the Treasury will always say that there's no money necessary".</p> <p pid="b.777.0/2">One of my prized possessions, that I was given by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Transport">Ministry of Transport</a>, was a map of the world showing where <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Majesty">His Majesty</a>'s ships were at sea 14 days after my birth in 1937. As your Lordships will know, the map was mainly red. I also learnt that if you had a British flagged vessel&#8212;I declare an interest as treasurer and secretary of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=191" title="The house of Lords is the upper chamber of the Houses of Parliament. It is..." class="glossary">House of Lords</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht_Club">Yacht Club</a> in this Trafalgar year&#8212;you had certain rights and obligations. If you flew a British flag you could call on the assistance of His or Her Majesty's ambassadors, consuls, proconsuls, plenipotentiaries and others wheresoever they might be. Sadly, there are fewer today, as there are fewer British flagged vessels. However, it taught me that everyone thought of the Foreign Office.</p> <p pid="b.777.0/3">As usual, my noble and learned friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Howe_of_Aberavon">Lord Howe of Aberavon</a>, with his delightful, gentle touch, with a bit of steel behind it, drafted a very wide brief. But the brief, until the <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> of the noble Lords, Lord Haskel and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Harrison">Lord Harrison</a>, has in general concentrated on the Foreign Office and not on all those other issues. With my map, I set out to say "Where in the world should one do things?". I moved into the banking world. At <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Bank">Midland Bank</a>, we had active bank accounts with more than 10,000 banks around the world and, effectively, had our own foreign service. When I was on the credit committee, we had certain rules. We could not lend to any country unless we had "been there", which meant that you had to have been there within the previous three months. You had to know the country and the people concerned, and its bankers were trained at our training school in Haslemere. We would build quite a surprising international relationship.</p> <p pid="b.777.0/4">Recently, I learnt that the Foreign Office may be selling off embassies in order to pay for information technology, which will be outdated within weeks or perhaps days, whereas embassies and their locations in prime parts of the world are not. It may seek to raise private money, such as the private finance initiative on the British embassy in Berlin, because it could not recognise that our property assets in the world have risen year on year to outstanding values.</p> <p pid="b.777.0/5">I am not being critical, but I come to an area in which the United Kingdom is possibly the most advanced in the world. Your Lordships will be aware that the Government sell mobile telephone licences for often twice the annual cost of the Foreign Office budget, but they do not give any of that money to the Foreign Office. In this world of information technology and mobile telephones, the world is smaller than it ever has been. We are in a position to use that technology to our benefit in communication and information. We talk about an information technology base and a knowledge base.</p> <p pid="b.777.0/6">One of my fears is that as this information wends its way through different links into the United Kingdom, those who have not been there interpret it in the wrong way. I apply that in particular to Ministers and governments of all parties who make judgments and worldwide decisions based on information about countries to which they have never been. I refer inevitably to one of my favourite countries. I should explain that I chair a body which is trying to promote the culture and history of Iraq, Babylon and so forth&#8212;when I saw the noble Lord, Lord Winston, I was grateful to him for his own initiatives&#8212;on which a major decision was made by people who in general had not been to that country. I took the opportunity to look up all noble Lords who have spoken in Iraq debates in recent years and found that in almost every debate fewer than 5 per cent had been there. They had not even "been there, done it and got the T-shirt".</p> <p pid="b.777.0/7">I turn now to what we should be representing, and to the text of my noble and learned friend's Motion. Your Lordships will be aware that more than 80 per cent of British people have passports. Further, there are 13 million British people living abroad. If we look to some of our former obligations, your Lordships will be aware that the Commonwealth has, including our population, about 29 per cent of the population of the world. We have greater opportunities and, perhaps, obligations than ever before. But we have the advantage of our knowledge base and technical communications. We also have the advantage that through the United Kingdom moves probably the greatest volume of international investment of all time. It may not be our money. It may be that awful mnemonic <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPM">OPM</a>&#8212;other people's money&#8212;but we have some influence on it and we are a force for good in the world.</p> <p pid="b.777.0/8">I turn back to my map and I realise that we still have worldwide opportunities. I wonder why our empire was built farther away from home and that hardly anyone in the new countries of the EU speaks English as a first language.</p>            </div>

If I have a text at all, it is the opening words of my own first passport which, as I recall started:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.779.0/4">"We, Ernest Bevin, His Britannic Majesty's Principal <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Foreign Affairs, requests and requires in the name of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Majesty">His Majesty</a> . . . ".</p> <p pid="b.779.0/5">Many in your Lordships' House will be familiar with the story told in James and Jan Morris's great imperial trilogy, of the outpost in Sudan which heliographed to Khartoum:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.779.0/6">"Outpost surrounded by lions and tigers. Please advise".</p> <p pid="b.779.0/7">To which Khartoum, with the classic British concentration on the essential, replied:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.779.0/8">"There are no tigers in Africa", prompting the outpost to reply:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.779.0/10">"Delete tigers".</p> <p pid="b.779.0/11">Yet we all know that lions and tigers roam the world, and it is not in the British character to ask others to control their behaviour on our behalf. Our island topography has never made for insularity of conduct or mien. Before the days of empire, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscovy_Company">Muscovy Company</a> was founded in 1555, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_Company">Turkey Company</a> in 1581, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Company">Venice Company</a> in 1583&#8212;the latter two merging in 1592 to become the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant_Company">Levant Company</a>&#8212;the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company">East India Company</a> in 1600, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Company">Virginia Company</a> in 1609. It was an Elizabethan and Jacobean version of globalisation. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Thomas_Gresham">Sir Thomas Gresham</a>, of Gresham's law and probably the richest commoner in England, was <i>inter alia</i> the Crown's financial agent in Antwerp. One of the companies I mentioned ran its finances from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London">City of London</a> but ran its global trading operations from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Countries">Low Countries</a>.</p> <p pid="b.779.0/12">To fast-forward within the Low Countries, as one is obliged to do in these soundbite times, I was in business in Brussels at the time Heath government&#8212;of which my noble and learned friend Lord Howe was a distinguished member&#8212;was negotiating our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEC">EEC</a> entry. Being in business, I was on the road throughout Europe during the week, but back in Brussels at the weekend where, socially, I was constantly struck that the international staffs of multinational companies headquartering regionally in Brussels were largely composed, perhaps for linguistic reasons, of men and women from the smaller European countries, but that the British outnumbered all others put together from the larger European countries. We have an international aptitude and, despite perfidious Albion, we are strangely trusted.</p> <p pid="b.779.0/13"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Acheson">Dean Acheson</a>'s quip that we had lost an empire but failed to find a role has perhaps been overtaken. In the words of Tennyson's Ulysses:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.779.0/14">"We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are".</p> <p pid="b.779.0/15">The new role is not a formal one, as perhaps befits a nation shaped before global warming by centuries of mist. Informally, we have become special constables to the world. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Nations">The United Nations</a> always seeks a British contribution to any new peacekeeping venture. It does this not only because of our military competence, but also because of our capacity to rub along and to work with others.</p> <p pid="b.779.0/16">I appreciate that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s taking up of the Messianic inheritance of the Gladstonian Liberals a century and a quarter ago acknowledged the Tennysonian disclaimer I quoted. There is a continuity of attitude about the problem. Gladstone's rationalisation of the military occupation of Egypt in 1881 and taking arms against the Dervishes of the Sudan thereafter was akin to part of Her Majesty's Government's explanations of why we are in Iraq. Nor do I in any way denigrate the present <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> of the Exchequer's expansion of British international aid, especially to Africa, on which my noble and learned friend Lord Howe made comparative comment. Yet, in the long history which has given us our particular international centrality, and which was characterised by the recent debate my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Freeman">Lord Freeman</a> initiated on the Commonwealth, it was both the public and the private sector which worked in integrated tandem, sometimes trade following the flag, sometimes vice versa. One cannot help remarking, at this moment when domestically the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Lothian">West Lothian</a> question is still unanswered but internationally the Achesonian one seems on the way to resolution, that the Treasury is diminishing in proportionate terms the resources, both military and civilian, to sustain the new mission that the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> has bestowed on those who carry the freight and responsibility to deliver it.</p> <p pid="b.779.0/17">I began with Khartoum, and will end between Afghanistan and Iraq. Some in your Lordships' House will recall Colonel Bailey's book <i>Mission to Tashkent</i>. Bailey, Britain's principal agent on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Frontier">Northwest Frontier</a> in 1914, because of his mastery of Muslim dialects and of disguise, was, in the aftermath of the 1918 war, the senior staff officer from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Government">Indian Government</a> attached to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Russians">White Russians</a> in central Asia. Bailey, who died peacefully in his own bed in Norfolk in the 1960s, achieved his professional apogee by attaching himself to the Bolshevik <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD">NKVD</a> murder squad, whose only duty was to hunt down and destroy the notorious British spy, Colonel Bailey.</p> <p pid="b.779.0/18">There can be no substitute through technology for such individuals as Colonel Bailey. Individuals will always be individuals, but they are persons rather than machines, and often in distant places. Their spirits require refreshment and material encouragement from Her Majesty's Government for their services' services. We at home whom they also serve through the 21st century equivalent of that magical instruction, "We, Ernest Bevin . . . " which I quoted earlier, owe them the sense that what they do is both important and valuable to us, and need to insist to our rulers that we at least recognise that this reassurance does not, and should not, come cheap.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.781.0/1">My Lords, I need to go carefully; I cannot match the elegance of my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brooke_of_Sutton_Mandeville">Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville</a>. My noble and learned friend Lord Howe was, for a while, my ultimate boss, and though they are not now in their places, there have been two of my semi-ultimate bosses in the House today: my noble friend Lady Chalker of Wallasey, and my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Patten_of_Barnes">Lord Patten of Barnes</a>. Since they are not here, but my noble and learned friend Lord Howe is, I will repeat a conviction I have had for many years: &#163;1 spent on the Foreign Office is worth &#163;2 spent on DfID.</p> <p pid="b.781.0/2">In considering resources, there will be general agreement that it is in British interests that the developing world, country by country, achieves that degree of economic development to bring it into the developed world, and that Britain is right to commit resources to the endeavour. Some countries successfully attracting foreign investment&#8212;a precondition of success for most&#8212;will get there by themselves, as did Japan and Singapore, and as will China and probably India. Many countries with less obvious economic opportunities&#8212;some beset by that description of market failure, so familiar to bureaucracy&#8212;need positive action by others.</p> <p pid="b.781.0/3">At present, we concentrate on the easy and historically less effective options of debt relief and aid. These were not the roads to the economic performance of the United States, Bismarck's Germany, or ourselves&#8212;not forgetting the exceptional circumstances of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan">Marshall Plan</a>. Aid has a role to play, but it is a limited role and more a matter of necessary alleviation than a sustainable solution. Trade is much more significant than aid, but not an easy option for developing countries, for where is the leverage in the cut and thrust of the marketplace? We might look at what lies behind the current negotiations on bananas and sugar.</p> <p pid="b.781.0/4">Finally, there is investment. Creative investment in the producers of goods and services was our way out of poverty, as defined by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank">World Bank</a> today. Why should it be different for developing countries? However, investment does not feature highly, or at all optimistically, on the Government's agenda&#8212;certainly not if we take the Africa commission's report as a guide. Yet, in 1948&#8211;49, the then government set up the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Development_Corporation">Colonial Development Corporation</a>.</p> <p pid="b.781.0/5">I was with CDC, by then the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Development_Corporation">Commonwealth Development Corporation</a>, and that was when my noble and learned friend was my ultimate boss. Indeed, he once stopped me in my tracks by saying that he did not need a lecture on the constitution. Mind you, the point I was making was correct, but it did not happen to be in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>'s brief, and, as is the way with Ministers who are lawyers, he knew how to defend himself.</p> <p pid="b.781.0/6">Where is CDC now, though? It has dropped "development" from its name. We do not hear of it. It lies low because of a failed government policy towards it. One suspects that the Government&#8212;at least, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> and the Treasury&#8212;would gladly be rid of it. Perhaps the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will be able to tell us whether Her Majesty's Government consider that CDC is a significant resource in support of British interests overseas and to be nurtured; indeed, whether they have a policy towards CDC, or are simply leaving it to fend for itself under a false label of "independence".</p> <p pid="b.781.0/7">In pursuing the road to economic success, we can list countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand. They needed three primary resources. First was equity capital: capital that is willing to wait for its return, often at lower levels than those obtainable in western silicon valleys. In many countries, domestic savings will be insufficient. Foreign capital will be vital, and British equity needs to play its part.</p> <p pid="b.781.0/8">The second resource is people. Where equity is invested, particularly in start-ups, an arm's-length relationship will be unsatisfactory. Partnership is needed, along with skilled people. Thirdly, Her Majesty's Government need to be present on the ground to provide a continuity of relationship&#8212;as has been referred to several times in this debate&#8212;with developing-country governments. We are in the endeavour for the long term, and agreements will be needed to reinforce the prospects of economic success in places where legal systems lack certainty on contract, tenure, employment, tax, exchange controls and many other matters; for example, work permits for partners.</p> <p pid="b.781.0/9">If we are serious about our contribution to development, particularly that of Africa, we will redefine and change our policy towards the deployment of British resources. Our present analysis and programme lack both depth and credibility. Indeed, if we just wait until all the capacity-building that can be achieved proves both expensive and insufficient for economic success, as it has and will, and at the same time chip away at the cost of being present on the ground, we shall fail to serve both our own best interests and those of the developing world.</p>            </div>

In the 1960s, as the noble Lord, Lord Wright, will remember, there were two government inquiries into the future of British interests abroad, which led to the merging of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Relations_Office">Commonwealth Relations Office</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Office">Colonial Office</a> into the Foreign Office, leaving behind various orphans like the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Development_Corporation">Commonwealth Development Corporation</a>. The Duncan review in particular caused a great furore by describing Britain as,</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.783.0/2">"a major power of the second rank".</p> <p pid="b.783.0/3">It was vigorously attacked by the <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail">Daily Mail</a></i>, the <i>Telegraph</i> and others for suggesting that Britain was not a first-rank superpower.</p> <p pid="b.783.0/4">When my book was published in 1976, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Policy_Review_Staff">Central Policy Review Staff</a> was just setting out on another review. I have a vivid memory of being carpeted when trying to visit junior staff at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Embassy_in_Paris">British Embassy in Paris</a> by the then ambassador, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Nicholas_Henderson">Sir Nicholas Henderson</a>, who grilled me aggressively about my book. Only afterwards did I realise that he was sharpening his teeth for the visit the following week by the woman whom the <i>Daily Mail</i> described as the "dark-eyed evil genius" of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPRS">CPRS</a> review&#8212;better known to your Lordships, of course, as the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone.</p> <p pid="b.783.0/5">The Berrill report's recommendations included that there should be an overseas budget that pulled together the Foreign Office, development and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence">Ministry of Defence</a> budgets, as well as an external service recruited not as a diplomatic service, but from several departments across <a href="/glossary/?gl=101" title="Whitehall is a wide road that runs through the heart of Westminster,..." class="glossary">Whitehall</a> engaged in external activities and feeding back into the whole of Whitehall. It made a number of arguments in recommending this: the need for wider language skills around Whitehall; the desirability of our representatives abroad being more deeply rooted in British government and society than some of our diplomats who spent two-thirds of their careers abroad were able to be; and the growing reluctance of both women and men with families to accept overseas postings when their children were small.</p> <p pid="b.783.0/6">Thirty years later these trends are far more evident than they were then. Foreign policy is conducted by much of Whitehall. Many people have mentioned this. I am struck by the complete transformation of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> over the past 20 years from a department where there was an instinctive suspicion of foreigners coming into the building, to one that at last count had 70 people working full-time on international and European matters, most of whom speak two or three languages apart from English. The same is true of Defra, as has been pointed out, as well as those departments like the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTI">DTI</a> and the Treasury which have always had large international activities.</p> <p pid="b.783.0/7">Foreign policy has not only spread across Whitehall, but has been increasingly concentrated in No. 10. I would underline what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, was saying more tactfully, which is that, to some extent, the Foreign Office has been sidelined in British foreign and European policy by the extent to which policy is now concentrated with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and his advisers in No. 10. Alongside that, in the developed world, embassies are often bypassed by Ministers conducting direct relations&#8212;and of course by the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Christopher_Meyer">Sir Christopher Meyer</a> has so famously complained.</p> <p pid="b.783.0/8">There are many Britons abroad, and many more foreign citizens in Britain. We have a much greater degree of economic interdependence within the global economy, and, as many noble Lords have remarked, there has been a sharp and continuing increase in the number of states that are now members of the United Nations. I was reading the evidence given to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a> in <a href="/glossary/?gl=112" title="During a debate members of the House of Commons traditionally refer to the..." class="glossary">another place</a> before this debate, and I noticed a complaint that we were not yet represented in Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro. We have only six representations in the former Yugoslavia so far. We used to manage with Belgrade alone. I am not quite sure how important Montenegro will be as an independent state immediately, but if it is going to be a member of the European Union in 15 years' time, sure enough, we will need to be represented there. One recognises that as the number of independent states grows, we simply cannot cover all of them.</p> <p pid="b.783.0/9">There has been one major change in our security context with the end of the Cold War. That is the disappearance of any direct threat to the United Kingdom from any other state and the replacement of that direct threat with threats that are much more indirect, through terrorism and state collapse in distant continents, and through the surges of asylum seekers that state collapse in Somalia&#8212;or, in previous years, the situation of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurds_in_Iraq">Kurds in Iraq</a>&#8212;brings to this country. One has to remark that there has been only a partial adjustment to the transformation of our security context. My noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Garden">Lord Garden</a> talked about the growth of defence diplomacy and the commitment to nation building, essentially a cross-departmental activity. However, as he also remarked, if you look at our procurement and our balance of forces you will see that we are still divided in exactly what we are trying to do with our defence commitment. I have started to read Sir Rupert Smith's <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Utility_of_Force">The Utility of Force</a></i>, in which he says with very considerable power that the balance of British defence procurement and commitments simply does not meet the different sorts of threats and tasks that we now face.</p> <p pid="b.783.0/10">What should be the direction of change? First, we need a clearer sense of what our objectives are and what we think our role is, as the Duncan review said all those many years ago. If we intend to continue to punch above our weight, who do we think we are punching and what are we punching for? Are we primarily the junior partner of the United States or a partner in exerting growing European influence on the global order? That of course is the central problem for our military: whether we intend it to continue to be able to operate alongside the United States in major operations, or to shift its balance to the more likely new tasks. One may remark that of course the United States military has failed extremely badly to shift towards these new tasks of nation-building, police operation and defence diplomacy, in which the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army">British Army</a> has gained so many skills.</p> <p pid="b.783.0/11">Secondly, we clearly should be moving towards an overseas budget&#8212;a cross-departmental budget&#8212;in which one can talk about what is spent on defence against what is spent on development and on representation. We recognise that the Ministry of Defence will resist. It is easier to see how one might rationalise relations and representations between DfID and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> in the developing world, as the French have done more carefully than we have.</p> <p pid="b.783.0/12">Thirdly, I also support the idea of an overseas service in which people would spend more of their careers in different departments, and less in just the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. That would encourage a closer integration of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCO">FCO</a> into Whitehall, with overseas missions drawn from across Whitehall. This is partly happening. I have been struck when visiting embassies across the European Union by how often one meets people from the Home Office or from <a href="/glossary/?gl=74" title="http://www.hmce.gov.uk/" class="glossary">Customs and Excise</a> and so on; it is a development that we should be encouraging.</p> <p pid="b.783.0/13">Fourthly, we need a continued emphasis on public diplomacy&#8212;the British Council and the BBC, for example. I support strongly what the noble Lord, Lord Patten, has said about the shameful toadying to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a> on the question of the future of the BBC's global operations. We should also continue to support those quasi-governmental agencies and non-governmental organisations that engage in what the Asians call second-track diplomacy&#8212;bilateral conferences and various other bodies of which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, has spoken.</p> <p pid="b.783.0/14">Lastly, we should share resources abroad. It is highly unlikely that we are going to move towards common European embassies during our lifetimes. However, sharing consular services, reporting, counter-terrorism work, the provision of security and transport co-location are all highly desirable. Indeed they are already happening in a number of third-country missions. Last year I was in Reykjavik where the British and the Germans shared a building, a conference room and a transport pool, but otherwise operated separately; a useful saving of money without blurring too far that we are representing different states.</p> <p pid="b.783.0/15">The Government would do better to admit publicly what they are doing in this respect and in others. I am struck by the extent to which British forces are now engaged in a range of joint European peacekeeping activities in Aceh and Gaza, and shortly also perhaps in Transnistria, Moldova. There are other operations, such as the new agreement being negotiated between the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union">African Union</a> and European Union about which nothing is being reported to Parliament, almost as if the Government are ashamed of what is happening. That of course is part of the confusion over foreign-policy objectives, strategy role and presentation at home. The first essential is therefore a clearer definition of Britain's international strategy and role. The second is a clearer co-ordination of policy-making and policy management between an over-powerful No. 10, an undervalued Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and its partners in the Ministry of Defence and DfID and the rest of Whitehall.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.786.0/1">My Lords, it has been a real pleasure to listen to this debate this afternoon. We are all extremely grateful to my noble and learned friend Lord Howe for introducing the subject and speaking from his vast and almost unique experience in these fields. I was also delighted to hear the <a href="/glossary/?gl=143" title="Maiden speech is the first formal speech made by an MP in the House of..." class="glossary">maiden speech</a> of my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Patten_of_Barnes">Lord Patten of Barnes</a>. What particularly pleased me more than I am normally pleased by his excellent delivery and style of speaking was his candour about the Treasury, whose expensive ignorance in cutting budgets time and again leads to even more expensive consequences as we have all learnt to our cost.</p> <p pid="b.786.0/2">At the risk of striking a slightly discordant note, there has emerged from the comments of your Lordships over the past two and a half hours a clear message for the Government which I hope the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will take back to his colleagues. It is worrying to hear the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, who was a central Minister in the Foreign Office and a really excellent Minister as well, saying that diplomatic initiatives and diplomatic budgets are being under-resourced and squeezed. Moreover, she was not the only person to say it&#8212;a lot of people said it in the debate. It is worrying to hear my noble and learned friend Lord Howe, with all his experience, pointing to the minuscule resources assigned to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> and the minuscule resources available for diplomacy and its associated skills compared with the tens of billions spent on defence projects such as the Eurofighter. There are no doubt similar projects to come, some of which have dubious value in protecting the lives of our citizens in the streets of London. Indeed they appear to have no connection with that vital task at all.</p> <p pid="b.786.0/3">In the debate there has also been a cautious challenge, which I welcome as it I believe it is very healthy, to that almost unchallengeable shibboleth that spending more money on aid is a good thing because it leads to more development. We are of course beginning to learn that aid does not necessarily equal development and therefore, as my noble friend Lord Eccles rightly said, maybe a couple of pounds on aid might be better spent in another way. I am not trying to claim that everything that is done by our great diplomats is essential. I was reminded when I heard the comments of my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brooke_of_Sutton_Mandeville">Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville</a> about Khartoum of the reply which was sent to demands from our post in Ulaanbaatar at the time of the Profumo scandal, who wanted every salacious detail sent out in telegrams and received the rather curt reply from London, "We think you have all you need".</p> <p pid="b.786.0/4">My noble and learned friend Lord Howe mentioned the UK International Priorities document issued by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office two years ago. This document had eight strategic priorities which I re-read last night. Although I was in a generous mood I could not see that more than two of them had achieved the slightest visible progress in the past two years. I then went on to the specific aims in each section, of which there are 62. Again I counted them up and again in a thoroughly generous spirit I found that 17 of the 62 can, with a bit of friendly interpretation, be said to have been achieved; of 13 one really could not say anything because they were so general; and 30 of the specific aims have ended since then in complete and utter failure.</p> <p pid="b.786.0/5">The latter category includes: zero progress, indeed reversal, on strengthening the European Union; zero progress on UN reform; a move backwards on ending poppy cultivation in Afghanistan; not much progress on halting Iran's nuclear ambitions, all of which issues are mentioned in the strategy report; little progress on the New Partnership for Africa's Development, which, with the Zimbabwe fiasco, has gone backwards; zero progress on agreeing and ratifying an EU constitutional treaty, which, I am afraid, has come to an end; and little progress on reforming and liberalising the EU economies, successful negotiations in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a>, on which we keep our fingers crossed, strengthening <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a>, maintaining energy security or a host of other negatives. Frankly, it has not been a very good record. Failure in all those areas, capped by the alienation in the EU budget debate of most of our friends in central Europe, who used to be our number one supporters&#8212;the more I see this saga, the more appalling a development it seems&#8212;are costing the British people dearly. A weak Britain in the world leads to weak social cohesion at home, for which we will also pay dearly.</p> <p pid="b.786.0/6">Worse still, those failures mean that we are squandering golden opportunities to strengthen Britain's reach and influence worldwide. At a time when we should be building up that vital soft-power impact on the world&#8212;and, incidentally, when regrettably but realistically American soft-power influence has almost totally collapsed in the world&#8212;and when we should be drawing on our immense experience and on the domination of the information revolution by the English language, we seem instead intent on running down our diplomatic capacities and capabilities and sliding, as my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Garel-Jones">Lord Garel-Jones</a> said very graphically, into the second <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">division</a> or league.</p> <p pid="b.786.0/7">Who do we call to account for all those undoubtedly damaging setbacks? Is it just the Treasury, which has received a battering from all noble Lords during this debate? Of course it is not just the Treasury. The real answer is that our very hard-working officials, often working in extremely dangerous conditions, and our diplomats and civil servants generally, have been undermined and let down at many points by bad political leadership and wrong-headed or weak foreign policy formulation.</p> <p pid="b.786.0/8">If asked to specify, I would give three examples. First, Ministers have been preaching, and remain wedded to, the wrong vision about Britain's status, place in the world and potential. We are not just one small to medium-sized European state, caught between trying to please America and trying to be at the heart of Europe. We are a central part of a network of relationships that goes far beyond the European region and is much more than a subordinate partner of the United States. That is one difficulty under which our officials have been labouring. Secondly, because our European policy is feeble and reactive, as demonstrated by the hopeless presidency of the past few months, we have a wrong view of our place in the EU, which has led to neglecting our true friends and allies in this transformed world. Thirdly, if we need, as we do, to establish a friendly but influential dialogue with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">USA</a> and have real influence over American policy, we would do far better to work with our real allies around the world, including our fellow Commonwealth members, as the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, reminded us. That group includes most of the dynamic, knowledge-intensive economies on Earth, such as India, Australasia, Singapore, Malaysia, and so on.</p> <p pid="b.786.0/9">What are we doing to build up links in that new situation? As we have heard in this debate, we are closing embassies, relocating posts, reducing reach, de-layering and de-prioritising, as my noble friend reminds us, squeezing the Foreign and Commonwealth Office budget&#8212;after 2006, in real terms it falls&#8212;neglecting our friends outside Europe and weakening Britain's soft power on every side. I hope that no one would question the dedication of our diplomatic staff around the world, both UK-based and local, who work often in conditions of great danger. No one should question the excellent work of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_World_Service">BBC World Service</a>, which should be supported, and the British Council in spreading and promoting the British word and values. But behind all those endeavours should lie "a certain idea", if I may quote General de Gaulle: a certain idea of Britain and its potential in a highly interdependent world. That idea, I regret to say, seems absent from present ruling circles. It should be restored, and with it will come an uplifted morale and pride and new vigour in our diplomatic ranks and in our projection of British policy and influence.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.789.0/1">My Lords, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, has chosen to raise an important subject for today's debate, for which I thank him. It has attracted contributions from a distinguished range of Peers. With his barrister's eye for the key points, he has chosen the issue of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCO">FCO</a>'s resources and the promotion of the UK's global interests. It is right that the FCO's resources should not be considered in isolation but rather against how best to deliver the outcomes and priorities that it has been set.</p> <p pid="b.789.0/2">In response to the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Garel-Jones">Lord Garel-Jones</a>, and others, we have and will continue to have a global foreign policy. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Park, that it is bound to be about pursuing the UK's national interests, if there is any doubt about that matter. But as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8">G8</a> and others have shown in the past year, the eradication of poverty is one of our interests&#8212;not the only one&#8212;and I do not know whether we are assisted enormously by having reruns today of the debate on whether the FCO and whatever we call the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_International_Development">Department for International Development</a> should be one or more than one department.</p> <p pid="b.789.0/3">I thank all noble Lords for the extraordinary range of experiences that they have shared; it has been quite humbling for me. I join the congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Patten, on a fine <a href="/glossary/?gl=143" title="Maiden speech is the first formal speech made by an MP in the House of..." class="glossary">maiden speech</a>, based on his formidable international experience. I have also read <i>Not Quite a Diplomat</i>, which I commend, if advertising on that level is allowed in your Lordships' House. It was of course an uncontroversial speech. In trying to avoid controversy he has focused attention on whether we are doing the right things and whether we are obsessed with managerialism. In that context, I say to the noble Lords, Lord Goodlad and Lord Patten, that good management is not a bad objective. I do not think that any of us would want to disparage it. I am afraid that when people read the language of management it is more often disparaged than achieved. Our ambassadors manage many services and we want them to do it well. Visa services, security services and consulates&#8212;I shall not go through the list&#8212;must be managed well.</p> <p pid="b.789.0/4">The noble Lord, Lord Howell, has encouraged me to send the central message, as he sees it, that billions of pounds have been spent that could be more effectively spent elsewhere. He used the example of the MoD. I want to get into that argument a little later. But I say now, particularly since MoD money was talked about, that I look forward to hearing the proposals for the cuts in the MoD budget that would make available the kind of cash it is suggested should be spent in the FCO, and to seeing how popular those arguments are in your Lordships' House.</p> <p pid="b.789.0/5">There have been three spending reviews since the Government came to office. Both the 2000 and 2002 spending reviews delivered additional resources to the FCO. That trend continued in the 2004 spending review, which resulted in a budget for the FCO that will be &#163;188 million higher in 2007&#8211;08 than it was in 2004&#8211;05. That is an increase in real terms of 1.4 per cent a year over the period of the spending review. Overall the FCO's budget has increased, as my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Truscott">Lord Truscott</a> said, by &#163;143 million in real terms since 1999&#8211;2000 and by 25 per cent in real terms since 1997. My noble friend Lord Truscott was right to say that there was no crisis. Of course, more resources would always be very helpful. The noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, made the point that the budget has not been cut and nor are we in the situation that she feared of moving from having embassies of our own to having European Union embassy styles of management. I cannot imagine that&#8212;</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.790.1/1">My Lords, I specifically talked about figures from spending reviews up to this point. There are questions about the future level of budget&#8212;the ones to which the noble Lord has just referred&#8212;and we are about to enter a new and, I hope, dynamic negotiation with the Treasury on the next comprehensive spending review. That negotiation will be fiercely fought.</p> <p pid="b.790.1/2">Like all other departments, the 2004 spending review set the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCO">FCO</a> challenging efficiency targets of 2.5 per cent in each of the three years of the review period. However, it must be emphasised that the savings generated by these efficiency measures would all be retained by the FCO for its own use. The FCO is deploying these new resources, both those granted in the 2004 spending review and those generated through internal efficiencies, on key priorities, including increasing engagement with and understanding of the Islamic world as well as counter-terrorism, climate change and energy issues. Expenditure in these areas will increase by &#163;15.6 million from 2003&#8211;04 levels.</p> <p pid="b.790.1/3">They are big figures and there are real projects at the heart of them. I mention one by way of illustration&#8212;the agreement between the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Communion">Anglican Communion</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Azhar_University">Al-Azhar University</a> in Cairo to exchange scholars to help improve understanding of the teaching of different religions and to promote tolerance. Behind the big figures are real stories. As I said, this additional expenditure has been possible only because of the FCO's efficiency programme, which will deliver &#163;86.7 million of cashable and non-cashable efficiency savings by 2007&#8211;08. This will achieved by a number of measures including better purchasing, improved use of capital assets, efficiencies through improvements in the FCO's IT infrastructure and reductions in the number of staff in London working on human resources and finance.</p> <p pid="b.790.1/4">As the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, said, it is certainly true that globalised environments make it very much more important to get co-operation across departments in the delivery of foreign policy, just as it is important for those departments to have an FCO input into it. I do not think it is true, though, that the FCO is out of the loop of these major discussions because No. 10 has become a significant player. Of course, some ambassadors and some individuals may believe themselves to be significantly cleverer than the person elected to be the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>. They may resent the fact that on occasions <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Ministers">Prime Ministers</a> may talk directly to presidents without their constant mediation.</p> <p pid="b.790.1/5">A very high priority for the FCO is the security and protection of its own staff, both UK-based and those recruited overseas. This is both a duty of care for the Foreign Office and a requirement if it is to be able to deliver on UK interests throughout the world. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Foreign_Office">The Foreign Office</a> will spend &#163;50 million more on security in each of the next two years. In my judgment Istanbul taught us a very stark lesson. Candidly, no FCO <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and&#8212;dare I say it?&#8212;no Member of this House would rest comfortably unless they felt that every effort had been made to protect those who work for us and represent us in some very dangerous places.</p> <p pid="b.790.1/6">As regards defence diplomacy and the points raised by the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Garden">Lord Garden</a>, co-operation with the MoD is vital. Training teams need to be in place for long periods. In the Kofi Annan Training Centre in Accra&#8212;a training centre for the peace-keeping missions in Africa&#8212;exceptional British and African officers are working together. The noble Lord, Lord Wright, also described the need for FCO and MoD co-operation, which I fully endorse.</p> <p pid="b.790.1/7">Public diplomacy was mentioned by, among others, the noble Lords, Lord Patten and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Truscott">Lord Truscott</a>, the noble Baroness, Lady D'Souza, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe. The 2004 spending review included increased resources for the British Council and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_World_Service">BBC World Service</a> to enable them to expand their activities. The BBC World Service will receive &#163;239 million this year from the Government, up from &#163;225 million last year. The figure is set to rise again in 2007&#8211;08 to &#163;252 million. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_British_Council">The British Council</a>'s resources will increase from &#163;172 million to &#163;193 million in 2007&#8211;08. Those institutions are widely admired and regarded as giving high value to the United Kingdom. Like the FCO, both of them are required to deliver a 2.5 per cent efficiency saving each year and, like the FCO, they are able to use all the resources released for their own activities. I hope noble Lords will accept that both are capable of demonstrating that they can do better and demanding that of themselves. They both do an extraordinary job but, like every other institution, they can do better. I doubt that either finds it helpful if they are described as being close to perfection. Of course, they can learn from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goethe_Institute">Goethe Institute</a> and others. Indeed, the Goethe Institute and American institutes overseas are keen to learn from the British Council.</p> <p pid="b.790.1/8">There has been a decision to reduce the number of vernacular radio services. That makes sense. We have debated these matters in your Lordships' House before. The end of the Cold War, EU accession and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> membership all add up to living in a different world. The map of the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Selsdon">Lord Selsdon</a>&#8212;if I may refer to it that way&#8212;is an interesting map, but it is a map of a world in which we no longer live, as I am sure he would acknowledge. The new world is often charted out by commercial interests and it is a highly networked world. The BBC World Service is one of the key networks in that highly networked world. I hope I draw on one of the themes that the noble Lord introduced.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.792.1/1">My Lords, I entirely agree with that. The values of the past do not die although how we deliver them changes. I believe that the World Service's review was thorough and authoritative, that the right decisions were taken and that they should be seen as part of an investment to meet the requirements of the new world. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> gave his consent to that change.</p> <p pid="b.792.1/2">As noble Lords have said, there is an increasing demand for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCO">FCO</a> consular and visa issuing services. The funding arrangements for these are different from those of the rest of the FCO. They are funded so that the visa fees recover the full cost of issuing visas. Similarly, consular services are funded through a levy on passports issued at home and overseas. The Treasury holds a reserve to meet catastrophes which hit consular costs in unforeseen ways, as the tsunami did. I am very determined that however unforeseen, monumental or unprecedented a disaster, UK citizens can feel confident of our consular service. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, has had to leave the Chamber but I say to him that the FCO sought a critical review of what happened with regard to the tsunami. The review has been generally positive. Some things were less than positive but we have learnt those lessons and are already applying them.</p> <p pid="b.792.1/3">On the thorny question of post closures, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-14">14 December 2004</phrase> my <a href="/glossary/?gl=172" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to another MP of..." class="glossary">right honourable friend</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Straw">Jack Straw</a> announced that we would be closing a number of posts in Africa, the Americas, Europe and the Pacific. I understand the reaction that this announcement caused in many quarters. We have understandable attachments to many of those posts. In many cases we could see potential for their continued existence. In many cases being in a particular country reflected historic friendship. A decision to close a post is never made lightly, as all noble Lords who have worked in the Foreign Office will know, not least because of the effect it has on staff, especially local staff who have served the UK loyally and well. But decisions to open and close sovereign and subordinate posts are made quite frequently. That must be part of the good management of FCO resources around the globe. I know that the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Garel-Jones">Lord Garel-Jones</a>, has appealed to any incoming government, if they were a Conservative one, to reverse that process. I emphasise that it would be a reversal of a process. From 1979 to 1997 the FCO closed 31 posts, largely in western Europe and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America">North America</a>, and opened seven posts, mostly in Asia. I do not complain about those changes, for I believe they were judgments made in order to deliver the priorities of the time.</p> <p pid="b.792.1/4">Since 1997 we have made a series of changes in the overseas network, also in response to changing priorities. But staffing has grown by 9 per cent. We have opened 18 new sovereign and subordinate posts, along with 13 locally staffed posts, while in that period 10 posts have been closed. It is interesting, for me at least, to note that Germany has 10 per cent fewer missions than Canada, and that India has 30 per cent fewer missions than Italy. I have never heard it said when people talk of the dynamism of the Indian economy that they can somehow not perform around the world because they have that relative difference in numbers. The decisions were taken after careful review and we were made to ensure, quite rightly, that FCO resources were best matched to the UK's priorities and objectives. Most of the resources released will not be wholly available for reprioritisation until 2006&#8211;07, because of the need to meet the costs of redundancy and other transitional costs.</p> <p pid="b.792.1/5">I turn to the issue of DfID and FCO funding, a rather sharp element in this important debate. Comparisons have been made between the relative increase in resources for the FCO and for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_International_Development">Department for International Development</a>. Many noble Lords, including the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, and the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, raised the point. The comparison is not wholly helpful, as the nature of spend in the two departments is different and, as noble Lords have noted, this Government are committed to raising the level of overseas aid to 0.7 per cent of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a> by 2013. We urged this on our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8">G8</a> and European partners and, despite some expressions of pain, they have mostly gone in the same direction.</p> <p pid="b.792.1/6">This is largely money which will be spent through DfID which, unlike the FCO, has a high proportion of programme spend in its budgets. In accordance with government policy on global commitments to eradicate poverty, these are increasing at 9 per cent a year. The prizes are considerable and inspiring; the eradication of hunger, the introduction of primary education and of good health as development for the poorest and hungriest on our planet. The noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Brooke_of_Sutton_Mandeville">Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville</a>, was typically generous about that. The FCO's programmes&#8212;the Global Opportunities Fund and the Global Conflict Prevention Pool&#8212;will increase by just over 7 per cent per year from &#163;202 million to &#163;313 million. That has been largely translated into valuable projects.</p> <p pid="b.792.1/7">The resources are more than money alone. The staff in both departments mainly deliver the United Kingdom's international strategic priorities, in the UK and overseas, and will continue to do so. DfID will make its own case in next year's <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>. It will no doubt demonstrate the strides taken this year at Gleneagles, and elsewhere; strides which we will continue to take. It will no doubt also address the critics who focused on some elements of its expenditure such as consultancy. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, said, diplomacy is critical to DfID missions. I hope that I have covered the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, who asked for a comparison of expenditure including those involved in MoD munitions.</p> <p pid="b.792.1/8">The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, made an interesting point. I am committed to the argument that trade will do a vast amount more than aid will ever do. Most economists would argue the same. In order to eradicate poverty, we need a solid launching pad. Some of the aid expenditure will provide that and some debt forgiveness will help lift trade much further.</p> <p pid="b.792.1/9">As I have said, between now and next summer the Government will be undertaking a comprehensive spending review. I hope that noble Lords will accept that I will be deeply interested in budgets; FCO Ministers are not uninterested in those, if I may say so. We will be looking at the entirety of government spending in the context of five long-term challenges facing the UK. There is a strong international dimension to many if not all of these challenges, as the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, said. It may well be that the FCO will want to develop proposals on how to do that.</p> <p pid="b.792.1/10">The FCO has to be persuasive; not just to Government and to Parliament, but to a wider public. It will need to show not only what it can achieve with more resources but how it has been a good steward of the resources that it has. I will try to deal in correspondence with many of the other issues raised, but this has been a debate about setting the path and the prism through which we should understand what is taking place.</p> <p pid="b.792.1/11">In concluding, I make this appeal. Addressing global challenges&#8212;whether narcotics, terrorism, trade or the environment&#8212;and delivering consular and migration services lie at the heart of the strategy. The strategy has been widely discussed and has broad support in Parliament. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Foreign_Office">The Foreign Office</a> takes its decisions on resources best to achieve these strategic priorities. It is against the delivery of that strategy that the FCO should be judged. That is what I ask your Lordships' House to do.</p> <p pid="b.792.1/12">The raw metrics where some claim cuts and I say that we can demonstrate growth are not really fulfilling the substance of that judgment. The judgment is on this: what are we trying to do and have we made the best available provision to do it? Let us judge what we do in this country by that set of equations. They are the only rational ones.</p>            </div>

I particularly thank the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for his reply, which was as comprehensive as ever. Some cynical lawyers say that even in an affidavit the truth will out. The truth that has emerged in his reply is that his heart is in the right place, and we express our appreciation for that.</p> <p pid="b.795.0/2">I also want to express my appreciation for the remarks made by the noble Baroness, Lady Symons of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernham_Dean">Vernham Dean</a>, and express our general admiration for her performance during her long stint in the field in this House. It is good to see her back, even if it is on the wrong bit of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>. I also express my pleasure at finding myself in partnership once again with the noble Lord, Lord Wright of Richmond. We always argued as to which one of us was the other's boss, and have never really resolved it, but it was a useful partnership.</p> <p pid="b.795.0/3">Of course, as everyone else has, I also welcome the remarkable <a href="/glossary/?gl=143" title="Maiden speech is the first formal speech made by an MP in the House of..." class="glossary">maiden speech</a> of the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Patten_of_Barnes">Lord Patten of Barnes</a>. It has rightly been proclaimed as Patten-speak. It was interesting that the Patten-speak ace was swiftly trumped by Park-speak. They must be labelled together as "Oxford-speak", which I say with regret. They effectively exposed the instincts of the Treasury with great candour. We all recognise that the Treasury instinctively wishes to erode the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a>, but that is almost secondary to the bluster from No. 10 rather than No. 11 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street">Downing Street</a>, which is a wish not to erode but to control. That message came out loud and clear.</p> <p pid="b.795.0/4">I must attribute my final remark to the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad. We all agree that the resources for this important aspect of promoting Britain's interests should be realistic and not exiguous. I am sure that everyone in the House will share my hope that today's debate will have at least some effect in getting that message through to both No. 10 and No. 11. I beg leave to withdraw the Motion for Papers.</p>            </div>
