Yet again, we face the oddity of debating regulations that are, in effect, well out of date. I welcome at least that we are covering a range of amendments today.</p> <p>The evidence presented by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister">First Minister</a> and deputy First Minister in mid-September was that transmission was largely in households. It appears, not least from the evidence bank now published by the Department, that that evidence was already outdated. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE">SAGE</a> evidence of 21 September already clearly stated that hospitality and universities were significant drivers. Last week, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer">Chief Medical Officer</a> confirmed that you cannot have schools and hospitality open and keep transmission declining. For example, in August, there were far more applications per head of population for the Eat Out to Help Out campaign in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> than any other region of the UK, and it was exactly at that time that transmission levels rose to the highest in the UK. That may be a false correlation, of course, but, unfortunately, the subsequent evidence such as that from the University of Colorado and the University of Warwick, especially around aerosol transmission, backs up the fact that hospitality was a clear risk area.</p> <p>One consequence of the test, trace and isolate system not working to maximum efficiency is that we did not have and do not have at present clear evidence about the sources and chains of infection here. To be clear, there was good evidence for the restrictions on household gatherings, although they appear to have made limited, if any, difference to transmission levels in the postcode areas in which they were initially introduced. What have clearly made a difference are the restrictions that were introduced in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry_and_Strabane">Derry and Strabane</a> on 6 October and elsewhere 10 days later. We can see that, even in the Castlederg area, where transmission rates were not as high as elsewhere in the council area, those rates dropped notably to among the lowest levels in Northern Ireland by the beginning of last week.</p> <p>This presents us with some useful information and knowledge and also with a conundrum. The good news is that, to some extent, we now know what works. The bad news is that, well, we also know what works in the sense that we absolutely do not want to close down an entire economic sector, potentially for a year or more. We should be concerned about that close-down, and we should not be afraid to challenge it. For example, when it came to closing close-contact services, there was genuine confusion. It was only much later, for example, that clarification came that holistic therapies could be offered only upon a referral from the health and social care sector. Why was that not clarified at the outset? It was only after the Health Committee requested that information last week that we received it today, and I know that there are many small, private enterprises that would have appreciated that information a long time ago.</p> <p>I turn now to face coverings. The challenge was demonstrated at the Committee last week when we found that insignificant consideration of the latest evidence had gone into the development of the regulations on face coverings. If these are to be enforced, there needs to be more straightforward application of the regulations. The evidence is clear that face coverings dramatically reduce transmission in all indoor public spaces. That is the starting point for living with the virus, and that is a phrase that the First Minister and deputy First Minister have used in recent days. There seems to be a profound misunderstanding about what we are trying to do when we introduce such regulations.</p> <p>At issue is not just the epidemiological evidence but the presentation of the regulations, which must be clear to the public and easily enforced. On the wearing of face coverings on school transport, I have continued to enquire as to why some locations are included and others are not, and why some ages are applicable in some places but not in others. It is confusing and ultimately suggests that the Executive are not entirely serious about the need for face coverings at all. The simple fact is that face coverings should be worn by everyone of post-primary age in all indoor public spaces. There is no doubt that a simple law to that effect will achieve much higher compliance and acceptance.</p> <p>I will now comment on the test, trace and isolate system. Before we consider taking significant steps out of the current restrictions, we need at least some of the evidence to be presented. We cannot pull out of a side street unless we have a clear view of the traffic on the road ahead. The test, trace and isolate system has not given us that clear view. The last time that the Assembly discussed the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> regulations, I warned that we should not waste these four weeks. By mid-November, contact tracing needed to be reformed and resourced to provide us with clearer and more specific information about the origins of the infection, and that is how we can best intervene without closing down entire sectors to break the chains of infection.</p> <p>The question now arises: what steps have been taken to reform and fix the test, trace and isolate service? Are we going to test, as is happening in the Republic, anyone who has been in contact with a person who has tested positive to identify who must be isolated? Are we going to trace more quickly? Are we going to do more to encourage people to self-isolate? That matters, because without that knowledge, there is no way to see whether the route is clear to reopen at least some aspects of hospitality. I know that the inevitable consequence of a rising transmission rate will once again mean closing down vital health services.</p> <p>My challenge for the junior Minister is this: what changes are being made to the test, trace and isolate system? Can he update us on the face covering regulations that will enable us to make significant amendments to the restrictions as they have applied to Derry and Strabane since 6 October, and to the whole of Northern Ireland since 16 October? I hope that the junior Minister will address those issues in his response.</p>            </div>

I will make no bones about it, my view about this specific set of regulations is on the record as being sceptical and critical. I am still as sceptical and critical today as on the day on which the regulations were introduced.</p> <p>My party's view is also on the record, and Members can reflect on the differing opinions in the Chamber about the approach that should be adopted going forward. I took great interest in listening not only to colleagues from different parties but to the junior Ministers, who are on record as saying that we need to live and coexist with the virus. Indeed, the junior <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> said that we cannot legislate our way through COVID. I very much support that line of thought and, as we have learned to come to terms with the devastating effects that COVID has had on our society, we have also learned that lockdown is simply not the answer.</p> <p>Lockdown is simply not a sustainable mechanism and strategy as it is built purely on the premise that a solution via a vaccine is needed. We have heard promising conversations in the media today about a vaccine. However, the premise of a lockdown is based solely on the need for a vaccine. We have to look at long-term sustainable solutions, and society needs to learn to live and adapt to the situation in which we are now.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I thank the Member for her <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>. I agree, and, keeping to the spirit of her language, I think that seeing a mutated strain of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">COVID-19</a> in an animal species such as mink is deeply worrying. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> does not have any mink farms but the fact that there are mink farms on our periphery, in Donegal etc, is alarming. It would have been preferable to have a <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> here to talk on the issue today but, unfortunately, we are where we are, as outlined by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>.</p> <p>The regulations need to be targeted, balanced and proportionate. This is what society has been grappling with since the moment that regulations were introduced. It is why many in the Assembly called for targeted data and evidence to show why a particular sector had been targeted with such an approach. We heard those in the hospitality sector crying out for much-needed intervention and asking that we look at different ways in which they, as an industry, could coexist with the virus. Hopefully, the junior Minister will elaborate on this. I understand that he and his colleagues have done a lot of work, looking at the hospitality industry and how it might, potentially, become COVID compliant. Members will join me in asserting that, although some businesses, sadly, acted irresponsibly, many businesses across the breadth of this country stayed in line and kept to the spirit of the regulations that were introduced. When given the opportunity to reopen, thankfully, they acted in an appropriate way. They were very much in compliance with the basic health messaging of observing good hygiene practices, social distancing and wearing face coverings. I expect that the junior Minister will elaborate on that.</p> <p>The sectors were not the only ones calling into question a lot of these regulations. As I mentioned in my speech during the debate on the third Budget, a document called 'Protecting Lives, Protecting Livelihoods: Finding a Balance to Protect our Community and our Economy' was released by a number of businesses. Some of its content needs to be repeated here today:</p> <p class="indent">"<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Executive">The Executive</a>&#8217;s decision to place large parts of the local economy into another lockdown will, quite simply, result in another round of job losses. Those who have had to shut their doors are deeply concerned by the decision after following the Executive&#8217;s own guidance and investing money they didn&#8217;t have in making their businesses safe. They are understandably anxious about the viability of their businesses and the jobs they have created and so too are the many companies who are in their supply chain or rely on them for footfall ... Our economy is an ecosystem and closing down one part isn&#8217;t a limited intervention &#8211; it harms us all."</p> <p>This is the crucial element:</p> <p class="indent">"Pursuing a path of lockdown, release and repeat will undo all of the good work we have done to build a strong and diverse economy and protect workers and their families."</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>Not just at this time. I will <a href="/glossary/?gl=176" title="To allow another Member to speak." class="glossary">give way</a> at a later point.</p> <p>There are other issues where people with cancer and other such serious illnesses are missing appointments. Unfortunately, lives will be lost as a result of the lockdown measures that have been put in place. I have said it clearly before, and I will say it again: COVID kills &#8212; we have no doubt of that &#8212; but lockdown can kill also.</p> <p>I outlined the concerns that I had about the restrictions that were put in place at the time, as did other Members, and I outlined that people in the business community had concerns for their livelihood. It is also important to note that there are medical professionals who do not agree with the strategy of lockdown. I refer to the note that we all received, and I think that it received some media publicity today. Four clinicians wrote collectively in a letter to us all to say:</p> <p class="indent">"We believe that the widely publicised calls in the local media to keep the hospitality industry closed are not founded on evidence based medicine and that a measured and mature debate on their implementation is required."</p> <p>That goes to the heart of our democracy, and those are the points that I really want to get on to today.</p> <p>COVID has wreaked havoc on the democratic processes not only in the Assembly but in democracies across the world. We see a need to balance speed of action from Ministers on targeted <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> where it may be required and curtailing public debate on these important issues. We can all agree that any restriction, no matter how vain it may feel to some Members, has a massive impact on day-to-day life. I think that I said at my first Health Committee meeting last week that the public will be as bewildered as I am that, because of the mechanisms in the House, here we are, three weeks in and four days before the regulations come out of force, debating them in the House only now. I would like to see the junior <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> address that today.</p> <p>I noted at the Health Committee that the Member for South Down Mr McGrath had brought forward a unanimous suggestion that we write to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister">First Minister</a> and deputy First Minister, as well as the Executive, to look at alternative ways in which the House can give the regulations the scrutiny that they deserve. Every Member would agree with that, but we cannot have an approach where we have our cake and eat it. I listened to Mr McGrath say, on the one hand, that he was calling for full and proper scrutiny of the regulations &#8212; I agree with him 100% on that &#8212; but, on the other hand, he was saying that anybody who dares to speak against or disagree with the approach adopted by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer">Chief Medical Officer</a> or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Scientific_Adviser">Chief Scientific Adviser</a> is in direct violation of the regulations. That is not true. We heard on the radio this morning and on air waves from across the world that there are scientists and doctors who look at different approaches, and it is only right and proper that we, as Members, give those due consideration. At the Committee, when we were discussing the vital lack of the transparency that allows us to really home in on the regulations, the Clerk informed us that, because they were laid in the way that they were with no consultation and no stakeholder engagement, we, the politicians, had become that stakeholder. It is vital that, whatever direction of travel the Executive take, the Assembly is given its place and the opportunity not only to question but to scrutinise the evidence presented.</p> <p>There are many questions that come from the data that we receive. I know that I speak for a lot of people who are in close-contact services, and I can think of beauticians and hairdressers who were forced to close their doors. I think that Members across the Chamber will agree that, if there was anybody that was abiding by the regulations and had invested money and time to put the practices in place to ensure a safe environment, it was those industries. Yet, because of the blanket approach that was applied to the regulations, they were all forced to close. Sadly, the financial assistance promised to them has been slow, and that is through no fault of their own. They were promised support, and it is important that we, as an Executive and an Assembly, stand by our word and support those people in these difficult times.</p> <p>I also want to refer to the likes of driving tests. In the days since lockdown began, how many young people have contacted us, frustrated that their lives are on hold because of something as basic and fundamental to their freedom as a driving test? There was good news: things had started to get moving again, albeit that there was a backlog in the system. Now, because of the regulations that were passed, those young people still cannot pass their driving test and start to contribute to society and maybe to their household <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">bills</a> etc. They cannot do so at the moment because of the regulations that are in force. I implore the Infrastructure Minister to bring forward a plan to see driving tests resumed across <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> and ensure that those young people can be dealt with as soon as possible.</p> <p>I mentioned this at the Committee, and the Chair of the Committee touched on it in his remarks: I was shocked to hear Health officials come to the Committee who could not even answer the most basic of questions about how the regulations affected everyday lives. They were not questions that were off the wall; they had been trawled through the media for weeks. When simple questions were asked, they could not answer. They were simple questions from the Committee, such as the evidence base for the introduction of all the rules or "As we are now two weeks into the four-week period of restrictions, how well does the Department assess the restrictions imposed are working to reduce the spread of transmission?". They were simple questions around compliance and enforcement information. The answers simply were not forthcoming, and it is a damning indictment that, while we curtail parliamentary scrutiny in the House, when it comes to Committees such as the Health Committee, basic questions are asked two weeks in, and there is still no clarity or answer; in fact, the answers were just forthcoming on Friday, before this debate. I do not think that that is acceptable, and I do not think it is a level of scrutiny that anybody can stand over.</p> <p>There should be scrutiny of the science as well. The regulations were brought into place, but the data and evidence that supported the closure came after calls in the Assembly for the data to be released. It should have been the other way around. It should have been given first, so that people could make an informed decision about why it is affecting their lives in the way that it is. Those are basic principles that the Executive need to take into consideration as we try to fight the virus.</p> <p>I also want to talk about the exit strategy. Maybe the junior Minister can elaborate on it. If it is the case that it is "lockdown and repeat" until a vaccine comes, I worry for the state of the economy and for the livelihoods of everyday people across the Province and the country. Each time we decide to place restrictions on certain sectors and individuals, we run the risk of those businesses never returning. I had a constituent on the phone to me in deep hysterics on Thursday past: "You have asked me to close my business. You have told me that financial support will be forthcoming. Here I am, two and a half weeks into the regulations, and I do not know how I can pay my mortgage bills. I have four children to feed; I do not know how I am going to feed them". All the talk in the media about restrictions and how they can help bring the R rate down must be looked at through the lens of balance when determining the approach. That is why I said at the Committee and repeat here that, much as I respect the Chief Medical Officer and hold him in high regard, it is not appropriate for him to go on the air waves and talk about how one sector cannot open unless the other sector closes, with those sectors being hospitality and education. Whether intentional or not, that simply sets communities and sectors against each another. That is not a strategy that the House should endorse. We should see the evidence. We should discuss and debate it in this institution and go forward with a cohesive plan.</p> <p>The issue of non-COVID patients is really starting to come home to a lot of Members across the Chamber and, indeed, the people of Northern Ireland. Every restriction has a consequence, and some consequences are more hidden than others. I ask the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Minister">Health Minister</a> how the needs are being met of hundreds of non-COVID patients across Northern Ireland who would currently be in hospital but are not, as a result of the pandemic. Since the middle of October, the number of hospital beds occupied by patients with non-COVID illness has dropped dramatically by between 800 and 900 beds. That is according to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health">Department of Health</a>'s own dashboard. I am keen to hear from the junior Minister or from the Health Minister, who may be listening from <a href="/glossary/?gl=112" title="During a debate members of the House of Commons traditionally refer to the..." class="glossary">another place</a>, an assessment of the scale of the problem and whether patients may be at risk of tragically passing away because inpatient care is not available. Ultimately, nobody should be turned away, regardless of whether a person is coming to hospital urgently or the attendance is planned or whether it is for a COVID or non-COVID service or COVID or non-COVID care. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> claims that that is simply not feasible in the current climate, but I again urge him and his officials to explore all options for expanding the health service workforce. We have a duty of care to those people, and the challenge now facing the Department of Health is to demonstrate what has driven that outcome and how the data justifies the restrictions that are put in place and the actions that we take.</p> <p>Households and businesses have had to make great sacrifices. Their consent and cooperation should never be taken for granted but earned and respected by us, the politicians. That means scaling up the evidence base for every rule and regulation and rationally setting out why they are necessary. In the past three weeks, more scientific evidence has been published indicating transmission risks in various settings. For sectors such as close-contact retail, as I have outlined, those figures alone do not stack up to the need for wholesale closure. Moving forward, the duty is on Ministers to account for that.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>As has been stated on numerous occasions in the debate, we are talking about regulations that have already been implemented. A number of them deal with the wearing of face coverings, face masks or whatever you want to call them. I am sure that the junior <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will recall that I have raised the issue on a number of occasions in previous debates in the Chamber. The evidence about face masks has been compelling for some time; indeed, when the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Scientific_Adviser">Chief Scientific Adviser</a> was at the Health Committee a couple of months ago, before the introduction of the regulations, he said that he was concerned to discover that, whenever he went into a shop, he was the only one wearing a face mask. He appeared on '<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_Ulster">Good Morning Ulster</a>' a few days after that and stated that there was considerable evidence that wearing a face mask significantly reduced the transmission of the virus.</p> <p>One thing that I have noticed about the countries that have been most successful in suppressing the virus is that they are the countries that moved quickly and did not wait for absolute, 100%, solid, concrete evidence. They moved quickly. It is the countries that have a culture of wearing face masks that, in the main, have been most successful in dealing with the virus. They did not wait for 100%, solid, concrete evidence before they did that. However, there was evidence &#8212; and it was compelling evidence &#8212; that the wearing of masks reduced transmission of the virus. We waited, and we waited longer than we should have. We should have moved more quickly. That should be a lesson to us when we come to make other decisions about what will be useful in the fight against the virus.</p> <p>Like most of the regulations introduced over the past months, the regulations are draconian. Of course, under normal circumstances, we would not introduce legislation like that. The question that people ask is this: why do we need those restrictions? Quite simply, we need them because if we did not have them, the health and social care system would be overrun. I heard <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Buckley">Jonathan Buckley</a> say that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">COVID-19</a> kills but that lockdown can also kill. It is not the lockdown that kills but the fact that the health service does not have the capacity. It did not have the capacity in the first place to deal with all the diseases and conditions that exist out there. Waiting lists were already far too long. On top of that, we have a pandemic that is killing people, leading people into serious illness and leaving others with long-term conditions as a result of the disease. How have we ended up in that situation? Why does our health and social care system not have the capacity to deal with what is coming at us in the pandemic? It is because the health system has been underfunded for years. There is a direct causal connection between that lack of investment and underfunding and the lack of capacity in the health and social care system to deal with the pandemic. It is not rocket science; we do not have the capacity.</p> <p>We need to introduce measures, draconian though they may be, to ensure that the system is not completely overrun. I agree that there are people who are dying from cardiovascular disease, cancer and other diseases who cannot get the proper and requisite treatment as a result of what is happening with the virus and the fact that the health service is being overrun. The fact is that if people are seriously ill with COVID-19, they have to be hospitalised. If people are seriously ill with cancer, cardiovascular disease or whatever, they also have to be hospitalised. The capacity is not there.</p> <p>Some argue that we should have built up capacity in the hospital system, but that cannot be done overnight. We are in the position that we are in because of years of underinvestment, and we will not be able to fix that overnight. We need an alternative. What the restrictions do is give us a breathing space. They ensure that the health and social care system does not collapse on us, that the most seriously ill can still get treated and that the transmission of the virus is reduced in society and our communities.</p> <p>I have some sympathy for those who oppose the lockdowns, but I have suspicions, too, because among them are the science deniers, the crackpots and so on. None of us wants any sort of lockdown. None of us wants to live under the conditions that we have had to live under for the past seven or eight months. Who in their right mind would want to live in this situation? Is there an alternative to this type of draconian legislation that means that people cannot have the wedding that they would normally have, visit their families or visit relatives in care homes or hospitals, for instance? Is there any alternative?</p> <p>I believe that there is. We need to look at international best practice. I have already given the example of the face masks. Among the countries that have been most successful in tackling the virus are such <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian">East Asian</a> countries as Vietnam, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan, with a combined population of 178&#183;5 million people. How many deaths have there been? There has been a total combined death toll of 629. That is fewer people than have died here, in a population of 1&#183;5 million. Why is that? What are they doing right that we are not doing? What can we learn from them?</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago, at a Committee meeting, I asked the chief social worker whether the Department had made any direct contact with any of those countries to find out what they were doing and from which we could learn. The answer was no; there had been no contact. I am not suggesting for one second that we are exactly the same as any of those countries. Of course, we are not; there are differences. I also remember, at the outset of the pandemic, being told about the lockdown in China, particularly in Wuhan. Commentators were saying that there was no way that that would be acceptable here &#8212; we could not have such a lockdown &#8212; because we are a democratic country and China is an authoritarian country. Lo and behold, we had a lockdown, and it did what it was intended to do. Unfortunately, we did not use the time to try to prepare for a second wave of the virus, and we are in a very difficult situation now.</p> <p>Five or six weeks ago, I spoke here when the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Minister">Health Minister</a> was responding, and I raised the issue of our contact-tracing system. I told him that it was insufficient and that, with the upsurge in the number of people contracting the virus, it was not going to cut the mustard. Not long after that, the chief executive of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHA">PHA</a>, which has responsibility for contact tracing, was at the Committee. She said that 151 people were involved in contact tracing. When I asked what that amounted to in full-time equivalents, she could not, or would not &#8212; I am not sure which &#8212; give an answer. It has since transpired that there are 88 full-time equivalents. Do the sums. At that point, when the PHA was giving evidence to the Committee, the rate of transmission was around 1,000 cases a day. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Centre_for_Disease_Prevention_and_Control">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECDC">ECDC</a>) states that, in a lockdown situation, you can expect each positive case to have had two or three contacts.</p> <p>Outside of a lockdown situation, that number rises to between seven and 20. So, do the sums: let us take an average and say that each positive case had 10 contacts; that means that there are 10,000 people who need to be traced in one day. Somebody explain to me how 88 people can do that. The sums just do not add up.</p> <p>Just by coincidence, on the following day, there was an article in '<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Irish_Times">The Irish Times</a>' about the contact-tracing system in the South. Some were saying that it had been overrun on the previous weekend, whereas others were saying that it had not been overrun but that it was understaffed and that that was the problem. Professor <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_McConkey">Samuel McConkey</a>, who is a consultant in infectious diseases &#8212; he is originally from this parish but is in one of the universities in Dublin &#8212; benchmarked the system in the South with Wuhan in China, and he estimated that the South need 2,500 contact tracers to have a proper and efficient system to track and trace all those who have been in contact with positive cases. If you extrapolate from that, we need around 1,000 contact tracers, and we have 88.</p> <p>According, again, to the ECDC, it takes between four and 20 hours to train a contact tracer. The topics covered include disease epidemiology, the contact-tracing process, how to conduct interviews, practical examples and exercises, and data protection issues. Why are we not taking 1,000 people off the dole queues and training them to contact trace in order to put in place a proper system of find, test, trace, isolate and support?</p> <p>What do we mean by "find"? Well, the only way that you can get a test here is if you have symptoms, yet it is estimated that up to 60% of people do not have symptoms at all. How do we find them? We find them by mass testing. I welcome the announcement by the Chief Scientific Adviser, and more recently by the Minister, to say that there is a possibility, in the coming weeks, that the capacity may be there to carry out mass testing in a way that has not happened thus far.</p> <p>We need to find those who have the virus, to isolate them, and then to support them. If they live in a house in multiple occupation (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMO">HMO</a>), for example, how can they isolate in that context? They need to have support from the powers that be &#8212; whether it is the Department or the Executive or whoever &#8212; that can take over a hotel &#8212; as happened at the start of the pandemic, when one of the hotels in the centre of Belfast was taken over &#8212; so that people can isolate and have support and so that there is a system in place. If people need somebody to go to the shop to get their messages, there is somebody there to do that. If they need financial support, it is there as well, and that is &#8212;.</p>            </div>

Of course, we are discussing the legislation, with the restrictions on gatherings, on going into other people's houses, on weddings, on funerals and all the rest of it. Collectively, it is all being described as a lockdown. I accept that it is not a lockdown in the true sense of the word, but that is the way that it is being described. I have tried to outline the type of system that we could put in place that would be an alternative to those restrictions so that society and the economy could carry on very much as normal, as is happening in South Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan, Hong Kong and so on. In a sense, there is agreement. I am in agreement, to an extent, with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Buckley">Jonathan Buckley</a>. I do not want a lockdown. Jonathan does not want a lockdown. Let us think of some other way of tackling this, and let us look to international best practice, because others have been much more successful than we have been.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the regulations. I thank <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> Lyons for being with us and for giving us some clarity. Hopefully, we will hear more from him later in response to some of the questions. Like many others, I am mindful of the fact that we are living with these regulations, so it can be quite difficult at times to give an evaluation of how they have worked. Of course, many members of the public look to us for guidance on how we go forward, but we need to be mindful that the vote today, if there is to be one, is specifically on what has already been put in place.</p> <p>The clarity that the tightening of regulations brought to the wearing of face masks was welcome, particularly for restaurants, cafes, bars, taxis, buses and those types of businesses, because many in those industries wanted that clarity. A taxi driver did not want to get into an argument with somebody who got into their taxi and was not wearing a face mask because the legislation did not specifically say that they had to do so. That clarity was very much welcome.</p> <p>That messaging was important, because it has increased compliance right across our communities. Over the past number of weeks, I know that all of us have said that it was worrying that members of the public seemed to have dropped their guard when it came to wearing face masks in shops and other places, but I think that that message has finally got across to the public once and for all.</p> <p><a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> No. 8 relates to the restrictions that there brought in in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> and the wider Londonderry and Strabane area. The context at the time was that the infection rate in our area was several times higher than the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> average and, at one point, was the highest in the United Kingdom. There was broad recognition, therefore, that the status quo could not continue and that something had to be done. At that time, while it was disappointing that it had to be done, the Executive were right to step in and take action. Thankfully, today &#8212; we have heard some of the news reports and some of the data that has been talked about &#8212; we have seen a 70% reduction in the infection rate. That was down to the fact that communities and businesses rallied and listened to that message. We can debate which specific restrictions did and did not work, but the fact is that the infection rate came down, and that was the ultimate goal. We need to ensure that we continue to go in that direction.</p> <p>Obviously, from a business and an employer perspective, it came as a blow. We know that those in the hospitality sector in particular had put in a lot of work to get <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPE">PPE</a> in place and to make their premises as secure as possible, so to find out that they had to close their doors came as a blow. That is why &#8212; we have said this all along &#8212; it is important that, when the Executive close businesses, support packages be in place. At that time, I was on the record with various news outlets as saying that the localised restrictions support scheme brought forward by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Minister">Finance Minister</a> was not enough; it just was not sufficient. We talked about there being &#163;400 for those at the lower end with premises with an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAV">NAV</a> of &#163;15,000 or below and about the amounts being scaled up.</p> <p>Thankfully &#8212; I am not putting it down to me, although, if people want to do so, they can &#8212; that was doubled and rolled out across Northern Ireland, and it is welcome. We need to ensure that money, regardless of which Department it comes from, gets out as quickly as possible to those who need it.</p> <p>Amendments No. 9 and No. 10 close up a lot of the gaps. There are varying views in the Chamber on the way forward. There is, I think, a collective position that we would rather be in a position where we did not have to shut anything down. We need to get to a point where we can coexist with the virus and are not switching the economy on and off.</p> <p>A few moments ago, we heard the Economy Minister say that the four-week restrictions cost the Northern Ireland economy &#163;400 million. That is a devastating blow. Absolutely, we have to point to the fact that our priority should be saving lives, but we also have to look at the evidence and the science. Mr Sheehan, who has left the Chamber, spoke about science deniers. For many businesses, however, it is not a case of denying; they want to see the science. They want to be assured that shutting their hair salon or beauty parlour makes a difference and that there is a genuine reason why they need to close their doors.</p>            </div>

Does he agree that one of the most frustrating parts of the evidence supplied by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Scientific_Adviser">Chief Scientific Adviser</a> and others is that it is modelling based on behaviour as opposed to transmission and infection rates in the settings that he talked about?

Yet, because of a behaviour modelling approach, they were branded as a potential cause of transmission and forced to close.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I agree with that point completely. That is why we need to get to a stage where we try to find another way. I can speak only about my barber &#8212; I will not name him in case he loses business because of my haircut, of course. The level of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPE">PPE</a> that he put in was exceptional, but he accepted, when localised restrictions came in, that something needed to be done.</p> <p>This is not about criticising. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Executive">The Executive</a> have a huge balancing task. We hear from experts &#8212; they include the likes of Dr Tom Black, whom I know and whose view I respect &#8212; who have genuine concerns from a health perspective. The Economy <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> brings to the table her concerns about the effects on the economy, and, subsequently, on the mental health of those who lose their jobs and livelihoods, and that is where we may differ from the experts. All that has to be taken in the round but it is important that we recognise that we have to find another way to coexist with the virus.</p> <p>Amendments No. 9 and No. 10 bring clarity on close contact, which was one of the frustrations when the restrictions came in. We need clarity. We need to know who is to shut and who is to open. They also bring clarity on worship, churches and face coverings. I would welcome the junior Minister giving us a bit of clarity on where places of worship sit going forward.</p> <p>The need for clarity is the key message that I have been getting from businesses in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, city centre and rural. They want the message to be clear. The current restrictions come to an end at midnight on Thursday. Caf&#233; owners are asking me whether they can order produce, and people want to know whether they can take bookings for beauty salons. We hear a lot of talk in the media, but it is important that the Chamber is given its place. It is important that we get to hear and give our views on what is brought forward. I think that that view is unanimous.</p> <p>Businesses regularly reiterate that we have to find a way to coexist with the virus. My colleague Mr Buckley spoke about the Belfast Chamber of Commerce. I, and others, have engaged with the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce. There is concern about job losses.</p> <p>The furlough scheme has saved many jobs, and, thankfully, it is there, but it will come to an end at some point. We cannot keep coming to this cliff edge and worrying about what we are going to do next. We need a strategy, and that is about getting the balance right.</p> <p>Like other Members, where the health service is concerned, I thank the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Minister">Health Minister</a>, because his is a difficult job, but we should not get ourselves into a position where we are pointing fingers and criticising. The Health Minister is just one Minister. We have lots of Ministers in the Executive, and that is where they can bring these issues, debate them and come to a consensus. There is an onus on all of us, because there are five parties in the Chamber that are in the Executive, and these are Executive decisions. When a decision is taken, as uncomfortable as it may be, it is important that we unite around that message and ensure that we go forward collectively.</p> <p>In closing, I thank our healthcare and key workers for all that they have done over the past number of months and for their work going forward. We are coming into a challenging time. We know that waiting lists are increasing and that people are queuing to get in through the doors at A&amp;E departments. We appreciate that work, and we cannot forget that those people are continuing to work day in, day out.</p> <p>These are tough times for our businesses. It is important that we send a message to the businesses in our constituencies that we will stand behind them, continue to fight for their funding and support them. We want to ensure that as many people stay in employment as possible over the next couple of months.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>There is no doubt that the rate of COVID transmission in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry_and_Strabane">Derry and Strabane</a> was alarming. It was out of control. The regulations that are before us today were vital in bringing the rate of transmission of the virus down. I acknowledge the people of Derry and Strabane, because when the restrictions were introduced, I said that I had confidence that our people would do what needed to be done. They responded and reacted in such a manner that meant that they curtailed the transmission of the disease. We were reminded that, if we needed to be, when the restrictions were introduced that we are the people who carry the virus and that, therefore, we are the people who transmit it to one another. Thankfully, as I stand here today, the good news to report is that, five weeks after the restrictions were introduced, there has been a 70% reduction in COVID infections in Derry and Strabane. That shows that the restrictions worked.</p> <p>The restrictions are draconian. Who wants to introduce them? There is not one person in the Chamber who wants people's civil liberties or rights taken away. However, when you hear how we were back then and think about where we are now, it is very clear that it has worked.</p> <p>However, it has not gone away. Most of us know someone who ended up with the virus or self-isolating or, who, unfortunately, ended up in Altnagelvin hospital. I am thinking of two friends of mine, Moira and Neil, who are in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICU">ICU</a>. Their families are distraught with worry, and they cannot get into the hospital to see them. I am conscious of the appeal that was made today by the vice Chair of the Health Committee, because it is important that we try to find a COVID-free pathway so that families can get in to visit their loved ones.</p> <p>I say to those anti-maskers who are sending and spreading nonsense that they should stop sending me emails, because I, for one, do not want them. I do not want to hear that argument. I support what was said, and I support my colleague <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Sheehan">Pat Sheehan</a> when he said that, at times, we acted too late with wearing face masks, but, thankfully, we are there. I support the need for us to wear them where we have to.</p> <p>We know that, when the restrictions were introduced, there were bars, restaurants and sole traders who were worried about their businesses and livelihoods. They are still worried. We all talk to them; they contact us. The emergency financial scheme that was put in place quickly by the Finance <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Murphy">Conor Murphy</a>, was welcome. However, in Derry and Strabane &#8212; this is probably not just in Derry and Strabane, but in all constituencies &#8212; we are being contacted by people who are designated as the "newly self-employed". They have heard that a financial scheme was going to be put in place to help them when these restrictions came in. They have been waiting and waiting, and they are getting very frustrated. They are still waiting. They heard from the Economy Minister that they are the people who fell through the cracks. However, Minister, I would like you to bring this back to your ministerial colleagues: enough is enough. They have waited for far too long. The Economy Minister needs to get moving to put in place such a financial package for the newly self-employed.</p> <p>I heard the Economy Minister say today that she would be taking something forward to the Executive this week. I hope that is the case for all those in our <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> and other constituencies who have been dealing with these restrictions since March and waiting desperately for a package. They do not want any more excuses. They do not want any more dilly-dallying. They are giving out to each and every one of us, because they are absolutely disgusted and fed up with having to wait as long as they have waited. There should have been a scheme in place long before now.</p> <p>I want to acknowledge the communication from the two junior Ministers to us, as representatives in Derry and Strabane, since the restrictions were introduced. You have had almost regular weekly engagements with us, and that is very much appreciated. I also want to put on record that I acknowledge the work of other Ministers. Conor Murphy, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Minister">Finance Minister</a>, met business stakeholders in Derry and Strabane more than once.</p> <p>Minister, I know that you understand and appreciate that we need to protect our front-line workers, including our carers. To this day, those who are on low wages still do not qualify for statutory sick pay if they have to self-isolate. We cannot keep telling people that they have to self-isolate but not provide them with some kind of financial support if their employers are not paying them sick pay.</p> <p>The discretionary grant that has been put in place by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Communities">Minister for Communities</a> is very welcome. It is actually better than any other grant that is in place anywhere. However, the Communities Minister understands &#8212; I have talked to her &#8212; that, if you have a partner who earns over &#163;20,000, you cannot apply for that discretionary support grant, even if you have two, three, four, five children or more. All the carers out there whose partners earn more than &#163;20,000 are not getting any kind of financial support.</p> <p>I am not the only one in the Chamber who has raised the valuable contribution that our carers make to people with dementia. I mention people with dementia because information from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NISRA">NISRA</a> has clearly stated that dementia is the most common underlying condition associated with the deaths from this virus.</p> <p>I have talked to many carers and agency workers who are working flat out and feel burnt out. Many of them are not getting a proper night's sleep. They certainly do not feel, and have never felt, that we are all in this together. What <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">COVID-19</a> and these restrictions have done once again is laid bare the dire state of our social care, whilst those who work in it go beyond the call of duty. Social care can be seen as the poor relation of the health service, yet it is one of the most vital elements. The people working in it are dealing with the most vulnerable in our society.</p> <p>When these restrictions came in, we said that people could not attend family gatherings and that people could not go into each other's homes. Although carers were able to go in, we know that the restrictions had a detrimental effect, particularly on the most vulnerable and those with dementia who live in Derry and Strabane. Minister, although the restrictions were necessary and supported, we also need to find a safe COVID pathway, just like in the hospitals, for family members to visit residential care homes. I know that the homes have been trying to facilitate that, but it is one of the areas that is very traumatic for people.</p> <p>Minister, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altnagelvin_Hospital">Altnagelvin Hospital</a> in Derry needs additional support to stop it getting to the point of being overwhelmed every time that the R rate rises. Despite the news today that the rate of community transmission of COVID is down by 70%, Altnagelvin's COVID surge plan remains on red alert. That is still its status as of today. When the restrictions were introduced, Altnagelvin Hospital repurposed ward 21, which is a vital, state-of-the-art, recently opened and much-needed orthopaedic service. The waiting time for a hip replacement or any other orthopaedic surgery is alarming. I have raised in the Chamber the example of one constituent who has been waiting for five years. That is just not acceptable.</p> <p>Being in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU">EU</a> has afforded quite a number of people the opportunity to avail themselves of the cross-border healthcare provision. I personally know two people from Derry travelling to a hospital in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_of_Ireland">South of Ireland</a> today for healthcare provision. We talk about the restrictions and the orthopaedic service being closed as a consequence of Altnagelvin Hospital being overwhelmed, but people have had a pathway to try to obtain a service. With the Brexit transition period finishing in 52 days, however, people are worried that we could have further restrictions: that these restrictions will still be in place and that there will be other restrictions. They are therefore asking this question: what will happen to that kind of cross-border service? COVID is bad enough, and, of course, the restrictions have been tough, but when you layer Brexit on top of that, you can understand why people are so deeply worried about where we are at now with the restrictions that are in place and about possible other restrictions being put in place.</p> <p>It has been said here that we owe a debt of gratitude to our healthcare workers, who have, without doubt, been to the forefront of the fight against COVID-19. Although we once again face the very serious challenge that this deadly virus presents, there remains an onus on us to ensure that other vital services &#8212; I have referred to the orthopaedic service in Altnagelvin Hospital &#8212; continue to operate in hospitals, wherever they are, even when we are seeing a rise in transmission. When restrictions are being put in place and services in hospitals are being curtailed as a consequence, we need to look seriously at the support that is needed for our health service.</p> <p>Many strands are needed to pull this all together in order for these restrictions to be effective in the long term whilst ensuring that Derry and its services, both public and private, are not, as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Black">Dr Black</a> said, overwhelmed and brought to their knees. The restrictions show that there is no good coming out of COVID, but we need to work to build back better. "Build back better" should be our motto for improving the quality of life of our citizens, for protecting and enhancing the environment and for resetting the economy. That means tackling regional inequalities with ring-fenced allocations and policies, such as the Communities Minister announced last week with the reintroduction of &#8212;.</p>            </div>

There is a correlation between deprivation and what happened in Derry and Strabane, why we needed the interventions that we had, and why community transmission was so high.</p> <p>I return to the point about the need to ring-fence resources and allocate them where they are needed in places such as Derry, where the people have suffered from chronic and persistent levels of deprivation. We had the spike, and restrictions were put in place in the way that they were. I believe that that is the work of the Executive and the Assembly. If we are to build back better, we need to make sure that we do not leave the most deprived behind.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I thank the junior <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for being present. I am glad to have the opportunity to respond to the regulations, as they continue to be the most pressing of issues. I begin my remarks by paying tribute to all in society who have made many sacrifices over the past eight tumultuous months. From front-line workers to single mothers and elderly grandparents, we have witnessed sacrifices from people from all backgrounds and walks of life. I would like to thank the public, who have considered the safety of others and their loved ones by continuing to wear face masks and washing their hands whenever necessary.</p> <p>My party and I acknowledge the need for the regulations that are being placed into legislation. However, in the past number of weeks, I have had a number of outstanding concerns, including some that were raised with me by my constituents. As we all know, mental health is a huge crisis in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, and I am sure that the junior Minister, and all Members, will share my concerns about its impact on all our constituents and the effect that the pandemic and lockdown has had on mental health, especially during the dark winter months.</p> <p>One deeply worrying fact is that, in June, 504 patients in the Western Trust, which serves areas such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry_and_Strabane">Derry and Strabane</a> that face deprivation, breached the nine-week standard waiting time for adult mental health support services, and the average waiting time for those services was 21 weeks. That is very alarming. I agree with the Member to my right, who spoke earlier. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">COVID-19</a> has truly revealed and further highlighted how chronically underfunded our health service is.</p> <p>A survey on COVID-19 and mental health by Queen's University earlier this year, which was raised previously in the Chamber, showed that a third of people in the North meet the criteria for anxiety and depression and that 20% meet the criteria for COVID-19-related <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD">PTSD</a>. Following the implementation of the restrictions, which limit human social contact so much, I am concerned about the student demographic. Recently, I spoke to representatives of the student unions about the restrictions. They told me that, given the unprecedented circumstances, we, as a society, private institutions and beyond, must change how we provide support to our young people. Currently, six mental health counselling sessions are being offered by university counsellors, but young people are being passed to other counselling services. Many students whom I have spoken to are greatly distressed as they are on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a> waiting lists and, depending on their trust area, and specifically in the Western Trust, they may not receive help until mid- to late 2021.</p> <p>Sadly, the pandemic shows no signs of disappearing, and I am sure that the restrictions will remain in place. Our young people will need more mental health support. Their social contacts have been incredibly limited over the past eight months and so have their support networks. Although we must do everything that we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones from contracting the virus, including by adhering to the regulations that we are discussing, we must also ensure that, as we do that, we are prepared for the knock-on effects of the virus and the mental health impact of the pandemic in the months and years ahead for all of us who have experienced it.</p> <p>Understandably, the new realities of life during the pandemic have caused great distress and anxiety, not least because of the separation from family and friends, the wearing of face coverings becoming the new normal &#8212; that is especially distressing for young children &#8212; and the fear of a virus with no apparent end in sight. A huge part of alleviating that anxiety is through ensuring that there is clear messaging on what is expected of us all.</p> <p>We have learned today that the Executive will discuss and consider plans for restaurants to potentially reopen without the sale of alcohol. I heard this morning from several frustrated restaurant and business owners who feel that they are not being listened to and that that would force them to close their businesses and livelihoods. I urge the Executive to ensure that the guidelines are communicated clearly and concisely, with, most importantly, the scientific reasoning at the forefront of the messaging to the public.</p>            </div>

Having expressed dissatisfaction at that situation, we must acknowledge that this is a pandemic that is being grappled with by democratic government forums in many countries across the globe. It is an emergency and thus requires emergency and agile approaches to making rules and creating guidance designed to save lives. Delaying to meet normal bureaucratic standards could cause more lives to be lost. I do not like the situation, but I would not wish that any demand from me or my party to deliberately delay the implementation of any regulations would result in any further loss of life.</p> <p>Perhaps, when we overcome the many challenges that the virus has thrown at us and maybe even new challenges, given the news coming out of Denmark, we can reflect on how we reacted and what lessons we can learn that might assist those who come behind us in dealing with future pandemics. Pat told us &#8212; I cannot argue with the figures &#8212; about how well a number of Asian countries have dealt with the virus. We have to acknowledge that they have the benefit of having dealt with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS">SARS</a> and many other deadly viruses and have learned their lessons from those. That is why they have managed the virus better than other countries have.</p>            </div>

Maybe that is the role of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization">World Health Organization</a>; perhaps it has let us down in not sharing what it knows about how Asian countries have dealt with viruses.</p> <p>My colleague Mr <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Aiken">Steve Aiken</a> spoke about leaks emanating from within the Executive. Whether it is political gamesmanship or someone's attempt to ingratiate themselves with members of the media, the people who are doing it are not serving the public interest and should reflect on how it will compromise confidence and trust in the Executive. Reports presented and debates held should remain confidential in the first instance. I genuinely do not envy the Executive their decision-making at present. I am sure that they are having a difficult time today, trying to come to some conclusions. If ever there was an occasion when it is almost impossible to please all the people all the time, it is right now. The decision-making task is not made easier by Ministers being lobbied through the media when they have not even sat down to consider what should have been a confidential document. If a <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> went straight to the media with a departmental report before submitting it to the Executive, there would rightly be outrage. Why would anyone else involved in the Executive think that it is clever to take it on themselves to pass someone else's report on to the media?</p> <p>Reference has been made today by a Member to calling in <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the army</a> to assist in our fight against COVID; indeed, the Minister was asked about that subject by that Member at the Health Committee last week. It is a fair question. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Health">Minister of Health</a> informed the House many weeks ago that he would not hesitate to seek additional help wherever he could source it, as and when required. What the army does well is providing engineering and logistical support. To date, we have not required such help other than provision by the military of temporary mortuary accommodation at Kinnegar camp in Holywood during the first surge that, thankfully, did not need to be utilised. On offering medical backup, it is a fact that around 75% of army medical reservists are already involved in the battle against the virus in their day jobs in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a>. On the army assisting in the track-and-trace and testing process, I imagine that, given the number of people out of work at present due to the virus, there should be an adequate pool of civilian workers to do that work. All that said, I go back to what the Minister is on record as saying: he will not hesitate to call in military assistance should the need arise. I will fully support him if that becomes necessary.</p> <p>The other issue that worries me and should worry the House is the undermining of the public health messaging in relation to this dreadful virus. Elected Members, some who serve in another House and should know better, have been guilty of this. There have been examples even today of remarks that are not helpful. No matter what experts who seem to enjoy taking part in local radio programmes think, their input is not helpful. One wonders what their motivation is. The mental health champion has cautioned against highlighting the impact of the lockdowns on mental health. We need to respect that advice from the mental health champion.</p> <p>Mr Aiken reminded us that all decisions around lockdowns and regulations are collective decisions of the Executive, on which the five main parties in the House are represented. The regulations made are not <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Swann">Robin Swann</a>'s regulations, as some people who should know better try to portray it; indeed, last week at the Health Committee, one of the two officials who were referred to and who were there to answer questions was representing the Finance Department.</p> <p>The virus will not be defeated by petty party politicking nor by the input of armchair experts, even those who have the benefit of letters after their name. The experts who really matter are our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer">Chief Medical Officer</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Scientific_Adviser">Chief Scientific Adviser</a>. My party has full confidence in those two gentlemen and their teams as they advise the Minister of Health and the Executive on the best way forward.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>No, I do not accept that. The experts whom we employ are the people whom we need to listen to. Is the Member advocating that I heed the hundreds of emails sent to me by crackpots telling me that this is some sort of fascist takeover of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>? I do not think so. The advice that I want to listen to is the cool professional advice of our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer">Chief Medical Officer</a> and our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Scientific_Adviser">Chief Scientific Adviser</a>. If the House has no confidence in the officials, there must be a method to change their employment situation.</p> <p>The other experts who appear to like the sound of their own broadcast voices should step back, as their input is not helpful. Today, Members could have indulged in a bit of finger-pointing, but they have been controlled. However, do the Members who have been criticising the test, trace and isolate system, face coverings and all the other aspects of what the Executive are trying to do and have said that we need to do better realise that they are criticising their own Executive Ministers? The lockdown and all that goes with it is a policy endorsed by the entire Executive. All the regulations being discussed today are collectively supported by every member of the Executive.</p> <p>Today, I have heard a <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and a Member say that we have to learn to live with the virus. When they say that, do they mean that we have to start learning to die with the virus? That is an important point. Jonathan mentioned the fact that the virus kills and the lockdown kills, but we have to acknowledge that lockdown saves lives. There is evidence that it has helped to save lives. If we look at the figures in Strabane and Londonderry, we realise that it works. Jonathan also said that he worried about the economy, jobs and mental health: he omitted to say that &#8212; I am sure that it was just a slip of the tongue &#8212; he worried about the health of every citizen in Northern Ireland. I worry about the health of every citizen. I know that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Swann">Robin Swann</a> worries about the health of every citizen, and that is quite correct because that is his job as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Health">Minister of Health</a>, just as the Economy Minister, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Minister">Finance Minister</a> and the Infrastructure Minister have their jobs to do. Robin Swann is focused on one thing: protecting the health of every citizen in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Pat rightly talked about underfunding. That underfunding has not just occurred over the last two, three or four years; the underfunding has gone on for decades. The pandemic has been a wake-up call. It has shown us how close our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service">National Health Service</a> is to disaster. We know that the waiting lists for different treatments, even before the virus, were the longest in the United Kingdom. The pandemic did not cause the waiting lists. Whom do we blame for the underfunding of our National Health Service? We do not have to look any further than the House to see where the decisions were made or not made that, perhaps, would have put the National Health Service in a better place than it is in now. I know that talking about people who are waiting for treatments such as cancer treatment and hip operations is a sensitive subject. It is shocking, but put yourself in the place of a clinician standing at the hospital door. He does not have a bed available in his hospital, and somebody presents at the front door of the hospital who cannot draw a breath because of the virus. The person is dying with the virus. What does the clinician do? Does he say, "I am sorry, we do not have any beds. Just go home"?</p> <p>No. He goes into the hospital. There, he may have a patient who is waiting to have a hip replacement the next morning, but he will send that patient home to make the bed available for the patient who cannot breathe because of the virus. Those are tough, tough decisions but, unfortunately, they are having to be made.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I support the regulations but, unsurprisingly, not the process. First, I recognise that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">COVID-19</a> has, sadly, claimed over 1,000 lives locally, left many others with debilitating conditions and put our healthcare workers under immense stress. Therefore, and given the high rate of community transmission, it was undoubtedly necessary to act quickly to implement the new measures. However, while I appreciate the unique situation that we find ourselves in, it is unacceptable that we are debating these restrictions in the Chamber just days before they are due to expire. We are denied the opportunity to give them due scrutiny, which reduces the chances of accountability and risks eroding the public's trust. We depend on that trust to get us through this pandemic. If the public do not trust us and our decisions, they are much less likely to heed the restrictions, which would render them totally ineffective and useless. These restrictions have had a huge impact on individuals, and they deserve proper scrutiny.</p> <p>I am sure that some people watching today are asking what the point of this debate is, and I absolutely understand why. Unfortunately, conspiracy theorists will seize on this lack of accountability and use it to justify their false claims that the pandemic is a hoax. We must not be complicit in adding fuel to that fire.</p> <p>We must also ensure that our message is clear. Mixed messages have muddied the water and left many of my constituents feeling very frustrated. Most people want to stick by the rules but it can be hard to navigate the different restrictions. We need clarity in policymaking so that the public know what is expected of them and why. It is therefore concerning to hear the phrase "living with the virus" being bandied about. This is a highly infectious virus that has devastating consequences for many. It is completely disingenuous to suggest that we simply start living with it rather than implementing a proper strategy that seeks to suppress it.</p> <p>There is no contradiction between the health of our people and the health of our economy. The solution, for employers and employees, is for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> to deal effectively with this pandemic. In particular, that lies with the Health, Economy, and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Departments">Finance Departments</a>.</p> <p>Members, I agree with my legislative colleagues <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Buckley">Jonathan Buckley</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Sheehan">Pat Sheehan</a>, both of whom made points, albeit from slightly different angles, that we need to get our test and trace to work effectively. We also need to speed up reforms in our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service">National Health Service</a> so that Northern Ireland has sufficient resources and capacity to support our patients and enable them to recover. It is unacceptable that 400 COVID patients can bring our National Health Service to near breaking point &#8212; 400 patients nearly floored our health service. That is a real difficulty and one that we will have to face. We have to fix it.</p> <p>We have seen that the restrictions on activities in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry_and_Strabane">Derry and Strabane</a> have worked. The transmission rate has fallen, as colleagues said, by 70% as a result of the recent restrictions, but we are not out of the woods yet. In Derry, Altnagelvin hospital had 16 COVID-positive admissions this weekend. That is a significantly high number. So, whilst the restrictions are improving things in my city and region, we are certainly not out of the woods yet.</p> <p>Some proposals, such as authorising restaurants to provide meals but without alcohol, are just silly. We have to give employers, employees and the wider public hope for the future, including for Christmas. Put yourselves in the shoes of our healthcare workers, who are sacrificing their mental and physical health to cope with rising hospitalisations. The phrase "living with the virus" offers no solutions and very little comfort. We need more than a vague sound bite to get through this crisis.</p> <p>I emphasise the importance of promptly putting in place the necessary support measures. While support schemes have been announced, we find ourselves in the farcical situation where the restrictions are due to end this week but some schemes have not even started paying out money. They have not even opened up.</p> <p>We still do not know the specifics of part B of the COVID restrictions business support scheme, and help for the previously excluded self-employed workers was announced many weeks ago, yet we have not heard a single bit of detail. That is unacceptable.</p> <p><a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> Lyons, one constituent put it to me like this: "It is the silence that is the real killer. The lack of communication, with no indication when payments will be issued. It makes it impossible for me to plan my business". The current delays are spreading fear and panic, making a difficult time even more challenging for thousands of workers.</p> <p>We need a plan that balances support for our employers and employees with the health of our communities. I cannot see it yet.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>Thank you, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>. You caught me unawares there. It is a pleasure to speak in the debate today. I thank everybody who has engaged so far. Whilst there are a number of different opinions on some of elements of the strategy and how we go about it, we have to remember that we have been talking about this for some months now. It has gone by in a flash, but for those families who have suffered, are still suffering and are going to suffer, it is imperative that we speak with one voice and that we are not afraid to challenge each other.</p> <p>As the previous contributor said, when the message goes out, we need to speak with one voice because that will give confidence. When we look at these regulations, we find that we are talking about them belatedly and slightly too late. However, I thank the <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a> for continually writing to the Executive to try to encourage them here to lay these regulations as quickly as they can. I also put on record my thanks to the Executive Office for offering up the junior Ministers, because that adds to the quality of the message that is going out.</p> <p>We cannot be divided on this, guys. It is right and proper that each of the Executive Ministers and those with their different priorities give voice to that, but let us be honest about it: protecting and saving lives is the priority. It takes precedence over everything. A case has been made from both sides of the House about finances and poverty and the pressures that our businesses are under at this time, but we also have to give voice and testament to those businesses that are speaking to us and saying, "We really need help. We really want to open, but we do not want to open if our business is in any way a danger".</p> <p>The evidence has been raised, and people have been calling for scientific evidence. That is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK">OK</a>, but when the evidence came, they said, "That is not the right type of evidence. We want it in a different way and in a different fashion". Guys, we are not virologists or scientists. We have to trust those we have put in place. I thank Mr Chambers for the point he made: either we trust our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer">Chief Medical Officer</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Scientific_Adviser">Chief Scientific Adviser</a>, or we do not. They do not work on their own; they have offices. Yes, we have a letter from four consultants who have raised concerns, but I suspect we have a thousand consultants in this country. Had the letter been signed by 1,000 consultants, I would maybe be prepared to give it a little bit more light.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>Yes. I do not disagree with what the Member says. This is something that none of us have dealt with before, and something that all our friends and families are involved in. When you embark upon any journey such as this, it is important that, numerous times, you put your head up, take a look around and assess what is working and what is not, and that you are agile. I do not see any conflict with anything that has been said here today. We all want the same outcome.</p> <p>Looking at some of the regulations, I pay tribute to the communities we have. One of the greatest burdens has been the inability to spend time with family and loved ones. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Irish">Northern Irish</a> personality is such that a lot of doors would normally be open in our streets. We are very hospitable, and very hospitable within our families. That has been ripped away from us for months now. Like many of you, there are members of my family who I have not seen since the start of this pandemic. Thankfully, we have some technology; we can speak and see each other. However, it really is quite tough.</p> <p>The case has been made, and rightly so, for businesses that are struggling. The information and the finances need to be expedited into their hands. What actually cripples people is the unknown. That is what causes the most damage. When there is a void of information, a void of financial assistance and a void of a promise, that is more catastrophic than when you know the answer. I am not going to point the finger at any <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, whether Finance or Economy, and think that I am just going to protect my party's Minister. These are Executive regulations. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Executive">The Executive</a>, in most cases, have worked exceptionally well in their messaging. You have only to look at the elections in America recently to see how divided a country that some of us admire can be. We have a complicated system here but, in some ways, we need to be proud of some of our achievements. However, we need to improve and ensure that life and safety are the number-one issues.</p> <p>With regard to masks &#8212; perhaps the junior Minister might respond to this &#8212; one of the things that concerns me, and which I have witnessed when travelling to work this past few mornings, is when I the post-primary schoolchildren gathering for buses. You see them in great crowds. They are standing in big numbers, and they do not have masks on. I know that the direction is to wear masks on buses, but what can we do to encourage them to wear masks even when they are gathering at bus stops? We have seen a remarkable response from young people in this country. We talk about them and say we worry about them but, in the round, they have been exceptional. Instead of a draconian measure pointing out what is not happening, we should ask how we fix the situation at bus stops and similar places to encourage schoolchildren to wear their masks.</p> <p>The other thing was a conversation last week with regard to university students. Christmas is fast approaching, and we have thousands of students living here who will have to go home and students who will need to come back here. I declare an interest. My son is in Aberystwyth as we speak so, as a father who wants to see his son at Christmas, I think that it is incumbent upon this legislature, in conjunction with the other devolved nations, to ensure that our students have that information as early as possible and that they get back for Christmas. I hope that is something we can look at.</p> <p>Finally, I am going to issue a challenge, and it is not a challenge for you guys. I go to church on Sundays; I am a churchgoer. I love my church. Last week, I was worried when I read a letter from some of the Church leaders in the UK who said that they were thinking of challenging the regulations across the water.</p> <p>I call on them not to challenge the regulations. I call on the Church leaders to lead by example. In any church that I am involved in, I certainly want them to lead by example with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament">New Testament</a> teachings and say, "Love your neighbour, so protect your neighbour". I want them to say, "If the Government have made a decision about restrictions, well, do you know something? They have done it in your interests and in the interests of your neighbours". I do not know whether the junior Minister will speak to that, but it is certainly a challenge to the Churches from me.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I want to start with the notion of the four consultants who have come up with a different view. We might call it a second opinion, because it is in the medical field. The question is this: is it for the House to say, "Here is a letter from four people that contradicts the direction of travel that we are going in, and that therefore justifies us perhaps taking a different turn"? I am not sure that it is.</p> <p>By the way, let me declare that I am somebody with cardiovascular issues that had to be dealt with in an acute hospital during COVID. I was dealt with in a timely, professional and empathetic manner, and I thank all the professionals involved.</p> <p>The point that I want to make, which is relevant, is that consultants no longer say to you, "Here is what you need to do. Here is the procedure that you must have". They will say to you. "You have a condition" &#8212; for example, I had a heart condition &#8212; "that a pacemaker should sort out, but you have to make the decision that you want the pacemaker fitted". They will then say, "You have another condition that could kill you. If you have an internal defibrillator fitted, that should keep you alive, if the condition kicks off, until we get you into hospital". They tell you your options; they do not tell you what you have to do. In the same way, if four consultants say that they think that we are taking the wrong tack, is it not for the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of Health to speak to his <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer">Chief Medical Officer</a> and say, "What about that opinion? It contradicts where you are. I need to be reassured by you that what you tell me is the right thing and the right recommendation". I am sure that it is for the Health Committee to test the Chief Medical Officer and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Health">Minister of Health</a> by asking, "Are those four are right, or are we are sticking with our Chief Medical Officer?". I do not think that it is for the House, particularly those in it who want to take a view contrary to the path that we are on, simply to say, "Aha! Here is a handy bit of evidence: a new letter from four people who call themselves consultants, because they are, so I will use that to justify my path". That is not the right thing to do or the way in which scrutiny should work. We should test the Minister. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> should test the Chief Medical Officer. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee">The Committee</a> should test the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMO">CMO</a>. We should follow the right medical and scientific advice.</p> <p>Mr Sheehan made the good point that, for at least 10 years, the health service has suffered from underinvestment. We have an Ulster Unionist Minister of Health today. Ten years ago, we had an Ulster Unionist Minister of Health. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McGimpsey">Michael McGimpsey</a> was able to forecast years ahead, to within three decimal points, in billions of pounds, what the health service needed to stand still, and the House did not vote through that money; in fact, the House tortured Michael McGimpsey. It brought him back again and again for debates, making sure that he spent as much time as possible in the Chamber, which meant that he had as little time as possible to do the job of being a Minister in his office. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> absolutely tortured him, but he was right, not least about the finances.</p> <p>Let us also recall that, 11 years ago, there was a global pandemic: swine flu. Michael McGimpsey was in charge, and what did he do? He ensured that there was a vaccine for every citizen in this country. What happened? The vaccine was not needed. We did not need anything like a million vaccines. What did the House do? It tortured him for wasting millions of pounds. What if we had needed it? Did we learn the lesson from that? I am not sure that we did. I have been in the Chamber this year when some Members have tried to torture the current <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Minister">Health Minister</a> over the Nightingale hospitals because the beds were not needed in the first wave. What if they are needed? I get the argument that it takes resource and takes professionals out of their day jobs to put them into a Nightingale hospital where, perhaps, they will sit unoccupied, but those are tensions that we cannot resolve, not if we want to be prepared for worst-case scenarios.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>Thank you, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>. I understand your desire for me to do that.</p> <p>I have a couple more points to make, if I may. Mr Buckley and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Middleton">Mr Middleton</a> referred to the effects, particularly under regulation 8, of the impact on businesses, including those in the hospitality sector. This morning, upstairs in my office, I took a phone call from somebody who did not tell me who he was except that he was a businessperson. I did not ask his <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> or whether he voted, because those are not the important issues. His issue was that he had had to close up his business in mid-March and had not been able to reopen since. He said that he vacillates between frustration because he thinks that we are useless and anger and despair because he thinks that we are useless. His point was that this is the second wave that we all knew was coming. His question was this: why did Departments, such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_the_Economy">Department for the Economy</a>, not make sure that they had their data sets and processing arrangements in order so that, when they came up with a scheme to grant-aid businesses, that could be processed quickly and the money delivered?</p> <p>That follows a lengthy email that I received yesterday, again with regard to regulation 8, relating to hospitality in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry_City_and_Strabane_District_Council">Derry City and Strabane District Council</a> area. The sender made the point that they now face the sixth week of having received none of the financial help &#8212; the &#163;400 to &#163;600 per week &#8212; promised by the Finance <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>. He said that businesses in the hospitality sector around Derry were informed that their claims would be dealt with first and that it would all be done in short order, seven working days after they were notified that the money was to go into their accounts, but here they are, having been told that they were successful in mid-October, still waiting for the money. In fairness to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Minister">Finance Minister</a>, I sent him an email last night, and he has already responded to say that there have been difficulties getting the right data out of some councils, the Department is working on it and he believes that the pipeline for grant aid is now open. I thank him for doing that, but the point of this morning's caller remains: surely, we should have ironed out all those data problems in advance. Given that the pandemic may be with us for a long time and that there may not be just a first and second wave but more to come, I encourage the Executive to do more to ensure that the data sets are in place so that processes can be activated as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Thank you for allowing me some latitude, Mr Deputy <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, but the point is that the health service needs to be supported not only to fight <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">COVID-19</a> but to prepare for the radical reforms needed to best serve the health of the people of this country. Once again, I thank all those who have helped me with my cardiovascular issues in recent months.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I thank everyone who has contributed to the debate. There has been a lot that I could agree with and a lot that I could not agree with. Business is not easy, folks. You all know that. If it were easy, everybody would be at it. We live in difficult times.</p> <p>The whole point of having the regulations in statute and, in fact, the main reason that we have our <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> written down is to provide clear instruction to our citizens and businesses on what must be done, how it must be done and when it must be done, clear instructions so that no one is disadvantaged or put under unnecessary duress. However, there has been no clarity on how we have got to the restrictions of this second lockdown. Yet again this week, we heard the First <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> say that there will be no extension to the current restrictions, but, yesterday, we found out in a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV">TV</a> interview that that will probably not be the reality for a lot of businesses. How do we expect any business to survive in this environment? How do we look at those who run our supply chains and need time to prepare for any reopening? They will be in limbo for another week, caught between the expense of preparation, if there is an extension, and a loss of income, if there is not.</p> <p>It is particularly annoying that that is exactly what happened when the Executive first introduced the new set of restrictions. On the Monday, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Minister">Education Minister</a> guaranteed that schools would not close. Questions had been asked for weeks about whether the schools would close, with no answers. On Tuesday, they were told to close. Honesty with the public is needed. Tell the public that a six-week lockdown now is a big step but would allow certainty that there could be some sort of relaxation to allow people to come together and businesses to open for the festive period. Surely, that clear instruction, rather than the political spin that we have got over the past few weeks, would give us a better standing with our business community.</p> <p>I applaud the vast <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of the public, who have followed the restrictions over the past period and helped to get our infection numbers down from some of the worst rates in Europe. However, unrest exists due to the lack of clarity and a lack of decision-making based on scientific evidence. That will grow if what was leaked this weekend turns out to be true. Shame on those who leaked that information. Show me the evidence that a restaurant that serves a bottle of wine with dinner is more dangerous than a restaurant that does not. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maybe_I">Maybe I</a> am wrong, but that sounds less like decision-making based on evidence and more like decision-making based on the outdated conservative prejudices against alcohol that the Chamber spoke so strongly against last week. It is nonsense to suggest that restaurants should open, denying their access to the support schemes for businesses that are asked to close, but should not sell alcohol, which is critical to their business model. When the Executive ask any service to close, whether it is schools, restaurants or retail, they need to provide additional support to allow people to follow the rules. The slow pace of support to date has not inspired confidence.</p> <p>Before deciding the way forward, the Executive should take advice from the president-elect and the first female vice president-elect of the United States: now is the time for science and the time for truth. That is how we build trust with our business community. That is how we can support them, and that is how we will get through the pandemic.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>There is something inherently farcical about the debate in the sense that we are debating regulations the first of which &#8212; the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> (No. 8) regulations &#8212; have already been superseded. The amendment (No. 9) regulations will run out in three days' time. Yet this is the opportunity for the Assembly to say whether it consents to horses that have already bolted in terms of legislation. There is something inherently farcical about that.</p> <p>The farce exists not only in the mechanics. I take you back to the amendment (No. 9) regulations. Members may recall hanging about the Building three weeks ago tomorrow &#8212; or was it four weeks? It was a Tuesday evening, and we were awaiting with bated breath an announcement from the Executive. It was coming at 5.00 pm, then it was coming at 7.00 pm, 8.00 pm, 9.00 pm. At 11.00 pm, we were told to go home. Why? Because, again, the dysfunctionalism ruled. When the regulation came the next day, we were told that it was coming into effect at 6.00 pm on the Friday.</p> <p>Businesses, in good faith, prepared to close at 6.00 pm &#8212; a whole evening of trading was lost in the hospitality industry &#8212; but the regulation was not made until 10.30 pm that night.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we had a sports <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> intervene to tell sports fans at Coleraine to go home. They could not get into the ground under a law that had not even been made, and, when it was made, it did not even say that. It never said that; it had the specific exemption for elite sports and was never in the business of banning the limited number of spectators.</p> <p>That is the background of farce and incoherence, which speaks to many people in terms of the level of confidence that they should exercise in respect of these measures from the Executive. That is a contributor, among other contributors, to the loss of confidence among many in the public as to the regulations that are made. That is unfortunate, potentially damaging and dangerous because COVID is real. We all have our personal responsibilities to obey regulations and to take that personal responsibility upon ourselves. However, when an Executive behave in that incoherent way, of course, it is easy for people who want to depart from regulations to find that route. Those are the reasons why I say that there is something inherently farcical about debating these matters at this stage.</p> <p>Nonetheless, it is important to do it, because we are still in the climate of this virus where, frankly, we do not really know what the direction of travel is. We had the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister">First Minister</a> telling us, not later than last week, that that which was forbidden in the amendment (No. 9) regulations comes to an end at midnight on Thursday. Then we had the deputy First Minister tell us yesterday that that is only partially true, because some of it is going to open up but some of it is not, and we are now going to have new ideas about restaurants opening without the capacity to serve alcohol. Mr Catney depicted that as some sort of a fall out over a view about alcohol, but, frankly, I think that it is more likely to be the typical horse-trade of this Executive rather than anything else. However, I agree that it is illogical and that it makes no sense.</p>            </div>

Who knows? However, I know this: the Executive have not addressed the issues that they ought to have addressed post-phase one of COVID. Let us take the issue of care homes. Care homes were devastated by COVID in the first wave, and yet, today, we are back at the point where there are 139 outbreaks in our care homes. Why would that be? I respectfully suggest that one of the reasons for that might be that, up until last week, we were testing staff in care homes only every two weeks. Last week, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> announced that we will now do it once a week.</p> <p>Given that care homes are effectively closed down to visitors, it is quite clear to anyone that the entry point for COVID has to come unwittingly through the staff. Why is it that staff are not being tested every day or at least every other day? What lesson has been learned from the first phase, given that, suddenly, multiple months later, we are only now starting to talk about upping the testing in care homes? I do not think that once a week is enough, although it is better than every two weeks. Again, knowing that the highest level of fatalities will be among people in the age bracket who populate our care homes, it seems a gross neglect to have allowed that situation to develop again.</p> <p>It is not enough to say, "Oh, we must all rally behind the Executive; they are doing their best". Sorry, there has to be a role and an opportunity for criticism. When four clinicians, who are not four busybodies, decide to swim against the tide, it is not an easy task &#8212; swimming against the tide: I have a bit of experience of that myself &#8212; when you have the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer">Chief Medical Officer</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Scientific_Adviser">Chief Scientific Adviser</a>, the Minister and the head of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMA">BMA</a> all telling a particular theme. It is not a particularly easy course for four clinicians to put their name to a letter and say, "Well, in fact, is this right? In fact, do we not need better evidence than the evidence we have?". It is no answer to those four clinicians to say, "There's not a thousand of them". If they are making a valid point, the Minister and the Executive should be looking at that and taking heed of it.</p>            </div>

Amendment No. 9 was brought in on the basis that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer">Chief Medical Officer</a> said that it had to be. That is the same Chief Medical Officer who, a few days ago, remarkably said that you could not have both hospitality and schools open. When a Chief Medical Officer says that and when four clinicians write a sentence such as this, I think that this is very germane to whether or not these regulations are on the money. What did the four medical officers write? Amongst what they wrote was:</p> <p class="indent">"To deprive our population of livelihood, civil liberties and education, we believe that the evidence to support this should be scientifically robust and beyond reproach."</p> <p>Who could disagree with that: before we do what we are doing, we need to be sure that what we have is scientifically robust and beyond reproach?

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I think that the public, watching on to buttress their confidence that they should believe all that they are told, have come to the point at which they recognise that challenge is an essential part of building confidence. It is easy to say, "Here is what we must do", but you cannot do that and ignore credible contentions. If four clinicians of the standard of Dr Walsh and his colleagues are bravely saying that there is clearly no evidence for what lies behind some of these measures, it would be grossly irresponsible for the House simply to say, "We don't want to listen to that. That doesn't suit. We're going to ignore that". The letter says many other important things. The four clinicians make the point that people are dying because of COVID but not of COVID. People are dying because they are not getting the treatment for their other diseases. Every day in this country, 12 or 13 people die of cancer. What will that figure be next year because of those who did not get their diagnosis, did not get their tests or had their treatment delayed?</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_House">In the House</a>, in the early stages of COVID, I raised with the deputy First <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> the tragic case of a young mother, aged 32, who had been diagnosed with cancer and whose treatment was paused. After some time, the Minister intervened &#8212; I appreciated that &#8212; and treatment was resumed. In the weeks that were lost, however, she had weakened, and, tragically, that young mother died a few weeks ago. Was she a casualty of COVID? How many casualties of COVID will there be next year? As Ms McLaughlin said, we are in the situation where 400 cases have put our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service">National Health Service</a> in crisis. Really?</p> <p>That brings me to Mr Nesbitt's point. He is absolutely right: some of the rundown in our health service was self-inflicted by the politics of this House. When <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McGimpsey">Michael McGimpsey</a> was <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Health">Minister of Health</a> and said that he needed funds to keep us standing still, the greater political forces in the House mocked him, refused him and forced upon him cuts, which, to this very day, we are bearing the consequences of. That was politics, not health. In fact, in the past 10 years, the House has reduced the number of hospital beds in our community by 1,500. Then, we are surprised that we are unable to deal with a pandemic and that 400 cases put us in this spin. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> needs to take a look at itself: why did it do that, and what will it do going forward?</p> <p>In the autumn of 2016, there was a nationwide pandemic dry run, as it were. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> of Health in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> was our present deputy <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister">First Minister</a>. What lessons were learned? What preparations were made for a pandemic?</p>            </div>

The preparations of the House were to reduce the number of nurses, reduce the number of doctors and reduce the number of beds. Those were the preparations that were made. Unless and until those are reversed, we will not be in a fit position &#8212; I hope that this does not arise &#8212; to meet future pandemics.</p> <p>Where are we going now? Regulation 9 came in, and it expires on Thursday night. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister">First Minister</a> told us that that is the end of it. We were told that if we get the R number under 1, the regulation has served its purpose. From what I have heard, the R number is significantly under 1. So why is there even a debate about continuing to strangle our economy with further regulations? Yes, it is very good to have all the support of the furlough scheme, and its generosity is considerable. However, I fear this: how many zombie jobs we are sustaining? How many jobs will not be there when furlough ends, as it must do one day? That is part of the real challenge. That is why the four doctors were right to say in this letter:</p> <p class="indent">"The deprivation of livelihoods and extreme measures that are being called for seem very difficult to justify on the basis of the current clinical evidence. When the wider societal and health costs are also considered we really must think again."</p> <p>I echo that. We really do need to think again.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I was going to try to guess the composer of that mobile phone ring tone, but I will not.</p> <p>We cannot have a situation where the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Parliament">Westminster Parliament</a>, which is hardly a bastion of democracy, has more accountability in its course of action than the House. Why is it, as others said, that we have to wait three weeks from when regulations are brought in before we have the chance to discuss them? We are in a health pandemic that has claimed the life of over 1,000 people, and I give my sympathies to all those families who have lost a loved one. Why can the House not have emergency or extra sittings in the Chamber to discuss the regulations in order to challenge or alter them?</p> <p>As I am sure is the case for others, whenever there is a proposed change to the regulations, I am inundated by questions from constituents about what is going on and what it means for them and so on. We should insist that Ministers bring the regulations to the House before they are implemented. Otherwise, we cannot say that there is any serious scrutiny or accountability at play here. Is that because, as was revealed in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_McBride">Sam McBride</a>'s book about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RHI">RHI</a> scandal, Ministers are overtly sensitive to criticism and in this instance are running scared of it, or is it because they do not want any scrutiny of their dangerous strategy of living with a killer virus like COVID?</p> <p><a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> 8 relates to the regulations and restrictions in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry_and_Strabane">Derry and Strabane</a> area. It is worth remembering that those restrictions on hospitality were brought in because case numbers rose rapidly. Evidence shows that the restrictions helped to bring the infection rate down by a significant number. We heard that the biggest proportion of cases in the Derry and Strabane area came from hospitality and then from community transmission. Restrictions on workplaces are not ideal and are not what anybody wants, not least workers themselves, but these restrictions are an important method in getting the infection rates down as opposed to letting it spread rapidly across our community. In the absence of the Executive adopting a zero-COVID approach, they are clearly still necessary.</p> <p>Amendment No. 9 implements restrictions on hospitality and other sectors. Again, this situation arose after the Executive moved prematurely to lift restrictions at the end of the summer, precipitating the spread of COVID in a second wave. This move, alongside the abject failure to establish a proper track-and-trace system, has created this disastrous, uncertain situation where the Executive have been forced to put the hospitality sector into lockdown again after lifting it too soon. That said, I strongly contest the idea that now is the correct or safe time to further open up hospitality or any other sector and to push people back into restaurants and other venues when this virus is still spreading and taking people with it. How many more lives will be put at risk and lost because some people in here want to see laissez-faire capitalism run riot over people's lives?</p> <p>In the Chamber, I have criticised <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DUP">DUP</a> members for their approach to the virus. Obviously, Mr <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammy_Wilson">Sammy Wilson</a> has been at it again. I think that we urgently need to isolate the rotten politics of Sammy Wilson. Now even Sinn F&#233;in, or the deputy First <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> at least, seems to be dancing to a similar tune. When we have a whole range of medical experts warning against the reopening of hospitality and suggesting that an easing of the current restrictions would be dangerous and result in mayhem, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister">First Minister</a> and deputy First Minister seem to be taking a very different approach in the media this week &#8212; very worrying indeed.</p> <p>I have to say that it is quite astounding to see some quarters feigning concern for low-paid workers despite not lifting a finger to support them or improve their conditions since Stormont has been sitting. Is this a tough period for hospitality workers? Absolutely. Many workers in this industry are worried about their future and their livelihoods, but they are also terrified of this virus. If people here are seriously concerned about these workers, I appeal to them and urge them to support the motion on the Unite Hospitality rescue plan that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Woods">Rachel Woods</a> and I submitted last week. The last time that I checked, the bigger parties had not supported it. That motion calls for a policy which would financially protect hospitality workers and adopt a proper testing system, along with making other important and achievable demands.</p> <p>We cannot look at hospitality in isolation from how people may react to the rumoured change in restrictions. If people see that, according to the Executive's logic, it is safe to go into a restaurant, they will also draw out the obvious contradiction. If it is fine to mix and socialise when they are spending money in a restaurant, then why not in their private lives? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Executive">The Executive</a> need to stop trying to effectively privatise social interaction by allowing people to mix only where they spend money but then restricting, and indeed fining, people in respect of elements of their family lives.</p> <p>My worry is that efforts to reduce the spread of this virus in recent weeks will again have been wasted if restrictions on workplaces are relaxed once again. This is happening because our political establishment at both Westminster and Stormont are too tight-fisted to deliver the real provisions that need to be put in place to help workers and small businesses to shield and protect themselves from COVID.</p> <p>Amendment No. 2 relates to face coverings. I have raised the point several times that wearing a mask is an important act of solidarity with those in our health service, retail supermarkets and so on and so forth. I have raised this with a number of Ministers a number of times, but I repeat my call for the Executive to urgently adopt a position of providing free reusable masks to the general public. If we are saying that masks are an important part of protecting people from this virus &#8212; and they are &#8212; then the Executive need to step up to the plate and support people in those endeavours.</p> <p>Finally, the Executive need to radically shift from their dangerous policy of living with the virus and adopt the zero-COVID approach and elimination strategy outlined by the independent <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Advisory_Group_for_Emergencies">Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE">SAGE</a>) and others. When we look at other countries adopting this approach and strategy, we see not only that they have a level of deaths way below our astronomically high figures, and that they are not going in and out and in and out of lockdown. Those countries are living what could be considered, in this period, to be relatively normal life, with people being able to go to large sporting events and do other activities.</p> <p>The Stormont Executive's living with COVID strategy is a disastrous one which creates a false choice of health versus economy. In reality, it delivers the worst of both of those worlds by continually pitching people's health against their jobs. You cannot keep sending people back to work unsafely before a proper track-and-trace system exists, for example. The negative repercussions of this impact on individual workers as well as on businesses and workplaces collectively. If cities such as Liverpool can implement mass testing of citizens, we should be able to do so in Belfast and across the North more generally.</p> <p class="italic">(Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a> in the Chair)</p> <p>We need to adopt urgently a zero-COVID strategy of elimination and control, not this constant stop-start situation of mini lockdowns, with seemingly no rhyme, reason, logic or long-term planning involved. Anything less means more deaths, as well as job losses in the long run. The lack of vision on the Executive on this is astounding and increasingly appalling.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>After listening to Mr Carroll, it is probably important for me to note that pennies do not fall from heaven. They have to be earned here on earth, and the economy pays for everything that government can do. Without a strong and thriving economy, government cannot exist and the services that we want to provide for our people do not exist. Only the most economically illiterate would attempt to assert that we should continue to keep vast swathes of our economy under lockdown.</p> <p>I do not envy Ministers. At the start of this year, no one had heard of COVID, so they have been dealing with an extremely fluid and evolving situation. They have to take advice. We have a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer">Chief Medical Officer</a> and a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Scientific_Adviser">Chief Scientific Adviser</a> who are paid to give advice, but, as this progresses, I hope that there is a preparedness perhaps to look outside government and to take advice and to listen to other, contrary opinions.</p> <p>I want to speak about the hospitality sector in particular. For many people, the sector provides a second job, and those few pounds that were coming in through that second job were perhaps going to pay for Christmas, the kids' school uniforms and other such things. The longer that those jobs are not accessible, the more that devastation and hardship is being heaped upon people. I am also mindful of the fact that, although we are making decisions, the income of no one in this Chamber will be affected by the decisions that are made here, because we are public-sector workers. It is therefore easy for us to stand up, as the previous contributor did, and say "Lock it down, lock it down, lock it down". It is not us who will be damaged economically by a loss of income through taking that approach. It is easy for us to sit in a big white house on top of a big hill in Belfast and tell people, "You cannot go to work".</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>That is the difference. You can pass motions, as the Member's party is wont to do on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast_City_Council">Belfast City Council</a>, that are a form of words or you can actually use the levers of government to act. The best way in which to act is to get the economy open as quickly as possible, because &#8212; I said this in March &#8212; the cost of all of this is immense. We are running up huge debts that my children, and possibly their children, will be paying off as a consequence. There is no such thing as free money. This has to be paid back, and therefore, for the good of people, I am pleased that relaxations have been announced for the economy and to allow people to get back to work. I urge the Executive to move as quickly as possible in that direction, because people need to be allowed to live, allowed to earn and allowed to support their family.</p> <p>I want to ask a question. I do not know whether the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> can tell me the answer; if he cannot, that is fair enough. It would be useful for people to know what the R number is currently. I was not in the Chamber for the entirety of the debate, so I do not know whether it has been put into the public domain, but it would be useful for people to know it. We knew that it was well above 1. If we are aiming towards a goal and the Minister was in a position to tell us that it has fallen from where we thought it was and will keep falling if we do X, it would give people something to aim for. That has been one of the problems, and, as I said earlier, I do not envy Ministers. As the situation has evolved so quickly, and because the regulations have had to be amended almost weekly, there is confusion out there. I am sure that people accept that.</p> <p>One of the issues on which I absolutely agree with Mr Allister is the cancellation of medical procedures. I am sure that we all have constituents who have had medical procedures cancelled or delayed. That is devastating for people. The mother of a girl I grew up with went to hospital in March complaining of pains in her stomach. They thought that it might be her gallbladder, but it turned it that it was stomach cancer. It is all well and good for us to have abstract conversations, but there are real people suffering real effects. That is why it is important that we move as quickly as possible to give our people the capacity to earn and support themselves and to give our Government the capacity, through rates and taxes, to deliver public services and reform.</p> <p>I will finish on this point. There was criticism of the health service. We all know that, as things stand and without reform, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health">Department of Health</a> will consume more and more of the block grant. It already consumes over &#163;50 of every &#163;100 that the Government have. Once this is out of the way, we will all have to be courageous. When Mr Swann became <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Minister">Health Minister</a>, one of the things that I said was that he should be given political cover to take through the Bengoa recommendations. The easiest thing for him to do would be to say, "I need more money", and the easiest thing for the other parties to do would be to say, "We need health reform". We need to be brave and not allow parochial or sectional interest in that area.</p>            </div>

When I saw that the Business Committee had allocated until 6.30 pm for the debate, I thought that it was being extremely generous. However, it seems that we have gone beyond that, as Members have certainly made the most of the time that has been made available to them.</p> <p>I want to address the substantive points raised by Members. First, however, I will address the issue that nearly all Members raised during the debate: the process that we find ourselves in and taking through regulations that were put in place a number of weeks ago but which we are only now having the opportunity to discuss.</p> <p>Members will be aware that the Assembly had agreed to that process and that regulations would be made and that they would then be subject to debate and an affirmative vote in the Assembly. It is right that Members get the opportunity to do that as early as possible. However, under the current system, a number of measures have to be taken first. The regulations have to go to the Examiner of Statutory Rules, then to the Committee, and then to the Business Committee to get time on the Floor.</p> <p>I understand why the Health Committee has written to the First <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and the deputy <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister">First Minister</a> to ask them to look again at the process. We are following the process, and we are following it properly, and I am sure that Members would not like it if we took out certain elements of the process that is in place. However, the First Minister and deputy First Minister share Members' concerns about the length of time that it is taking for regulations to come to the Assembly. They have said that they are content to review that so that they can come to the House in a more timely manner. I hope that Members accept that the Executive Office recognised that there was an issue in that regard; Ministers made themselves available for questions when the Ad Hoc Committee met, and it now provides written <a href="/glossary/?gl=34" title="Ministerial statements are made after questions and urgent questions,..." class="glossary">ministerial statements</a> and, where possible, statements to the Assembly so that Members have the opportunity to question Ministers about the changes that have been made. Nevertheless, it is a less than acceptable situation in which we find ourselves, and I hope that it can be changed.</p> <p>Mr McGrath is no longer <a href="/glossary/?gl=145" title="Of a male MP, sitting on his regular seat in the House. For females, &quot;in..." class="glossary">in his place</a>, but he raised a number of issues around compliance. That is very important; if we do not have compliance with the regulations, we will not get the desired outcome. I recognise how important that is. I appreciate that he recognised the work that has been done already in regard to communication. I think that we have seen greater adherence to the regulations over the past number of weeks because of the additional communications that the Executive have put in place. I put on record our appreciation of all the partners that have worked with us over the past number of weeks. We have had extensive engagement with local government, retail, hospitality and church leaders. We are Zoomed out. We wanted to engage, and it has helped with communications in particular.</p> <p>Another issue that Mr McGrath and many others raised was that of leaks. Obviously, that should not be happening. Decisions should be made in the Executive, and, once made, should, in the first instance, where possible, come before the Assembly. I can say only that I am not responsible for those leaks; I assure the House of that. I hope that all Members who raised that issue will also raise it with their Executive Ministers, so that they understand the strength of feeling in that regard.</p> <p>Mr Gildernew and Mr Stalford, who is no longer in his place, wanted information about the current estimate of R. It currently sits between 0&#183;6 and 0&#183;9 and is most likely to be 0&#183;7. The current estimate of R is definitely below 1. It is important to note that that is what we had sought to achieve. I am pleased that we have that now and that hospital admissions have begun to decline slowly over the past week. They remain relatively high, but the number of COVID hospital patients should begin to decline further in the next week, although that is expected to be slow and will depend on hospital discharge.</p> <p>One of the good news stories in the second wave is that fewer people are dying as a result of the virus, but that requires them to go from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICU">ICU</a> back into the general wards again. The pressure is still there because more people are living. Significant challenges are still there, but we are heading in the right direction.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Cameron">Pam Cameron</a> raised a number of issues. She expressed concerns about the distress of families who have a loved one dying in hospital. In order to reduce that distress for families and support decision-making for staff in circumstances in which end-of-life care is being provided, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health">Department of Health</a> has issued updated guidance that recognises end-of-life care as being an exceptional circumstance in which restricted visitation to a patient will be permitted, regardless of the regional alert-level at the time. That will apply to ministers of religion; we know how important it is in those final moments of life to have a minister or someone from your faith community with you. At all times, we want to balance the public health and infection control guidance with the need for compassionate care at the end of life.</p> <p>The Member mentioned that there is a threat to life from COVID. She is absolutely right, but there is also a threat to life from other illnesses. That has been very well illustrated by a number of Members today, particularly Mr Allister, who gave us that heartbreaking account of what had happened to the young woman in his <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>. There is no other word for it: it is just absolutely heartbreaking that that lady did not have the treatment for a time. Our hearts go out to all the people who find themselves in that situation, because it is not an isolated incident. I thank the Member for bringing that to the Floor and for reminding us all of the many challenges, not just COVID, that exist in healthcare.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>The Member has certainly put his views on the record. I will also pass that on and get my officials to pass that on to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health">Department of Health</a>. I advise him that we get that information only once a week. Getting it daily is not as useful as getting the bigger picture over a seven-day period. I think that it is important that not only members of the Executive but Members of the Assembly, especially those who have a role in the scrutiny of the Department of Health, have that information. I have no problem in passing that message on to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>.</p> <p>I also want to associate myself with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Cameron">Pam Cameron</a>'s comments about the impact that the virus is having on wider society, on people, on the economy and, as she said, on the fabric of society. I do not think that that is hyperbole. This virus has the potential to change so much of how we live our lives, how we interact and our relationships. It is having a big impact, and she is absolutely right that we must break the cycle of lockdown. I will speak more to that later.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Aiken">Steve Aiken</a>, who has also left the Chamber, mentioned the need for a vaccine and the good news that has come out today. That is to be welcomed. It gives us hope for the future. However, it should not make us complacent, and it should not make us think that this will be a solution. We are still a way away from that, so we should not let our guard down. I also agree with what he said about the importance, as I stated, of the Assembly hearing about the decisions that are made first and that they do not go out via the media.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Bradshaw">Paula Bradshaw</a> raised the issue of whether it should be a requirement for individuals to wear a face covering in all indoor settings. That has been considered, however, I am told that evidence suggests that, when there is a prolonged close contact between individuals, cloth face coverings will not offer effective protections and that, therefore, extending the regulation to require blanket wearing of coverings would not be justified. There is an inconsistency, she said, in requiring junior pupils to wear face masks on public and home-to-school transport but not in retail settings. That matter, I can inform the Member, will be discussed when the face coverings working group next meets. I note that the social distancing that has become a feature of the retail environment is not possible on public transport, and we need to keep that in mind.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Buckley">Jonathan Buckley</a> raised a number of issues. He is not in the House at this moment. I am informed that the risks of infection associated with the hospitality industry and the impact of restrictions on the hospitality industry are well known and recognised by the Executive.</p> <p>Finding a way through those difficult issues does not involve easy answers, and, until there is a vaccine, we will continue to seek an effective way through. It is right to thank those in the hospitality sector who have spent so much time engaging with us over the last number of weeks. We appreciate that and will continue to engage with the sector.</p> <p>We then had <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Sheehan">Pat Sheehan</a>, who is <a href="/glossary/?gl=145" title="Of a male MP, sitting on his regular seat in the House. For females, &quot;in..." class="glossary">in his place</a>. The more things change, the more they stay the same: no matter how often the Member is told to stick to the regulations at hand, he always likes to give his current assessment of where things are. He was certainly comprehensive in his assessment today. Perhaps contact-tracing capacity is a subject for a further Assembly debate. There has been a significant increase in the pressures faced by the service, including a threefold increase in the number of new cases notified to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTS">CTS</a> on Friday 2 October. The number went from 300 to 900, so that was significant. We understand the pressures, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Health_Agency">Public Health Agency</a> has now introduced mitigations such as the introduction of the new texting and digital self-trace platform.</p>            </div>

She then recanted that for some reason. She said that the modelling estimated that the maximum number of positive cases would be 300 and that was the basis on which the PHA had recruited contact tracers. Now, we were getting 1,000 cases a day at that time. The numbers whom the PHA was thinking of recruiting were a serious underestimation, even for 300, but, given that we were getting 1,000 positive cases a day, as I said, the sums did not add up. It was a woeful underestimation of what was coming at us.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>That is not a matter for the regulations that are before us today, but I appreciate the fact that the Member has raised the issue. I can inform him that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health">Department of Health</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHA">PHA</a> colleagues are working on options for contact tracing in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. Options are being considered, including a hybrid model with a focus on digital solutions to deliver early messages to contacts and cases that includes more advanced analytics to help to enable a more targeted input from expert health professionals to risk assess and deal with more complex cases, clusters and outbreaks. That work is being progressed at pace as we aim to optimise the current window afforded by the Executive's interventions and the consequential short-term impact expected on virus transmission. I hope that that is of some use to the Member today, but I do not doubt that he will find other avenues to raise this further. I understand the importance of the subject.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Middleton">Gary Middleton</a> rightly raised a number of issues, and I will answer one in particular about churches. I am proud of the fact that we have kept churches open in Northern Ireland, and I very much hope that that will continue to be the case. I understand the importance of worship to so many people. They want to be able to come together and worship, and corporate public worship is an important part of so many people's religion. I understand how important worship is for many older people in our society who do not have the interaction, perhaps, that others can have in the work environment. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Executive">The Executive</a> recognise the importance of that, and it is only right that churches remain open. I believe that churches are safe. If Members want to see an example of a church opening safely, they are more than welcome to come to my church. I extend that invitation, although there are many other reasons that Members might find it beneficial. It is important that we allow people to meet in that way and recognise the right of people to express their faith and religion.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martina_Anderson">Martina Anderson</a> made comments about two of her friends who ended up in Altnagelvin. It brings home to us the fact that the virus is among us, it is real and it impacts on people whom we know. It is important that we recognise that. I will pick up on a couple of other points that she made. First, financial support for businesses is extremely important. The Executive are continually looking at the grants and support schemes that are available. I am concerned about the time that it takes to get money out. A number of colleagues have expressed similar concerns, and I have had many complaints from constituents. It should be an absolute priority for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance">Department of Finance</a> because people do not have any other source of income. It is really important that the money gets to them as soon as possible. I hope that the Member is aware that the issue of payments to people who are self-isolating is also being considered.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cara_Hunter">Cara Hunter</a> made comments about mental health. It is important that we recognise the impact on people in Northern Ireland. She also made comments about communication, which is important. We have ramped up communication well, and we need to continue to do that.</p> <p>Mr Chambers made a number of comments. A theme throughout the contributions from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Unionist_Party">Ulster Unionist Party</a> was the importance of listening to the experts. We have always said that we will listen to what the experts have to say and to the advice that they give. However, as Dr McBride and Professor Young have said, they are there to advise; they are not the decision-makers. It is the Executive &#8212; the Ministers &#8212; who make decisions, and Dr McBride and Professor Young would not want it any other way. It is important that we do not look at this from a purely health point of view. In no way do I dismiss or downplay the importance of this as a health issue, but, as an Executive, we have a responsibility to look at the economy as a whole, to look at education and to look at all the other aspects of life that are so important. That is why we take the recommendations and listen to the advice of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer">Chief Medical Officer</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Scientific_Adviser">Chief Scientific Adviser</a> and others, but we also have to listen to what other Ministers and stakeholders say. That is why none of this is easy. It all has to be done in the round.</p> <p>I want to pick up on a few comments. One particular comment was from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinead_McLaughlin">Sinead McLaughlin</a>, who tried to portray our saying that we needed to live with the virus as being in some way irresponsible. She implied that, by saying that we need to live with the virus, we are saying, "Let it run rampant across the place, and we will just get on with things". We also heard that from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Carroll">Gerry Carroll</a>. That is not what we mean at all, and I hope that the Member for Foyle recognises that. That is not what we want to happen. We are not throwing caution to the wind. What we mean when we say that we want to live with the virus is  that we want to live with it and suppress it at the same time, which is, I believe, possible, if we make sure that mitigations are in place. We have done it in a number of sectors, and some sectors have really stepped up to the mark. Churches have stepped up to the mark. People are looking at how they can operate their businesses and hold the gatherings and events that they want to take place while making sure that they adhere to the basic science: social distancing, where possible; the wearing of face coverings; and good hygiene &#8212; all of those simple messages. How can we put in those protections so that we can make sure that businesses and life can carry on in as normal a way as possible? It is not sustainable, as Mrs Cameron and others said, to go in and out of lockdowns, interventions or whatever.</p> <p>We have to look at how we can be COVID-secure. I thank the hospitality sector and the retail sector for the work that they have done on that so far and for looking at how they can improve standards in the businesses that they operate. We have to look at testing and tracing and at contact tracing, as Mr Sheehan mentioned. We need to look at what can be done to expand hospital capacity. We need to take all those things in the round, including testing, and think about how can we take them and build them in to make sure that we are living with the virus. That is not to say that we do not think that it is real or we do not need to take proper precautions. I think that it is possible, and that is what we should want to do. I will touch more on that later.</p> <p>Mr Butler raised a number of issues. I think that I covered what he said about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMO">CMO</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSA">CSA</a>. It is not a matter of whether we trust them; it is about taking their advice along with everything else and coming to a solution to the problems that we face. I have endorsed what he said about churches as well. He said that children should be encouraged to wear a face covering on school buses. Whilst the evidence shows that masks can be important in confined settings such as indoors and on buses, we have not required them to be worn outdoors. Children waiting for the bus should maintain appropriate social distancing. That is the right thing to do at this moment in time.</p> <p>We had a few more comments from other Members. Mr Nesbitt raised a common theme, which was that we should not listen to anybody other than the medical experts in the Department of Health. I have a lot of time and a lot of respect for our CMO and our CSA, but it is wrong for us to say to other medical professionals and other advisers, "If you are saying anything that is contrary to what we hear, we do not want to hear from you". We live in a free society, and I welcome the fact that other people want to contribute to the debate. They should have the right to contribute to the debate without being shut down. If we are convinced of the scientific evidence and of our position, we should welcome interactions with and interventions from other people. That is not something that we should be afraid of, and I do not want us to go down a route where people are censored because of what they have to say. That would be entirely the wrong route to go down.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Catney">Pat Catney</a> made a number of comments about what is being planned by the Executive or what may come from the Executive. I do not know what is coming for the simple reason that, I think, the Executive are meeting now and I am here with you fine people instead. I am not able to provide him with any clarity on what may or may not be being discussed at this time. However, I have said that it is important that, whenever decisions are made, they are placed on the record in the Chamber and in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>.</p> <p>Mr Allister raised points about the process. I have addressed those already and agree that this is not the way that we want to do things. I agree with him wholeheartedly that we should not be afraid to hear other points of view.</p> <p>Mr Carroll raised concerns about the process that we have here for the regulations that are coming in. He loves to have a go at Stormont and at the power, control and supposed secrecy that there is here, but it is Mr Carroll who wants an ever more powerful state that goes into every aspect of our life. That was evidenced by what he said today. I cannot understand his aversion to economic freedom and to people who want to do things for themselves and his continual rants about capitalism. There is not much more that can be said to that. Some people have said that others have tried to sectarianise COVID; it seems that Mr Carroll wants to bring in socialism at every opportunity as the solution to all of &#8212;.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I thank the Member for his <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>. It is important that we lead by example in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>.</p> <p>Mr Carroll also mentioned <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Wilson">Mr Wilson</a>. As the <a href="/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a> for East Antrim, Mr Wilson is free to express his views. It seems, however, that he lives rent-free in Mr Carroll's head. I advise Mr Carroll not to get caught up in what others say or do. It is not always good to be obsessed in that way.</p> <p>I have missed out Mr Stalford. I agree with the points that he made and hope that I have answered his question in relation to the R number.</p> <p>I want to acknowledge how difficult these regulations have been for so many people. For some, they are a minor nuisance or inconvenience, but I recognise that, for so many more, the regulations are having a major impact on their life. I understand that they are keeping people away from their families, having an as-yet-unquantified impact on people's well-being and causing huge uncertainty and worry for many about their jobs and businesses. Like many other Members, I have heard from those who have built up their businesses over many years and spent energy, effort and thousands of hours trying to build them up. Some have now depleted their savings and are worried about their survival. That is why it is so important that we do everything in our power to make sure that we get out of this cycle of lockdowns.</p> <p>I am pleased to report that good progress has been made through our interaction with retail, hospitality, faith leaders, local government and key players to ensure that we can get to a place where we live with COVID in a way that does not require the type of intervention that the Assembly is discussing today. Whilst effective, the interventions are far too blunt a tool for the problem that we face. It is simple and straightforward to tell people to stay away from work, stay at home and not do the things that we are so used to doing. It is straightforward, but it is not realistic for us to do it any longer. We can and must do better, because there is so much at stake. However, it is only right that we acknowledge the sacrifice of so many. That sacrifice has paid off. I want to say thank you to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> who abide by the rules. You have caused the R rate to fall. Transmission is falling, and hospital admissions are falling. It is therefore inevitable that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICU">ICU</a> admissions will fall, and deaths will fall, too.</p> <p>It is certainly the case that, all too often, politicians and experts seem to bring a message of doom. It is certainly true that we find ourselves in a difficult time, and this is no time for complacency. However, I have no doubt that we will get beyond this difficult winter and that 2021 will be a much better year than 2020. We will get better at living with this, we will find a vaccine and life will get back to normal. However, in the meantime, we need to adapt, get smarter and get better so that we can live through COVID.</p> <p>It is important that we recognise our healthcare professionals at this time. They are deserving of so much praise. Over the weekend, I spoke to a nurse who works in an ICU ward. It is really difficult for them. They are finding it tough. They are under strain. Having done their jobs so valiantly through the first wave, they are now under pressure once more. I am incredibly grateful for all that they have done. I know that it may sound trite and clich&#233;d to say so, but I highlight that so that the public will be aware and so that those who are not taking it seriously might think twice. I say to them: your actions have an impact and could lead to increased pressure on our doctors and nurses, who are already getting it tight.</p> <p>I am grateful for the contributions that Members made today. There is much for us to take away, not least on the process that we find ourselves going through today. If I have missed any issues in the debate, I will, of course, write to Members.</p> <p>We all have a responsibility to curb the spread of the virus. The most important thing that we can say, and this is the advice that we are getting from our medical experts, is to do the simple things. It is about maintaining social distancing and good hand hygiene, wearing a face covering, self-isolating if we experience symptoms, downloading the app and complying with all the restrictions in place.</p> <p>It is certainly the case that none of us likes these restrictions or wants them to be in place for any longer than they have to be, but we are informed that this is what we need to see happen at this time, so, reluctantly, I commend these regulations to the House.</p> <p class="italic">Question put and agreed to.

Resolved:</p> <p class="italic">That the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (No. 2) (<a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> No. 8) Regulations (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>) 2020 be approved.</p>            </div>
