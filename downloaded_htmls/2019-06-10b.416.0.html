                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b416.1/1">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> remain acutely aware of our enduring responsibility towards Hong Kong as one of the joint signatories to the 1984 joint declaration that established the principle of &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221;. This principle, underpinned by the common law system, provides Hong Kong with the foundations for its continued success as a truly global financial centre and prosperous world city.</p> <p pid="b416.1/2">Let me turn to the current issues around the ramifications of the Hong Kong Government&#8217;s contentious proposals to change their extradition <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a>. Yesterday&#8217;s huge protest march&#8212;peaceful right up until the end&#8212;was a clear demonstration of the strength of feeling in Hong Kong. Hong Kong&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive">Chief Executive</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Lam">Carrie Lam</a>, has insisted that new legislation is needed to close a loophole that has prevented a Hong Kong national accused of murdering another Hong Kong national in Taiwan from facing justice, yet the Taiwanese Administration also oppose the changes, while civil society and business and legal groups in Hong Kong have expressed the strongest concerns about the content of the proposals and the very short consultation period.</p> <p pid="b416.1/3">Many fear above all that Hong Kong nationals and residents risk being pulled into China&#8217;s legal system, which can involve lengthy pre-trial detentions, televised confessions and an absence of many of the judicial safeguards that we see in Hong Kong and in the UK. While we welcome recent efforts by the Hong Kong Government to react to the unprecedented level of public concern&#8212;of the 7 million people living in Hong Kong, between 300,000 and 1 million were on the streets yesterday&#8212;the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> is clear that the changes proposed fail to address fully some core issues that we and others have raised.</p> <p pid="b416.1/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> Government have been unequivocal in their views. From the outset, the consul general, Andy Heyn, and my officials have been raising concerns with the Hong Kong Government, members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Legislative_Council">Hong Kong Legislative Council</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Council">Executive Council</a> at all levels. We have also had full and detailed discussions with Chief Executive Carrie Lam, both bilaterally and as part of an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU">EU</a> d&#233;marche. On <phrase class="date" code="2019-05-30">30 May</phrase>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> issued a joint statement with his Canadian counterpart on the potential impact of the proposals on our citizens in Hong Kong, including on business confidence and on Hong Kong&#8217;s international reputation.</p> <p pid="b416.1/5">Some Hong Kong lawmakers have proposed an array of alternative solutions, including that additional legally binding human rights safeguards be included in the proposed legislation. In my meeting in London on <phrase class="date" code="2019-05-20">20 May</phrase> with Hong Kong Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Edward Yau, I made it clear that proper consideration must be given to all these suggestions as part of a wider and more comprehensive consultation. More time for consultation would allow for a more adequate consensus to be built.</p> <p pid="b416.1/6">As the House will be aware, the operation of the court system on mainland China is very different from that which applies in Hong Kong. There are widespread concerns that fear of extradition to China might have a chilling effect on Hong Kong&#8217;s rights and freedoms and result in increased self-censorship. We shall continue to stress to the Hong Kong and Chinese authorities that for confidence in the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; policy to be maintained, Hong Kong must enjoy the full measure of its high degree of autonomy and rule of law as set out in the joint declaration and enshrined in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law">Basic Law</a>.</p>            </div>

If enacted, the law would allow suspected criminals to be extradited to mainland China, bypassing Hong Kong&#8217;s independent legal system. Over the past few weeks, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the business community, civil society organisations, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Bar_Association">Hong Kong Bar Association</a> and the International Chamber of Commerce have all expressed deep concern that the Bill will further erode the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; model.</p> <p pid="b417.0/2">The law courts on mainland China are seen as an arm of the state. Forced confession is frequently practised and activists often fear imprisonment for crimes they have not committed. Hong Kong&#8217;s common law system is not open to such abuse, as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> mentioned in his introductory remarks, and although it is under pressure, the separation of powers remains more or less intact. The amendments to the extradition law would significantly compromise the firewall that separates the sharply different systems.</p> <p pid="b417.0/3">In recent times, we have watched with great unease as political and civic freedoms have been put under increasing strain. Those freedoms are guaranteed under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law">Basic Law</a>, a core component of the Sino-British joint declaration. As the co-signatory to that treaty, which is registered at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a>, the Government have a legal duty to ensure that it is upheld.</p> <p pid="b417.0/4">The last Governor of Hong Kong, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Patten">Lord Patten</a> of Barnes, said that this Bill&#8217;s provisions were</p> <p class="indent" pid="b417.0/5" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;an assault on Hong Kong&#8217;s values, stability and security. They create fear and uncertainty&#8230;at a time when we should all be working to safeguard Hong Kong&#8217;s reputation as one of the world&#8217;s greatest business&#8221; and cultural centres. Does the Minister agree with his colleague&#8217;s assessment, and will he outline how the Government intend to address this issue in the immediate future, alongside long-standing concerns about the erosion of democratic principles in Hong Kong?</p> <p pid="b417.0/7">We have a long and enduring history with Hong Kong, and we have lasting political, economic and cultural ties. As we mark the 21st anniversary of the handover next month, it is crucial for us to keep our promise that &#8220;Hong Kong will never walk alone&#8221;.</p>            </div>

She will be aware from discussions that we have had&#8212;and I have visited Hong Kong twice already during my time as a <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8212;that we understand many of the concerns which have been raised by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Patten">Lord Patten</a>  and, indeed, by her. In particular, we understand the concerns raised in the most recent six-monthly report&#8212;not without some controversy do we continue to have a six-monthly report&#8212;which states that, while we believe that one country, two systems is working well, in the sphere of civil and political freedoms Hong Kong&#8217;s high degree of autonomy is being reduced.</p> <p pid="b417.1/2">Let me say this in relation to the joint declaration as a whole. Three years ago, in 2016, we called on a breach of the declaration following the involuntary removal of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway_Bay">Causeway Bay</a> booksellers from Hong Kong to the mainland. That was the first and, to date, the only time that we have called upon a breach. However, it is clear that these events are becoming close to breaching not just the spirit but the letter of the joint declaration. I fear that this is also a good example of tough cases making bad law. There is a potential loophole, but it is interesting to note that it is not one that the Taiwanese authorities have asked to be sorted out.</p> <p pid="b417.1/3">A Hong Kong national is being accused of a very serious crime&#8212;murder&#8212;and there is clearly no extradition prospect, but, as the hon. Lady rightly pointed out, this opens up a potentially much broader extradition-related concern. As I mentioned in my initial comments, one of the biggest concerns is that, particularly at a time when <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Xi">President Xi</a> has a strong anti-corruption campaign in place, there is a risk that individuals could be caught up in this in a very inadvertent way. While there are proposed safeguards&#8212;it is proposed to raise the extradition level from a three-year custodial sentence to one of at least seven years&#8212;the situation none the less still raises the deep concerns to which the hon. Lady referred.</p>            </div>

We believe that some opportunities to climb down have been missed, but even the huge public display of defiance yesterday&#8212;as I have said, up until the last few moments it was very peaceable&#8212;combined with concerted <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> from the international business and legal communities has not been able to turn the tide.</p> <p pid="b419.0/3">I say to the hon.

I hope that the work of democracy and diplomacy will ensure that we are able to do our best not only to push back but to advise and express our deep concerns. We have only to look at the recent six-monthly reports to recognise the increasing buzz of concern on our side and indeed from many in Hong Kong in relation to this matter. In particular, the extradition treaty has engaged many in the business community, many of whom have felt broadly positive over the past 22 years. One of the messages we put to our counterparts in Beijing is that a strong Hong Kong is required for their own plans, whether on the belt and road or other economic initiatives, to be fully successful. Hong Kong&#8217;s unique legal system provides an opportunity for substantial capital markets. The great success of Hong Kong therefore relies on its high degree of autonomy being maintained.</p>            </div>

Although people will say that China has moved on since then, it has not moved on enough even to admit that Tiananmen Square happened, never mind to apologise to the relatives of all those who were killed. Most people in China do not know that the weekend&#8217;s protests in Hong Kong happened because the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> made absolutely sure that they were not allowed to know about them. That is the extent of the ongoing repression of human rights in China and we should all be concerned that a similar repression of human rights will start to be inflicted on the people of Hong Kong as well.</p> <p pid="b420.1/3">Normally, under an extradition treaty, a person cannot be extradited for an offence that is not a crime in the country they would be extradited from. That will not apply in these circumstances, however, because China will not respect the terms of any treaty with Hong Kong. Also, a person cannot normally be extradited to a country where they would not get a fair trial, but does anyone seriously believe that that protection would be respected for anyone in Hong Kong? I welcome some of the assurances that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> has given, but will he say a bit more about what action the United Kingdom is taking just now&#8212;through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a>, for example&#8212;to ensure that all possible international diplomatic pressure is brought to bear, not just in Hong Kong but, more importantly, in China to ensure that this law never becomes effective? Also, given that China is one of the countries that we are supposed to be looking keenly towards for a trade deal, may we have an  assurance that in no circumstances will the prospect of a trade deal allow the voice of the United Kingdom and our allies in Europe to be silenced when it comes to speaking up in defence of the rights of people to whom the United Kingdom continues to owe a legal and moral responsibility?</p>            </div>

He has obviously been to the same school as Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a> in that regard. The reality of the situation is that there is an international agreement that was signed with the UN, and we and many other international partners take it seriously. I hope that my right hon. Friend was reassured when he heard what I had to say about our discussions with our Canadian counterparts&#8212;a significant number of Canadian nationals live and work in Hong Kong&#8212;which happened as recently as <phrase class="date" code="2019-05-30">30 May</phrase>. The message that is coming out loud and clear is that, as my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=11768" title="Our page on Stephen Crabb - 'the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Stephen Crabb)'">Stephen Crabb</a> said earlier, we need the international community to work together.

Building up that body of trust also involves being able to have robust conversations about human rights matters.

He is absolutely right that we have significant obligations to British national (overseas) passport holders. He will be aware that the right of abode in the UK was defined by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_1971">Immigration Act 1971</a>, so there are immigration controls to which <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BN">BN</a>(O) passport holders are subject. The rights they have are not the full rights of British citizens. None the less, they are British nationals from Hong Kong. It is something that we do take very seriously.
