The report itself is an extraordinarily thorough, detailed and clear document. It leaves no room for doubt or interpretation. We accept it in full.</p> <p pid=".337.1/3">Lord Hutton has just finished reading the summary of his findings. Before coming to those, I want to echo one thing that Lord Hutton said about Dr. Kelly himself. Lord Hutton makes his findings about Dr. Kelly's conduct in respect of the matters at issue here, but as he says, nothing should detract from Dr. Kelly's fine record of public service to this country. He was respected here and abroad. I am sorry that as a result of the gravity of the allegations made it was necessary to have this inquiry and that the Kelly family have had to go through reliving this tragedy over the past months. I hope now that it is over, they will be allowed to grieve in peace.</p> <p pid=".337.1/4">Lord Hutton has given a most comprehensive account of the facts. It is unnecessary for me to repeat them. But let me emphasise why I believed it right to establish such an inquiry. Over the past six or more months, allegations have been made that go to the heart of the integrity of government, our intelligence services and me personally as <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>. There are issues, of course, as to how the case of Dr. Kelly was handled in personnel terms, and I shall come to those.</p> <p pid=".337.1/5">But those have not sustained the media, public and parliamentary interest over all this time. What has sustained and fuelled that interest has been, to put it bluntly, a claim of lying, of deceit, of duplicity on my part personally and that of the Government. That claim consists of two allegations: first, that I lied over the intelligence that formed part of the Government's case in respect of Iraq and weapons of mass destruction published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-24">24 September 2002</phrase>; and secondly, that I lied or was duplicitous in respect of the naming of Dr. Kelly, leaking his name to the press when it should have remained confidential.</p> <p pid=".337.1/6">In summary, Lord Hutton finds the following. First, contrary to the claim by the BBC that intelligence was put in the dossier against the wishes of the intelligence services, the dossier of <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-24">24 September</phrase> was published with the full approval of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Intelligence_Committee">Joint Intelligence Committee</a>, including intelligence about Saddam's readiness to use some weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes of an order to do so. Secondly, the allegation by the BBC that the Government deliberately inserted this 45-minute claim probably knowing that it was wrong was, to quote Lord Hutton, "unfounded". Thirdly, the allegation by the BBC that the reason for it not being in the original draft of the dossier was that the intelligence agencies did not believe it to be true was also, to quote Lord Hutton, "unfounded". Fourthly, no one, either in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIC">JIC</a> or Downing street, acted improperly in relation to the dossier. Fifthly, the BBC claim that it was "sexed up" in the sense of being embellished with intelligence known or believed to be false was also, to quote Lord Hutton, "unfounded".</p> <p pid=".337.1/7">Sixthly, Mr. Gilligan's key allegations repeated by the BBC were never in fact said, even by Dr. Kelly himself. Seventhly, there was</p> <p class="indent" pid=".337.1/8">"no dishonourable or underhand or duplicitous strategy by the Government covertly to leak <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Kelly">Dr Kelly</a>'s name to the media."</p> <p pid=".337.1/9">Eighthly, on the contrary, it was reasonable for the Government to conclude that there was no practical possibility of keeping his name secret and that the Government behaved properly in relation to naming him. Ninthly, the suggestion that either I or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Kevin_Tebbit">Sir Kevin Tebbit</a> in our evidence were in conflict with each other or that one of us was lying was, to quote Lord Hutton,</p> <p class="indent" pid=".337.1/10">"incorrect and is not supported by the evidence."</p> <p pid=".337.1/11">Tenthly, and for good measure, he also dismisses the allegations surrounding what I said on a plane to journalists in these terms:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".337.1/12">"Some commentators have referred to answers by the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> to questions from members of the press travelling with him on an aeroplane to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-22">22 July</phrase> and I have read the transcript of that press briefing. As I have stated, I am satisfied that there was not a dishonourable or underhand or duplicitous strategy on the part of the Prime Minister and officials to leak Dr Kelly's name covertly, and I am further satisfied that the decision which was taken by the Prime Minister and his officials in 10 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street">Downing Street</a> on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-08">8 July</phrase> was confined to issuing a statement that an unnamed civil servant had come forward and that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_and_Answer">Question and Answer</a> material was prepared and approved in the MoD and not in 10 Downing Street."</p> <p pid=".337.1/13">Let me now return to the two central allegations. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-29">29 May 2003</phrase>, following the end of the conflict in Iraq, the BBC "Today" programme broadcast a story by its defence correspondent, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gilligan">Andrew Gilligan</a>. It dominated the morning bulletins and reverberates to this day. It alleged that part of the September 2002 dossier&#8212;that Saddam could use weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes of an order to do so&#8212;had been inserted into the dossier by Downing Street, contrary to the wishes of the intelligence services, and that moreover we</p> <p class="indent" pid=".337.1/14">"probably knew it was wrong even before we decided to put it in".</p> <p pid=".337.1/15">There could not be a more serious charge. The source for this extraordinary allegation was said by the BBC to be</p> <p class="indent" pid=".337.1/16">"a senior official in charge of drawing up that dossier" and an "intelligence service source", implying a member of the JIC or assessments staff who would be in a position to know. If true, it would have meant that I had indeed misled the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-24">24 September</phrase> and the country, that I had done so deliberately, and that I had behaved wholly improperly in respect of the intelligence services.</p> <p pid=".337.1/18">From that day, <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-29">29 May</phrase>, onwards, that story in one form or another has been replayed many times in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a>, and around the world. It dominated my press conference the next day in Poland, and Prime Minister's questions when I returned. It led that week to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a> deciding to conduct an inquiry into the issue. In particular, on the Sunday following the story, Mr. Gilligan wrote an article in <i><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mail_on_Sunday">The Mail on Sunday</a>,</i> not merely standing by the story but naming <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alistair_Campbell">Alistair Campbell</a> as the person responsible in Downing street. The headline read:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".337.1/19">"I asked my intelligence source why Blair misled us all over Saddam's weapons. His reply? One word . . . CAMPBELL".</p> <p pid=".337.1/20">That, again, was completely untrue, and not merely stood up but further inflamed the original allegation of deceit.</p> <p pid=".337.1/21"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BBC">The BBC</a> has never clearly and visibly withdrawn this allegation. This has allowed others to say repeatedly that I lied and misled Parliament over the <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-24">24 September</phrase> dossier. Let me make one thing plain: it is absolutely right that people can question whether the intelligence received was right, and why we have not yet found weapons of mass destruction. There is an entirely legitimate argument about the wisdom of the conflict. I happen to believe now, as I did in March, that removing Saddam has made the world a safer and better place. But others are entirely entitled to disagree.</p> <p pid=".337.1/22">However, all of this is of a completely different order from a charge of deception, of duplicity, of deceit&#8212;a charge that I or anyone else deliberately falsified intelligence. The truth about that charge is now found. No intelligence was inserted into the dossier by Downing street; nothing was put in it against the wishes of the intelligence services; no one, either in Downing street or in the Joint Intelligence Committee, put any intelligence into it,</p> <p class="indent" pid=".337.1/23">"probably knowing it was wrong"; and no such claim to the BBC was made by anyone</p> <p class="indent" pid=".337.1/25">"in charge of drawing up the dossier".</p> <p pid=".337.1/26">Indeed, Lord Hutton's findings go further. He finds that the claim was not even made by Dr. Kelly himself.</p> <p pid=".337.1/27">The allegation that I or anyone else lied to this House or deliberately misled the country by falsifying intelligence on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMD">WMD</a> is itself the real lie. I simply ask that those who have made it and repeated it over all these months now withdraw it fully, openly and clearly. <i>[Interruption.]</i></p>            </div>

Instead of this, as has been claimed, being disputed by the intelligence services and inserted in the dossier at the behest of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a> or Downing street, the true position was that a concern about it and how it was phrased in the dossier was raised by Dr. Jones in the defence intelligence staff, was rejected by the head of defence intelligence and never actually came to the attention of the chairman of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIC">JIC</a>, let alone anyone in Downing street.</p> <p pid=".339.1/2">In any event, Dr. Jones&#8212;again contrary to reports&#8212;did not say it should have been omitted from the dossier. On the contrary, Dr. Jones thought it should be included as it was "important intelligence". Dr. Jones told the inquiry that Dr. Kelly thought the dossier was, and I quote, "good" and Mr. A, from the counter-proliferation arms control department, said of himself and Dr. Kelly:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".339.1/3">"Both of us believed that if you took the dossier as a whole it was a reasonable and accurate reflection of the intelligence that we had available to us at that time."</p> <p pid=".339.1/4">Lord Hutton does fairly comment:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".339.1/5">"However I consider that the possibility cannot be completely ruled out that the desire of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> to have a dossier which, whilst consistent with the available intelligence, was as strong as possible in relation to the threat posed by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>'s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMD">WMD</a>, may have sub-consciously influenced Mr Scarlett and other members of the JIC to make the wording of the dossier somewhat stronger than it would have been if it had been contained in a normal JIC assessment".</p> <p pid=".339.1/6">However, he then goes on to say:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".339.1/7">"Although this possibility cannot be completely ruled out, I am satisfied that Mr Scarlett, the other members of the JIC, and the members of the assessment staff engaged in the drafting of the dossier were concerned to ensure that the contents of the dossier were consistent with the intelligence available to the JIC."</p> <p pid=".339.1/8">Lord Hutton also says, in terms, that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Scarlett">John Scarlett</a></p> <p class="indent" pid=".339.1/9">"only accepted those suggestions which were consistent with the intelligence known to the JIC and he rejected those suggestions which were not consistent with such intelligence."</p> <p pid=".339.1/10">I hope that from now on the wholly unjustified attacks on the chairman of the JIC, John Scarlett, and the JIC will cease. Those people are people dedicated to this country and its well-being. The publication of intelligence by the Government&#8212;which we did, let me remind the House, because of the clamour for it&#8212;was a unique exercise never done before, and difficult for all our agencies. But in the interests of openly sharing intelligence with people, they worked hard in good faith to release it properly.</p> <p pid=".339.1/11">Let me also remind the House that when this dossier was published, it was routinely described at the time as "low key" and by Mr. Gilligan, no less, on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-24">24 September 2002</phrase> as "sensibly cautious and measured"; and actually moved public opinion hardly at all. Only in retrospect has it been elevated into the single thing that conclusively persuaded a reluctant country to war.</p> <p pid=".339.1/12">The dossier itself reflected independent reports such as that of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Institute_of_Strategic_Studies">International Institute of Strategic Studies</a> published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-09">9 September</phrase>. It reflected precisely that evidence which led the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a> unanimously in November 2002 to agree Saddam and his weapons posed a threat to the world. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_45">The 45</a> minutes claim, for the record, was in fact mentioned once by me in my statement in this House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-24">24 September</phrase> and not mentioned by me again in any debate, not even in the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-18">18 March</phrase> or indeed by anyone else in that debate. Again, only in retrospect has history been rewritten to establish it as the one crucial claim that marched the nation into conflict. Lord Hutton establishes clearly why the 45 minutes was put in the dossier, what its provenance was&#8212;and whether or not subsequently it turned out to be correct. It finds it was put into the dossier entirely in good faith by the JIC. So much for the first charge of dishonesty over the dossier.</p> <p pid=".339.1/13">The second charge was over the naming of Dr. Kelly. Again, throughout these past six months, the context in which this has been debated has largely been that Dr. Kelly's name should not have been revealed, it should have remained confidential and therefore anyone, including myself, who discussed or acted upon the issue was acting improperly.</p> <p pid=".339.1/14">In hindsight, of course, the name of Dr. Kelly and his evidence to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a> has taken on a different and altogether more tragic aspect. Rightly, Lord Hutton puts it back into its proper contemporary context. The truth is that, by early July, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAC">FAC</a> was actively engaged in examining the truth of the Gilligan allegations and due to report on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-07">7 July</phrase>. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a> was about to begin its deliberations the same week. The Government had already given evidence to the FAC and all of us, myself included, were due to give evidence to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC">ISC</a>, beginning with the chairman of the JIC on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-09">9 July</phrase>.</p> <p pid=".339.1/15">Suddenly in late June, Dr. Kelly came forward and said to his managers that he believed he might have been at least part of the source for the Gilligan story. That information was given to me personally on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-03">3 July</phrase>. By <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-07">Monday 7 July</phrase>, it was apparent that in all likelihood he was indeed the source of the Gilligan story. The dilemma we were in, therefore, as Lord Hutton accepts, was how we could possibly keep that information secret not just from the FAC, which had just taken evidence on that very point, but also from the ISC, who were about to interview us all about the intelligence relating to Iraq, with the first session on the morning of <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-09">9 July</phrase>.</p> <p pid=".339.1/16">The evidence, very frankly given, of both my right hon. Friend the Chairman of the FAC, and at least one of the Committee's members, was that if they had been told that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOD">MOD</a> knew the source and had interviewed him, the FAC would have wanted to do the same&#8212;as, of course, they did. Indeed, they told the <a href="/glossary/?gl=17" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/" class="glossary">Hutton inquiry</a> that they would have liked to have been told sooner.</p> <p pid=".339.1/17">The context therefore for the meetings on 7 and <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-08">8 July</phrase>, which I chaired, was how to act properly in relation to those two Committees when we were in possession of information plainly relevant to their inquiries and when one Committee was on the point of publication and another was about to begin proceedings.</p> <p pid=".339.1/18">The evidence of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_David_Omand">Sir David Omand</a> to Lord Hutton was that it would be "improper" to keep this information secret and that moreover we were under a duty to reveal it to Parliament. So, as Lord Hutton accepts, the whole basis of the claim that somehow Dr. Kelly should never have been named or that his name was leaked in breach of a duty of confidentiality is based on a false premise. On the contrary, our duty was to disclose his name to the Committees and to allow them to interview him if they so wished; and Lord Hutton finds expressly that our concern at being accused of misleading those Committees was "well-founded".</p> <p pid=".339.1/19">In any event, again as Lord Hutton finds, no one in fact "leaked" his name&#8212; not myself, not the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>, not the officials. As Lord Hutton finds, the decision by the Ministry of Defence to confirm Dr. Kelly's name, if the correct name was put to it by a journalist, was based on the view that in a matter of such intense public and media interest it would not be sensible to try to conceal it.</p> <p pid=".339.1/20">So, there was no dishonourable or underhand or duplicitous strategy to name Dr. Kelly. He was named for the reason we gave. And again I ask that those who have repeatedly claimed that I lied over this issue or that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Kevin_Tebbit">Sir Kevin Tebbit</a> lied, now withdraw that allegation also&#8212;unequivocally and in full.</p> <p pid=".339.1/21">Lord Hutton does, however, find that the Ministry of Defence was at fault in not telling Dr. Kelly clearly and immediately that his name would be confirmed to the press if it were put to the MOD. The MOD accepts these findings. However, Lord Hutton goes on to say:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".339.1/22">"However these criticisms are subject to the mitigating circumstances that (1) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Kelly">Dr Kelly</a>'s exposure to press attention and intrusion, whilst obviously very stressful, was only one of the factors placing him under greater stress; (2) individual officials in the MOD did try to help and support him in the ways which I have described in paragraphs 430 and 431; and (3) because of his intensely private nature, Dr Kelly was not an easy man to help or to whom to give advice."</p> <p pid=".339.1/23">I believe that the civil servants concerned were acting in good faith, doing their best in difficult and unusual circumstances. Lord Hutton indeed has not criticised any individuals in the MOD. Some have been subject to trenchant media criticisms far beyond anything that they should ever have had to bear. So has Sir Kevin Tebbit and so has my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. Both are cleared of any allegations of impropriety. My right hon. Friend in particular has been subject to a constant barrage of such claims as parts of the media have alternated between wanting his scalp or mine. I hope that these attacks on him also over this issue now cease.</p> <p pid=".339.1/24">I come to the final issue: the cause of Dr. Kelly's death; in effect, why he took his own life, since it is now beyond doubt that he did.</p> <p pid=".339.1/25">Lord Hutton finds that no one could have foreseen that Dr. Kelly would commit suicide. He finds further that, in all probability, he did not decide to do so until the day of his death. He finds that the reason he did so was not for any reason of conspiracy or dark motives. The truth is that Dr. Kelly did speak to Mr Gilligan, and, whatever the distortion, it was an unauthorised meeting, as was his conversation with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Watts">Susan Watts</a>, the "Newsnight" journalist; and he was surprised to be asked about this at the Foreign Affairs Committee. Lord Hutton finds that the existence of a note of that conversation must have weighed heavily on his mind. Finally, on the day of his death he received notice of a series of parliamentary questions about his contacts, which he was going to have to answer.</p> <p pid=".339.1/26">Dr. Kelly was a decent man, whose very decency made him feel wretched about the situation in which he found himself.</p> <p pid=".339.1/27">No one wished this tragedy to happen. All of us felt, and feel still, desperately sorry for Mrs. Kelly and her family. None of us could have foreseen it, because none of us, at that time, knew what Dr. Kelly knew.</p> <p pid=".339.1/28">Lord Hutton puts it in this way at paragraph 15 of his report:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".339.1/29">"I also consider it to be important to state in this early part of the report that I am satisfied that none of the persons whose decisions and actions I later describe ever contemplated that Dr Kelly might take his own life. I am further satisfied that none of those persons was at fault in not contemplating that Dr Kelly might take his own life. Whatever pressures and strains Dr Kelly was subjected to by the decisions and actions taken in the weeks before his death, I am satisfied that no one realised or should have realised that those pressures and strains might drive him to take his own life or contribute to his decision to do so."</p> <p pid=".339.1/30">In conclusion, I repeat what Lord Hutton said in his summary, at page 322 of his report:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".339.1/31">"The communication by the media of information (including information obtained by investigative reporters) on matters of public interest and importance is a vital part of life in a democratic society. However the right to communicate such information is subject to the qualification (which itself exists for the benefit of a democratic society) that false accusations of fact impugning the integrity of others, including politicians, should not be made by the media."</p> <p pid=".339.1/32">That is how this began: with an accusation that was false then and is false now.</p> <p pid=".339.1/33">We can have the debate about the war, about weapons of mass destruction, and about intelligence. But we do not need to conduct it by accusations of lies and deceit. We can respect each other's motives and integrity, even when in disagreement.</p> <p pid=".339.1/34">Let me repeat the words of Lord Hutton:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".339.1/35">"false accusations of fact impugning the integrity of others . . . should not be made".</p> <p pid=".339.1/36">Let those who made them now withdraw them.</p>            </div>

I pay tribute, too, to Mrs. Kelly and her family, who have behaved with great dignity throughout the events of the last six months.</p> <p pid=".343.3/2">I also thank <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> for his report. We accept his conclusions. The report is about the chain of events which started with the publication of a dossier, led to a feud between the Government and the BBC, and then finally to the death of a distinguished scientist in the Oxfordshire countryside.</p> <p pid=".343.3/3">The report's findings about the BBC speak for themselves. We have long argued that the board of governors cannot both run and regulate the BBC. Does the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> agree that the case for independent regulation of the BBC has never been stronger?</p> <p pid=".343.3/4">At the beginning of his report Lord Hutton refers to the controversy and debate about weapons of mass destruction&#8212;whether they exist, and what the Government told the country in the run-up to the war. Lord Hutton is quite clear that these issues are beyond his remit. Will the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> therefore now undertake to establish&#8212;</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid=".344.1/1"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> expressly finds, at paragraphs 402 and 403 of his report, that there was no conflict between what Sir Kevin Tebitt said to the inquiry and what the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> said to the inquiry. As the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> well knows, the questions I have put to him are about what he said on the plane to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> and eventually repeated in this House. On that, Lord Hutton merely says, in very carefully worded language, at paragraph 411:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".344.1/2">"the answers given by the Prime Minister to members of the press in the aeroplane cast no light on the issues about which I have heard a large volume of evidence."</p> <p pid=".344.1/3">Of course they do not. Lord Hutton never heard evidence about what was said on the aeroplane. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> never sent him a transcript of what he said on the aeroplane. If he had not been sent it by one of my right hon. Friends, Lord Hutton might never have even seen that transcript. Lord Hutton says, at paragraph 416 of his report,</p> <p class="indent" pid=".344.1/4">"I am satisfied that the decision to issue the statement which said that a civil servant, who was not named, had come forward was taken by the Prime Minister at a meeting in 10 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street">Downing Street</a> on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-08">8 July</phrase>".</p> <p pid=".344.1/5">So the Prime Minister chaired the meeting that decided to issue that press release. That press release led inevitably to the naming of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kelly">David Kelly</a>. David Kelly knew that, and it says so in the report, at paragraph 439. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ministry_of_Defence">The Ministry of Defence</a> knew that. It says so in the report, at paragraph 409. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a> knew that. That is why he wrote in his diary, "That meant do it as a press release." Anyone with any sense would know that if one issues a press release like that, the name will come out. That is why the press got David Kelly's name the very next day.</p> <p pid=".344.1/6">Is the Prime Minister the only person who thought that issuing that press release would not lead to the naming of David Kelly? Is that what he is asking us to believe? Is he really that naive? Is it not clear to everyone that the release of the statement, authorised by the Prime Minister, led inevitably to the naming of David Kelly? Is the Prime Minister really telling the House that he had no idea that that would happen?</p> <p pid=".344.1/7">Listen to what Lord Hutton said at paragraph 407. He said:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".344.1/8">"The issuing of the statement authorised by the Prime Minister did give rise to the questions by the press as to the identity of the civil servant and these questions led on to the MoD confirming <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Kelly">Dr Kelly</a>'s name".</p> <p pid=".344.1/9">It is no wonder that Lord Hutton says that there was no plan or strategy to do this covertly. There did not need to be. It was all going to happen anyway, as night follows day, all because of the decision made by the Prime Minister. The best that can be said about the answer that the Prime Minister gave on the plane, and repeated in this House, is that it is at odds with what Lord Hutton concludes.</p> <p pid=".344.1/10">When all is said and done, I suspect that what will remain in people's minds is the blinding light that this inquiry has shed on the innermost workings of the Prime Minister and his Government. Is not the picture painted in that evidence an extraordinarily vivid one? Vital meetings are unminuted, crucial telephone calls are unrecorded. In Lord Hutton's words in a letter to my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=1050" title="Our page on Peter Lilley - 'the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley)'">Mr. Lilley</a>, the notes made by private secretaries were</p> <p class="indent" pid=".344.1/11">"very sparse and of no relevance."</p> <p pid=".344.1/12">Whatever happened to the recommendations made by the Hammond inquiry into the Hinduja passports affair? <i>[Interruption.]</i> Oh, yes&#8212;just listen. That report, given to the Prime Minister&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>            </div>

Why has nothing been done to implement those recommendations? What a picture the evidence to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=17" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/" class="glossary">Hutton inquiry</a> portrayed of the state of mind of the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s closest advisers and confidantes.</p> <p pid=".345.1/2"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a> wrote in his diary:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".345.1/3">"The biggest thing needed was the source out."</p> <p pid=".345.1/4">And what was the reason for this? The reason, as he agreed with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Defence, was that that would stuff Gilligan. "Stuff", of course, was not the word that he used. I cannot repeat in the House the language used by the man hand-picked by the Prime Minister to be his director of communications.</p> <p pid=".345.1/5">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Defence">Secretary of State for Defence</a> said that he had made great efforts to ensure Dr. Kelly's anonymity, yet he agreed to a course of action that he knew would lead to the naming of Dr. Kelly, he did not bother to tell <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kelly">David Kelly</a> what he was going to do, he did not tell David Kelly that he would be named, and he did not give David Kelly the support that he needed as he was thrown into the media frenzy. Is not the <a href="/glossary/?gl=7" title="http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/report/" class="glossary">Hutton report</a> quite clear on this point? Paragraph 432 says:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".345.1/6">"the MoD was at fault in the procedure which it adopted in relation to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Kelly">Dr Kelly</a> after the decision had been taken to release the statement."</p> <p pid=".345.1/7"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State for Defence then went to great lengths to deny what he had done. He denied it on television immediately afterwards and he denied it to the inquiry. He said that he had made great efforts to ensure Dr. Kelly's anonymity.</p> <p pid=".345.1/8">Is not there the starkest contrast between David Kelly, the dedicated scientist and weapons inspector who had done so much for our country, and the cabal of Ministers and advisers, including the Prime Minister himself, which was so obsessed with its war with the BBC that it gave scant attention to his welfare? Is not there the starkest contrast between the hours and days that it spent working out different ways of releasing his name to the media, and the two and half minutes that it spent informing him of the consequences of its actions?</p> <p pid=".345.1/9">No one in Government can look back on this episode with pride. The nation will in due course deliver its verdict. <i>[Interruption.]</i></p>            </div>

First, as the right hon. and learned Member knows, there will be a thorough review of the BBC's charter and all these issues should be considered in the course of that.</p> <p pid=".346.1/2">Secondly, I have nothing to add to what I said to the right hon. and learned Gentleman earlier in the day on the inquiry, other than to say also that the Iraq survey group should be able to complete its work.</p> <p pid=".346.1/3">Thirdly, the right hon. and learned Gentleman referred to the subconscious of the chairman of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIC">JIC</a>, which was mentioned in paragraph 228(8). The report goes on to say that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a> finds specifically that there was no improper interference, nor was any intelligence put in the dossier that should not have been.</p> <p pid=".346.1/4">As for the 45-minute claim, Lord Hutton finds specifically, as he was bound to do from the evidence, that any doubt that occurred in one part of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Intelligence_Staff">Defence Intelligence Staff</a> was never actually put to the JIC chairman, never mind to myself as <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>.</p> <p pid=".346.1/5">In relation to the plane and the naming of Dr. Kelly, let me read the rather fuller version of what Lord Hutton says. On page 323, he says:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".346.1/6">"On the issue whether the Government behaved in a way which was dishonourable or underhand or duplicitous in revealing <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Kelly">Dr Kelly</a>'s name to the media my conclusions are as follows:</p> <p pid=".346.1/7">(i)</p> <p class="indent" pid=".346.1/8">There was no dishonourable or underhand or duplicitous strategy by the Government covertly to leak Dr Kelly's name to the media."</p> <p pid=".346.1/9">If the right hon. and learned Gentleman says that he agrees with the report's conclusions, how on earth could he make the allegations that he does?</p> <p pid=".346.1/10">Lord Hutton goes on to say:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".346.1/11">"I consider that in the midst of a major controversy relating to Mr Gilligan's broadcasts which had contained very grave allegations against the integrity of the Government and fearing that Dr Kelly's name as the source for those broadcasts would be disclosed by the media at any time, the Government's main concern was that it would be charged with a serious cover up if it did not reveal that a civil servant had come forward."</p> <p pid=".346.1/12">He concludes by saying:</p> <p class="indent" pid=".346.1/13">"It was reasonable for the Government to take the view that, even if it sought to keep confidential the fact that Dr Kelly had come forward, the controversy surrounding Mr. Gilligan's broadcasts was so great and the level of media interest was so intense that Dr. Kelly's name as Mr Gilligan's source was bound to become known to the public and that it was not a practical possibility to keep his name secret."</p> <p pid=".346.1/14">I was going to say that I expected, but actually I did not expect, the right hon. and learned Gentleman to respond to this in a measured and sensible way. It is a severe lack of judgment that he did not. As he knows perfectly well, the allegations of impropriety or dishonesty have been found not to be true. That is absolutely clear from Lord Hutton's findings. The right hon. and learned Gentleman might therefore have had the decency to come to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> and withdraw the allegation about lying to the House over weapons of mass destruction which he made last August, and his statement that I or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Kevin_Tebbit">Sir Kevin Tebbit</a> lied, which he made when he questioned me in the House a few weeks ago.</p> <p pid=".346.1/15">If the right hon. and learned Gentleman had really wanted to respond to this in a sensible way, he would have done so. I simply say to him that yesterday was test of policy for him, and he failed it, and today is a test of character, and he has failed that too. What he should understand is that being nasty is not the same as being effective, and opportunism is not the same as leadership.</p>            </div>

Lord Hutton's report, without doubt, sheds considerable light on the key workings at the top of this Government. Lord Hutton acknowledges in paragraph 9 the tightness of the remit set for him by the Government which excludes, for example, specific consideration of matters ranging from the reliability of the intelligence material to the 45-minute assertion. Lord Hutton is therefore explicit, at the beginning of the report, about the fact that it necessarily leaves unanswered the most fundamental question of all, which is of course the basis on which this country went to that war in Iraq.</p> <p pid=".347.0/3">Incidentally, listening to what has just been said, I have to reflect and remark on the fact that, if I may put this in the terms used by Lord Hutton in a different context, the leader of the Conservative party almost seems to have subconsciously forgotten the support that he expressed for that war at the time.</p> <p pid=".347.0/4">The question for the House, surely, is whether there was adequate justification for the Government to seek the endorsement of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> on the basis that they did for our forces to go to war in Iraq without the express approval of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a>. In the absence of the discovery of weapons of mass destruction, surely as things stand today the decision and judgment on that question would have to be no. The Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, as he himself said in his statement, cannot therefore dodge or escape profound questions about the basis on which his judgment was made.</p> <p pid=".347.0/5"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> referred to the relationship between the intelligence services and Downing street, and he read those carefully crafted words of Lord Hutton about that. Surely the way in which business has been done on this issue between the intelligence services and No. 10 will have to lead to some reassessment as a result of what has been learned through the inquiry. A prime lesson in the middle of all this has to be that the independence of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Intelligence_Committee">Joint Intelligence Committee</a> has to remain sacrosanct and must not be seen to be compromised, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIC">JIC</a> must not become embroiled in the presentation of a policy of the Government of the day, as opposed to informing the intelligence basis on which that policy is arrived at. That is a most important principle.</p> <p pid=".347.0/6">There are also big questions over the way in which Downing street is now seen to operate, as a result of what has come out. In the report, the role of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> Secretary as all these vital decisions are arrived at seems almost to have been supplanted by the role of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a>. Is that something that the House can be sanguine about? Is that something that should ever be allowed to happen again?</p> <p pid=".347.0/7">The Prime Minister has acknowledged the fair criticisms of the role of the Ministry of Defence in paragraph 432 of the report. He used the word "mitigation" of the description of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOD">MOD</a>'s role. Let us remind ourselves specifically of what Lord Hutton said. He said three things. First, it would have been better to name Dr. Kelly with his consent. Secondly, it would have been better to tell him to his face that it was the intention of the MOD and the Government generally to do so. Thirdly, that decision, having been conveyed to Dr. Kelly, should have been delayed for 24 hours to give time to advise him about the intense press interest that was likely to arise, and to allow to him to consider whether he wished to move house or wanted a press officer sent to his home. Does the Prime Minister really think that sufficient duty of care was extended to Dr. Kelly on that basis?</p> <p pid=".347.0/8">On the position of the BBC, Lord Hutton confirms serious management failures at senior levels within the corporation. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BBC">The BBC</a> is a globally respected organisation, and many of us would argue, deservedly so. However, trust must be an essential element of its trade, and on this issue it is clear that senior personnel failed in that respect. Does the Prime Minister therefore agree that as a result of the report we require reassurance that BBC management are putting in place mechanisms to ensure that the editorial shortcomings to which the report refers are not repeated? In the light of what he said a moment ago, can he also reassure all of us who value the integrity of the BBC that this matter should not be used by those who seek to undermine the integrity or independence of the BBC when it comes to licence fee renewal and its independence of funding and function?</p> <p pid=".347.0/9">At the time of the publication of the dossier that gave rise to the high-profile recall of Parliament, the Prime Minister wrote in his introduction to that dossier about the</p> <p class="indent" pid=".347.0/10">"current and serious threat to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> national interest" posed by Saddam and his possession of weapons of mass destruction. For those of us who were less than convinced at that point&#8212;that does not include either the previous or the current leadership of the Conservative party&#8212;the key questions remain outstanding. Why was the decision to go to war at that point taken on the available information? Should not the United Nations weapons inspectorate have been given more time? Does not the case for an independent inquiry remain paramount?</p> <p pid=".347.0/12">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-18">18 March 2003</phrase>, this House debated an all-party <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> to which my party put all our names.

However, the crucial point is that the whole of the allegation about the naming of Dr. Kelly has proceeded on the basis that his name should have been kept confidential. The important finding that Lord Hutton makes is that his name should not have been kept confidential. That puts the issue in an entirely different context.</p> <p pid=".349.0/8">Finally, I am sure that the BBC will make its own response.

I also agree with what he said at the conclusion of his question. It is important that there be reflection on how such allegations come to be routinely made, as there is absolutely no need for that. As I said earlier, a perfectly sensible debate can be had; it is one to which I think the public would respond with rather greater enjoyment and depth, if it was conducted on the basis that there can be two views about Iraq and the justification for the conflict. I have never disrespected anyone who took a different view, and I certainly do not disrespect those people who ask searching and proper questions about what has happened to weapons of mass destruction. I entirely accept that, but it has always been a completely different issue from suggesting that I, the intelligence services, or anyone else in government deliberately set out to mislead people. It simply is not necessary for the debate to be conducted in those terms. Frankly, if I may put it like this: the contrast between the journalism exemplified by Mr. Gilligan and that exemplified by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Watts">Susan Watts</a> tells its own tale.</p>            </div>

Gentleman should study the part of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hutton">Lord Hutton</a>'s report in which he says that he first came to this issue asking precisely that question, and heard the evidence explaining exactly why this was done. Let me go back to the situation on 7 and <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-08">8 July</phrase>, because the context is extremely important. What had happened was, we had known literally at the very last minute that someone had come forward saying that they might be the source. We did not in fact know whether they were, but we increasingly believed as the days went on that they were. We had the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a> literally about to report on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-07">7 July</phrase>. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-09">9 July</phrase>, the Chairman of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Intelligence_Committee">Joint Intelligence Committee</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Scarlett">John Scarlett</a>, was due to give evidence. I was due to give evidence, too. I was also in front of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaison_Committee">Liaison Committee</a> on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-08">8 July</phrase>.</p> <p pid=".353.4/2">As was described not merely by me but by the civil servants, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_David_Omand">Sir David Omand</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Kevin_Tebbit">Sir Kevin Tebbit</a>, there was a dilemma as to whether to name somebody in circumstances in which we could not at that stage be absolutely sure&#8212;because the BBC was refusing to confirm even whether it was not the source, which would have cleared the matter entirely&#8212;or whether we had to be careful about naming someone when we were not sure, and indeed given that other people then could be speculated upon.</p> <p pid=".353.4/3">The reason for this way of proceeding, as was explained in the evidence, was that it became increasingly clear that there was a risk of the name leaking out in any event, and that there were other Ministry of Defence officials being harassed as the potential source. So that was the reason why it was done in that way. What Lord Hutton describes in the end is that process, and he concludes that it was conducted in good faith. I entirely accept what he says, that in retrospect it could have been done in a number of different ways. But in the end, one thing was for sure: the name was bound to come out because it would have been wholly improper for us to have realised that we had the person within the Ministry of Defence who was supposed to be the source of this story and not once disclose the fact that we knew that someone had come forward and admitted that, given that we had two Committees looking into it and we were going to go and give evidence to those Committees, and they were focusing on the truth or otherwise of the Gilligan claim. That is the reason for it. I think that the hon. Gentleman is a fair-minded person, and I would just ask him to read what Lord Hutton says about this in detail. I think that he will find it properly described.</p>            </div>

Does the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> accept that No. 10 could have calmed the whole thing down if it had not over-reacted, especially after the letter of <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-30">30 May</phrase>?</p>            </div>

It was the right thing to do and events since the war have, if anything, vindicated that.</p> <p pid=".357.2/3">However, I have a concern about the intelligence material. I appreciate that other intelligence agencies and the Security Council were of the same view as our intelligence services, but there must be serious concern about whether the intelligence services had an accurate picture of the position at the time. I suggest to the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> that it would be a good idea to examine the way in which we could have some sort of consideration of or inquiry into the accuracy of the intelligence that our intelligence services gave him.

Member appears to have misled the House, will you have a private conversation with that Member about the advisability of making a personal statement?</p>            </div>
