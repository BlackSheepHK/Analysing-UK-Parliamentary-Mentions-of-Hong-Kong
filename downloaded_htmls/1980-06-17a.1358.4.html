Last year three airlines, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Caledonian">British Caledonian</a>, Laker and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathay_Pacific">Cathay Pacific</a>, a Hong Kong-based airline, applied to the Hong Kong Air Transport Licensing Authority and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Authority">Civil Aviation Authority</a> for licences to operate on the London-Hong Kong route in addition to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways">British Airways</a>. At present, British Airways provides the only direct service, although there are, of course, already a large number of services between Hong Kong and other European cities.</p> <p>
Both authorities heard evidence separately on these applications. In December the Hong Kong authority licensed Britsh Caledonian and Cathay Pacific, but restricted their frequency of service to four and three flights a week respectively. In March this year, the Civil Aviation Authority announced its decision to license only British Caledonian.</p> <p>
The two applicants who were unsuccessful before the Civil Aviation Authority submitted appeals to me under the provisions of regulation 16 of the Civil Aviation


Authority Regulations 1972. I also received a number of representations, including one from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Hong_Kong">Government of Hong Kong</a>, that under the powers conferred on me by section 4(3) of the Civil Aviation Act 1971, I should direct the authority to license Cathay Pacific in the interests of the United Kingdom's relations with Hong Kong.</p> <p>
I gave this matter the most careful consideration, in particular against the criteria set out in section 3 of the Act, and I found myself in disagreement with the Civil Aviation Authority in a number of ways. In particular, I was convinced by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Freddie_Laker">Sir Freddie Laker</a>'s contention that there is a large untapped market for this route if fares are pitched at the right level. In his evidence he described this market as consisting of
<q>the forgotten men and women at the bottom end of the market</q>
who might wish to fly if they could afford to do so. I find myself in agreement with this dynamic approach to civil aviation, and in my view it should be acknowledged.</p> <p>
I also felt that the authority had placed too much emphasis on the economics of the proposed additional services in the short term, and too little on the benefits to the development of the United Kingdom civil aviation industry generally of choice of service and competition on a route such as this&#8212;in particular, competition with other non-British airlines.</p> <p>
I felt that it was in the interests of airline passengers that they should be offered a wider choice of service than exists at present, that it would be unreasonable to expect British airlines, within the meaning of section 3(1) of the Act, to be granted exclusive rights when Cathay Pacific is based in Hong Kong and commands much local loyalty, and can expect to draw traffic from its network of regional services.</p> <p>
I concluded therefore that the substantial new traffic likely to be generated over a period by a wider variety of services would offer a reasonable prospect that four operators could, over a period, achieve an economic return on this route.</p> <p>
I have accordingly upheld the Civil Aviation Authority's decision to license British Caledonian but, in addition, have directed it to reverse its decisions on the other two applications and to issue licences in the same terms to Cathay Pacific

and Laker, but without prejudice to the former's existing rights between Hong Kong and Bahrain. The authority and the other parties to the appeals are being informed of my decision today.</p> <p>
As I have reached this decision by the normal appeal criteria, I do not intend to issue a political direction under section 4&#8212;and I have informed the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Government">Hong Kong Government</a> accordingly.</p> <p>
I believe that my decision will be welcomed by airline passengers generally, and in Hong Kong, where freedom to compete is one of the cornerstones on which the economic success of Hong Kong has been built. I hope, therefore, that the Government of Hong Kong will lend support to the applications which Laker may now wish to renew to the Hong Kong Air Transport Licensing Authority and to any applications which British Caledonian and Cathay Pacific may wish to make to increase the frequency of their services, should they believe it is in their interests to do so.</p>            </div>

Does he recollect that in recommending the Civil Aviation Bill to the House recently he argues that a Secretary of State should play less of a role in licence applications and that he should give greater scope and authority to the CAA? In this early decision on a licence application, is he not totally confounding the policy that he says underlines the Bill?</p> <p>
Is he aware that in the evidence that was given at great length to the CAA at the licence hearing nearly everyone except Laker argued that the market was limited in scope and demand? The CAA was clear in its decision that this was not a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic">North Atlantic</a> situation. It said in crystal clear terms that on the evidence that was given it believed that too many carriers would destroy the route and would not provide a proper service to the public.</p> <p>
Does the right hoh. Gentleman realise that if he takes a different view from the body that was established to judge these matters on the same evidence he undermines any confidence in its future decisions? Has he accepted evidence from any other body that was riot before the


CAA when the licence decision was taken? Has he received any further evidence from Hong Kong or from any of the other interested parties?</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman has effectively countermanded the CAA's decision, and in the forthcoming Bill he is depriving himself of powers to decide a general policy for the authority to follow. There will be total confusion about British civil aviation licensing policy, on which the Government's view is to be deduced from random decisions made by the Secretary of State rather than by parliamentary approval, as in the past. In this circumstance, has not the right hon. Gentleman totally undermined the process of civil aviation licensing in Britain?</p> <p>
If the right hon. Gentleman feels that there were some other matters that the CAA should have taken into account but which it did not, surely the proper course would have been to refer those matters back to the CAA for further consideration, which would be fair to all those whose interests are involved.</p>            </div>

That is the purpose of the appeal procedure. The change that I am making in the new Bill is a major one in the sense that I am removing ministerial guidance and placing within the Bill the criteria on which the CAA will operate in future. I am keeping an appeal procedure. In that respect the position will remain exactly the same. There was nothing extraordinary or new about using the appeal procedure.</p> <p>
I did not take into account the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic">North Atlantic</a> route in arriving at my decision. I arrived at it purely on the evidence submitted to the CAA and on the basis of the evidence submitted by the parties on the various submissions. I took no evidence into account other than that contained in the appeal procedure and in the original submissions.</p> <p>
There is no confusion about the policy. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_3">Section 3</a> of the 1971 Act is continuing in the new Bill in more or less the same form. It provides a series of objective criteria to avoid arbitrary political decisions. I have not made an arbitrary political decision. My decision was taken

entirely in accordance with existing appeal arrangements. I have exercised my judgment in an entirely proper way.</p>            </div>

How often each airline decides to fly the route, or whether it decides to fly it, must be for its economic judgment. As long as unforeseen circumstances do not arise, I believe that all four carriers should be able to operate profitably on the route. In the end it will be the market that decides. The operators that have sought to fly the route must seek the additional traffic, find it and tailor their operations to the market as it develops. That is what business is all about.</p>            </div>

That is what happened in this instance. To end the licensing procedure and to make every decision subject to ministerial decision, without the objective criteria that are legally based in the Act, would lead to one political decision after another.</p> <p>
I favour a continuation of the objective legal criteria that are contained in the 1971 Act, and that we are continuing in the new Bill, so that politics are, as far as possible, removed from the process.</p> <p>
In deciding the appeal I have made a judgment that is based purely on the

evidence presented to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAA">CAA</a>. We could get rid of the appeal procedure, but I do not think that that would be sensible, as ultimately aviation policy must be subject to a judgment by the Government of the day on the basis of the criteria that are set out in the Act.</p>            </div>

Many people in the industry will be appalled at this decision, especially in the light of the Government's stated intentions. I refer the right hon.

On the question of the ability of the hon.

Member for Lanarkshire, North (Mr. Smith)&#8212;is nearly 400 miles away. At present a sleeper journey from London to Edinburgh costs almost &#163;50. In the submissions to the CAA, most of the applicants


were suggesting a single one-way tare to Hong Kong, at the lower end of the scale, of between &#163;100 and &#163;150. The present lowest return <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEX">APEX</a> fare is &#163;400. The hon Gentleman is saying that his constituents will not be able to afford the fare. On the basis of the evidence submitted, it is not much over double what it now costs to go on the sleeper journey to Edinburgh. I believe it costs more than &#163;100 for his constituents to go on their holidays in Spain.</p>            </div>

May I remind my hon. Friend that similar gloomy predictions about competition in world aviation were made before the arrival of Skytrain on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic">North Atlantic</a>? In the year following the arrival of Skytrain on the North Atlantic, which was in 1978, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways">British Airways</a> passenger revenues on the route exceeded all previous records. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am">Pan Am</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWA">TWA</a> had an equally good year.</p> <p>
May I remind my hon. Friend of what happened on the North Atlantic? I accept that at present the airlines are not going through a profitable phase. That, overwhelmingly, in the current period is because of massive increases in aviation fuel costs. In 1979 airline passenger growth rose by 9 per cent. over 1978. The current problems of the airlines are the problems of rising aviation fuel costs and other costs. I do not think that we

can decide a medium-term and long-term aviation policy on the basis of short-term criteria. If we are frightened for the future, we shall never have the right aviation policy.</p>            </div>

My duty under the Act is to weigh the interests of the airline passenger with those of the airline operator. On the evidence submitted on the appeal&#8212;aviation fuel costs have of course risen since then&#8212;we are talking about extremely attractive fares at the lower end of the scale.</p> <p>
I am not instructing the airlines how many flights to fly ; I am not telling them what frequency they should have. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways">British Airways</a> now have seven flights a week to Hong Kong. I am not saying how many flights <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Caledonian">British Caledonian</a> or Laker or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathay_Pacific">Cathay Pacific</a> should fly.

Sixth freedom carriers are fairly numerous on this route&#8212;Swissair, Lufthansa, Air France, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KLM">KLM</a>, Singapore Airlines, Malaysian Airlines, Thai International and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India">Air India</a>.</p> <p>
I believe that there is scope&#8212;I cannot say how great it is&#8212;in attracting business to British airlines on the Hong Kong-London route. I want British airlines to compete as effectively as possible with other foreign airlines. That is the whole basis upon which I am instructed under the Act to pursue the policy.</p> <p>
I cannot tell how much diversion there will be, but I believe that there should be a considerable amount as a result of this decision.</p>            </div>

I rejected that application in favour of a decision under section 3 of the Act, because there is a large market here which all four airlines, over a period, can make economic if they go out and really sell their business to the general public at what will be a wider choice of fares and at lower fares.

As he says, no one is withdrawing a licence already granted to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Caledonian">British Caledonian</a>. It was granted a licence by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAA">CAA</a> and I am upholding that decision. [HON. MEMBERS : "Oh ".] That is surely correct. The right hon. Member for Lanarkshire, North, (Mr. Smith) is entitled to be a protagonist for one airline. I understand that. If he had read the evidence, he would know that there were protagonists for all the airlines.</p> <p>
Unless I am mistaken, the existing draft guidelines relate to the 1971 Act. The CAA has not yet issued any guidelines in connection with the Bill which will come before the House and which will change the basis of the policy. Certainly I shall be looking with great interest at any guidelines which the CAA may decide to issue in relation to the Bill when it becomes an Act.</p>            </div>

Of course, we want the airline operators to use the widest number of regional airports in attracting the kind of traffic which I believe is available for the Hong Kong route. The question whether the traffic should go from regional points to Hong Kong, or from regional points via London to Hong Kong, is important. I agree with the hon. Gentleman's general point that there is a broad market in the United Kingdom. Of course, I should like to see the tour operators attracting people from all round the United Kingdom with what will be lower fares and a greater choice of service.</p>            </div>

I do not understand why so many members of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> feel that British Caledonian is uncompetitive. I am not instructing British Caledonian about how often it should fly. I am merely upholding the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAA">CAA</a>'s decision that it should be allowed to fly. That is perfectly correct.</p> <p>
I read in the newspapers that British Caledonian has purchased two <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC10">DC10</a> aircraft for this route. If it did so before a decision was taken on the route, that cannot be my responsibility. I believe that British Caledonian will want to fly this route and that it will fly it successfully.

On appeal, I am entitled to take a different view from the CAA about the evidence. I did so. As the hon. Gentleman would have wished, the process was handled as a quasi-legal procedure.</p> <p>
As the hon. Gentleman made a political charge, I shall conclude with a political point. If the attitude characterised by the hon. Gentleman's remarks were to prevail, it would be almost as expensive to travel from Westminster to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackney_Marshes">Hackney Marshes</a> as it is to travel from Westminster to Hong Kong. I believe in a dynamic market. The route provides great opportunities. Over a period, the four operators will take advantage of those opportunities. That will be of great benefit to airline passengers, because it will mean lower fares and a wider choice.</p>            </div>
