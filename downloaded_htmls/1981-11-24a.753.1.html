My right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Privy_Seal">Lord Privy Seal</a> reported to the House on 18 November on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Council">Foreign Affairs Council</a> on 16 and 17 November, including a parallel session, which he chaired, on the Community's negotiating position for the final round of talks in Geneva on the renewal of the multi-fibre arrangement.</p> <p>
In view of the importance of this subject for many United Kingdom interests, and, in particular, the United Kingdom textile and clothing industries, I will, Mr. <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, with permission, supplement what my right hon. Friend told the House and, particularly, report on subsequent events in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GATT">GATT</a> textiles committee in Geneva.</p> <p>
On 17 November, the Council decided that it would be necessary to give further consideration to the question of overall import ceilings for sensitive products particularly. This embraces the all-important question of imports of low-cost textiles and clothing from the preferential countries. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> will be aware that the Government place the greatest importance on acceptance by the Community of such an overall approach.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Council">The Council</a> had in mind, however, that the final round of negotiations on the renewal of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MFA">MFA</a> was to start in Geneva on 18 November. The Council wished the Commission to be able to participate in these negotiations from the beginning and to be in a position to state the broad Community position clearly, especially since other participants, notably the United States and the developing countries, had put forward formal proposals. On this basis the Commission made a full statement in Geneva on 20 November. I have placed a copy of this statement in the Library. Within the next day or two, I expect the Commission to table a full draft protocol of extension for the MFA in Geneva, essentially a formal expression of the Community's requirements in a renewed MFA.</p> <p>
I should like to summarise for the House the main points of the Commission's statement. The first is the depressed state of the Community's market and the very low rate of growth forecast over the next years. The House will know that this has been estimated at about 1 per cent. on average. Secondly, import penetration in clothing and textiles is much higher in the Community than in any other major importing country. Accordingly, the Community would agree only to small overall growth rates.</p> <p>
Third is the Community's intention to seek a surge mechanism which would guard against a threat presented by under-utilised quotas. I can tell the House that the United Kingdom was instrumental in introducing this concept into the Community position.</p> <p>
Fourthly, difficulties caused to the Community industry in the past as a result of reductions in demand during periods of recession when supplying countries' quotas continued to grow. The House will be glad to know that the Community has decided that special provisions should be negotiated with supplying countries to try to mitigate such problems in the future. The House will recall that this is something that the Government have been seeking for

some time, and I believe the mechanism now agreed will go some way towards meeting the industry's concerns in this area.</p> <p>
Fifthly, the Community's statement made clear that we shall be looking very closely at our trade with a few dominant suppliers, including <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>. In particular, the Community will seek "adjustments"&#8212;I am afraid that I cannot be more specific on this point&#8212;in these suppliers' quotas, possibly with existing access being replaced in part by an element of outward processing quotas. I emphasise that what can finally be achieved in this field, is clearly a matter of negotiation.</p> <p>
Furthermore, and sixthly, the ability of the dominant suppliers to use the flexibility provisions to augment their quotas in particular years will also be reduced. These flexibility provisions enable supplying countries, within specific limits, to anticipate a following year's quota, carry over from a previous year's quota, or transfer quota from one product to another. We expect to negotiate substantial reductions in the ability of the dominant suppliers to use these provisions.</p> <p>
I have given a short summary of the Community's position on important areas of the renegotiation. In general, the Government are content with the position agreed by the Community. I would not wish to pretend, that the United Kingdom has obtained satisfaction on every single point which we have raised, but I believe that no essential British interests have been compromised.</p> <p>
As I have already said, certain essential elements still have to be reconciled&#8212;in particular the overall approach to low-cost imports which is a subject upon which I know hon. Members have strong views. The actual quotas for individual MFA countries will have to be hammered out in detail in the course of bilateral negotiations during next year. I believe that the groundwork has now been laid for a new arrangement which will be tough, indeed, in many respects, tougher than the current MFA, and which will provide the United Kingdom industry with the trading climate it needs to plan for the future, while taking account of all the interests represented in the House.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I thank the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for making the statement; it has been requested on a number of occasions in the House. When is the statement to be <a href="/glossary/?gl=252" title="This phrase is often used in written answers to indicate that a minister..." class="glossary">placed in the Library</a>? It was not available when I inquired a short time ago. Has not the Minister rather delicately obscured the fact that no agreement has been reached in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEC">EEC</a> on the single most important part of these negotiations&#8212;the agreement that there should be an overall limit, a global limit, on imports admitted to the EEC? Does not the delicate phrasing conceal the fact that no agreement has yet been reached? Can the Minister say when agreement will be reached? Will he report back to the House on the matter?</p> <p>
I notice that a statement has been made in Geneva which will be followed by a protocol. Will the agreement&#8212;or lack of agreement&#8212;on this subject be ready before the protocol is submitted?</p> <p>
On quotas, the Minister referred to an anti-surge mechanism. Does not this confirm that growth will be on the basis of existing quotas and not on existing levels of imports which, in some cases, are much lower than existing quotas? If this were not the case, there would be no need for an anti-surge provision to be introduced into the structure of the agreement.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> will be aware of the very great importance that was placed on the recession <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> by hon. Members on both sides of the House during the debate before the Summer Recess. The hon. and learned Gentleman says in his statement that "special provisions should be negotiated &#8230; to try to mitigate such problems in future" and goes on to call this a "mechanism". Will he say what the mechanism is? There is a suspicion that all that has been agreed is talks about talks if there is a downturn in demand. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> asked on a pretty well unanimous basis for some automatic linking of demand in the EEC to the level of imports.</p> <p>
We note what the Minister says about dominant suppliers. Will he bear in mind the need to reduce imports from dominant suppliers so that some of the poorer countries can gain access to this market which is, in many ways, dominated by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, South Korea and Taiwan? Will he bear in mind in the negotiations that some of these countries excluding Hong Kong, have high tariff barriers against British exports?</p> <p>
On the most important question of the overall limit, the Minister confirmed that projected growth was likely to be about 1 per cent. in demand. Will the Minister confirm what is rumoured&#8212;that the Commissioners agreed to a 1&#183;2 per cent. increase on the eight sensitive products, which implies a greater increase for other products and, perhaps, no limit on Mediterranean associates and other preferential suppliers? Is it the case that the likely increase to be permitted under this is nearer 5 per cent. than 1 per cent. and that this cannot be represented as a victory even in the Community before we get to Geneva?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I apologise if I misled the House by saying that the statement of the Commission representative was in the Library. I am now told that it is in the Vote Office. I hope, however, that it is equally available to the House.</p> <p>
I am flattered that the right hon. Gentleman said that I had skated delicately, rather than with heavy feet, on the question of global ceilings. The principles by which the global ceilings can, in the end, be determined were very largely resolved in the last ministerial Council, but it will be necessary, I think, to try to reduce those to figures. That is one of the principal reasons why it is not possible for me to give global ceilings here this afternoon. Furthermore, we felt it most important that the global ceilings should also relate to the other bilateral arrangements that have to be negotiated this year with the preferential or Mediterranean suppliers.</p> <p>
On the question of the anti-surge mechanism, it is much more important, rather than to get into almost a theological discussion about quotas which have been very largely under-utilised, to Focus instead on the level of imports. It is by reference to or linked to that that the anti-surge mechanism will finally be devised. Again, I do not want to go into too much detail because, as I am sure the House will readily appreciate, it will hamper the efforts of the Commission, which is engaged in very delicate negotiations, if its entire hand is spread face upwards on the table from the start of the negotiations. The whole House, and certainly the right hon. Member for Lanarkshire, North (Mr. Smith), will recognise that the Commission would be negotiating from a position of weakness.</p> <p>
On the question of anti-recession provision, a perfectly practical arrangement can be evolved from the principles laid down, but again I prefer not to go into the detail of

that because I think that it would prejudice the negotiations which are being undertaken on behalf of this country and the other countries of the Community in Geneva</p> <p>
The right hon. Gentleman is, perhaps understandably, robust on the position of dominant suppliers. Certainly the United Kingdom and the Community subscribe to the principle of differentiation in favour of the less developed, poorer countries. I believe that we should recognise the fact that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, by contrast with all the other dominant suppliers, is a particularly open market, and this country has, for that and other reasons, a case for being especially tender of the interests of Hong Kong. However, the interests of all the dominant suppliers will have to be resolved in bilateral negotiations with them.</p> <p>
Coming back to the question of the overall limit and the question of growth, I cannot confirm any particular figure, for that, again, has finally to be resolved. But there was certainly agreement in the Community that the growth figure should approximate much more to the expected rise in consumption, and that will involve a much lower figure of growth, I believe, than the figure of growth under the existing <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MFA">MFA</a>.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I pay considerable tribute to the amazing grasp of the problems of the textile and clothing industries that has been attained by my hon. and learned Friend in the two months during which he has held his present office.</p> <p>
Is my hon. and learned Friend aware that over 100,000 people in these two industries lost their jobs in 1980? Will he appreciate, therefore, that the quota base levels upon which the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MFA">MFA</a> is to be established and the growth of quotas established are of paramount importance? Is it correct, as has been leaked to many newspapers, that the quota base levels are likely to be the 1982 levels? That would be unacceptable to the industry, because undoubtedly importers will inevitably pile in their imports to Britain to ensure that these quotas are established at a very high level, and this could be damaging to an industry which could, at present, employ at least 300,000 extra people if it were faced with fair competition.</p>            </div>

I am deeply conscious of the loss of jobs in the textile industry. Indeed, I have, not once but twice, and even three times, I think, stressed to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=205" title="An informal reference to the Council of the European Union." class="glossary">Council of Ministers</a>&#8212;going a little further than my hon. Friend&#8212;the fact that 150,000 jobs have been shed in the industry over the past 18 months, which I think goes beyond anything suffered in France or Italy, which consider, perhaps rightly, that they have slightly comparable problems.</p> <p>
I appreciate the anxiety about the level from which the new quotas, year by year, will start. I cannot conceal from the House that they will start from the 1982 quota level. I recognise at once that this will be a matter of disappointment. I did not conceal that fact at any point. But what is more important, and what I ask the House to focus on, is not the theoretical or notional quotas&#8212;any hon. Gentleman who has studied this subject will know that there is considerable under-utilisation&#8212;but to relate imports in any year to the imports in the previous year and to make certain, if there has been under-utilisation, that there cannot be a sudden take-up which would result in a surge.</p> <p>
It is precisely to counter that and to limit imports to actualities rather than to notional quotas that the surge mechanism&#8212;the United Kingdom can take some credit for having initiated this idea&#8212;has been launched, not on an astonished world but on an astonished <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Ministers">Council of Ministers</a>. It has been taken up and it will be the basis of the negotiating position of the Community in Geneva.</p>            </div>

I recognise the sensitivity of the House, and of those right hon. and hon. Members who represent textile interests, about the operation of the anti-surge mechanism. It will be designed to limit surges. It would be more important for right hon. and hon. Members, and textile


interests outside, to concentrate on the real level of imports rather than on theoretical quotas that in many cases are not fully taken up.</p>            </div>

If I may put it in colloquial terms, this is a "no w in" situation for a negotiator. We must reconcile the interests of not only the textile industry but British exporters to the developing world, consumers and the Third world, I would need an adroitness far beyond that to which I lay claim to be able to balance those interests.</p> <p>
However, the negotiations have not been concluded. All that we have endeavoured to do in Brussels is to establish a common position from which the Commission can negotiate on behalf of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Community">European Community</a> at Geneva. Although there are some important points of detail that must still be resolved, we have given the Commission a tough but credible posture from which to negotiate at Geneva.</p> <p>
I am in no doubt about the importance of low-cost imports. I would not have spent so many days, not to say nights, in Brussels, Luxembourg and elsewhere discussing the subject if I were not profoundly convinced that it is necessary to moderate the flow of low-cost imports into Britain to give the textile industry a further opportunity to adjust.</p>            </div>
