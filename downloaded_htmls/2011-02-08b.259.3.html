I hope that across the House tonight we can develop consensus on the need for fundamental reform.</p> <p pid="b.164.2/5">It was striking that just five years ago across the Dispatch Boxes in the House there was consensus between those on the two Front Benches on the fundamental need for education reform. My right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40665" title="Our page on David Cameron - 'the Member for Witney (Mr Cameron)'">Mr Cameron</a> and the then right hon. Member for Sedgefield both recognised the fundamental need for reform. I hope that we can see the same consensus across the Front Benches tonight. If not, that will tell us something about the state of the Labour party in the second decade of the 21st century.</p> <p pid="b.164.2/6">What about the state of the economy that the Labour party bequeathed the coalition Government-the state of the mess that we have to clear up? It is against that backdrop that we need to appreciate the fundamental need for educational reform. It is only by having a well-educated, capable and highly skilled work force that we can deal with the economic crisis generated by the right hon. and hon. Gentlemen on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>. We had a structural deficit for seven years before the banking crisis began. When we entered that period of unprecedented global turbulence, our economy had been undermined by the actions of the previous Government. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I know that Opposition Members find that difficult and that it is painful to be reminded of the desperate position in which they left the country, but the need for urgent reform is underlined by the terrible mess they made-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> No matter how much they chunter, object or interject from a <a href="/glossary/?gl=128" title="In the process of debate, members of parliament need to stand up in order..." class="glossary">sedentary position</a>, these are truths that they and the country have to face. They cannot run away from that fact.</p> <p pid="b.164.2/7">When the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> graded this country in 2000, we had the best fiscal position in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a>, but in 2007 we had the worst fiscal position, and that was before the banking crisis. By 2010, we had the largest deficit of any <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20">G20</a> country, and today we are paying &#163;120 million a day in debt interest. Manufacturing output fell by 9% as a share of the economy in Labour's years and we lost 1.7 million manufacturing jobs. According to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum">World Economic Forum</a>'s ranking of global competitiveness, we moved from fourth to 86th. No country can succeed economically or respond to an economic crisis unless it ensures that its education system is fit for purpose, and under the previous Government it was not.</p>            </div>

In 2008, no child in Hackney, Newham, Sandwell, Knowsley or Lambeth got three As at A-level including maths and further maths.

In specific situations where a site is purchased from a local authority, of course we will seek to ensure that the best deal possible is secured for the taxpayer and for the school and the pupils who will be attending it.</p>            </div>

Ministers such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Duncan">Arne Duncan</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Key">John Key</a> in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand">New Zealand</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Gillard">Julia Gillard</a> in Australia, and countries such as Sweden, Singapore, Finland, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, Alberta and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea">South Korea</a> all recognise the need to reform their education systems, and we cannot afford to be left behind. That is why this Bill includes measures to allow us to invest in the early years, improve discipline, remove bureaucracy, and raise standards for all children, with new powers to intervene directly to tackle failure. Above all, it generates more good school places for all children, especially the very poorest.</p> <p pid="b.168.3/3">There is a key test for Labour Members tonight: will they vote against these measures? Will they vote against improvements in discipline? Will they vote against reductions in bureaucracy? Will they vote against powers to intervene early when schools are failing? Will they vote against additional cash for disadvantaged two-year-olds? Will they prove themselves to be old Labour populists or new Labour modernisers?</p>            </div>

Mind you, looking at the record of those who have occupied that position, I am prompted to ask a variety of questions. I should point out, of course, that many of the highest performing schools in this country-in fact, some of the highest performing schools in the world-are the fee-paying independent schools, which have earned this country so much foreign currency and have ensured that we continue to have beacons of educational excellence in the fee-paying and state sectors alike. Such schools draw in and welcome a wide variety of highly trained individuals, some of whom do not have qualified teacher status. It is important that we continue to innovate and to learn from the fee-paying independent sector. We must also continue, as we are doing, to invest in high-quality training for all teachers. That is why we are reforming initial teacher training, investing in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teach_First">Teach First</a>, and setting up a new generation of training schools for teachers to develop the best practice from higher education institutions and elsewhere.</p>            </div>

Friend for making that point, and we will have an opportunity to consider it in Committee. The phenomenon that he refers to is known in the United States as "the dance of the lemons", whereby teachers who are not up to the job are removed from it and reappear in another educational setting. We have explored with a variety of professional bodies the best way of ensuring that that cannot happen. There is no consensus that a central list of the kind he mentions is the answer. I am happy to discuss with him, in Committee and elsewhere, how we can ensure that teachers who are not effective do not continue in the classroom.</p> <p pid="b.170.6/2">I mentioned that there are six principal areas in the Bill. The first is investment in the early years. It is critical that <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members appreciate that if they vote against the Bill tonight, they will be voting against additional funding to guarantee 15 hours of learning for all disadvantaged two-year-olds. Under Labour, 20,000 of the poorest two-year-olds would have received 15 hours of free learning. Now, under the coalition Government's proposals, 120,000 two-year-olds will be able to have the best possible free learning. Because of that investment, we will be able to ensure that those children are school-ready when they arrive at primary school. We can ensure that when we have in place the literacy check at the end of year 1 that we intend to impose, those children will have a grasp of the basic skills required to make the most of their time at primary school.</p>            </div>

It is important that I move on to one of the central parts of the Bill, on which I am genuinely worried that the Labour party may be about to put itself on the wrong side of the argument.</p> <p pid="b.171.4/2">If Labour Members vote against the Bill tonight, they will also be voting against the measures that teachers and teaching unions want in order to ensure that teachers are safe in the classroom. We know that the biggest reason why professionals leave teaching, and the biggest barrier to talented graduates entering teaching, is the quality of behaviour and discipline in our classrooms. We know that every day, there are 1,000 exclusions for abuse and assault and that last year, 44 staff were assaulted so severely that they had to be taken to hospital as a result of violence in our schools. We know that two thirds of teachers surveyed say that poor behaviour is driving people out of the classroom.</p> <p pid="b.171.4/3">I believe that the time is now right for the House to send an unambiguous signal to the professionals who work so hard on our behalf in the nation's classrooms that we back them, and that we will give them the tools they need to keep order. We will ensure that they have the power to search students for items that may cause violence or disorder in the classroom. We believe that it should be easier for teachers to detain pupils who are guilty of disruptive behaviour, and that the authority of head teachers should not be undermined by exclusion decisions being overturned, allowing excluded pupils, many of whom might have been guilty of violent offences, to march back into the classroom. We also believe that teachers deserve the right to enjoy anonymity up until the moment when they are charged with any offence that occurs in school. We believe that those four basic protections are no less than our professionals deserve.</p>            </div>

Do hon. Members want to remove bureaucracy? Do we want to lift the burden of duties that our teachers and head teachers currently have to shoulder? Do we want to ensure that a number of non-departmental public bodies-quangos, in plain phrases-are allowed to continue to exist and to drain resources from the front line, or do we want to see every penny that the taxpayer gives to the Exchequer for their children's education sent into the classroom? Do we want to keep the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_and_Development_Agency_for_Schools">Training and Development Agency for Schools</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Teaching_Council">General Teaching Council</a>, the School Support Staff Negotiating Body, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualifications_and_Curriculum_Development_Agency">Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency</a>, Becta and the Children's Workforce Development Council in their current forms, or do we want the money that is spent on them spent on our teachers?</p> <p pid="b.173.6/3">Let us take the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QCDA">QCDA</a>-just one of those organisations -which has 393 employees. Can any Member of the House tell me how many of those work in the QCDA communications department? <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> There are a variety of guesses, but not even the former <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>, <a href="/mp/?m=40527" title="Our page on David Blunkett - 'the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough (Mr Blunkett)'">Mr Blunkett</a>, can tell me. The answer is 76 of the 393. How can it possibly be an effective use of public money to have 76 people involved in communications at a curriculum quango, when that quango has been responsible for a secondary curriculum that mentions not a single figure in world history apart from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilberforce">William Wilberforce</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaudah_Equiano">Olaudah Equiano</a>? How can it be right that we have spent money-so much money-on that curriculum authority, when its geography curriculum mentions not a single country other than the UK, and not a single river, ocean, mountain or city, but finds time to mention the European Union? How can it be right that we can find money to employ 76 people in communications-76 spin doctors-when our music curriculum does not mention a single composer, a single musician, a single conductor or a single piece of music? How can any hon. Member justify this unreformed status quo? The Bill gives every Member the chance to vote not just for money going into the classroom but for a reformed, 21st-century curriculum.</p> <p pid="b.173.6/4">We will also remove bureaucracy by tackling Ofsted. I am delighted to inform the House that Ofsted has a new chair, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroness_Morgan">Baroness Morgan</a> of Huyton-formerly Sally Morgan and political secretary to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair">Tony Blair</a> when he was <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>. I am delighted that someone who has direct experience as a teacher and in government at the highest level is helping Her Majesty's Government in their work of improving educational standards. She joins Ofsted at a crucial moment-at a time when we are refocusing its inspection on what really counts. We are getting rid of the tick-box mentality, which has meant that far too much time has been taken up by pointless bureaucracy and political correctness. Instead, we are telling Ofsted to concentrate on four areas: the quality of behaviour and discipline in our schools; the quality of leadership, because nothing matters more than having great leaders; the quality of teaching, because every moment in the classroom is precious; and the quality of attainment and achievement, including the progression of the poorest pupils. This relentless focus on what counts and this stripping away of bureaucracy are at the heart of the Bill, and I hope that these measures will commend themselves to every Member.</p>            </div>

We have heard a great deal about teachers, which is welcome, but we have heard very little so far about children. I would like to ask him about one particular group of children who will be devastated by the behaviour proposals that he is seeking to introduce, and that is young carers, who often do not tell anybody that they have caring responsibilities because they are ashamed of it and wish to be seen as normal. I worked with many young carers for several years, and I have consistently asked for safeguards in the legislation to ensure that those children will not suffer undue prejudice because of the no-notice detentions that have been brought in, but I have been unable to get any answers from his team. Will he assure me that he will find a way to protect this group of children, and will he tell us today what it is?</p>            </div>

Lady has championed children with caring responsibilities in her role working for the Children's Society and now in the House, and I take her point on board. However, the power that we are giving to teachers is a discretionary one-we trust professionals. There is a distinction between the position of some Labour Members and Government Members. We do not believe that teachers are whimsical, capricious or wilful in the exercise of their powers. We believe that teachers should be supported and backed at every point, but we also believe that it is necessary, when we recognise that there are children exercising caring responsibilities, to make appropriate provision for them. That is what we will ensure and properly fund every school to do.</p>            </div>

We all know that in his work as a children's lawyer before he entered the House he was a very effective advocate for the interests of looked-after children. We will ensure that the system of virtual heads is built on and that looked-after children, whatever their circumstances, are in receipt of the pupil premium. We are consulting on which performance measures we should use to ensure that looked-after children, children eligible for free school meals and other children whose prior attainment was poor are captured, so that every school has an incentive to ensure that those children are educated at least as well as other children, and that the attainment gap between those children and others, which grew under the previous Government, is at last closed.</p> <p pid="b.175.2/2">There will be a relentless focus on standards, not just to help children with caring responsibilities or looked-after children, who might perhaps have received less than their due in the past, but to ensure that our education system can stand comparison with the best in the world. That is why the Bill contains explicit provisions to ensure that schools will take part in international studies, such as the programme for international student assessment, the progress in international reading literacy study and the trends in international mathematics and science study. It will also ensure that Ofqual, the exams watchdog, is explicitly tasked with ensuring that our qualifications and examinations can compare with the world's best.</p> <p pid="b.175.2/3">It is long overdue that we should do that, because it is a sad fact that our curriculum is not keeping pace with changes that are occurring in other, educationally high-performing nations. In the primary curriculum for mathematics in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, students are expected to be able to master calculations with fractions and the solution of equations, and to know about the properties of cones, pyramids and spheres, but not in England. In Singapore, students studying science at primary school are expected to have a basic understanding of cells as the basic unit of life. They are also expected to know about the importance of the water cycle and the earth's position relative to the sun as a factor in its ability to support life. However, those core curriculum details are not in the curriculum in this country.</p> <p pid="b.175.2/4">Let us look at other nations. The principle of adding and subtracting fractions is in the core curriculum in Armenia, Colombia, El Salvador and Yemen, but not England. Comparing and matching different representations of the same data is in the curriculum in Lithuania, Ukraine and Tunisia, but not England, while finding a rule for the relationship between pairs of numbers is in the curriculum of Hungary and Slovenia, but not here. We cannot possibly expect our children to compete in the 21st century unless our curriculum equips them with the knowledge and skills that our competitors are giving their children.</p>            </div>

I welcome the changes that he has announced. Important as it is for our young people to understand how to do quadratic equations and all the rest, it is also incredibly important that they should learn functional skills through the curriculum. I would therefore like to make a plea for financial education for young people, which could play a particularly important role in the mathematics curriculum, in functional maths. Although we obviously want our young people to learn all the important skills in the various subject areas, they must also learn something functional that they can put to use later in life.</p>            </div>

One of the problems with the mathematics curriculum is that it lacks many of the skills-and much of the knowledge-that are being taught in other countries, equipping the young people there with the ability to take advantage of the opportunities of the 21st century. The point that he makes could not be better made.</p> <p pid="b.176.3/2">It is also the case that, as well as our curriculum not being fit for the 21st century, many of our schools are not fit for the 21st century either. It is a sad reflection of the last Government that there are still so many schools that are below acceptable standards. The Bill will therefore give the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Education">Department for Education</a> the power to intervene where there is failure. I hope that all hon. Members will agree that where children are trapped in an underperforming school, there should be the opportunity to ensure that the leadership and the investment are in place so that those children have the same opportunities in life as those who were fortunate enough to be born in areas where the schools are stronger.</p>            </div>

I hope that all hon. Members, in every part of the House, will join me in saying that there can be no excuse for failure. The culture that so often prevailed in the past which says, "These children come from such and such a background, or these children have such and such parents, so we cannot expect more of them," should be consigned to the past, where it belongs. We must ensure that in every part of the country, children have a right to high-quality education. We must also ensure that the absurd bias of the past, which suggested that just because children have working-class parents or come from immigrant backgrounds, they cannot access an academic curriculum, is ditched too.</p> <p pid="b.177.1/3">For anyone who doubts that that is possible, I would ask them to visit some of the superb schools out there, such as Mossbourne in Hackney or Durand in Lambeth, the latter in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> of <a href="/mp/?m=40624" title="Our page on Kate Hoey - 'the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)'">Kate Hoey</a>. One of the things that they will find at Durand, for example, is that it has a higher proportion of children who are eligible for free school meals than the Lambeth average, and a higher proportion of children on the special educational needs register, yet every child attains at least level 4, and many get level 5, at key stage 2. In other words, they are performing well above the national average.</p> <p pid="b.177.1/4">Mossbourne community academy is outside local authority control, and it has an inspirational head teacher, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Michael_Wilshaw">Sir Michael Wilshaw</a>. This year, 10 of its children are going to Cambridge. What are their backgrounds? They are from one of the poorest boroughs in London-</p>            </div>

Gentleman should listen, because he fails to appreciate that schools such as Mossbourne academy have head teachers who recognise that every child deserves an academic education. He can sneer if he likes, but if those 10 children had been in a school where he was the head teacher, they would not have had the opportunity to go to Cambridge. He would have said to them, "I'm terribly sorry, but it's not for the likes of you." He would have said of their studying academic subjects, "I'm terribly sorry, you're not good enough." It is that culture of "know your place", of enforced mediocrity and of denying opportunity and aspiration that the Bill directly challenges.</p> <p pid="b.177.3/2">The reason that there is so much discomfort among those on the Labour <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> is that they have been rumbled. They pose as meritocrats, but in fact, whenever an educational change comes about that tells people from disadvantaged backgrounds that they can achieve far more than they ever imagined, they say, "Oh no, we don't want that. We don't like it. It's inappropriate." For that reason, the unrepentant and unreformed socialists who form an increasing part of the representation on the Labour Benches object. It will be interesting to see whether every Labour Member votes against the Bill tonight, or whether some are sufficiently enlightened and reformist to see merit in the proposals and in aspiration, and to join us in supporting it.</p>            </div>

He is both ornament and use. He is formidably well informed; I know from our previous exchanges in Committee that he knows every single member of the Aberdeen team that won the European cup winners cup in Gothenburg in 1982-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> My dad was there, as a matter of fact. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I am grateful. We Aberdeen fans need all the support we can get at times like this. I was going to say to the hon. Gentleman that he is misinformed on this particular point, because religious education is in the curriculum. It is a compulsory subject. Moreover, the English baccalaureate is not a compulsory measure; it is simply a performance measure that will allow us to see how many students have access to five core academic subjects. The sad fact is that only 16% of students succeeded in securing the mix of subjects that make the English baccalaureate, when every other developed country demands that its students have that suite of qualifications at 15, 16 or 17.

It will help to guarantee every child a high quality education, which will equip them for the technological, economic, social and cultural challenges of the next century. Throughout history, the opportunities we give to our young people have far too often been a matter of time and chance. Accidents of birth or geography have determined children's fate, but education can change all that. Education allows each of us to become the author of our own life story. Instead of going down a path determined for us by external constraints, it allows each of us to shape our lives and the communities around us for the better. What this Bill offers is a chance for every Member to shape our education system for the better, to give every child a greater level of opportunity and to transform their futures. That is why I so enthusiastically commend it to the House.</p>            </div>

Today the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> is back with an even more audacious request. He is asking Members of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> to give him more than 50 new powers, and near-total control over almost every aspect of our school system in England. He wants the power to seize land, to close schools, to overrule councils on budgets, to ban teachers from working, to define early-years provision, and to rewrite the curriculum without reference to parents or the public.</p> <p pid="b.180.2/2"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State has been known to claim-and he did so again today-that he is continuing Labour's reforms. Labour Members empowered parents with guarantees, but the Bill does precisely the opposite. It constitutes an unprecedented power grab from pupils, parents, professionals and the public, leaving them without essential safeguards in a free-for-all. As we have heard, the Secretary of State wants to tell children what subjects and facts they must learn, and what kind of schools they must go to. Student and parent choice is being restricted.</p> <p pid="b.180.2/3">During the passage of the Bill, the House will have to reflect very carefully on whether it can ever be healthy for so much power over something as precious as our children's education to be vested in one person. Given the Secretary of State's record in office to date, would it not be downright reckless to give him a free hand in such crucial issues? Local authorities will be stripped of their long-standing role of looking after all children in their areas, balancing the wishes of one group against those of another and thereby ensuring that service is shaped by need and not by the loudest voices.</p> <p pid="b.180.2/4">Where does this leave Government promises of localism? I look to the Liberal Democrat Benches. Where does it leave those promises? Absolutely nowhere. By preaching freedom and autonomy-as he so frequently does-only to come up with a highly prescriptive reform of the curriculum, the Secretary of State places himself in serious danger of collapsing under the weight of his own contradictions.</p> <p pid="b.180.2/5">As with the Government's national health service reforms, the fabric of public services is being ripped up. Power is being taken from people and handed back to the system. The result is a huge void in public accountability at local level. Liberal Democrat councillors can see that; why cannot <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a> see it as well? The Bill reveals an unhealthy obsession with structures, and the mistaken view that structural reform automatically leads to higher standards. It does not. The Bill has little to say about what really matters to parents: high standards in the basics, a rich and balanced curriculum, and quality teaching in every classroom.</p> <p pid="b.180.2/6">There are elements of the Bill that we support, such as the proposals relating to early-years provision and discipline, and I shall say something about those later. However, what we are witnessing from this Secretary of State-and, indeed, from the Secretary of State for Health-is an unseemly rush to reform in which the normal processes of government are simply ditched. There will be no pilots, no evidence and no consultation. No time will be taken to listen to parents and children, consult teachers, and build the broad consensus in the country that should properly underpin any education reform. We will oppose the Bill tonight because it represents too big a gamble with the life chances of our children, and because-as I shall now set out in terms-it takes power from pupils, parents, professionals and the public, leaving them with fewer protections in a less publicly accountable education system.</p> <p pid="b.180.2/7">Let me explain first how the Bill takes power from pupils. It restricts student choice and takes away guarantees at a time when youth unemployment is at a record high. It strips yet more support from young people, adding to the growing risk of a lost generation. This is national apprenticeships week. Debating the abolition of a guarantee of an apprenticeship for all suitably qualified 16 to 19-year-olds seems to me an odd way in which to mark it. It cements the impression that this Secretary of State gives very little thought indeed to the hopes and life chances of the 50% of young people who are unlikely to go to university. That is further strengthened by <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 29, which lifts the requirement on local authorities to ensure young people have access to studying for the diploma. Both the Association of Colleges and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_School_and_College_Leaders">Association of School and College Leaders</a> have expressed concerns that that sends the</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.180.2/8">"wrong message about the future of vocational education."</p> <p pid="b.180.2/9"><i> [Interruption.] </i>The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Further Education, Skills and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelong_Learning">Lifelong Learning</a> shakes his head, but that is what they say. Does it not also send the wrong message about student choice in this day and age that young people might not be able to choose the courses that will give them the skills they need?</p>            </div>

I served on the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill Committee. One criticism was that the Bill gave a statutory right to an apprenticeship when one needs a job to get one. The right hon. Gentleman can correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that the current Bill simply recognises that reality, but does not alter the right of a young person who secures a job that needs apprenticeship funding to get that funding from Government. I therefore do not think the right hon. Gentleman is taking the right line on this very important issue.</p>            </div>

I put it to the hon. Gentleman that we in Parliament have neglected debating the opportunities for those 50% of young people who do not plan to go to university. We owe it to them to do more by debating the quality of the opportunities that we are going to give them so that they can have a foothold in the future and hope of a better life. We endlessly debate higher education, and that is very important, but is it not about time that we gave more thought to young people who want to get a good skill so that they can get on in life?

He must know that we published a schools strategy shortly after coming into government, and he must know that we have put enough funding in place to deliver 30,000 more apprenticeships for 16 to 18-year-olds.

I went from a state school to Cambridge and my dad said to me, "It will open every door for you in life. You will just walk into any job you want." He said that because I took some persuading to go, as I was not convinced that it would be for me. My dad was wrong, because it did not open every door. It is the networks and the conversations around the dinner party table that open the doors to those top jobs. I am talking about the people who can sort out two weeks' work experience in the holiday period, because that is what gets people through. What further restricts opportunities for young people is the culture of unpaid internships, where young people are expected to come to London to work for free. That is beyond the reach of many working-class young people in this country, who simply cannot afford to work for free for three months in London. That is what ensures that the top jobs remain in the reach of a small social circle, as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC">BBC</a> creatively and accurately reported last week.</p>            </div>

The diploma, which the previous <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> introduced, was an attempt to bridge the divide between academic qualifications and vocational qualifications, which should remain our aim. We should want all children not to choose one route or another, but to do academic subjects and learn practical skills that will serve them well through life. My worry about this <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> is that he is further entrenching the divide between academic qualifications and vocational qualifications and sending a message to those who wish to pursue a vocational route that they are second best or somehow second class, which is a damaging step to take. As my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40597" title="Our page on Geraint Davies - 'the Member for Swansea West (Geraint Davies)'">Geraint Davies</a> has said, most other countries do not have such a divide, which is why I argue that this Bill takes us back to the past.</p>            </div>

Indeed, I am surprised to find that I agree with something in it, but I do. I have visited schools recently and I have been struck by the anger and, in some cases, despair of head teachers. They have worked night and day with their staff to raise standards in their schools, and along has come a retrospectively applied league table, which has knocked the stuffing out of them. I think it is quite immoral to say to those schools, "You are now at zero: you have 0% five <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCSEs">GCSEs</a> under this measure," when they were not being judged by that measure previously.

Gentleman will listen to it, is that children have a right to a broad and balanced curriculum, and his prescriptive English baccalaureate is taking us away from that. The body that has independently advised Ministers, which was set up by the previous Conservative Government, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualifications_and_Curriculum_Development_Agency">Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency</a>, is being abolished, so what can we expect in the future? We can expect ministerial whim replacing independent expert advice. As the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Committee">Education Committee</a> pointed out last week, a mix of academic and vocational options is more likely to keep young people engaged and help reduce behaviour problems.</p> <p pid="b.187.6/3">We welcome provisions in the Bill to ensure that every young person has access to independent careers advice, but we fear that this is yet another instance where rhetoric will fail to live up to the reality. Is not the truth that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>'s mismanagement of transition arrangements to an all-age careers service and front-loaded cuts to local authority budgets have meant that careers advice is disappearing?</p> <p pid="b.187.6/4">Why does the Bill remove the requirement on the Secretary of State to enforce the new legal participation age of 18? Is it because, with the scrapping of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMA">EMA</a> and the other measures that I have described, he knows that full participation until 18 will never be achieved? Alongside the clauses on higher education, no wonder <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCL">ASCL</a> talks of a Bill with</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.187.6/5">"serious implications for social mobility".</p> <p pid="b.187.6/6">In the ways that I have described, the Bill takes power from pupils and, in the words of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF">UNICEF</a>,</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.187.6/7">"risks narrowing the educational agenda and limiting children's rights within schools."</p> <p pid="b.187.6/8">Let me turn to how the Bill takes power from parents. The National Children's Bureau has called this a Bill which</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.187.6/9">"chips away at hard-won parental rights".</p> <p pid="b.187.6/10">It removes their ability to challenge decisions about admissions and exclusions and to make local complaints. The Bill abolishes the local admissions forum. ASCL raises concerns that there</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.187.6/11">"may now be a void in policing admissions".</p> <p pid="b.187.6/12">Admissions forums involve local parent representation, governors and heads. They exist to give parents avenues of redress and to help them get a fair deal. As with many provisions in the Bill, their abolition seems at odds with ideas of localism. With no group co-ordinating fair admissions, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASUWT">NASUWT</a> says that there are real risks of increased inequality, back-door selection and covert discrimination.</p> <p pid="b.187.6/13">We welcome the extension of the schools adjudicator's powers in relation to academies and individual cases, but we fear that this move is undermined overall by a weakening of the adjudicator's role and his ability to change admission arrangements. ASCL has said that it is</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.187.6/14">"essential that parents have a well defined route to deal with their grievances relating to admissions" , yet the Bill repeals parents' power to complain to the local commissioner.</p> <p pid="b.187.6/16"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State mentioned <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair">Tony Blair</a> and our reforms. They were all about empowering parents, just as in the health service we empowered patients with guarantees. The Bill strips away those powers from parents. That is why we do not support it.</p>            </div>

It brings me on to the subject of parents whose children have special educational needs or disabilities. Her point is particularly important in respect of such parents. Concerns have been raised about the measures in the Bill disempowering parents in relation to exclusions. The removal of the ability of appeals panels to tell schools to reinstate a pupil who has been expelled has been described by the National Children's Bureau as</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.188.1/2">"counter to the principles of natural justice."</p> <p pid="b.188.1/3">These changes affect the rights of every parent and the life chances of every child, but they have big implications for the most vulnerable.</p> <p pid="b.188.1/4">Parents of children with disabilities and special needs already face a battle to get them a good education. With its changes to admissions and exclusions, which will see schools become judge and jury, the Bill stacks the odds against those children even further. Poor behaviour can arise from a failure to identify or support a child's special needs, yet in future any exclusions that might result will be much harder to challenge.</p> <p pid="b.188.1/5">The changes must also be seen in the context of the diminishing ability of local authority to fund and co-ordinate specialist services that help children facing the biggest challenges. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Committee">Education Committee</a> has noted that some pupils could be left</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.188.1/6">"without access to critical support".</p> <p pid="b.188.1/7">The autism charity, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TreeHouse">TreeHouse</a>, fears that councils will no longer be able to plan services for children with complex needs.</p> <p pid="b.188.1/8">That brings us to a central problem with the Government's rush to reform: the Bill has been brought forward before the long-promised <a href="/glossary/?gl=221" title="A Green Paper is a tentative report of British government proposals without..." class="glossary">Green Paper</a> on special educational needs. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Autistic_Society">National Autistic Society</a> has stated:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.188.1/9">"The impact of certain aspects of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Bill">Education Bill</a> on children with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEN">SEN</a> and disabilities... will not be known until the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Paper">Green Paper</a> has been made public."</p> <p pid="b.188.1/10">That means that the Government are asking Members to vote on these measures without giving them either answers to the questions posed by TreeHouse or the ability to feel sure that the most vulnerable children in their constituencies will not be adversely affected. That is profoundly wrong. It is an abusive process and an affront to this House, but, much worse, it sends a clear message to the parents who are most affected that their children are an afterthought for the Government.</p>            </div>

I was struck yesterday by the comments of my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40079" title="Our page on Frank Field - 'the Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)'">Mr Field</a>, who feels that his report, which was commissioned by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, will be undermined if cuts on such a scale proceed, because the delivery system for early <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> will simply no longer be in place in constituencies throughout the country. Let us remember that this Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> accused the former Prime Minister of trying to scare people about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sure_Start">Sure Start</a>. This Prime Minister said that he would build on Sure Start, but that is yet another broken promise.</p> <p pid="b.191.3/2">Let me turn to how the Bill takes power from the profession. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Secretary">Education Secretary</a> says that he wants to put teachers in the driving seat, but again we see a widening gap between rhetoric and reality. There has been a 10% drop in applications for teacher training this year, which does not say much for his powers of recruitment. The drop has been blamed on his decision not to allow the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_and_Development_Agency_for_Schools">Training and Development Agency for Schools</a> to run its usual advertising and marketing campaigns to attract people to the profession. With the Bill's abolition of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TDA">TDA</a>, teacher training places cut by 14% and most bursaries scrapped, surely we can expect to see teacher shortages in a few years' time.</p> <p pid="b.191.3/3">The Bill restricts teachers' freedoms, undermines the status of their profession, reduces their entitlement to ongoing professional development and fails to protect the rights of support staff. Ongoing development is a hugely important issue for many teachers. The TDA provided a vehicle for identifying the training needs of the profession, and its abolition raises concerns about the future of teacher training and professional development.</p> <p pid="b.191.3/4">The think-tank million+ says that</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.191.3/5">"the TDA avoided teacher training being the subject of political interference", and that</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.191.3/7">"given the current ministerial view", there is a</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.191.3/9">"real danger that teaching as a profession is being downgraded."</p> <p pid="b.191.3/10">Those are its words; that is what million+ says.</p>            </div>

There is a complete lack of transparency and accountability over funding. We know that the Government have set aside &#163;50 million to pay for new free schools, and we know from reports yesterday that about &#163;25 million has been pledged to just two schools. Earlier, the Secretary of State failed to answer a question from my hon.

We know that a further 13 have been given promises of funding, but we do not know how much. Named day questions to Ministers simply go unanswered.

We would not close a good school that was well integrated with its local community and played its part in a local partnership to raise standards. I do not have a dogmatic position, as some of the acolytes of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> like to say. I do not just want to close all free schools and all academies out of spite. That is not my position. If a school was not well integrated with its local community and was not playing its part to raise the standards of all children in the area, of course that would have to be looked at.</p> <p pid="b.194.3/2">In conclusion, last year's Liberal Democrat conference passed a motion supporting the role of local authorities in education and opposing an uneven playing field between schools, where some schools get more funding than others. This centralising Bill is the polar opposite of that motion. As I have shown today, it takes powers from pupils, parents, professionals and the public and leaves a huge democratic deficit in every community. Where are the Lib Dem voices now? Why are they not howling down a Bill that strips local councils of any meaningful role? They seem silent and defeated. This is a battle for the soul of state education. I hope for the sake of young people that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lib_Dems">Lib Dems</a> rediscover some principle and backbone, and stand up to a Bill that grants one man huge power to foist an elitist view of education on everyone.</p> <p pid="b.194.3/3">The vision is of a 1950s curriculum in a 19th-century school system; a free-for-all where parents have no guarantees, where there is a lack of protection for the most vulnerable children, and where for every winner there is a loser. I respect the undoubted passion for education of the Secretary of State, but his is a vision for some children, not all children. In his rush to reform, he is failing to take people with him; he is losing the confidence of head teachers; he is inflicting an ideological experiment on young people, with no pilot schemes, no consultation and no evidence to support it; he is taking power away from parents; and he is gambling with the life chances of our children. Today, in the interests of a fair education system for all, I ask the House to put the brakes on him.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.195.2/1">It is a pleasure to take part in this debate. Last year, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academies_Act_2010">Academies Act 2010</a> flew through Parliament. Today, we are debating the Government's second education Bill, which follows on from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> entitled "The Importance of Teaching". Disraeli told the House 136 years ago:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.195.2/2">"Upon the education of the people of this country the fate of this country depends."-[<a href="/search/?pop=1&s=date:18740615+column:1618+section:debates"><i> Hansard</i>, 15 June 1874; Vol. 219, c. 1618</a>.]</p> <p pid="b.195.2/3">That view was true then; today, it is even more obvious and is shared across the House.</p> <p pid="b.195.2/4">There is a lot to support in the Bill-a lot that even the most opportunistic of Oppositions would struggle to oppose. I welcome the priority given to behaviour and discipline, the subject of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Committee">Education Committee</a>'s first report, which was published last week. Anonymity for teachers prior to criminal charge and clarity about teachers' powers will materially help, as will the more focused brief for Ofsted. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee">The Committee</a> urges the Government to collect appropriate data to monitor the actual, as opposed to the perceived, state of discipline in our schools. I hope that Ministers will think on that.</p> <p pid="b.195.2/5">The emphasis on international comparison is also right. What was the point of the previous Government claiming higher standards at home if, compared with others, our relative position was collapsing? The changes to Ofqual are therefore also correct. The duty on schools to bring in specialist careers advice from outside is hugely welcome. The provision of advice is often woeful and exacerbates pre-existing disadvantage for those who do not have strong family networks. The change is a great move and needs to be extended to academies and free schools. If that cannot happen in the Bill, I should like to hear from Ministers that it will be included in the funding agreement.</p> <p pid="b.195.2/6">Those are all good things, yet I cannot help feeling a little disappointed with the Bill. When I saw "The Importance of Teaching", I thought, "Maybe the Government have got it. Maybe they'll be obsessed with teacher quality above all else", as the research suggests we should be. Attracting, retaining and motivating the brightest and best in teaching is a matter of existential importance to this country's future, and removing the incompetent is likewise essential, so what does the Bill offer on that front? Less than I would like.</p> <p pid="b.195.2/7">We know that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teach_First">Teach First</a>, the highly selective programme to get the brightest graduates into teaching, is being doubled in size, which is extremely welcome. The entry level for teacher training is being raised to a 2:2 degree, and training will be reformed, with a big expansion of school-led initial teacher training, which the Education Committee has welcomed.</p> <p pid="b.195.2/8">However, it seems to me that the biggest challenges are to increase the accountability of teachers and to manage variability both within and between schools. The Government have inherited a performance management system for teachers that is toothless. The so-called social partnership was a surrender to the teaching unions and the producer interest, strangling every effort to put the interests of the child brought up in poverty ahead of those of the well-paid, qualified adult who teaches them. Our professional standards, by which the performance of teachers is judged, were written as much by union leaders as by leaders in education. When will the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> rewrite the professional standards? That cannot be started too soon.</p> <p pid="b.195.2/9">If the Government's promise of autonomy and accountability is to be delivered, we need more than a refocused Ofsted. We need action when children stop progressing in a teacher's class. We need a considered resetting of the rights of the child and the rights of the work force. Where are the provisions in the Bill to ensure that the teachers who do not help pupils to learn cease to teach?</p> <p pid="b.195.2/10">The Government have stressed the importance of autonomy in their proposals for free schools and academies, which I broadly welcome. The best education systems in the world all give their schools and heads a lot of autonomy. However, we need to be wary of concluding that greater autonomy by itself brings higher standards. High-performing leaders tend to demand and be granted more autonomy in any organisation-it is a by-product of top performance rather than an initial driver. In business, a top manager is granted more freedom because of his success. He then uses that freedom further to improve his practice. A management consultant looking at businesses with branches would find that the best-performing branches in a variety of businesses tended to have leaders with greater autonomy from the centre. Observing that, the consultant might conclude that if only all managers had those greater freedoms, standards would necessarily rise elsewhere. I believe that that would be an erroneous judgment. Can Ministers assure me that we are not making that mistake in education?</p> <p pid="b.195.2/11">McKinsey's excellent report, "How the world's most improved schools systems keep getting better", shows that different interventions are required at different stages of school system improvement. Ministers should reflect on its analysis and recognise that in a system as large as England's, one size does not fit all. Will they also expand on the respective roles of competition and co-operation? How will the Government ensure that competition, which is so critical to improvements in the business sector, will not stifle the exchange of best practices that is often so important in the education sector?</p> <p pid="b.195.2/12">I entirely understand why Ministers have proposed what they have proposed on the English baccalaureate-they want to ensure that young people are not put on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a> courses that should be removed for their lack of rigour. However, that rightful <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> does not necessarily mean that one should assume that all courses that are not academic courses are Mickey Mouse courses that lack rigour. Surely we should ensure that we remove inappropriate courses rather than condemn them all. I am concerned that we could end up getting the mix between vocational and academic courses wrong.</p> <p pid="b.195.2/13"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Goodwin">Chris Goodwin</a> is the head teacher of Beverley grammar school in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, which must be one of the highest-performing state schools in the country. Despite its name, it is the oldest state school-and indeed the oldest school-on one site in the country. It is a comprehensive school for boys and it has been found to be outstanding in its last three Ofsted inspections. Chris Goodwin and his team have extreme concerns about the potential impact of the baccalaureate. He said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.195.2/14">"I thought the whole drive of the government is to give power to the Headteachers to enable them to make the right choices for their students. By publishing tables and rating schools in this way, you are placing me, the staff and students in a strait-jacket. We will have no choice but to comply, to the detriment of all concerned...This is ironic, as my entire Senior Team are in favour of a better constructed <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Baccalaureate">English Baccalaureate</a>-just not this one."</p> <p pid="b.195.2/15">I hope the Government remain open minded on that. I absolutely understand their desire for rigour and to make the basic right to a decent academic education an opportunity for everyone in our society, but we must ensure that vocational and other courses that schools often use are not squeezed out by the baccalaureate, thus undermining so much of the good work in many of our schools.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.197.0/1">I worked in the child protection field for many years before entering the House, and I am chair of the all-party group on child protection, so I intend to confine my remarks to the parts of the Bill that affect the protection of children.</p> <p pid="b.197.0/2">I welcome the fact that the Bill will not repeal the safeguarding duties on schools-the duty to protect and promote the welfare of children. I understand that that was considered, and I am glad that- following pressure from organisations such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Society">National Society</a> for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, supported by a number of hon. Members on both sides of the House-the Government recognised that it was a bad idea. It is vital that schools continue to be safe place in which children can learn and grow.</p> <p pid="b.197.0/3">Schools have a moral duty to keep children safe, and it is often the teacher to whom a child first turns for help when he or she faces problems at home. In my experience, it was often someone at school-a class teacher or a school nurse-who identified children at risk and monitored the well-being of those considered to be at risk.</p> <p pid="b.197.0/4">The Government say that they will remove duties and statutory guidance that create burdens for schools. A duty of child protection is not a burden but an expectation that parents and communities rightly have of schools. I am concerned about two measures in the Bill: the repeal of the requirement to give 24 hours' notice of detention, and changes to the powers of teachers to search children.</p> <p pid="b.197.0/5"><a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 5 amends section 92 of the Education Inspections Act 2006 by removing the requirement to give a parent or carer a minimum of 24 hours' written notice that their child is required to attend detention outside normal school hours. That has been trumpeted by the Government as a major step that will help to revolutionise discipline in schools, but I believe that they are wrong. Since the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> first spoke of such a measure in the Chamber, other hon. Members and I have raised the matter on a number of occasions and received unsatisfactory responses that show a staggering disregard for the safety of children.</p> <p pid="b.197.0/6">When I wrote to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> to set out my concerns, I received a reply from the Minister that did not even attempt to address the issues that I had raised. Unfortunately, there seems to be a great reluctance on the part of the Government to respond to child protection concerns. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under-Secretary_of_State_for_the_Home_Department">Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department</a>, <a href="/mp/?m=40321" title="Our page on Lynne Featherstone - 'the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone)'">Lynne Featherstone</a>, cancelled a meeting with the all-party group on child protection at 24 hours' notice only this week.</p> <p pid="b.197.0/7">Significant research tells us that often, schools are unaware of the responsibilities of young carers.</p>            </div>

Do they collect a younger sibling from their school, or do they disobey the teacher? That could result in a younger brother or sister being left to wait alone, or they could decide to walk home on their own in the dark. Surely the Government should be reasonable.

It is perfectly acceptable to give 24 hours' notice, as it will allow parents to make other arrangements for travel or to arrange for a neighbour or other family member to stay at home to provide cover. Anything else would be unacceptable."-[<i> Official Report, <a href="/glossary/?gl=248" title="In a normal session there are up to ten standing committees on bills. Each..." class="glossary">Standing Committee</a> E, </i><phrase class="date" code="2006-05-10">10 May 2006</phrase>; c. 856.]</p> <p pid="b.198.3/4">That spokesperson is now the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of State, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Education">Department for Education</a>, <a href="/mp/?m=40113" title="Our page on Sarah Teather - 'the hon. Member for Brent Central (Sarah Teather)'">Sarah Teather</a>, and she carries the responsibility as Children's Minister. She should hold to that position.</p> <p pid="b.198.3/5">At the very least, if the 24-hours' notice period is to be removed, why are the Government not inserting a requirement to notify parents and carers before a detention takes place? Many schools regularly text or e-mail parents and carers. If schools need to give more immediate detentions to bolster discipline, as the Government believe they do, that should not happen at the expense of children's safety. Hon. Members should be able to agree that the safety of children comes first, so I ask the Minister to introduce an appropriate <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> in Committee.</p> <p pid="b.198.3/6"><a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 2 specifically allows a teacher of the opposite gender to search a pupil in situations of urgency, and-crucially-when no other teacher is present. That raises a number of concerns, certainly in respect of the protection of children, but also because it creates risks for the teacher involved. The Children's Rights Alliance is also alarmed by the relaxation of safeguards for children being searched.</p> <p pid="b.198.3/7">My understanding is that such searches should happen only when a member of staff believes that there is a risk that serious harm will be caused if they do not conduct the search, and when it is not practicable for the search to be carried out by a member of staff of the same sex as the pupil, or for the search to be witnessed by another member of staff. Frankly, I am struggling to think of a scenario in which the search of a pupil by a member of staff of a different gender without witnesses would be the right thing to do. Obtaining the assistance of other staff members, or indeed contacting the police, would surely be the way to go.</p> <p pid="b.198.3/8">Can the Minister explain how that power will make a positive difference in schools? It appears to many that introducing that power could open teachers to more allegations of inappropriate behaviour, not fewer. Organisations who work with children in care have raised concerns that children who have already been physically or sexually abused would experience such a search as yet further abuse. That could lead to further trauma for them, which is surely the last thing we want.</p> <p pid="b.198.3/9">The Children's Rights Alliance has other concerns. It believes that such searches constitute a significant intrusion into children's privacy. Intrusions must be shown to be necessary and proportionate to be lawful. However, as well as giving extensive rights to search the individual child, the Bill enables staff to look through phones, laptops and other devices, and to delete information</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.198.3/10">"if the person thinks there is a good reason to do so".</p> <p pid="b.198.3/11">I am puzzled as to why that detail is in the Bill. Perhaps the Minister can address that. Surely such issues would more appropriately be dealt with in guidance, which can be reconsidered and amended if necessary.</p> <p pid="b.198.3/12">We all want good discipline in schools. A school with good discipline allows children better to learn, but it is also a safer place for children. However, I ask the Government to look again at those two measures. It appears to me that they are posturing and talking tough. Schools should protect the most vulnerable children, such as young carers and children who have been abused, but the two measures risk doing the exact opposite. Please think again.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.200.0/1">I share the aspirations and passion of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> to improve standards for all our children and young people, and I welcome the proposals to improve discipline in our schools, to tackle bullying of all types and to protect teachers from false allegations. Of course I also feel that head teachers need the freedom to exercise their professional judgment.</p> <p pid="b.200.0/2">The Bill contains some welcome proposals, and some others that merit close scrutiny at later stages. For me, the most important part of improving standards is investing in early years in order to get the foundations right. I hope that the commitment to, and funding for, free pre-school provision for disadvantaged two-year-olds will be welcomed across the House. Research shows that good quality early-childhood services have wide-ranging benefits for children, particularly disadvantaged children. That obviously helps disadvantaged children with their development, and speech and language skills, which are vital as they progress through later schooling.</p> <p pid="b.200.0/3">In 2010, the latest findings from the effective provision of pre-school education research project were that children aged 11 still showed benefits from attendance at high quality pre-schools, which emphasises the importance of high quality provision. With the cutbacks, however, we have to keep the focus on driving up the quality of pre-school education. I also agree with Save the Children that local authorities should be asked to publish the proportion of free early places for disadvantaged two-year-olds taken up in good or outstanding settings.</p> <p pid="b.200.0/4">I commend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> for achieving the universal free entitlement of up to 15 hours for three and four-year-olds, and for achieving that very high take-up. However, we still face the conflicting problems of cost, quality, quantity and sustainability-we will face those challenges throughout. It is important in early years to establish the joy of learning, so I hope that any reforms we make will encourage it throughout schooling-and through life, really.</p> <p pid="b.200.0/5">I want to comment, however, on a few clauses that concern me and on which I would like reassurance. I am particularly concerned about the removal of the duty to co-operate with local authorities. I have been involved in many Bill Committees concerned with legislation for children and young people, and I have always felt that schools have to be included-I think that my coalition partners felt that too. I can understand that people might be concerned about unnecessary bureaucracy for schools and colleges, and I can see a case for reviewing how that provision is working in practice, but a repeal with no obvious measure to fill the gap concerns me greatly.</p> <p pid="b.200.0/6">Like <a href="/mp/?m=40529" title="Our page on Meg Munn - 'the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn)'">Meg Munn</a>, I am deeply concerned about child protection. When I read through a serious case review that went back some years, I noticed that spattered throughout were cases in which teachers had not reported incidents. I worry, therefore, about taking away that duty, about the possibility of child protection being overlooked and about teachers not taking on their full responsibilities. I am also concerned about removing the duty to co-operate in respect of looked-after children, young carers, children with parents in prison and children with special needs. How can we ensure co-operation between schools, local authorities and other vital services for our vulnerable young people without something being put in place? I hope that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will tell us what that something is.</p>            </div>

Lady's professional knowledge, only that of the limited serious case reviews I have had the opportunity to see. It is vital that everybody concerned with children is looking out for their protection.</p> <p pid="b.201.1/2">I am equally concerned about removing the requirement on maintained schools in England to have regard to the children and young people's plans. Obviously, the provision for vulnerable children within the plans is really important. I have even greater concerns about special educational needs. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Autistic_Society">National Autistic Society</a> points out that where services are not co-ordinated, children may undergo tens of assessments, and essential support can be delayed. Parents have reported the constant battles they face to get all the services that their children need. I believe that by working together we can reduce bureaucracy and costs, but I remain concerned about the removal of duties on schools to co-operate and to have regard to the children and young people's plans.</p> <p pid="b.201.1/3">During the passage of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Act_2009">Autism Act 2009</a>, which was sponsored by <a href="/mp/?m=40164" title="Our page on Cheryl Gillan - 'the right hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan)'">Mrs Gillan</a>, and which I was pleased to support throughout, the previous Government committed themselves to ensuring that the needs of children with autism would be supported locally through children and young people's plans. How will the Government ensure that these needs are recognised and met locally?</p> <p pid="b.201.1/4">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Education challenged the belief of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> in local authorities. I believe strongly that local authorities should play an important strategic role in the provision of high quality education in their local areas, and that they should play a pivotal role in ensuring that other related services necessary for a child's well-being work together effectively.</p> <p pid="b.201.1/5">I am concerned not only about removing the duty to co-operate but about the abolition of admissions forums and the reduction in the role of the schools adjudicator. I welcome the extension of the adjudicator's role to academies, but I think that the ability to look at a whole school admissions policy when responding to a particular complaint has brought many benefits. I would hope that we all want to promote fair admissions to schools, but I seek reassurance from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>: if we are to reduce the role of the adjudicator and get rid of admissions forums, how are we to monitor the situation and ensure that admissions policies are administered fairly at a local level? I sincerely seek answers from him, because these are important aspects of the Bill-they are important across the board for disadvantaged young people, children with special educational needs and looked-after children.</p> <p pid="b.201.1/6">With those comments, I would like to emphasise that local authorities have a strategic role to play. I would not want to return to the old-style model for local authorities, but I do think that they have a role to play, and if we are to take away some of their powers, we need to know what will be put in their place.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.202.0/1">I say to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> that on reflection nothing is ever quite as good or bad as we think it is: I was not as good a Secretary of State as I thought I was, and I have a feeling that the right hon. Gentleman is not quite as bad as I think he is-at least I hope he is not.</p> <p pid="b.202.0/2">The Bill is a mixture of incrementalism, with which I agree, contradiction, with which I do not, historical misinterpretation, downright old-fashioned conservatism and, with the exception of <a href="/mp/?m=40395" title="Our page on Annette Brooke - 'the hon. Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)'">Annette Brooke</a>, complete humiliation for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>, who have been against most of the things in the Bill, but who now have to vote for it.</p> <p pid="b.202.0/3">On incrementalism, as the Secretary of State managed to get across several times in his 52-minute speech, there is clearly much in the Bill with which the Labour party can agree and which in fact we put in place. However, there are major contradictions, one of which is that the more academies and free schools we have, the less the Secretary of State's prescriptions on the curriculum, which he laid down this afternoon, will actually apply. In fact, I thought at one stage this afternoon that the Secretary of State was going to lay down a menu for all school meals that would have sweet and sour from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, a little tortilla from Mexico and rolled herrings from Sweden, and would be dictated by the Secretary of State, so that nobody missed out on the five portions of fruit and veg required every day, because that is how he is coming across.</p> <p pid="b.202.0/4">There has been a complete misunderstanding of the historic mission of providing diversity and flexibility. We would all agree on having the highest quality world-class headship and top-class teaching in the classroom, but the Secretary of State went into great detail this afternoon, picking out a bit of the curriculum here and a bit there from across the world, indicating that schools would have to teach certain things to reach a particular configuration-an indigestible menu that will in fact not be manageable by most schools. I therefore ask the Secretary of State to think again. He should by all means build on the progress that has been made, learn from the mistakes that we made and transfer genuine power to heads and teachers, but he should not pretend that he is doing that when he is doing exactly the opposite.</p> <p pid="b.202.0/5">Another contradiction that I have noticed over the past few days is the way in which the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has indicated that we should have a sense of identity inculcated in our schooling system and our society. I do not disagree with that-indeed, I have put that in place on a number of occasions, both in education and at the Home Office-but we cannot have that at the same time as seeking to abolish citizenship from the curriculum. If we really want to ensure that we have a sense of belonging and mutuality together, and that we understand our history, we need more than simply the teaching of historical figures, so that we can understand how our world works and how people find their place in it.</p> <p pid="b.202.0/6">Above all, my worry about this Bill is the sheer politicisation involved. The power placed in the hands of the Secretary of State, with the abolition of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualifications_and_Curriculum_Development_Agency">Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency</a>, is a worrying factor. Let us just imagine for a moment what our media, including our beloved <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC">BBC</a>, would have done if we had abolished the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QCDA">QCDA</a> and the Training and Development Agency, and placed their powers directly in the hands of a Labour Secretary of State. It would have been on the "Today" programme every morning, with somebody, probably from Real Education-it would probably have been the former inspector, Chris Woodhead-parading themselves, saying what a dastardly thing it all was, yet here we have a Conservative Secretary of State politicising the education curriculum and the education service.</p> <p pid="b.202.0/7">This is not just about central administration; it is about an hegemony that can be seen throughout, with the politicisation of our life more generally. In each area-it is most heavily writ large in the case of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Communities_and_Local_Government">Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government</a>, matched only by the current <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education">Secretary of State for Education</a>-the parade is of freedom and localism, while the measures are about centralisation and diktat, and this goes right across the board. I fear that as the Government preach freedom, they take away the rights, as has already been described, of those who should be driving the system, namely the parents of the children concerned. Taking away rights in respect of the adjudicator and sheer fairness, as well as the right to have one's voice heard and to get redress, will lead either to the courts or to complete disillusionment. Either way, that is a bad outcome for the education system.</p> <p pid="b.202.0/8">As we are dealing with a Bill that includes a real rate of interest for students under the new fees system, which will create difficulties and have a dangerous impact on access, it is worth reflecting on the fact that Cambridge university has today announced that it will be charging the full &#163;9,000 fee, because it believes that the demolition of the contribution from the Government-the taxpayer-towards teaching makes it impossible to do otherwise. The whole Bill could have been about building on progress made, learning the lessons or drawing down on world-class experience; instead, it is about-</p>            </div>

It is unlikely to be remembered as one of the great education reform <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a>-such as, arguably, the Bills of 1988 and 1944-but the sum of this Bill is probably much greater than its parts; and, if we add the changes that have already been pushed through in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academies_Act_2010">Academies Act 2010</a>, it is likely that this Government will have a claim to be remembered as a really radical reformer of education. For all the arguments that we have heard-and will hear again-against this Bill, few would disagree with the broad principles that lie behind it. Those principles are about devolving power down to schools; ensuring that exams reach the highest possible standards internationally; improving social mobility; and reducing the bureaucratic burden on schools, allowing the quality of teaching and leadership to flower, which, as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroness_Morgan">Baroness Morgan</a>, the new chair of Ofsted, has said, is the bedrock of any successful school.</p> <p pid="b.204.0/2">Crucially for me, what this Bill has at its core is support for teachers. I particularly welcome the measures aimed at strengthening the power of teachers to maintain school discipline. We all know how one badly behaved child can threaten the prospects of all the pupils in a class if they are not dealt with firmly and quickly. The national statistics are quite shocking. Every day, nearly 1,000 children are excluded from school for abuse or assault against staff or fellow pupils. Major assaults on staff have reached a five-year high. Good teachers are leaving the profession because of bad behaviour, while talented graduates are discouraged from coming into teaching owing to fears for their safety. Across Reading in 2008-09, we had 390 suspensions for assaults and abuse, which is equivalent to two exclusions for every school day in the last recorded year. Why should we expect teachers to put up with that? We would not expect any other profession to put up with such violence.</p> <p pid="b.204.0/3">Put simply, the substantial improvement in pupil attainment that all Members across this House wish to see will not be possible unless we give schools all the help that we can to set and maintain school discipline. Rules imposed by the previous, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> deliberately made it more difficult for schools to expel pupils, undermining the authority of head teachers. By contrast, the measures in this Bill will ensure that we get adult authority back into schools. The fact that exclusion review panels will no longer be able to enforce the reinstatement of disruptive pupils will help to set boundaries for acceptable behaviour and ensure that teachers are not second-guessed all the time. The new powers on detentions and searching for items banned under school rules will help to give the necessary legal backing to enforce school rules whenever that is needed.</p> <p pid="b.204.0/4">Pupils go to school to learn. That must be our message to parents, pupils and teachers. I am confident that the long-overdue measures in the Bill will considerably reinforce teachers' authority in schools. But action on discipline on its own will not be enough to drive the vast improvement that we need to see in England's schools. The latest <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> report, the "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment">Programme for International Student Assessment</a>", made it clear that, under Labour, schools in England plummeted down the international league tables. As we have heard from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>, we went from seventh to 25th in reading, from eighth to 28th in maths and from fourth to 16th in science.</p> <p pid="b.204.0/5">This trend is deeply worrying for our economic future. Reading was recently named in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_Cities">Centre for Cities</a>' "Cities Outlook 2011" as one of the five cities best placed for a private sector-led recovery. Among the major local employers are international companies that require a highly skilled work force. In information technology, for example, Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco and Symantec all have important headquarters in Reading. To ensure that those employers continue to feel that Britain is the best place in which to run major parts of their operations and to enable them to draw on the skilled work force that they need, we must take every possible step to ensure that we reverse the decline, relative to other countries, and strive to get to the top once again. To do anything else would be to sell future generations short.</p> <p pid="b.204.0/6">I welcome the provisions in the Bill that will require Ofqual to compare standards in England with others internationally. I also welcome the proposals to give the Government the power to require schools to make themselves accountable to international surveys.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.205.1/1">I thank the Select Committee Chairman for his question. Of course technical skills will be important, and I hope that university technical colleges will play an important role in that regard. I shall return to that point in a minute.</p> <p pid="b.205.1/2">Rigour is absolutely essential, but we must not lose sight of the fact that not every pupil is right for university and the academic route. There has been a danger in recent weeks that all the emphasis might be placed on academic subjects and academic achievement. I have no doubt that that emphasis might be necessary temporarily while we are changing the prevailing philosophy that has surrounded education over the past decade, and, yes, we need academic rigour, but we also need alternative, equally valid and equally celebrated pathways in education. However, this should not come down to pushing some young people towards easier subjects, which is what the previous Government did. We have to find different ways of teaching and learning. I am looking forward to the findings of the review on vocational qualifications that is being led by the excellent Professor Alison Wolf. Unfortunately, they were not available in time for this debate, which was disappointing.</p> <p pid="b.205.1/3">I welcome the Government's support for initiatives such as university technical colleges under the academies and free schools programme. UTCs, as championed by the endlessly energetic <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Baker">Lord Baker</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Dearing_Educational_Trust">Baker Dearing Educational Trust</a>, offer 14 to 19-year-olds the opportunity to take a highly regarded, technically oriented course of study at a specialist college that is equipped to the highest standards. Those colleges specialise in subjects that require particular, modern equipment, and local employers, large and small, are asked to help to shape the specialist curriculum. The colleges offer a promising way of engaging young people through a different type of teaching, which is, as the name suggests, more technical in its orientation. They do not neglect the academic subjects, however, and they also help to ensure that local employers continue to have the skilled work force they need.</p> <p pid="b.205.1/4">I welcome the priority given to academies in the establishment of new schools. This builds on the previous Government's most successful reform programme, which in turn built on the success of city technology colleges. Academies are a proven success story, with their academic performance improving at almost twice the rate of other state schools. In 2009-10, the proportion of pupils in academies achieving the expected level at GCSE of five A* to C grades, including in English and maths, increased by 7.4 points on the previous year, compared with an increase of 4.1 points across all maintained schools. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> has concluded that</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.205.1/5">"in countries where schools have greater autonomy over what is taught and how students are assessed, students tend to perform better".</p> <p pid="b.205.1/6">Labour Members might not like the reforms, but teachers and parents in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> do. Three schools in Reading have already become academies, and all the secondary schools there will probably have converted by the end of next year. The number of proposals for new free schools is rising at what the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> might regard as an alarming rate. There is clearly an appetite among parents and professionals for our policies. With the extra priority being given to academies in the Bill, Reading might finally be relieved of the absurd situation in which Reading children cross into neighbouring local authority areas in search of good schools while pupils from other local authorities cross into Reading to attend what are successful but almost regional grammar schools. The quality of schools should not depend on the local authority in which they are situated. The measures in the Bill will give head teachers more freedom to determine what goes on in their schools and greater powers to drive improvement, wherever they might be. As such, I welcome these measures as a step in the right direction.</p>            </div>

In spite of what the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> claims, many of its measures are grossly unfair, and I will not support it. It is full of rhetoric promising to devolve power to families and professionals, but the reality is quite different, with many parts of the Bill actually centralising power. As we have already heard, it will make it impossible for parents to challenge decisions about admissions, as well as limiting the choice of subjects that teachers can offer their students and denying communities the opportunities that can be gained by schools working together in partnership.</p> <p pid="b.206.0/2">From early-years provision to students aspiring to higher education, the Bill restricts educational opportunity. With one hand, it extends free entitlement for early education and child care, which I support, yet with the other it removes the need for local authorities to ensure that there is enough quality child care available in their area. The Bill proposes to allow maintained nursery schools and classes to charge for any early-years provision above the 15-hour entitlement. That, in conjunction with the early-years single funding formula that will come into force in April, will have a devastating impact on settings that currently provide free full-time places for disadvantaged children.</p> <p pid="b.206.0/3">More than 3,500 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sure_Start">Sure Start</a> children's centres were opened under Labour, offering a range of early-years, health and parental support services to more than 2.5 million children and their families. Yesterday, we heard the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of State, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Education">Department for Education</a>, <a href="/mp/?m=40113" title="Our page on Sarah Teather - 'the hon. Member for Brent Central (Sarah Teather)'">Sarah Teather</a> edge her way round the question of whether Sure Start children's centres would continue to remain open and to offer every child the best start in life, or whether hundreds would close, as the survey carried out by 4Children and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daycare_Trust">Daycare Trust</a> predicts. In my own <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, Sure Start workers are already being made redundant. It is no good saying that early-years education is important, only to take away the funding so that parents cannot access it.</p> <p pid="b.206.0/4">The damage that will be done to early-years education by cutting the grants for Sure Start is just the start; every parent worries about getting their child into the school of their choice. Yet these proposals will make it harder, not easier, for parents to choose what is right for their child, as free schools and academies squeeze money out of the funding for schools in their area. Similarly, the proposals on admissions will mean that parents will struggle to fight for what their child needs. <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 34 removes the requirement for local authorities to establish an admission forum.</p> <p pid="b.206.0/5">Even if a child can get into the school that the parents want, the way in which the Secretary of State is narrowing the national curriculum will make it harder for children to achieve. He claims that he wants to consult parents and teachers on what should be taught, but by limiting the English baccalaureate he seems already to have made up his mind that it should be quite restrictive. How can I say to a young person from my constituency that it is more important for them to learn Latin than to be able to use a computer, especially when 10% of our gross domestic product is generated from the online economy? That simply does not make sense.</p> <p pid="b.206.0/6">With the axing of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Schools_for_the_Future">Building Schools for the Future</a> and the promise that it gave to every child, including those in my constituency, of the learning environment that they need to succeed, it is most worrying that the Bill still fails to define the capital funding that will be available for free schools and academies. The so-called academy conversions are another example of co-operation and partnership working between schools being undermined by this Government, with federated schools being able to apply to become an academy without any discussion with other schools.</p> <p pid="b.206.0/7">My final point relates to part 8 on student finance, which my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40527" title="Our page on David Blunkett - 'the Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough (Mr Blunkett)'">Mr Blunkett</a> mentioned. This is like the small print of a dodgy contract: it is almost hidden, yet it proposes to remove the cap on student loan interest rates. In effect, this will allow profit to be made out of student debt. With the trebling of tuition fees, this is another example of the Government's unfairness, kicking away the ladders of opportunity from our most disadvantaged young people.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.208.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this important education debate. My wife is a primary school teacher; my sister is a secondary school teacher; and my mother-in-law devoted her career to primary school children with special educational needs. I understand the challenges that many teachers in the school system face daily. However, that understanding does not give me the right to tell teachers how to do their jobs. That is why this Bill is so important. It gives power back to teachers and head teachers to take the decisions on how to deliver the best education for the children in their classrooms.</p> <p pid="b.208.0/2">Everybody remembers a good teacher, and every teacher wants to see their class grow up, develop and get the best possible start in life. Teachers love to excite and inspire children to learn so that they can enjoy a journey of lifelong learning from the primary school classroom to the boardroom. Unfortunately, many children are left behind. The highest early-year achievers from deprived backgrounds are overtaken by lower-achieving children from advantaged backgrounds by the age of seven-and the gap gets larger as the poorer students get older. For example, the primary school in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> with 40% of children on free school meals has only 64% achieving level 4 at key stage 2, when they are 10 or 11. The primary school in my constituency with only 4% of children on free school meals has 90% achieving level 4 at key stage 2. It is unacceptable that children from poorer backgrounds are allowed to fall further behind year after year.</p> <p pid="b.208.0/3">A good education is the best route out of poverty. I fully support the Bill's provisions to introduce free early-years learning for disadvantaged two-year-olds and the pupil premium. These massive investments in the poorest children in our society will help spread fairness throughout our education system and lift children out of poverty. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF">UNICEF</a> currently ranks the UK as 13th out of 24 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> countries for educational inequality, but it is not possible to lift children out of poverty if we measure only poverty of income. Poverty of education is an equally important factor, as it leads to a poverty of opportunity and aspiration in later life.</p> <p pid="b.208.0/4">Before I briefly mention some of the opportunities provided by the Bill to transform educational achievement in Stevenage, I would like to make three quick points, to which I hope Ministers will be able to respond-in a little more detail, of course, in Committee. First, I fully support the introduction of a reading test for all six-year-olds so that parents know how their child is doing. However, I ask that an element of comprehension be included in this test. Many children and adults-including myself on many occasions-can often read a word, but without fully understanding its meaning, so they cannot use it correctly in a sentence. A little reassurance that the new reading test will have an element to demonstrate that children understand the meaning of the words they are reading would be welcome.</p> <p pid="b.208.0/5">Secondly, many hon. Members will speak on the huge benefits that children and schools will obtain by converting to academies. However, will the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> consider providing a little more clarification for those education authorities concerned about their responsibilities for casual admissions throughout the school year?</p> <p pid="b.208.0/6">My final query is whether the pupil premium will be available to children currently in care. One of the saddest facts that I am aware of is that only 15% of children in care achieve five A to C grades at GCSE, compared with an average of 70% of all children in the UK.</p> <p pid="b.208.0/7">I do not want to take up too much time, as many other Members want to contribute. In my final few minutes, however, I want to highlight some of the exciting developments taking place in Stevenage as a result of the freedoms that the Bill will give to schools. Plans to convert to academies are, of course, already under way. There are also discussions going on about the possibility of what we are calling an "educational village"-a school that provided full through-schooling for children from the age of four to 19. As one head teacher put it, it will allow for controlling the supply chain of the children coming through, so that the standards of the children are well known and can be developed. It should provide greater understanding of what the children are likely to achieve later in life.</p> <p pid="b.208.0/8">My local college is looking at developing a vocational school for 14 to 19-year-olds, which is also called a university technical college. My constituency is also fortunate in having within it the headquarters of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution_of_Engineering_and_Technology">Institution of Engineering and Technology</a>, which I know is working with university technical colleges throughout the country to develop those schemes.</p> <p pid="b.208.0/9">The most exciting prospect for me is that the Stevenage educational trust has been established this month. This is a charity set up by local head teachers, which is developing the idea of taking on the extended services that they consider important to educational provision in Stevenage. My ultimate aim for this charity-and, I hope, the aim of the head teachers-is that it will take over the responsibilities that will be devolved from the local education authority and allow solutions that are more focused on the needs of the children in a single town rather than across a widespread geographical area. It will be able to have an educational psychologist looking after the children in a particular small area rather than on a county basis.</p> <p pid="b.208.0/10">Finally, I would like to end by quoting <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Marshall">Patrick Marshall</a>, the head teacher of Marriotts secondary school in Stevenage, who told me:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.208.0/11">"The Government's new reforms for education have meant that I have more freedom to target specific resources to the young people and families I know are in most need. My accountability is now transferred to my local community rather than centralised targets, which have in the past dictated the delivery of services at a local level".</p> <p pid="b.208.0/12">I very much look forward to voting for this Bill, which promises to lift educational attainment for the poorest children in my area.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.209.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow the measured speech of <a href="/mp/?m=40576" title="Our page on Stephen McPartland - 'the hon. Member for Stevenage (Stephen McPartland)'">Stephen McPartland</a>. Let me say first that I support many aspects of the Bill and will not join my colleagues in opposing it tonight. A number of issues can be clarified and corrected in Committee. One important issue that I feel should be looked at again is the whole question of support staff, who are so important in any school. I am not sure that the issue has been looked at carefully enough. It is the sort of matter that should be probed in Committee.</p> <p pid="b.209.0/2">I welcome the abolition of the Training and Development Agency and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Teaching_Council">General Teaching Council</a> for England. I welcome the fact that we can finally get back to having a <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> who has to take responsibility and has to be accountable to this Parliament for what happens in education. I also welcome the fact that the Bill makes it clear that trainee teachers who do not meet the required standards should face termination of employment. As I said earlier, for too long we have tolerated poor performance in the teaching profession and we have been afraid to be honest to those who simply are not good enough. For me, there is no more important profession than that of educating the next generation. We need to foster a culture of excellence, not of complacency. As many have pointed out, we would not tolerate a pilot who had a questionable record in flying and we would not go to a doctor who always gets a diagnosis wrong. Why, then, should we accept a teacher who we know does not deliver for her children?</p> <p pid="b.209.0/3">There are many good schools in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, but one in particular has always taken that sort of approach to teacher training-the Durand school, now the Durand academy. Durand spent years fighting the local authority, Lambeth council because it refused to accept anything less than great teaching for its school. For more than 16 years, the school has had innovative social entrepreneurship under its belt, under the inspirational leadership of the executive head, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Martin">Greg Martin</a> and the head, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_McLaughlin">Mark McLaughlin</a>. It has gone from being a failing school to an outstanding one. It has built on-site accommodation for teachers who are new to London; it has a health club with special rates for parents; and it has truly self-helped.</p> <p pid="b.209.0/4">Durand has been creative in showing how a school can use its property assets for social good, and I would encourage other schools to do the same. Through its own endeavours it bought 19 acres in Sussex, in the constituency of <a href="/mp/?m=40166" title="Our page on Andrew Tyrie - 'the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)'">Mr Tyrie</a>. It was formerly the site of a grade <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II">II</a> listed private school and then a local education authority special school. It is the most amazing of locations, where Durand wants to open the first truly free-of-charge state boarding school, offering the best possible educational experience to inner-city teenagers.</p> <p pid="b.209.0/5">The intake of the Durand primary school in Stockwell is extremely diverse: 95% of children come from black or ethnic minority backgrounds; more than 50% are on free school meals; and more than 40% live in overcrowded households. Despite those statistics, the quality of attainment, behaviour and attitude at the school is impeccable. It is an outstanding school, which has proved time and again that a low-income background need not mean low expectations for children. It is built on hugely important leadership.</p> <p pid="b.209.0/6">Children leave Durand at the age of 11, and many subsequently fail to achieve five good <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCSEs">GCSEs</a>. Last year children leaving Durand were transferred to 20 different secondary schools, many outside the borough and many of poor quality. It is to be hoped that at the end of the current school year, if the right decisions are made and if the system proves successful, children will stay on in the middle school and, at the age of 13, will board between Monday morning and Friday afternoon. That will enable them to retain links with their community, and will allow their families-many of whom live in overcrowded accommodation-to see them receive the best possible education while also benefiting from the extra time that boarding schools provide for sport and the other extracurricular activities that are so rarely found in inner-city areas such as mine.</p> <p pid="b.209.0/7">Parents want choice. They want the best, and they do not see why the best should be available, or offered, only to those who can pay or who come from the most affluent areas. That cannot be right. Labour Members need to be honest. For a long time we have espoused the benefits of academies as one part of a broad system of education. Academy status has given proven successful schools such as Durand the freedom that they need in order to develop education and tailor it in accordance with their intake, helping each and every child to reach its full potential. Parents want those options: they recognise that one size does not fit all, and that local authorities do not have all the answers. There have been many struggles involving my local authority, which wanted to impose a straitjacket on its schools to ensure that they were all the same.</p> <p pid="b.209.0/8">As a former grammar school girl, I feel strongly that my party must not lose ownership of aspiration. In the past month, my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40373" title="Our page on Stephen Twigg - 'the Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg)'">Stephen Twigg</a> hosted an event in the House on behalf of Progress, which reached the same conclusion. For a number of years many of my hon. Friends supported the views of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Adonis">Lord Adonis</a> of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden_Town">Camden Town</a>, and we are familiar with his views on much of the Bill. My constituent Katharine Birbalsingh-who may be better known for speaking at a Conservative party conference but who is a brilliant teacher, as will be clear to anyone who meets and talks to her-has shown the same willingness to believe that every child can aspire to and, indeed, reach the top. I am proud that she is my constituent, because what she says and writes is based entirely on the reality of what is happening in many inner-city schools.</p> <p pid="b.209.0/9">We must be honest, and reflect the views of all involved in education and teaching rather than just those of the unions. Theirs is an important voice, but it is not the only one. I want us to speak for the family of the child from Myatt's Fields estate in Stockwell who wants to reach for the stars-for the family who want for their child the options that are available to a child from the richest family in the land. I want us to speak up for the silent <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a>, who are often without a voice.</p> <p pid="b.209.0/10">If the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Bill">Education Bill</a> helps schools like Durand which pride themselves on great teaching to become a model for others to follow, I welcome it; if the Education Bill helps schools like Durand which insist on good discipline to enforce that discipline, I welcome it; and if the Education Bill helps schools like Durand which want to open a new secondary state boarding school for disadvantaged children to deliver that, I welcome it, and urge its adoption.</p>            </div>

I shall speak as briefly as possible so that other can contribute, but, if time allows, I shall touch on the subjects of early-years provision, academies and apprenticeships.</p> <p pid="b.211.0/2">Why is early-years provision so important at this time? In my view it is a critical element in the Bill, because evidence increasingly suggests that it will become more crucial than ever in determining outcomes. A couple of weeks ago, in a debate initiated by Government Members-in the context of reports presented by <a href="/mp/?m=40079" title="Our page on Frank Field - 'the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)'">Mr Field</a> and <a href="/mp/?m=40461" title="Our page on Graham Allen - 'the hon. Member for Nottingham North (Mr Allen)'">Mr Allen</a>-the House benefited from speeches that demonstrated a wealth of experience in relation to early-years provision and early <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> in particular.</p> <p pid="b.211.0/3">I believe that in providing 15 hours a week for disadvantaged children, the Government are taking a stand and making an active contribution. As a child protection lawyer, I encountered many cases whose outcomes jeopardised children and put them at risk. The situation was very delicate in such cases, and a central issue was what would happen to the children during those early years. Problems arose in relation to young children's attachments to carers and other adults, which, in my view, were likely to determine their long-term educational and socio-economic prospects. I applaud that aspect of the Bill, and was reassured to hear from <a href="/mp/?m=40361" title="Our page on Andy Burnham - 'the right hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)'">Andy Burnham</a> that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> supported it.</p> <p pid="b.211.0/4">The provisions for academies, which amend provisions in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academies_Act_2010">Academies Act 2010</a>, offer some schools an exciting and positive future. They may not be appropriate for every school in Erewash, but we are fortunate in that three of our schools are seeking academy status and in each I see strong leadership, committed governors, and members of a school unit working to achieve better outcomes for children not just in their own schools, but in all the schools in their community.</p>            </div>

Friend-of course we should support a school that makes that important decision, if it is right for the school. As I have said, I have seen great leadership from head teachers throughout my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> who, having made their decision, have worked to gain the support of the whole school unit: parents, governors and the local community.</p> <p pid="b.212.1/2">At Long Eaton school, which has perhaps travelled furthest towards achieving academy status, I have seen leadership and encouragement on the part of the head teacher and staff. I have been concerned by the distribution by trade unions of leaflets containing scare stories and negative comments about what the school has been trying to achieve, but I believe that their efforts have been unsuccessful. Now the scare stories have started again in regard to Bennerley school in Ilkeston, and I support the actions of the head teacher, the staff, the pupils and the school community in standing firm. If their decision is right for them, they should not be bullied by unions or anyone else.</p> <p pid="b.212.1/3">I want to mention a third school, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Hallam">Kirk Hallam</a> community technology and sports college. It is also in Ilkeston, in a more socially and economically deprived part of my constituency. For decades, it did not receive the investment and attention it deserved-and it has to be said that Derbyshire county council was Labour-controlled for 28 years. I am now asking, very clearly and vocally, for a level of support and investment in Erewash from the county council and the local council that it did not have in the past.</p> <p pid="b.212.1/4">My constituency has a proud history of manufacturing, furniture making, engineering and high-tech companies, many of which have taken on apprenticeships over the years. Apprenticeships is a topic that comes up at every meeting of the Erewash Partnership, the local business partnership in which I play a role. There is a real thirst for apprenticeships, and enthusiasm for what the Government are doing to back them. I was interested to learn that 190 different types of apprenticeship can be taken, which is more than I thought. Giving young people this opportunity and variety for their future is extremely important.</p> <p pid="b.212.1/5">The Bill emphasises prioritising funding for young people who have already secured an apprenticeship. That is important, as it will allow us to move forward both with the commitment to have more apprenticeships-which is, of course, the right thing to do-and with making sure the practical steps are in place so that that can be achieved.</p> <p pid="b.212.1/6">I will vote with enthusiasm for the Bill. This is a positive day for young people in this country. I think that taking this step will enable us to go forward, and I hope we get as much cross-party support as possible in order to bring all these positive ideas to fruition.</p>            </div>

The previous Government's system was founded on the principle of the equal opportunity to succeed-that is rooted in the comprehensive system-which focused on supporting failing schools in deprived areas and providing some choice and flexibility. It achieved remarkable success in GCSE results and standards.</p> <p pid="b.213.0/2">The current Government want to shift resources-in an economic climate in which ever fewer resources are available-from the most deprived areas to those already achieving or to new schools in middle-class areas. In addition, their system will centralise power in the hands of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> sitting in <a href="/glossary/?gl=101" title="Whitehall is a wide road that runs through the heart of Westminster,..." class="glossary">Whitehall</a> to make decisions over the future of schools he has never seen or will never care to visit. It will undermine communities and their power to influence local <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> in schools via their democratically elected councils, and replace parent choice with head teacher choice as schools achieve growing power over selection and there is shrinking accountability to parents.</p> <p pid="b.213.0/3">Meanwhile, the ability to plan for aggregate levels of special educational needs in an area will be undermined as that will be unknown, when what we need is, for example, the screening of all two-year-olds for speech and language difficulties in order to assess the level of need and to target early so that the system is cost-effective. We have yet to see the plans for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEN">SEN</a> as this Bill has been introduced ahead of them.</p> <p pid="b.213.0/4">What we know instead is that schools in middle-class areas will be empowered to select parents who can make a donation to the school and to avoid pupils who might incur disproportionate costs as the system for appeal has been weakened. Unfortunately therefore, the marketised system that will emerge will naturally adjust to create sink schools, risking the creation of dumping grounds of socially and financially disadvantaged children.</p> <p pid="b.213.0/5">The aggregate impact of these market forces will be for the school system to exaggerate and amplify social Darwinism, and to punish people for being poor by kicking away the ladder of opportunity so that society overall suffers by being less productive, more unequal and more divided. When Britain most needs a society that is strong and united, the Lib Dem-Tories are unleashing market forces in education that will create an England that is weak and divided.</p> <p pid="b.213.0/6">Alongside this, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sure_Start">Sure Start</a> infrastructure for early intervention is being systematically cut so pupils from less well-off backgrounds will enter a worse school, worse prepared. Meanwhile, in sharp contrast, across the border in Wales, despite the Lib Dem-<a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> bid to reduce the financial bloodstream to the comprehensive education system, the flame of hope for fair and equal education still burns bright. Fortunately, as NHS spending is not ring-fenced in Wales and the &#163;3 billion cost of restructuring the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_in_England">NHS in England</a> will not be wasted in Wales, we will have money to invest in education and to give all our children-not just the few-the life chances they deserve, with local authorities charged with streamlined strategic responsibilities to ensure holistic success and efficiency, with schools accountable and with a refreshed focus on leadership achievements and transparency, and with a new commitment to ensuring money meant for schools is spent on schools and not for other purposes.</p> <p pid="b.213.0/7">The appalling waste we will see in England, of letting poorer schools go to the wall and fail and close, will still be avoided in Wales by early intervention that is locally driven, and with parents empowered through local democracy, not threatened by the distant foreign voice of Whitehall muttering the drumbeat of a one-size-fits-all curriculum. Local head teachers will not be given a free rein to run schools without parent power or be forced to stick to the new Tory curriculum diet of Billy-Bunter Britain that is being prescribed. In England, in education as in the NHS, we see the arrival of a market-led system, the withdrawal of democracy, and the distant diktat of the Secretary of State, with unaccountable schools competing to attract the most well-heeled parents and the least expensive children, who will be fed an intellectually grey diet that may keep them above their neighbours locally but will relegate them below their neighbours internationally.</p> <p pid="b.213.0/8">This ill-thought-out patchwork of measures threatens to cast the children of England adrift from the firm anchorage of hope and opportunity to float into the uncertain and treacherous waters of growing inequality and underachievement. The Bill is a rag-bag of right-wing ideas dreamt up in haste, and threatens to undermine the future of a united and prosperous England. It is incomplete both in terms of SEN and apprenticeship provision, and it fails to acknowledge the withdrawal of support from Sure Start and will lead to us ending up with a two-tier system in respect of local authority access. All this underlines the case for Wales to avoid importing this half-baked Tory-Lib Dem plan for ruining education. Thankfully, the only good aspect of it is that it will encourage the people of Wales to vote Labour this May.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.215.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow such a vivid speech, describing-<i> [Interruption.] </i>Well, it contained a lot of imagery, but it described an outcome that I do not think many people outside this House who commented on the Bill will recognise. There are undoubtedly concerns and areas that require clarification, but while the language of <a href="/mp/?m=40597" title="Our page on Geraint Davies - 'the hon. Member for Swansea West (Geraint Davies)'">Geraint Davies</a> used was very colourful, it was, perhaps, not entirely accurate. We will look back in a few years and see whether the vision he set out has come to pass. The hon. Gentleman's party colleague, <a href="/mp/?m=40624" title="Our page on Kate Hoey - 'the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)'">Kate Hoey</a>, had a more generous view of both the intentions behind the Bill and the outcomes its provisions might produce.</p> <p pid="b.215.0/2">I join other Members in welcoming the addition to the Bill of a commitment to extending early-years provision for those from disadvantaged backgrounds. That will have a huge impact. It will be tied to the pupil premium, which was a Liberal Democrat commitment. I greatly welcome the fact that the coalition is focusing on trying to raise the attainment of those from disadvantaged backgrounds, as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> set out. I also hope that this encouragement to drive up the take-up of places in early-years education will lead to more investment and therefore greater provision as well. Other hon. Members have mentioned training and, by setting out greater investment in that sector, we hope to encourage more people to participate in delivering it and to improve it.</p> <p pid="b.215.0/3">The issue of bureaucracy has been raised. <a href="/mp/?m=40576" title="Our page on Stephen McPartland - 'The hon. Member for Stevenage (Stephen McPartland)'">Stephen McPartland</a>, who is no longer <a href="/glossary/?gl=145" title="Of a male MP, sitting on his regular seat in the House. For females, &quot;in..." class="glossary">in his place</a>, started his speech by stating his family's educational credentials. Unlike some hon. Members, I have never been a teacher, but both my parents were teachers and my wife is a teacher. I did work for a while in a teacher training college and I have been a school governor, so I have seen close up the reams of guidance and prescription issued by the Department under the previous Government. Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that at last we have a Bill that puts at its heart cutting aside a lot of that and allowing schools to get on with teaching, because that is what teachers want to do.</p> <p pid="b.215.0/4">The Government have already addressed issues such as financial management in schools and the self-assessment documentation, and in this Bill we are looking at the school profile. Those measures together deal with a huge amount of the reading through that has to be done. They also address the quantity of work that head teachers, governors and staff have to do to send back pieces of paper or to hang on to filing cabinets full of paper that do not achieve a huge amount-or a proportionate amount, given the time involved in doing that work-for the pupils in their school or for the wider community.</p> <p pid="b.215.0/5">The Bill also seeks to abolish some organisations; we have heard a little today about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Teaching_Council">General Teaching Council</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_and_Development_Agency_for_Schools">Training and Development Agency for Schools</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualifications_and_Curriculum_Development_Agency">Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency</a>. The Young People's Learning Agency could have been mentioned too. Those organisations have undoubtedly performed a role, but it is right for the Government to challenge how effective they have been in discharging their roles. If it is at all possible, it is right to do that work far more efficiently.</p> <p pid="b.215.0/6">The hon. Member for Vauxhall talked about accountability, which is also important. She made a good point, because I recall discussions about the Bill that set up the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Planning_Commission">Infrastructure Planning Commission</a> and I felt that it was all about taking tricky decisions away from the Secretary of State and giving them to an unelected body to consider. So I very much welcome the decisions that this Government have taken across the legislation that they are introducing to ensure that Government accountability is included and that the buck stops with them.</p> <p pid="b.215.0/7">My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40395" title="Our page on Annette Brooke - 'the Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)'">Annette Brooke</a> made an excellent and measured contribution, in which she rightly set out some questions for the Government. She also mentioned bullying, which has been mentioned by all parties in election manifestos and so on. It is therefore welcome that the Government are dealing with discipline issues and are tackling bullying, so that teachers can have the confidence that they will be supported when they try to intervene to ensure that they get the discipline that they want in their classes and so that parents can be reassured too.</p> <p pid="b.215.0/8">The speech made by <a href="/mp/?m=40361" title="Our page on Andy Burnham - 'the right hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)'">Andy Burnham</a> laid into the issue of apprenticeships. He tried to pretend that the approach that had been adopted towards the end of the previous Parliament was going to deliver a huge number of apprenticeships. A responsibility had been placed to deliver those places, but we need employers to come forward with them. There is far more clarity in our arrangement because the funding and support is in place, and it is then up to people to get out and secure those places locally.</p> <p pid="b.215.0/9">My questions for the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> focus on school governance. We need to explore in greater detail the proposals for governing bodies to alter their own structures and remove some categories of governor. I have concerns about that with regard to local authority governors and staff governors, so I hope that we can hear more justification of that proposal.</p> <p pid="b.215.0/10">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_School_and_College_Leaders">Association of School and College Leaders</a> has said that it welcomes the exclusions proposals that will ensure that teachers will able to take action to remove pupils who are having a disruptive effect on their classmates. However, we must make sure that safeguards are in place. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> may correct me if I am wrong here, but I believe that the Bill provides that decisions on exclusions must recognise the position of children with special educational needs, particularly those who have autism. Could similar sorts of rights be put in place for looked-after children too, given the pressures that they are under and the disruptions that life has inflicted on them?</p> <p pid="b.215.0/11">The measures on providing an independent careers service are also welcome. They will allow people to be confident that the advice being given is in the best interests of the young person. In most cases, it has been, but we have all heard examples of people being pushed to stay on at a particular school in the interests of the school, rather than the young person. The independence contained in the measures is good, but I hope that the Government will be considering transition arrangements to ensure that as we move to the new system, the experience that has been gained in providing careers advice will not be lost.</p>            </div>

Members to learn that I want to discuss part 7 of the Bill, which covers post-16 education and training. More specifically, I want to discuss <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 65 on "The apprenticeship offer". This is particularly appropriate given that we are in national apprenticeship week, as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> said.

They provide a structured career path for young and old people alike, while helping to develop the skills that UK plc will need if it is going to compete effectively on the global scale. It is for that reason that I introduced my Apprenticeships and Skills (Public Procurement Contracts) Bill, which seeks to increase the number of apprenticeship places available across the country by introducing a requirement that when awarding large contracts all public authorities must ensure that successful bidders demonstrate a firm commitment to providing skills training, wherever possible and appropriate, and, crucially, apprenticeship places.</p> <p pid="b.217.2/3">I am delighted that my Bill is to have its <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> debate this Friday, during national apprenticeships week, and that it has garnered widespread support from organisations such as the Federation of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Businesses">Small Businesses</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUC">TUC</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East">North East</a> chamber of commerce, Unison, Unite, the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians, the Association of Colleges, the Federation of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Builders">Master Builders</a>, the Electrical Contractors Association and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMB">GMB</a>, and indeed from the former Government enterprise champion, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Sugar">Lord Sugar</a>, to name but a few. It is a simple measure that will help to increase the number of apprenticeships available. It will ensure that employers do their bit and are on an equal footing when bidding for public contracts as the Bill will reward those with good practice and encourage the others to do more. I therefore urge the Government to do all they can to secure the Bill's passage through the House or to take on the ideas and proposals in their own policies.</p> <p pid="b.217.2/4">I was also delighted to welcome my own 16-year-old apprentice to her first day in my Newcastle office. Charlene Curry, a business administration apprentice from Newbiggin Hall, in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, has been placed in my office by the excellent North East Apprenticeship Company, which works hard on a not-for-profit basis to marry businesses with willing apprentices, with great success. I wish to take this opportunity to urge all right hon. and hon. Members to make every effort to accommodate an apprentice in their office, if they have the ability to do so.</p> <p pid="b.217.2/5">At this stage, it is useful to take stock and acknowledge that the previous <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> had a clear, unwavering commitment to boosting and expanding apprenticeships. As I have said, this is national apprenticeship week, which the previous Government launched in 2008 to celebrate and promote the important role that apprenticeships play. Under Labour, the apprenticeship system was lifted from its knees by a Government who invested money, status and opportunities in apprenticeships for young and older people alike.</p> <p pid="b.217.2/6">In 1996-97, the final year of the previous <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> Government, only 65,000 people started an apprenticeship. By 2009-10, that figure had risen to almost 280,000, a massive and highly commendable increase which comfortably exceeded Labour's original target of 250,000 starts.</p>            </div>

Either way, the target is unambitious over four years when we consider demand and the obstacles that young people now face in trying to stay on at school or carry on to higher education.</p> <p pid="b.218.1/3">Labour's commitment to expanding apprenticeships included the introduction of a statutory apprenticeship offer as part of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeships,_Skills,_Children_and_Learning_Act_2009">Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009</a>, which required the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skills_Funding_Agency">Skills Funding Agency</a> to secure an apprenticeship place for all suitably qualified 16 to 18-year-olds by 2013. Part 7 of the Bill seeks to repeal that duty and replace it with a requirement to fund apprenticeship training for those people who have already secured an apprenticeship place. I do not doubt that the Minister for Further Education, Skills and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelong_Learning">Lifelong Learning</a> shares my passion for promoting the importance of apprenticeships, but I am concerned about the signal that that repeal will send out. Should we not be encouraging all young people to think that an apprenticeship is at least an option for them?</p> <p pid="b.218.1/4">Yesterday, City and Guilds published the results of a study showing that employers actually find apprentices to be more valuable than graduates. What impact does the Minister believe that taking away the guarantee of an apprenticeship will have on the number of young people seeking and successfully acquiring apprenticeship places, particularly among those from disadvantaged backgrounds?</p>            </div>

I have three points. First, we warmly welcome her attempts to link procurement and apprenticeships. Regardless of whether we can support the Apprenticeships and Skills (Public Procurement Contracts) Bill, we will take action to support the intentions behind it. Secondly, on the numbers, we will grow apprenticeships on the back of the progress that Labour made, which I acknowledge, to an unprecedented level-we have put the funding in place for at least 105,000 more apprenticeships. Thirdly, we have changed the offer because we want to ensure that everyone who secures an apprenticeship place with an employer is funded. That is my commitment to the House tonight, which is reinforced in the legislation.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.219.1/1">One of the greatest failures of the previous Government, who started with great hope, was their failure to improve the performance of schools. We know that the performance of schools in international league tables, which is measured by the programme for international student assessment, fell from where we-the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a>-left it in 1997.</p> <p pid="b.219.1/2">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> promised that their three main priorities in government would be "Education, education, education". The aim was clearly for schools' performance to get better and, more importantly, for schools to get better, but the problem was that performance was getting worse all the time. While Ministers here insisted all was well, every external audit proved the opposite.</p> <p pid="b.219.1/3">Let me illustrate how well we were doing under <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_John_Major">Sir John Major</a>'s Government and how much worse the statistics were by 2009. The first <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA">PISA</a> assessment took place in 2000, three years after the Labour Government had won power. In it, the UK ranked seventh in reading, eighth in maths and fourth in science. In the 2009 assessment, the UK ranked 25th in reading, 28th in maths and 16th in science. I confess that there are many ways to read the statistics, as the PISA readings were collected over a long period and any one set of results used in the tables may have been taken over a period of five years, but the striking thing is that the United Kingdom was, using the average of the three results, in sixth place in 2000, and yet we were in 23rd place in 2009.</p> <p pid="b.219.1/4"><a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members may argue about the finer details, but to any objective observer it is obvious that the UK has tumbled down the international league tables. Canada, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand">New Zealand</a> and Australia now occupy much higher positions, around sixth, seventh and ninth. Their positions are statistically significant above the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> average. I would expect the United Kingdom to occupy a similar position, but we are ranked 23rd. We are only around average on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of indicators, although we are a little above average for science. The OECD says that average performance needs to be judged against a range of socio-economic indicators, most of which give the UK an advantage. The problem is not the money that we spend on education-only seven OECD countries spend more per student than the UK-but the way in which it is being spent. The best performing countries are China, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea">South Korea</a>, Finland and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> is now below Ireland and the United States, which, to make it clear, are pretty average.</p> <p pid="b.219.1/5">To be fair, the problem was clear to us even in the 1980s, when from a good position we were starting to get worse. We needed to slow down that slide in performance, and there were two ways in which schools could improve. One was greater independence for all schools, which was called local management and which was reasonably successful in many areas. The other was giving schools greater freedom-grant-maintained schools. Seventeen schools became grant maintained in the first group in 1989. In 1994, 554 secondary schools-about 15% of the total-enjoyed the freedom to make the right decisions for their school and their pupils that grant-maintained status gave them. The results in those schools were well above average, and grant-maintained status did what needed to be done for individual schools in individual areas.</p> <p pid="b.219.1/6">Finally, I draw hon. Members' attention to small schools, which have also benefited from having more freedom. The smallest grant-maintained school was Kettleshulme in Cheshire: it had 12 pupils, but the number grew to 19 by the time it was grant-maintained. It was already a successful small school and after it achieved grant-maintained status it became very successful. The head teacher at that time was Allan Ramsdale-Capper, who is now one of my constituents. Let me take this opportunity to pay tribute to him and to all the other headmasters and mistresses of grant-maintained schools who have done so much to improve the education of their pupils. Large schools are often very good, but I want to make it clear that small ones are equally successful and that their position does not need a huge influx of money to keep them going. I believe that decisions are best made by parents, head teachers and governors. The OECD comments that</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.219.1/7">"the international achievement gap is imposing on the United Kingdom economy an invisible but recurring economic loss".</p> <p pid="b.219.1/8">That needs to be addressed urgently.</p> <p pid="b.219.1/9">When grant-maintained schools were created in the '90s, they were successful, and it was the freedoms they were given that made them so. I should like to say to my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Education that I am sure that free schools and academies will be successes given time, although they will not need that much time. They will be our successes and, most importantly, the successes of parents up and down the country.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.221.0/1">I think that all hon. Members who are interested in education struggle with the challenges of which we are all aware. We want every child in our country to fulfil their full potential and to garner from education the very best, from which many of us have benefited. I had a very happy educational experience and I wanted the same for my children and now for my growing number of grandchildren. We all want that, but the truth is that we are not doing well enough.</p> <p pid="b.221.0/2">When Labour won the <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a> in 1997, I could not have been happier with the commitment of our young, new <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> to education, education, education. I watched the performance of Labour Governments for 10 years as the Chair of the Select Committee on Education-indeed, it had three names in that time-and I saw them make tremendous efforts to raise standards and to innovate in order to do so. A great deal was achieved in that time through innovation, new ideas and confronting the truth that many of our young people had been given a pretty bad deal-and not only in the centres of great deprivation. When the Committee looked at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sure_Start">Sure Start</a> centres, we had to consider the fact that if one circles the areas of greatest poverty, one does not find the most children in poverty because most of them live outside those areas. That is why we had to have 3,500 children's centres instead of the 500 originally envisaged. There is always this challenge of getting through to the most deprived families and constituents, and that is difficult for any Government.</p> <p pid="b.221.0/3">I am going to be honest: much of the Bill could have come from the previous Labour Administration. I think some colleagues would agree with that. I shall not vote against its <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> because I want to make a plea. The longer I chaired the Select Committee, the more I realised that much of what really works comes when we have agreement across the House. One can see that from the history of educational progress in our country. It was true of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Act_1944">Education Act 1944</a>, of the Callaghan speech that was taken up by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Baker">Ken Baker</a> and of later legislation.</p> <p pid="b.221.0/4">We often throw across the Chamber allegations that the other side is being ideological-those on the Government side say it about the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> and vice versa-but I cannot find any ideology in this Bill. Indeed, if I were to vote against it, it would be because it is a bit of a mish-mash. There are some very good things in it, but there are other things that I do not really like and want to know much more about. I do not like the fact that the Government want to get rid of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_and_Development_Agency_for_Schools">Training and Development Agency for Schools</a>, as that would be a retrograde step. I do not agree with what they have said about schools adjudicators or with giving parents less chance to challenge admissions policies and get them changed. The Select Committee worked very hard to persuade the former Government to change the powers of adjudicators and allow them to be called in more easily because we found that many schools, such as faith schools, were evading their responsibilities in terms of fairer admissions policies.</p> <p pid="b.221.0/5">I want to be able to vote for the Bill and I am not going to vote against it today because I want to see whether we can improve it in Committee. However, I get very irritated when I hear about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA">PISA</a> studies and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIMSS">TIMSS</a>-trends in international mathematics and science study-tables and about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a>. I remember when <a href="/mp/?m=40333" title="Our page on Andrew Turner - 'the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr Turner)'">Mr Turner</a> and I went to Paris to talk to the OECD about the PISA study. The truth is that many such evaluations are quite flaky and have changed dramatically over the years. When I chaired the Select Committee I was constantly saying that I wanted our country to be compared with other countries such as ours-large, populous countries with high migration and high turnover in inner urban schools. The United States, Germany and France, and perhaps Italy and Spain, would be fairer comparisons for the UK. On that measure, our education system has improved dramatically in the past 13 years. I do not believe the PISA studies showing a cataclysmic decline: I do not believe that is true and I do not think that Ministers believe it either. Let us have some good sense.</p> <p pid="b.221.0/6">When do we get good policy? As you will know from a previous incarnation, Madam <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>, it is when it is based on evidence, good research and good experience in similar countries. It is not about pulling off what the Hong Kongs and Chinas of the world have done-or Alberta, which became a country earlier today. Let us learn from countries such as ours, but let us also have high-quality expertise and research. Too many Education Departments are not good enough and they should be better. There should be much more research on why we do not get better results.</p>            </div>

I applaud the idea of reaching out to two-year-olds-the Government are right about that-but not in the context of changing the commitment to Sure Start children's centres. That is good policy based on research and what is really happening.</p> <p pid="b.222.1/3">What if we used the same holistic method as the Dutch to tackle those not in education, employment or training, and tied it to the welfare system? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Holland">In Holland</a>, people up to the age of 27 can get no welfare benefit unless they are in training and learning the Dutch language. Why not link welfare to training here? Why not make everyone on benefits do something to improve their training, skills and employability and to learn the English language?</p> <p pid="b.222.1/4">One of the problems that we do not consider in this country is the effect on the ability of families to support their children in schools if they have no English language themselves, the television is on in the home language, and then we suffer deprivation in our inner cities. We see a new form of poverty, not the poverty that was found in the shipbuilding and mining areas. The new kind of poverty is based on high turnover. In schools in my inner town, 40% of the children in front of the school today will not be there next year. None of the political parties has examined the new poverty in sufficient detail and come up with policies to deal with it.</p> <p pid="b.222.1/5">Too many people in education policy want to live in a mythical golden age that never existed, but also want some ideological determination of what happens. I was taught by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Oakeshott">Michael Oakeshott</a>, the greatest Conservative philosopher of the 20th century, who believed in the pursuit of intimations.

There are currently 27 separate headings under which schools are marked during inspections-27 headings, but, as one school told me, the inspectors did not speak to a single child during their visit.</p> <p pid="b.223.0/4">Under the Bill, Ofsted inspections will focus on four key areas-the achievement of pupils, the quality of teaching, leadership and management, and the behaviour and safety of pupils at the school. In today's society it is far too easy to judge a pupil by an exam result or a school by a rigid and complex Ofsted report. The results tell only a part, never the whole story.</p> <p pid="b.223.0/5">Over the past few months, I have visited on average two schools a week. I have 39 schools in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, so I still have a way to go. I am extremely fortunate that the diversity of my constituency gives me a good insight into the challenges that schools face. Not only do I have some schools in nice middle class areas, but I have others that are situated in areas with significant welfare dependency and high levels of multiple deprivation. In some of my schools well over half the children are on free school meals, more than 75% live with just one of their birth parents, and more than 10% are under child protection measures because of neglect or abuse.</p> <p pid="b.223.0/6">Many children experience challenging home lives, sometimes with parents who have drug or alcohol problems or mental health issues. These kids, from an early age, have to get themselves up in the morning, feed themselves, dress themselves and get themselves to school, perhaps with a younger sibling, while their mum might still be in bed. For these children, school is their stability, their comfort zone, a safe haven where they know what to expect and what is expected of them, where they will be secure, nurtured, listened to and cared for, where their needs are put first.</p> <p pid="b.223.0/7">The schools that take children from extremely vulnerable backgrounds often have to do much more than educate them. Often they have to heal them, deal with their issues and address their needs, and give them so much more than numeracy and literacy. Those that are doing this successfully are, to me, the very best schools and the very best teachers of all. The problem with the current system is that after this incredible level of achievement, they might still get only a satisfactory Ofsted report because they have not attained the same high level of results as schools in more affluent areas.</p> <p pid="b.223.0/8">That must be incredibly demoralising for the amazing teachers and governors who pour so much of themselves into supporting the most vulnerable children. What incentive is there for more able teachers and heads to take jobs in the most challenging of schools, which should surely the most rewarding of roles, when they know that all their effort could be seen as merely satisfactory?</p> <p pid="b.223.0/9">Reforms to Ofsted inspections will help to prevent that. Of course grades and results are important, but there is hope that for the first time it will be more than the end result that is considered. It will be possible to achieve good Ofsted reports in certain circumstances by demonstrating the true progress that has been made, measuring achievement from where the school started, not just where it ends up. Ofsted must be more sophisticated in recognising the social justice agenda, not just performance levels.</p> <p pid="b.223.0/10">In many schools, the move away from mainstream academic subjects such as modern languages could be laid partly at the door of Ofsted. The constant focus on performance levels and grades achieved, irrespective of the subject matter, means that curriculums have been altered to please Ofsted. In my constituency there are senior schools in which no one is studying a modern language, yet classes are crammed with pupils studying for a GCSE in dance. We will become a nation of people who can glide sure-footedly through the streets of the cities of the world, but unable to communicate with a soul who lives there.</p> <p pid="b.223.0/11">The Bill removes the requirement for Ofsted to inspect every school, enabling more resources to be concentrated on the underperforming schools. This will lead to more targeted inspections, so schools in need of support will get the help that they require to progress and show that progress is being made. Above all, the Bill sends parents the message that allowing every child to flourish and be the very best that they can is at the heart of Government thinking. It sends heads the message that the Government prize educating more than ticking boxes and filling forms, and it sends teachers the message that the Government value teachers and understand that nothing is more important than attracting great people into teaching. That is why I will support the Bill.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.224.0/1">I congratulate <a href="/mp/?m=40281" title="Our page on Caroline Dinenage - 'the hon. Member for Gosport (Caroline Dinenage)'">Caroline Dinenage</a> on her brief speech. I shall endeavour to be brief also. I was struck by the comments of my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40325" title="Our page on Barry Sheerman - 'the Member for Huddersfield (Mr Sheerman)'">Mr Sheerman</a>. I agreed with much of what he said.</p> <p pid="b.224.0/2">I want to take colleagues on a journey to a not particularly closely examined part of the Bill, which deals with children's trusts. Before I do that, I want to say something about social mobility. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> often speaks about social mobility in a way that might lead people to think that he understood it. However, he refers only to statistics on free school meal take-up and admission to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_and_Cambridge">Oxford and Cambridge</a>. In my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, Darlington, five or six years ago, there were one or two wards where a young woman of 18 or 19 would be more likely to be a mother than to be a student in higher education. I can report with great pride that that is no longer the case. Teenage pregnancies are reducing and participation in higher education in those wards is improving. That needs to be taken into account when we discuss social mobility in the House.</p> <p pid="b.224.0/3">It is not right to portray Labour as the party that resists academies and is against them. Academies are a Labour initiative. <i> [Interruption.]</i> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Milburn">Alan Milburn</a>, indeed. I am pleased that the remaining schools in my constituency that are not yet academies will become academies. I support them in that and I am pleased to see them aspiring to take that step.</p> <p pid="b.224.0/4">Part 5 removes the duty on local authorities to establish children's trusts. Let me remind the House of the origins of children's trusts. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_2001">In 2001</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Laming">Lord Laming</a> wrote a report commissioned by the former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education">Secretary of State for Education</a>, my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40527" title="Our page on David Blunkett - 'the Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough (Mr Blunkett)'">Mr Blunkett</a>, and the former Secretary of State for Health, Alan Milburn. The report examined the murder of Victoria Climbi&#233; in north-west London. One of the key findings was that the various agencies that should have the safeguarding of children at the forefront of their minds were not able to protect that eight-year-old girl.</p> <p pid="b.224.0/5">I quote from Lord Laming's recommendations:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.224.0/6">"Each local authority with social services responsibilities must establish a Committee of Members for Children and Families with lay members drawn from the management committees of each of the key services. This Committee must ensure the services to children and families are properly co-ordinated and that the inter-agency dimension of this work is being managed effectively."</p> <p pid="b.224.0/7">I do not think that anything that Lord Laming found in 2001 has changed. It is probably more important now that services are co-ordinated and integrated better than they were then.</p> <p pid="b.224.0/8">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_Act_2004">Children Act 2004</a> placed local authorities under a duty to make arrangements to co-operate and promote the safeguarding of children, including the sharing of resources, money and information. I am pleased that Darlington was an early adopter of the children's trust model before it became a statutory requirement. The success from 2004 obviously differed between agency areas, which was partly because the model was optional and so some areas, such as Surrey, did not take up the recommendation as quickly as they might have done. As a former lead member for children's services in Darlington and a former chair of its children's trust, I remember attending a training course with the lead member for children's services from Surrey county council and its chair of scrutiny, who were utterly perplexed by the idea that those services would need to work quite so closely together.</p> <p pid="b.224.0/9">In 2008 it was realised, following consultation, that strengthening was needed, so all local authorities were required to set up trusts and "duty to co-operate" partners were expanded. Schools were included in that duty to co-operate, and it would be surprising if they were not, as they are best placed to know when things are going wrong and should, if anything, be better supported by the wider children's services and properly involved in commissioning services.</p> <p pid="b.224.0/10">In November 2010, Ofsted undertook to study six children's trusts, Darlington being one of them, to find out whether this children's trust business was all just bureaucracy and a load of nonsense that was having no impact. As chair of the children's trust, I was relieved to find that what we were doing was having an effect. Ofsted concluded:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.224.0/11">"Children's Trusts were providing more integrated front-line services that were linked closely to and responded to local needs... Trust boards showed considerable flexibility and willingness to find common ground from which to move services forward. They showed strong commitment to <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> and prevention", of which everyone is saying they would like to see more.</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.224.0/13">"They worked effectively in a complex environment which involved different performance targets, priorities and ways of providing services."</p> <p pid="b.224.0/14">I am proud to have been chair of Darlington children's trust at the time of that inspection and to have worked closely with the superb director of children's services, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rose">Murray Rose</a>. Our children's trust was highlighted as an example of best practice. Success has not been replicated in every local authority, so we need to take lessons from the areas that have managed to make this work well for the benefit of children and families, rather than scrapping the whole infrastructure.</p> <p pid="b.224.0/15">In conclusion, and in case anyone thinks that this is some sort of romantic ideal of mine that services should work together properly, I should point out that Ofsted found some tangible outcomes from Darlington's children's trust: a rise in the number of young people screened for chlamydia as a result of closer working between schools and health services; a reduction of more than 20% in teenage pregnancy rates; improvements in long-term stability of placements for looked-after children, an area that is close to my heart; the continued improvement of GCSE performance; importantly, an increase in the number of children receiving free school meals who achieve qualifications at age 19; and, most significantly, a reduction in the achievement gap at level 3 at age 19 between young people who had received free school meals and those who had not. I am proud of Darlington's achievements and would like the Government to reconsider abolishing children's trusts.</p>            </div>

I was going to talk about the free school bid in Bristol and my hope that the local council would give parents what they wanted: an all-through school. I was also going to make a plea to the Front-Bench team to consider my idea for a trigger for a special needs assessment after a certain number of exclusions to see whether something was wrong with the original assessment. However, I am not going to talk about any of that, because I want to address something else which has been at the heart of the debate: appearance versus reality.</p> <p pid="b.226.0/2"><a href="/mp/?m=40325" title="Our page on Barry Sheerman - 'The hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr Sheerman)'">Mr Sheerman</a> talked about ideology and appearance and the importance of evidence, and I could not agree more with him. I know that <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members are concerned about social mobility, as are Government Members, and I saw their bleak faces when the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> illustrated the awful situation facing children on free school meals and their lack of opportunity in comparison with their richer counterparts. I know that they are concerned, so we must ask how we deal with that.</p> <p pid="b.226.0/3">In asking that question, we cannot shy away from things that might not be ideologically to our liking. International league tables are so important, because there is a tendency to get caught up in a self-referential bubble of success, of exam results getting ever better. Our young people always work hard, and I believe that the cohort of young people in the country today is every bit as good as that in the 1950s, but that is not the point. The point is this: what is the objective reality of the qualifications that we are offering those young people? We must look at those measures to work out what is going on and then what we can do about it.</p> <p pid="b.226.0/4">I will re-rehearse the statistics. I understand that statistics always have wriggle room, but I do not think that Members can argue with the general thrust of the statistics from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> programme for international student assessment. They show that the UK has moved from fourth to 16th in science; from seventh to 25th in literacy; and from eighth to 28th in maths. I thank my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40333" title="Our page on Andrew Turner - 'the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr Turner)'">Mr Turner</a> for his brilliant breakdown of those figures and their background. The worst thing about that is that it is the poorest who suffer, and we have to look at why that is so. That is why the idea of an English baccalaureate is so interesting and crucial. The fact of the matter is that the poorest suffer in the curriculum. The evidence is overwhelming that those who go to state schools in deprived areas do not have access to the kind of academic subjects available to those who go to state schools in better-off areas or to private schools. That is because struggling schools have perverse incentives to put their pupils through qualifications that lead to equivalents so that they look good in the league tables. We cannot blame them for that, because it is obvious why they do it. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_English">The English</a> baccalaureate is an attempt to offset that perverse incentive.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.227.1/1">I agree absolutely, and my hon. Friend anticipates my point. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_English">The English</a> baccalaureate shines a cold and difficult light of reality on what is going on. I will ask a question that Members might expect to come from the Labour Benches: why is it that, because I went to a private school, I was able to study Latin and a range of academic subjects which friends of mine who did not go to private schools were not able to study? When I applied for difficult and competitive jobs in television, I was told time and again that Latin looked interesting on my CV. Why was I given that opportunity and my friends at state schools were not? I do not think that that is fair. I make no apology for a system that will enable people from less well-off schools to study academic subjects, because it is resetting a balance. It is a case not of having either academic or vocational subjects, but of having both. It is really very simple.</p> <p pid="b.227.1/2">If we look at the other objective measures of what is going on, we see that universities have courses that they value. I have a concern that our schools, in their bid to look good in the league tables, are pushing our children through courses that the universities do not value as much. The statistics show that only 1% of children on free school meals are going on to Russell group universities. That is not because those children are any less able than the counterparts, but because we have got something wrong.</p> <p pid="b.227.1/3">I would like to run through a few scenarios that I have come across to add colour to what I am saying. First, there is a boy in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> who went to a school in one of the more deprived wards, and he was prevented from taking physics. He was an incredibly bright chap and wanted to study physics, but he was prevented from doing so, which was awful. Secondly, the head who took over that same school recently said to me how despairing he was that he had bright students who had been told that they would do only vocational courses. Vocational courses are obviously equally important-someone had to build the building we are in now-but that does not mean that academically able children should not be able to pursue their course in life as well.</p> <p pid="b.227.1/4">Thirdly, we do not have the vocational element right. I do not even like the name "vocational", because a vocation is what one does, so one can have a vocation as a brain surgeon, as a plumber and even as an MP, but "vocational", which has slipped into the political language, is a euphemism for manual, practical and technical skills and crafts.</p>            </div>

It bodes well.</p> <p pid="b.228.1/2">To illustrate that point, I recall talking to a young offender in a young offenders institute. I asked him how he ended up there, expecting him just to be a bad sort, but he said, "I was really interested in electronics. I wanted to be an electrician, but every time I thought I was going to do something practical about electronics, they gave me paper about it." He said, "I can't do the paper; I can do the thing." That is how we have failed-for 13 years and more-a whole generation of people whose skills lie in the practical and technical fields. I could go on about how restoring discipline in our schools will help most those on free school meals, and about how discipline problems are highest in schools in deprived areas, but I will not.</p> <p pid="b.228.1/3">I finish with a plea, because I know that <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members are as concerned as we are about the matter.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.228.2/1">With so much in the Bill, it is difficult to know where to start. Some of it, such as the intention to give anonymity to teachers accused by pupils, is welcome. There are too many cases in which innocent teachers have had their careers and, sometimes, their lives ruined or, even worse, lost their lives, because of false accusations and malicious gossip, but such anonymity should be extended to support staff and to teachers and support staff in colleges, because they are equally vulnerable to accusations. I hope that the Bill will be amended to include them.</p> <p pid="b.228.2/2">Much of the Bill is, however, unwelcome. The abolition of the school support staff negotiating body is a real step backwards for the professionalisation of school support staff, making those workers-predominantly women-vulnerable to a return to poor wages and poor terms and conditions. Setting a core contract and developing a qualification framework has been fundamental in making support staff an integral part of our school landscape, but the Bill will reverse that progress, and is it the thin end of the wedge? Academies are being actively dissuaded from signing up to national terms and conditions for teachers, so will teachers become the next group to be thrown to the market?</p> <p pid="b.228.2/3">So much of the Bill seems to roll back the progress that has been made. It represents a view of education that does not match today's reality. In most parts of the country, we no longer separate children at 11 years old, creaming off just a few for grammar school education while giving the rest a shorter, cheaper education. Now, we have a more equal education system, in which we try to enable all young people to fulfil their potential. We said that we need 50% of our children to be educated to degree level, but what about the other 50%?</p> <p pid="b.228.2/4">We have very few low-skilled jobs left in our economy, and we need young people to be educated so that they are ready for the higher-skilled jobs that we do have. I therefore really do not understand why the Government are proposing a very narrow English baccalaureate and abandoning diplomas. Where is the research and evidence that those are the subjects that society and employers need? Why those narrow subjects? Should not education develop skills in investigation, analysis and comprehension? Is it not more important, therefore, that we have a range of equivalent subjects rather than a narrow definition?</p> <p pid="b.228.2/5">As a scientist, I stopped doing history and geography in year 8. Is the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> saying that those subjects are better than the physics and chemistry that I did? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_people">Young people</a> need a broad and balanced curriculum, not one based on the narrow views of a few individuals. We also need to recognise that different children and young people learn differently. Some are perfectly happy to listen and absorb information, but others need to learn by doing. The diplomas would have opened up different routes for young people to learn-and to learn things that employers want.</p> <p pid="b.228.2/6">I met a group of apprentices in Parliament yesterday from my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>. They work for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBDA">MBDA</a>, a company that manufactures missiles. It is clearly very high-tech engineering, and the company has a fantastic apprenticeship programme. Those apprentices will all do ONDs, HNDs and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVQs">NVQs</a>, which the company very much values, because they judge what the apprentice can actually do, not just what they can write on paper.</p> <p pid="b.228.2/7">Many will also do a degree as part of their apprenticeship. I asked them why they decided to go down the apprenticeship route, and part of the reason was the fear that, if they went to university, they would just be hugely in debt and then possibly unable to get a job. They also did so because they preferred to learn by doing and to put theory into practice on a daily basis. I asked their training officer and their managing director what subjects they needed young people to learn in schools. They said they wanted maths, English and science, but they also believed that technology was essential. Why will the Secretary of State not listen to employers, such as MBDA, which are the highly technical, high-value manufacturers that our economy needs?</p> <p pid="b.228.2/8">Moving on, I am as confused as the Bill appears to be about the future of careers guidance. As we speak, Connexions personal advisers all over the country are getting their redundancy notices. Of course, Connexions is more than careers guidance. It is also about working with young people who are either not in employment, education or training, or at risk of becoming a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET">NEET</a>, to help them to reach their full potential; and it is about working in partnership with schools and other agencies.</p> <p pid="b.228.2/9">The Bill states that schools have to provide independent careers guidance, but that the school does not have to pass on information about the pupil to the adviser. The Department has announced the introduction of an all-age careers service later in the year, but as yet we have no details about it, and local authorities currently have a duty to provide the Connexions service. That part of the Bill appears to be an ill-thought-out mess. Surely the sensible thing to do is to fund Connexions until its staff can be transferred to the new all-age service, keeping intact all those years of experience and the expertise of careers advisers, with the service then having a duty to provide careers advice in schools and continuing to provide a much-needed service to young people. As one of the young female engineering apprentices said yesterday, "How will young people like me know about the option for apprenticeships like this if they don't get good careers advice?"</p> <p pid="b.228.2/10">Finally, I have concerns about education funding. Whether the schools budget is being cut or growing is for somebody else to argue, because there is no question but that funding for other parts of education has been slashed. All other funding streams have been put into the early <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> grant, covering such things as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sure_Start">Sure Start</a>, Connexions, teenage pregnancy, substance misuse and youth services-a much reduced pot of money compared with the original funding. The Government state that they are</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.228.2/11">"freeing local authorities to focus on essential frontline services".</p> <p pid="b.228.2/12">The reality is that, instead of devolving power, they are devolving cuts.</p> <p pid="b.228.2/13">What we are seeing nationally is the utter destruction of youth work, both in maintained youth services and in the voluntary sector. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_and_Inspections_Act_2006">Education and Inspections Act 2006</a> gave statutory responsibility to local authorities to provide positive activities for young people, and to consult them about the services that should be delivered. The Bill appears to be silent on youth services, but surely there is a responsibility to ensure that youth services are delivered and young people consulted.</p> <p pid="b.228.2/14">This Saturday, 30 national organisations and 1,000 young people representing hundreds of thousands of users of youth services will meet in Solihull to discuss the demise of the youth service. Some local authorities have shut their youth services altogether; many face 50% to 80% cuts. Unless the Government act, many parts of the country will have no youth service, nowhere for young people to go, nothing for them to do and, even more importantly, no one providing the informal education and support that is so vital to young people's development. I beg the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> to intervene to save the youth service.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.231.0/1">I look forward to supporting this Bill with gusto on behalf of all my constituents. It is, indeed, a landmark Bill. Historic? Well, not quite historic. Landmark, I think, is better, but the canon of my right hon. Friend's work as <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Education will truly be seen as historic as time passes.</p> <p pid="b.231.0/2">It has been interesting to sit on the Government Benches and hear not only the speeches recognising that the Bill honours, empowers and respects our head teachers, but the observations of right hon. and hon. <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members and the real divisions within the Labour party over the Bill, which is really the continuation of a journey that their Government started. There are divisions between those who believed then and believe now; those who believed then and are now just a little bit iffy; and those who never believed in the first place and certainly do not now. It has been very interesting to hear the observations about those divisions in the Labour party. It is welcome, however, to hear that Labour Members will be supporting the Bill.</p> <p pid="b.231.0/3">One part of the Bill that is extraordinarily useful and valuable is the requirement for local authorities to fund early-years teaching for the most disadvantaged. That will come as welcome news to the governing boards and teachers at Cherry Trees, Peter Pan and Southway nurseries in Cauldwell ward, one of the most deprived parts of my town, which are suffering cuts from the Liberal Democrat-controlled council. I hope that we can move this measure forward quickly so that they can see that there is some hope for their funding in future.</p> <p pid="b.231.0/4">If we are moving forward with the reading test at the age of six, which my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40576" title="Our page on Stephen McPartland - 'the Member for Stevenage (Stephen McPartland)'">Stephen McPartland</a> welcomed, I hope that my hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and his colleagues will ensure that they maintain the grants that are extraordinarily important for children who do not have English as a primary language at home. At two primary schools in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, Priory lower school and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens_Park">Queens Park</a> lower school, well over 80% of pupils do not have English as a primary language. We must maintain the ethnic minority achievement grants for families where English is not the primary language spoken at home. I also draw the Minister's attention to issues of exclusion, which were mentioned by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> Secretary of State. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Autistic_Society">National Autistic Society</a> says that for children with autism the exclusion rate is 27%, but for the rest of the population it is 4%. That is a major difference that requires further consideration.</p> <p pid="b.231.0/5">My main concerns are about the proposals on academies and free schools. I like the fact that the Bill enables schools, each in their own time, to move towards becoming an academy. The Bill gives them that freedom, which they did not have before it was proposed and will not have until it is passed. I urge us all to think about talking to our own local authorities. As this strong movement towards academies moves forward, there will come a tipping point when local authorities no longer have the critical mass to offer the services they provide to the remaining schools. That is not a reason to hold back on this new-found freedom for head teachers, but a push for us to ensure that our local authorities are thinking ahead about what they will do next.</p> <p pid="b.231.0/6">The Bill overcomes inertia and intransigence and promotes inspiration. I know, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>, that you will want me to give local examples of those three things, so I will accede to that. Let me start with inertia, which comes from the local authorities. As the shadow Secretary of State desperately tried not to be on the wrong side of history, he may have put a bit too much reliance on the record of local authorities. A total of 216 schools across the country are below the national minimum standard. That gives hon. Members a one in three chance of having one in their constituency. I inherited two: that was the record that my local authority bequeathed to me when I became the <a href="/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a>.</p> <p pid="b.231.0/7">I am not going to stand for that in my constituency. One of them, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bunyan">John Bunyan</a> school, had been trailing at 19% and the low 20%s-at the lowest point, 9%-in terms of students who were achieving the minimum level of five <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCSEs">GCSEs</a>, including English and maths. Parents were voting with their feet, and its pupil numbers rolled down from 900 to 600. The school then became an academy. It has taken the action, and parents are responding. Now, its application rate makes it a 1,200-pupil school. Parents want this. They see that academies are a way of breaking down the inertia of local authorities, and I can see that in my town.</p> <p pid="b.231.0/8">We have seen intransigence from the more extreme, unreconstructed class warriors or defenders of their own self-interest-by that I mean those at the Anti Academies Alliance and their fellow travellers at the Local Schools Network, who are, around the country, doing a great disservice to parents by distorting information, in some circumstances possibly to the extent of giving misinformation, about what academies and free schools are trying to do. They are also indulging in highly personalised attacks against people who want to establish academies and free schools-attacks they would never allow on members of their own union. We have seen that in Battersea, in Stourbridge, in Hammersmith and in my own constituency.</p> <p pid="b.231.0/9">It is time that those people stopped acting as bovver boys for a Labour leadership who do not want their fingerprints on the crime of attacking people who have educational inspiration for their communities. I challenge the Labour leadership, in this debate, to draw the campaign by those groups to a close. There should be no more misinformation and no more attacks on people who are in the proudest tradition of trying to establish educational excellence in some of the most deprived areas of the country. In a blog for the Local Schools Network, the author refers to a debate in my town in which someone said of Mark Lehain, who has established a free school,</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.231.0/10">"Does he truly believe that local <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LA">LA</a> heads and teachers...are going to willingly and regularly exchange pleasantries?"</p> <p pid="b.231.0/11">Well, I have got news for that person: we do things differently in Bedford and Kempston. I am very proud of our head teachers, 34 of whom came down here to make their case to the Secretary of State. We do things as a team in Bedford. Head teachers share what they learn from each other and grow together. I am very proud to say that that exchange partnership is going to welcome the head teacher of the free school, when it is established, as part of the family of schools. That is part of showing the way forward. That is the inspiration that we need, and that is what this Bill provides.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.233.0/1">Like <a href="/mp/?m=40123" title="Our page on Charlotte Leslie - 'the hon. Member for Bristol North West (Charlotte Leslie)'">Charlotte Leslie</a>, I have changed some of what I was going to say, because I want to respond some of the outrageous and inaccurate comments made about Labour's record in office with regard to education.</p> <p pid="b.233.0/2">I want, however, to start a bit earlier than that-in the early 1990s, when I was vice-chair of education in Newcastle. I think that Conservative Members need a history lesson about what we inherited from the previous <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> Government. For very many years, because of budget cuts, all that we did when we met as an education committee was to take money out of the education system. We made teachers redundant, and we made class sizes larger and larger as the teachers disappeared, so that in the end we often had 48 or 50 pupils in our classes. When schools came to us with a request to do something about their roof leaking, we did not tell them how much money they would get or how many years it would take to mend it-we said "Go and buy buckets because there is no capital allowance for schools." The outcome was that in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> and in many areas like it, 30% of young people or fewer got five A to C grades at GCSE in any subject. This generation was, in many ways, failed by that Tory Government.</p> <p pid="b.233.0/3">When Labour came to office, we had to do something to try to reverse that dreadful situation, and we did. In my constituency, education was transformed under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a>. We not only employed lots more teachers so that we could get more specialisms into schools, but reduced class sizes drastically. We did not waste money: we built new schools, which were absolutely necessary because of the appalling state of the school estate that we inherited. Most important of all, we improved qualifications so that by last year young people in my constituency were doing better than the national average for five A to C grades at GCSE, including maths and English. That was the reality under Labour, and it is an important legacy that I hope this Government will build on, rather than simply being trashed by Government Members.</p> <p pid="b.233.0/4">In the time left, it is impossible to go through the Bill in any detail, but there are a few overriding considerations. The first is about the number of powers that are centralised in the Bill that previously resided with parents, schools, teaching agencies, the admissions adjudicator and the admissions forum. I do not see how the Bill is devolving powers to schools. Secondly, there is a lack of any clear direction on vocational skills. Thirdly, a number of the proposals could make the education system more unfair, not less.</p> <p pid="b.233.0/5">I will start with part 8, which contains clauses 70 and 71. On Friday morning, I visited <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_College_Durham">New College Durham</a> in my constituency to discuss with 16 and 17-year-olds what they felt about the abolition of the education maintenance allowance and the introduction of the new tuition fees system. Clauses 70 and 71 are important in operationalising part of that new student funding system. I do not think that that should be done in a Bill such as this and outside the <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> on higher education. I totally disagree with the market rates that are being introduced for student loans. It was quickly apparent on talking to the young people that fees of &#163;9,000 would put them off even thinking about continuing their education. They cannot comprehend the sums involved-&#163;27,000 on fees alone. When that is coupled with the payback on market interest rates, they just cannot believe that a Government of any description would ask for something that so dampens their aspirations. It was dreadful to witness that. I hope that, even at this late stage, the Government will think again about introducing this appalling and unfair system of student funding.</p> <p pid="b.233.0/6">We have to look wider than just some poor students getting to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_and_Cambridge">Oxford and Cambridge</a>. I am getting fed up with how much I hear about that in this House. Although that is important and although I want students from poorer backgrounds to go to Oxford and Cambridge, I want every young person who would benefit from it to go to higher education at the institution that suits them. Unfortunately, I do not think that will be possible with the Government proposals.</p> <p pid="b.233.0/7">I will make a couple of points about early years and charges. I would like an explanation from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> about what <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 35 means and what the impact of introducing different levels of charges for services is likely to be on children. For example, people will pay a range of sums of money for milk or school meals. How that is implemented will be important, because there is a lot of stigma when some children get things free and others have to pay.</p> <p pid="b.233.0/8">I am sorry that the Government did not take the opportunity to use the Bill to extend free school meals and to extend the pilots of universal free school meals to all areas. There is an obsession with how schools impact on children and young people, without seeing the wider context within which they live. Children need to be properly fed, and to have good parenting, housing and health to thrive in schools. They need adequate support to enable them to overcome difficulties. It is a pity that when the Government looked at Sweden's free schools, they did not look at its excellent free school meals system.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.234.0/1">I will make four points on four aspects of the Bill.</p> <p pid="b.234.0/2">In Salisbury, I am blessed with some amazing schools, from the Trafalgar school at Downton in the south to Stonehenge school in the north. I have visited them all at least twice since I was elected. The school I am most proud of is Sarum academy, which operates in one of the most challenging communities in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>. When I first visited it a few months after being elected last summer, the headmaster would not show me round the school. He sat me down and explained many of the difficulties he had encountered. To his credit, he had made great progress in the previous 12 months in meeting some of the targets that had been set for him.</p> <p pid="b.234.0/3">A few months later, I visited the school again. The excellent new principal, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Johnson">Ruth Johnson</a>, took delight in showing me round, perhaps because she was keen for me to take up the case for greater investment in the school. I am pleased to say that the Government duly heard those pleas and money has been forthcoming. She said that what was critical was not only the investment in buildings-I acknowledge what the previous <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">speaker</a> said about that sometimes being critical to lift the morale of teachers and pupils-but the discipline that she was able to instil because of the culture of the school.</p> <p pid="b.234.0/4">I welcome the provisions of the Bill, which give massive encouragement to teachers who have been struggling with discipline and pupil behaviour in recent years. It may be true, as was said by those on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a>, that the cut in advertising will have an impact on recruitment. However, I suspect that the bigger reason for the drop in the number of people who want to go into the profession is that they have been unhappy at the level of discipline that they have had to deal with, and the level of support that they have been given, in the classroom. I am delighted that the Bill gives teachers practical powers to search and confiscate possessions when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting the possession of prohibited items. They need that detailed provision to deal with some of the situations that they face. It is a scandal that a quarter of school staff have been subject to false allegations. It is important and welcome that teachers will be able to impose detentions immediately, without having to give 24 hours' notice.</p> <p pid="b.234.0/5">The Bill could go further. Like other Members, I am concerned about the provision for excluded children, particularly those who suffer from special educational needs and who need extra provision. I hope that when the Government bring forward proposals in this area, there is special investment for individual children who need extra help from the state. Vulnerable children who are excluded still have to access education and support. For the past six months, I have been battling along with my constituents Stuart and Emma Verdin to secure the right provision for their son James, and it has not been an easy process. Finding the appropriate discretion and finance for such individual cases needs to be taken seriously.</p> <p pid="b.234.0/6">I am delighted by the provisions on raising standards in schools. Currently, I do not think that educational standards have the full confidence of employers, parents and universities, particularly with respect to the examinations system. There seems to have been a conspiracy of affirmation that does not acknowledge the reality of grade inflation over the past 20 years. Every summer, every politician goes out of their way to praise the improvement in the quality of teaching. Some of that must be true, but I am not convinced that it is all true. Schools are choosing less rigorous subjects for their pupils to ensure that their league table position is maintained. That is not healthy. The provision for Ofqual to ensure that attainment standards are improved is welcome.</p> <p pid="b.234.0/7">I urge the Government to think again about the great contribution that religious studies could make to the English baccalaureate curriculum. I have been lobbied about the matter by a number of my constituents, and having studied the subject myself to the age of 18, I believe that it is of great assistance to critical thinking, teaching pupils to respect themselves and other religions, beliefs and cultures.</p> <p pid="b.234.0/8">I welcome, too, the simplification of the scrutiny process and the fact that Ofsted inspections will focus on four key areas. I welcome the fact that outstanding schools such as Bishop Wordsworth's grammar school in my constituency-soon to be, if not already, an academy-will not need to be inspected unless their performance indicators fall. That seems to me a reasonable and practical step for schools that do not need masses of attention from regulators and scrutiny by the state.</p> <p pid="b.234.0/9">I shall finish by addressing early-years provision. I echo the comments of my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40251" title="Our page on Jessica Lee - 'the Member for Erewash (Jessica Lee)'">Jessica Lee</a>, who endorsed the Bill's provision of free early-years education for two-year-olds. It is critical that the Government have a joined-up policy across education and welfare reform, which we will discuss in a couple of weeks, to ensure that poor children do not become poor adults. I endorse the report by <a href="/mp/?m=40079" title="Our page on Frank Field - 'the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)'">Mr Field</a>, who has done so much to raise awareness of the critical importance of that issue.</p> <p pid="b.234.0/10">We need to go further in recognising that there is too much micro-management in early-years provision. I remember visiting a school in my constituency last autumn and seeing pads of yellow Post-it notes lined up as the teachers and teachers' assistants were getting ready to photograph every single element of behaviour in order to demonstrate change. It is right that parents want to see some evidence of progress, but do they really need a blow-by-blow account of every time their four-year-old blows his or her nose?</p> <p pid="b.234.0/11">The Bill will make a massive contribution for children in this country and in my constituency. I have suggested a few improvements, but I welcome it massively. Those improvements can be taken on in Committee, and the Bill will make a massive contribution to education in this country.</p>            </div>

I like the parts that are intended to ensure that full funding follows an excluded child from their school. Too often, some schools have simply washed their hands of children with difficulties and problems, and hopefully the Bill will make schools think carefully, and financially, before doing so in future.</p> <p pid="b.236.0/2">I also like the plans that will, we hope, ensure that schools remain responsible for the educational outcomes of children they exclude. I have visited very many schools over very many years, from the smallest nursery schools to the highest-achieving grammar schools to the most specialist behaviour schools, and eventually the conversation always gets round to behaviour. At almost every school, I have been told at some point, "If you could just take away the five most difficult children, everything would be wonderful." But teachers know, and I know, that if they took away the five most difficult children, the next five would simply rise to the surface.</p> <p pid="b.236.0/3">Only when schools start to deal properly with their difficulties in the quality of teaching and learning, and introduce consistent approaches to behaviour and staff training, do they begin to feel confident in their ability to manage behavioural problems. I hope that preventing schools from simply washing their hands of the difficult children will make all schools begin a proper internal dialogue about those issues. I also welcome plans to provide anonymity to teachers accused by pupils until they are charged, and I hope that the Government will consider extending that to all school staff.</p> <p pid="b.236.0/4">Given that I welcome some clauses in the Bill, I hope that Members will see that my remarks today are not about <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> for opposition's sake but about making the Bill better for all children and young people, their schools and their families.</p> <p pid="b.236.0/5">I wish to focus for a while on early <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>.

Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40079" title="Our page on Frank Field - 'the Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)'">Mr Field</a>. As we all know, early intervention means not just intervention in the early years but intervention with children and young people as soon as a difficulty becomes apparent, whether that is when a special educational need is suspected, when other barriers to learning become clear or when the safety and well-being of a child or young person is suspected to be at risk.</p> <p pid="b.236.0/6">The Bill is full of good intentions about early years and early intervention, but it cannot be separated from the reality of, in some cases, biblical-sized cuts facing local authorities. In the early years, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sure_Start">Sure Start</a> is widely recognised as a distinctive and increasingly important service that plays an essential role in helping our children get the right start in life and ensuring that they are ready to learn when they start school. Both the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=91" title="The office of Deputy Prime Minister is one that has only existed..." class="glossary">Deputy Prime Minister</a> have made personal promises to keep Sure Start centres open. Even since the election, they have said that they do not want any to close, yet there are to be significant budget cuts that will mean the removal of funding for Sure Start and the ring-fencing that would have protected those centres.</p> <p pid="b.236.0/7">The Government have said that they are safeguarding Sure Start funding, but they have cleverly rolled together 10 separate and previously ring-fenced budgets, including that for Sure Start, into their new early-intervention grant. That budget will increase to &#163;2.2 billion in 2014, but they have dictated that that money has to support not only Sure Start centres but the cost of extending free education to two-year-olds; the cost of short breaks for disabled and vulnerable children; all support programmes targeted at preventing children from engaging in crime; all support programmes targeted at tackling substance misuse; all teenage pregnancy support programmes; programmes for children with mental health problems and learning difficulties; and all transition arrangements. It also has to support all behaviour support services in schools and local authorities; child and adolescent mental health services; children's community paramedic services such as speech therapy; special educational needs services; and youth services.</p> <p pid="b.236.0/8">For the Government to say that they are providing funding to support Sure Start and early intervention is not only wrong, given the current financial situation facing local authorities, but insulting. They are tying the hands of local authorities by slashing their budgets, while at the same time washing their hands of any proper support. Closures in the children's centre network are inevitable.</p> <p pid="b.236.0/9">Although I welcome some things in the Bill, some matters are missing from it that would have benefited it. I urge the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> to include measures to ensure that all schools take their fair share of pupils from poorer homes and those with special educational needs. All that we have had so far is a promise to simplify the admissions code of practice, but for many parents there are real concerns that "simplify" will mean "make opaque", and that it will therefore be easier for schools regarded as good or outstanding effectively to exclude those groups of children through their admissions policies.</p> <p pid="b.236.0/10">I also urge the Secretary of State to amend the Ofsted framework to ensure that all schools are properly held to account for all children's outcomes. That can be done by including a limiting judgment that ensures that no school can be designated an outstanding school if it cannot demonstrate, first, that it takes its fair share of pupils from poorer homes and pupils with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEN">SEN</a>, and secondly, that it is narrowing the gap between the achievements of those children and the most able in the school. In my view, that is what makes an outstanding school. Those would be real sanctions, and I recommend them to the Secretary of State if he is serious about improving outcomes for vulnerable children and those from poor homes.</p> <p pid="b.236.0/11">As well as clauses that are missing from the Bill, there are those with which I disagree outright, including the ones that reduce the powers of independent exclusions panels. They will have a direct detrimental effect on children with SEN, particularly those with hearing impairments, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette's syndrome, epilepsy and diabetes. There is a known link with behaviour when those conditions are not properly addressed. The Select Committee on Education looked at that in some detail recently, and I recall that not even one witness from across the educational divide felt that the reduction of those powers was a good thing.</p> <p pid="b.236.0/12">I disagree with the measures that seek to remove the requirement to give 24 hours' notice of detention. That is at best disrespectful to parents, and at worst a child safeguarding issue. I also disagree with the measures that repeal the duty on schools to co-operate with local authorities and those that repeal the duty on schools to have regard to children and young people's plans. As I said in an intervention, those duties have had a significant impact in reducing the number of serious case reviews in the middle years-from when a child starts school to the middle teenage years.</p> <p pid="b.236.0/13">Finally, there is much in the Bill to recommend it, but there is much that I ask the Government to reconsider.</p>            </div>

I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> of this wide-ranging Bill. In the interests of time-the fickle finger of fate is working against us-I shall focus my remarks on one aspect of education that is essential to its success: the need to drive greater aspiration.</p> <p pid="b.238.3/2">In Tamworth, we face a real challenge to encourage aspiration among our young people, because historically we have not had the sort of GCSE and A-level results that we could and should have had. However, parents, pupils and teachers are prepared to meet that challenge if they are given the tools with which to do the job.</p> <p pid="b.238.3/3">There are three essential tools to driving up aspiration among our young people, the first of which is restoring discipline in our classrooms. I do not want to go on too much about that-my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40492" title="Our page on Rob Wilson - 'the Member for Reading East (Mr Wilson)'">Mr Wilson</a> has already spoken very eloquently about it-but we know that without good discipline, there cannot be good education. We heard the statistics. There are some 18,000 assaults on teachers each year, resulting in pupils being suspended or excluded, and that does not begin to describe the pain and fear that members of the teaching profession feel when those assaults happen.</p> <p pid="b.238.3/4">Such indiscipline drives teachers out of the classroom, but it also distracts good children from their studies and means that the kids who really need help-the disadvantaged ones-do not even get into the classroom in the first place to be taught. I therefore welcome my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>'s announcement that the 24-hour notice period for detention will be abolished.

I am pleased that we will encourage ex-members of the armed forces into the teaching profession, because they have dedication and enthusiasm and they know a little bit about discipline. I am also pleased that we will free-up pupil referral units, particularly in respect of my own excellent <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRU">PRU</a> at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Rivers">Two Rivers</a> in Tamworth, to give them the opportunity to use their expertise to stem the tide of disruptive pupils who end up on the NEETs scrap heap.</p> <p pid="b.238.3/5">We also need to use teachers. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State paid tribute to them, as I do. We have some fantastic teachers in Tamworth, including a great set of maths A-level teachers at Belgrave high school. When I go to see my primary school heads at their quarterly meetings, I see the enthusiasm that they have for their subjects.</p> <p pid="b.238.3/6">However, those professional people are burdened by bureaucracy. It is our responsibility to remove that burden of responsibility from our head teachers and other teachers, so that they can get on and do what they really want to do, which is to teach. That is what the Secretary of State will do. I also think that freeing-up schools via the academies programme encourages good teachers to stay in the profession and the recruitment of good teachers. We have one academy school in Tamworth, but by the end of next year all our secondary schools should be academies. Teachers in Tamworth are embracing freedom and the choice that freedom gives them.</p> <p pid="b.238.3/7">It is important to stress vertical integration between primary and secondary schools. In Tamworth, we still have kids going into secondary school aged 11 who have a reading age of eight. Some even have reading ages of seven. I suppose that after 13 years in government, Labour might call that progressive. However, I do not think it is good enough, because it means that kids in that situation, entering Belgrave school, Wilnecote school, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth">Queen Elizabeth</a>'s Mercian school, Rawlett school or wherever, start at a disadvantage, and many of them will never catch up but will be put on the NEETs scrap heap.</p> <p pid="b.238.3/8">I hope that my hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will take note of this point, because we have discussed it before. We need to encourage greater linkage between primary and secondary schools, even joining them up, so that secondary and primary school teachers can work together to identify the children who need help and raise them up so that they are ready to go to secondary school and have the same chances as the other kids. Going to secondary school should be like going up a gentle incline; it should not be like facing a sheer cliff face. I hope that he will take that point onboard.</p> <p pid="b.238.3/9">I should like to say one more thing about secondary school education and the need for greater aspiration. It is something that is not actually in the Bill, so I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister, in his winding-up speech, will make some remarks about it. Since the Butler Act-the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Act_1944">Education Act 1944</a>-we have clung to the antiquated notion that A-level students should apply to university six months before they sit the examinations that will determine whether they go to university. It is strange that the hopes and aspirations of young people should be determined by the educated guesses of their teachers, rather than their own merits. The fact is that they are just educated guesses: 55% of predicted grades, on which universities make their conditional offers, turn out to be wrong, and it is the most disadvantaged children who suffer, because of the kids doing A-levels in the lowest socio-economic group, 61% have mis-predicted grades and a very large proportion have under-predicted grades, the result being that many of them do not go to the university they want to and many do not go to university at all. That is a travesty.</p> <p pid="b.238.3/10">I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will use all his eloquence and artistry to prevail upon the Minister for Universities and Science jointly to come up with a proposal for post-qualification applications to universities. It is a challenge, but it will mean less bureaucracy for universities and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCAS">UCAS</a>; it will end that horrible spectacle-I remember it back in 1988 when I left school-of kids going through the clearing process over the summer; and it will even up the advantage for those disadvantaged young people who currently go to university on the basis of crystal-ball gazing by their teachers, not on their merits.</p> <p pid="b.238.3/11">Apart from that one, small caveat, I think that this is a good Bill. It offers freedom to schools, and we should support it. I shall be voting for it tonight.</p>            </div>

I am from Liverpool, so I suppose I am getting used to cuts. I will try to amend my speech to fit the six minutes allocated.</p> <p pid="b.240.2/2">As we have already heard, the Bill covers a wide range of concerns-from school discipline and behaviour to schools admissions and exclusions, setting up new academies and even changes to apprenticeships and the reform of student fees and loans. It is a mishmash of proposals designed not to give everyone the best chance of a good education but to create a three-tier system of the haves, the have-nots and the have-not-got-a-chances. In the future, unless parents have money or good connections, their children will be sent to schools facing massive cuts in their budgets, while money is siphoned off to academies and free schools.</p> <p pid="b.240.2/3">Narrowing the curriculum to five subjects will mean abandoning all the young people who have thrived on vocational courses. Removing the promise of an apprenticeship will leave a legacy of young people who do not fit into this 1950s vision of what an education should be-young people consigned to the scrap heap by a <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> who cares more about Latin and the classics than he does about Liverpool and the educational attainment of children from ordinary working families.</p> <p pid="b.240.2/4">Above all, the Secretary of State is asking this House to strip local authorities of their role in managing the provision of education, and to transfer to him 50 new powers to interfere in and control almost every aspect of our schools system in England, including what subjects our children learn and what kind of schools they go to. Indeed, so much will be affected that, in view of the time, I shall confine my remarks to an aspect of education that gets little attention in the Bill, something that I believe highlights this Government's misguided priorities.</p> <p pid="b.240.2/5">We on the Labour Benches judge a society by how it treats its most vulnerable, not by how the strong prosper. In that sense, many Members have been right to express deep concern today about what the proposals will mean for the treatment of children with special educational needs. As Ofsted highlights, just over one in five pupils-1.7 million school-age children in England-are identified as having special educational needs. Critically, as a whole, pupils currently identified as having special educational needs are disproportionately from disadvantaged backgrounds, are much more likely to be absent or even excluded from school, and achieve less well than their peers, in terms of both attainment at any given age and progress over time.</p> <p pid="b.240.2/6">Getting education right for those young people transforms their chances and our ability as a society to benefit from what they could be, rather than dealing with the consequences of what they never get help to overcome. First and foremost, what many parents of children with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEN">SEN</a> in Liverpool will ask about this Bill is: how can we judge what these proposals will mean for those children if we have not even been given notice of when the special educational needs <a href="/glossary/?gl=221" title="A Green Paper is a tentative report of British government proposals without..." class="glossary">Green Paper</a> that this Government said they would publish will be published? In the absence of such information, the proposals offer little comfort to parents, who fight hard to ensure that their children receive the education they need, whatever their ability.</p> <p pid="b.240.2/7">Many in the Chamber would recognise the challenges that Ofsted identified in its work reviewing SEN schooling and in the special educational needs and disability review. However, that is why it is all the more worrying that the proposals in the Bill have been brought forward without any details outlining what they will mean for children with SEN. Under the present system, a parent of a child with SEN often fights long and hard to get their child statemented, to ensure that they can access the services necessary to address their specific requirements. Under the proposals in the Bill, I fear for those children who need the co-operation of different services to participate in education-for example, children with a disability-or to access speech and language therapy, or mental health support.</p> <p pid="b.240.2/8">It is not just in ensuring that children with special needs are supported that the cross-agency approach is important. Many of the current provisions were introduced as a result of the Laming report, as we heard earlier, following the death of Victoria Climbi&#233;, in order to protect the health, safety and well-being of children and young people. I therefore hope that Ministers will offer more than kind words for the parents of children with special educational needs who are listening today, and explain clearly how the Government's proposals and the removal of the role of local authorities will not lead to a loss in joined-up services for our most vulnerable students. We know that children with SEN or a disability are more likely to face discrimination in admissions. The outcomes of the case often depend on the evidence presented, and if-</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.242.1/1">At its heart, the Bill is about social mobility and opportunity for all, and we need to address those issues urgently. No one would doubt the good intentions of the previous Government, but the statistics are there for all to see. <a href="/mp/?m=40196" title="Our page on Jenny Chapman - 'The hon. Member for Darlington (Mrs Chapman)'">Mrs Chapman</a> complained about how much people talked about Oxbridge statistics, and <a href="/mp/?m=40451" title="Our page on Pat Glass - 'the hon. Member for North West Durham (Pat Glass)'">Pat Glass</a> said she was fed up with hearing them. Sadly, however, there are many other, equally depressing, statistics. Among young adults, there are 1 million people who are not in employment, education or training. The lower income groups, which form 50% of the population, have only a 16% representation in the top universities represented by the Russell group. A student's chances of getting five good <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCSEs">GCSEs</a> are four times as great if they have degree-educated parents than if they do not. Even at the age of three, twice as many children in the top income quintile are school-ready as in the bottom one.</p> <p pid="b.242.1/2">Problems such as social immobility did not start under the previous Government, but we have every right to expect that these things will improve constantly. I am afraid that social mobility has stalled. It is stuck stubbornly at levels that, in some cases, we barely tolerated in the 1970s. <a href="/mp/?m=40325" title="Our page on Barry Sheerman - 'The hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr Sheerman)'">Mr Sheerman</a> said that we should look for evidence-based approaches, and I could not agree more. We know what makes a difference. Given the economic legacy that my right hon. and hon. Friends on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> inherited, with the Government spending &#163;4 for every &#163;3 that they received in income, it would perhaps have been easiest to postpone any expansionary programme. However, I am pleased and proud that the Government whom I support are finding ways to extend free nursery care to two-year-olds. They are extending the participation age to 18-or continuing its extension, to be fair-and, perhaps most dramatically, introducing the pupil premium, which represents a significant structural change to the way in which we fund education.</p> <p pid="b.242.1/3">Another factor that we know from international studies makes a huge difference, not only to the overall average attainment in a school but to equality of opportunity, is the person standing at the front of the room: the teacher. That dwarfs other factors, including class size. When you, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>, and I were at school, we were taught not to judge a book by its cover. In this case, however, we can do just that, because the front page of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> tells us all that we need to know about this Government's approach. It is entitled "The importance of teaching".</p> <p pid="b.242.1/4">This will be manifested by reinforcing the status and authority of the teacher, making a clear statement that they have an absolute right to impose reasonable measures to achieve classroom discipline, and to be protected from vexatious allegations. We need to move from a situation in which difficult children mutter, "I know my rights" to one in which all children can say, "I know where I stand." Teachers repeatedly complain that they are burdened by too many targets, too much prescription and too many directives and missives landing on their doorstep. I therefore welcome the Government's approach in rationalising the national curriculum to leave more room for innovation and for learning other things.</p> <p pid="b.242.1/5">We have fantastic teachers in our school system-I think they actually work a lot harder today than they did when I was at school, and, by the way, I think the children do as well-but we need to encourage yet more talent into the profession. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teach_First">Teach First</a> has been a great programme, and I celebrate the fact that it happened on the watch of the previous Government. Now, it is going to be doubled in size, and we should all welcome that. I hope that the publicity surrounding the troops to teachers programme, to which my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40598" title="Our page on Christopher Pincher - 'the Member for Tamworth (Christopher Pincher)'">Christopher Pincher</a> referred, will send a clear signal to men that more of them are needed and welcome, particularly in the primary sector, whether or not they have been troops.</p> <p pid="b.242.1/6">Alongside mobility within the system, we also need to think about mobility opportunity for us collectively as a nation. I am afraid that one of the bad things about the past decade or so is that, as every single domestic record has been smashed, we have been falling further down the league tables. One of the most refreshing things about the new Government is that whenever anyone asks, "How did you come up with that idea?" or "Where did that one come from?", the answer starts with, "We looked at where they do it best in the world." I am pleased that that world outlook also extends to the international benchmarking of our qualifications.</p> <p pid="b.242.1/7">My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40123" title="Our page on Charlotte Leslie - 'the Member for Bristol North West (Charlotte Leslie)'">Charlotte Leslie</a> explained quite brilliantly how some of the fastest growing qualifications were not those that are sought by universities or employers but those that offered quick, short-cut ladders up the performance tables. This misleads students and flatters the system, and it does nobody any favours except in the very short term.</p> <p pid="b.242.1/8">There will be a sharper focus on the key aspects of an academic education, but, to be absolutely clear to <a href="/mp/?m=40371" title="Our page on Steve Rotheram - 'the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Steve Rotheram)'">Steve Rotheram</a>, the English baccalaureate is not all that is in the curriculum: it comprises only five core academic subjects, and I do not think that for most people, English, maths, science, a humanity and a language would be a particularly controversial definition of what should constitute an academic core. Alongside it, of course, we must have proper valuing of, and political will behind, the vocational routes and qualifications.</p> <p pid="b.242.1/9">We should not care only about headline results; we need to look at how to value every child and how to progress every child. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVA">CVA</a>-contextual value-added-is a ridiculously complex measure, which nobody I have ever met understands. We need better ways of ensuring that schools' efforts on behalf of every child are valued. Too often in this House we debate how we are going to tackle the <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">bills</a> of social failure, and I am delighted that today we are debating this Bill-a Bill for social opportunity.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.244.0/1">I will, of course, oppose this Bill because it provides yet more evidence of an elitist approach to the education of our young people. This <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a>-led Government are out of touch with teachers, with parents and with students.</p> <p pid="b.244.0/2">I get sick and tired of people doing down our young people and their very real achievements, when we should be celebrating with them and praising and encouraging them to do better. They should be able to thrive, doing the things that they do best within a balanced curriculum. Yet at Education questions yesterday, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> proudly promoted his narrow 1950s vision of what our education system should look like. His attachment to dead languages such as Latin is worrying. As Secretary of State, he has a responsibility to create a flexible education system that caters for all students-he is failing in that responsibility.</p> <p pid="b.244.0/3">The proposals for the "English baccalaureate" are a backward step, which sends our young people the message that only traditional academic subjects hold any value. Instead of telling young people what subjects they should be studying, the Secretary of State should be giving them the freedom to pursue the subjects that they are passionate about. As my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40684" title="Our page on Debbie Abrahams - 'the Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth (Debbie Abrahams)'">Debbie Abrahams</a> rightly questioned, how can the Secretary of State proclaim that Latin is more important than information technology in the 21st century?</p> <p pid="b.244.0/4">About 50% of our young people do not plan to go to university, and I think that number is going to grow as the tuition fees rises are brought into place. We have brilliant universities in this country, including the excellent Teesside and Durham universities, and the young people who aspire to attend university should be encouraged to do so. A university education, however, is not the be-all and end-all, because other things are happening in further education. We must be careful not to send the wrong message to our young people, many of whom work incredibly hard and are rightly proud of their achievements-irrespective of whether or not they reach university.</p> <p pid="b.244.0/5">This Bill contains measures that give the Secretary of State free rein to set uncapped and commercial rates of interest on student loans. The thousands of students who marched passed my office as part of the protests against the rise in tuition fees are learning government lessons the hard way, and it will be their successors who know that we are not "all in it together".</p> <p pid="b.244.0/6">Youth unemployment is at an all-time high. One in five of our young people are out of work. The Tory-led Government are in danger of creating a lost generation of young people, so why does this Bill repeal Labour's apprenticeship guarantee? With current levels of youth unemployment, we should be doing everything we can to help young people succeed in education and training. Over and again, we hear the mantra, "We're all in this together"-but not according to the large numbers of young people in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> who have e-mailed me, angry at the way their generation is being targeted by this Tory-led Government. They are most particularly concerned about the move to scrap education maintenance allowance-another broken promise to add to the list.</p> <p pid="b.244.0/7">There is much to criticise in this Bill, but I want to move on to focus on the Secretary of State's pet project of free schools. The Government's free schools initiative has serious implications for secondary education in the Stockton borough. Last week, the Secretary of State visited Stockton to announce he had given the go-ahead for an initial plan for a free school in my neighbouring constituency of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockton_South">Stockton South</a>. In my former life as a local councillor in Stockton, I was the <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">cabinet</a> member for children and young people, so I know this is a very difficult local issue.</p> <p pid="b.244.0/8"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingleby_Barwick">Ingleby Barwick</a> is a modern and growing housing development, with only one secondary school. Many hundreds of local children have to travel a few miles to get to school. Parents in Ingleby Barwick have campaigned for years for another secondary school, but if they are successful the implications will be problematic. Conyers and Egglescliffe schools-both excellent local secondary schools-rely on pupils from Ingleby Barwick to keep their numbers up. At least one of these schools serves children from my constituency and potentially would have to close if the Secretary of State were to approve a new school in Ingleby Barwick.</p> <p pid="b.244.0/9">If the free school proposal goes ahead, which other schools will suffer, and perhaps even close, as a result? That is what I and affected communities in my constituency want to know. I cannot understand how the Government can allow any school proposal to go ahead without consideration of the local authority strategy for schools. In Stockton the strategy provided for a massive expansion of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Saints">All Saints</a> school in the middle of Ingleby Barwick, which could have been facilitated without the investment that will be needed if the free school proposal is to go ahead. That idea was ditched by the Secretary of State when he axed <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Schools_for_the_Future">Building Schools for the Future</a>.</p> <p pid="b.244.0/10">It is important for parents to have influence over local schools, but free schools will undermine local authorities. I am concerned about the impact that the free schools initiative will have across the Stockton borough as communities and schools are pitted against each other. When it comes to the free schools policy, for every winner there will be an even bigger loser.</p> <p pid="b.244.0/11">The Bill requires the expenditure of hundreds of millions of pounds that would surely be better spent on supporting existing schools. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State is preoccupied with his structural changes to the education system, while neglecting what teachers and parents care about most: the provision of the best possible education and training for all our young people, not just the most academically able. Contrary to what the Secretary of State claimed, in my area children across the education system did considerably better over the past 13 years than over the previous 10. We need to work with our schools and local authorities to achieve even greater success, rather than setting school against school. Let us build on success, not abandon it.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.246.0/1">I welcome the Bill, because it will improve education in our country in the same way as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academies_Act_2010">Academies Act 2010</a> does. That is vital not just to the pupils whom we have been discussing today, but to our standing in the world. It is important to our businesses and to our economy. We are trading in an increasingly international, globalised, competitive marketplace in which the knowledge-based industries are king, and knowledge is power in the modern world.</p> <p pid="b.246.0/2">Over the past week or so, <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members have taken great delight in bandying about the words of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Richard_Lambert">Sir Richard Lambert</a>, the outgoing director general of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBI">CBI</a>, about our growth strategy. In December 2009, in an interview in <i> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian">The Guardian</a></i>, Sir Richard said that the then Government should be ashamed of the results produced by the education system. <a href="/mp/?m=40579" title="Our page on Alex Cunningham - 'The hon. Member for Stockton North (Alex Cunningham)'">Alex Cunningham</a> should interpret such comments not as an attack on the pupils who are working so hard, but as an attack on a system that has consistently and utterly failed them.</p> <p pid="b.246.0/3">Social mobility is essential, but, as was pointed out by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40227" title="Our page on Damian Hinds - 'the Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds)'">Damian Hinds</a>, it is probably at its lowest level since the 1970s. I will not pretend that responsibility for that lies only with the previous Government, but no one can escape the simple reality that education is the great route of social mobility, and that we get it wrong at our peril. Some Opposition Members are irritated by the statistic revealing that last year just 42 pupils receiving free school meals obtained places at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_and_Cambridge">Oxford and Cambridge</a>, compared to over 80 at one public school alone, Westminster. That is a disgrace, but, rather than being irritated by it, Opposition Members should feel angry and sorry for the many other children receiving free school meals who have been deprived of the opportunity to achieve the very best in their lives.</p> <p pid="b.246.0/4">I welcome many aspects of the Bill. For instance, I welcome the way in which it encourages and promotes academies and free schools. I believe that parents should be the ultimate arbiters of what is best in education. They do not need league tables. They know-as they say in Northern Ireland-what the dogs in the street know. They know a good school from a mediocre school, and it is they who are most likely to stand up for their sons and daughters. We must promote academies at every turn.</p> <p pid="b.246.0/5">I also welcome the Bill's emphasis on the importance of improving qualifications, and on ensuring that Ofqual takes account of international league tables. As was pointed out by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40123" title="Our page on Charlotte Leslie - 'the Member for Bristol North West (Charlotte Leslie)'">Charlotte Leslie</a>, there is no point in our continually looking to the past and our inflated examination results, patting ourselves on the back and telling ourselves how well we are doing domestically, when we are plummeting in the international league tables year after year. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA">PISA</a> numbers have frequently been cited in the debate. <a href="/mp/?m=40325" title="Our page on Barry Sheerman - 'The hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr Sheerman)'">Mr Sheerman</a> rightly pointed a finger at them, saying, "You can't quite compare one year with another, as there's a different cohort." There may be some truth in that, but even Opposition Members must on occasion have pause for thought about the fact that there has been such a slump consistently over time.</p> <p pid="b.246.0/6">It is important that through this Bill we get a firm grip on the issue of school discipline. Some 1,000 pupils are excluded each day for abusive or possibly even assault-based behaviour, and many teachers are being put off from even going into the classroom as a consequence. It is right that teachers should now be given the authority to search pupils; we should trust them to do that. Among the items they are currently not allowed to search for are hardcore pornography and video cameras, which can be used to film disruptive incidents that can then be posted on the web. It is right that we should empower them to take the necessary action.</p> <p pid="b.246.0/7">It is also extremely important that we afford teachers our protection in respect of unfair claims made against them by pupils. An <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Teachers_and_Lecturers">Association of Teachers and Lecturers</a> survey has shown that about one in four teachers have been the recipient of false claims, and I welcome the Government's commitment to ensuring that they are given anonymity up until the point at which they are-or are not-charged.</p> <p pid="b.246.0/8">I welcome the Bill, and I want it to be a moment of hope not just for the children who are currently at school, but for future generations yet to come. I hope they will look back and see that this was a moment when their life chances were improved immeasurably.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.247.0/1">I welcome some of the Bill's measures, in particular the commitment to retain the extension of free early-years provision to two-year-olds, which could not be more important. I am sorry it is no longer envisaged as a universal provision, but I am grateful to Ministers for deciding to protect it for the targeted few at least. I would also welcome clarity on how it is to be funded.</p> <p pid="b.247.0/2">I am less enthusiastic about the Bill's provisions on behaviour and discipline, however. I am a member of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Committee">Education Committee</a>, and we have spent a considerable amount of time debating that topic and hearing about it from witnesses in evidence, and it seems to me that there are two key principles: first, powers and protection for staff; and secondly, protection and freedom for pupils. I think Ministers have got that balance wrong. We heard from a range of witnesses and we could not find any evidence that over several years behaviour had worsened. In fact, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of witnesses agreed with Ofsted that the vast majority of behaviour in schools is good and no worse than previously.</p> <p pid="b.247.0/3">I also think Ministers have got the balance wrong because there is cause to believe that their proposals may make the situation worse. The relationship between pupils and teachers should be based on mutual respect. Pupils learn by example and flourish in strong, trusting relationships with adults, yet what is proposed in the Bill is largely a one-way street that says to pupils, "We expect you to respect us, but we won't respect you back." No-notice detentions, which I raised earlier, are a pressing example of that. I am particularly concerned about them in respect of young carers, but I am concerned not only for the children but for teachers as well. The point that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> failed to understand when responding to my question was that teachers do not necessarily know that young people have caring responsibilities. Rather than trusting teachers, this Government are putting them in an impossible position. This "bureaucratic burden" of giving notice is an important safeguard for teachers as well.</p> <p pid="b.247.0/4">The same could be said of powers of search. Many of the teaching unions have said that they think what is proposed will lead to a rise in the number of legal cases against teachers, and I am extremely concerned about the protection for those teachers. Will the Secretary of State support teachers when a legal case is brought against them for overstepping their powers of search? If not, this is not so much liberation for teachers as abandonment.</p> <p pid="b.247.0/5">There are signs that the Government wish to protect teachers, however. I am particularly grateful that the plans to remove the requirement to record incidents of the use of force have been reconsidered, because that is an important safeguard. Like many others, I welcome measures to protect anonymity, but why do they not also apply to support staff? We must be careful not to create an impression that, with the abolition of the school support staff negotiating body, we are saying to support staff that they do not matter.</p> <p pid="b.247.0/6">I am also at a loss to understand why safeguards on exclusions are being removed, given that statistics show that head teacher decisions are overturned in only 2% of cases. I know from experience that we do not always get this right; looked-after children are nine times more likely and children with special educational needs are eight times more likely to be excluded from schools than others. That can produce appalling results, and are we seriously saying to children who have suffered that injustice that they cannot go back to the school where their friends are?</p> <p pid="b.247.0/7">For the most vulnerable children the Bill seems to be a disastrous unravelling of a decade of progress. I am concerned about the removal of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_Act_2004">Children Act 2004</a> duty to co-operate. As a school governor, I know that schools are really busy and pressed for time. That is why it is so important that they are required to sit round the table and take the time to talk to partners. I say to Ministers that, by taking schools out of that equation, they are putting children at risk. I urge them to reconsider.</p> <p pid="b.247.0/8">I am not at all convinced by the fairness of the new school arrangements and I am particularly concerned about admissions forums. Ministers are reviewing the code with a view to slimming it down so, with the abolition of admissions forums and the watering down of powers for the school adjudicator, we simply do not know which standards, if any, schools will be held to for admissions. We need to know that if we are to understand the Bill's implications.</p> <p pid="b.247.0/9">I am most concerned about the aggressive expansion of new-style academies and free schools, for which the Bill provides. In my local area, a campaign group, Save Wigan Schools, is battling against academies, not just for the children who will lose out as a result of academies, but for teachers. According to international studies, their pay and conditions are one of the key factors, so I say to Members on the Government Benches that this is a problem not just for teachers, but for children, as the evidence tells us that through pay and conditions we raise standards. I was appalled to see a letter from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hill">Lord Hill</a>, the Education <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, telling schools not to sign up to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASUWT">NASUWT</a>'s pay and conditions agreement. I say to those Government Members who talked about bullying tactics, if that is not a bullying tactic, what is?</p> <p pid="b.247.0/10">My chief concern is that the Bill will entrench segregation and widen the achievement gap. I welcome the increase in the participation age, but how are students expected to carry on without the education maintenance allowance? Although the Bill contains measures that I welcome, its general direction is of great concern: it introduces more centralisation and prescription; it is based on a lack of respect for children; in reality, it removes protection for teachers; it shows a shocking lack of respect for the valuable contribution made by school support staff; and, most importantly, it is based on a vision of competition between schools that is sure to create winners and losers. The Bill undermines the key principle that education is a public good, held and managed in trust for the wider community. For that reason, the Bill will not just disadvantage the most disadvantaged children; it will disadvantage us all, and I will not be voting for it.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.249.0/1">This has been an interesting debate, with the Bill having been described variously as minor tinkering building on Blairite successes and as creating a wasteland in education across England and Wales-and that is just from Labour Members. We have heard some very diverse opinions from them. Although there was some good in what <a href="/mp/?m=40658" title="Our page on Lisa Nandy - 'the hon. Member for Wigan (Lisa Nandy)'">Lisa Nandy</a> said, she fails to understand the reality of what classroom teachers face in our schools today.</p> <p pid="b.249.0/2">An awful lot of myth has been put about in respect of many of the Bill's proposals. I am broadly supportive of the Bill, although it contains bits that I do not particularly agree with and so I will get those out of the way first. Since I have been in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>, I have learned that legislation is like a box of chocolates: you do not like everything in it. I am not a particular fan of the forced raising of the participation age to 18, but I am probably out of sync with many people, on both sides of the debate, about that. I also have some concerns about the changes to student loan interest and I have some issues to raise about the English baccalaureate, which I shall discuss in a moment. Those are my minor concerns with the Bill, but in general I am a huge supporter of it and of the ministerial team in this Department, who have the best interests of this country's young people at heart.</p> <p pid="b.249.0/3">I wish to deal with some of the points made by <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members about bringing unqualified people into the classroom, as if that were something new. I intervened on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> on this matter. The practice is not new, although there are more unqualified staff teaching young people in our country today than at any time since the war and possibly ever. Studies have been done by the unions to prove that. Some of that teaching has been very good and in some circumstances schools have had to go down that route, because standards have slipped in some of our schools and they have been unable to recruit qualified staff. There is nothing wrong with bringing in people from different backgrounds. My personal view is that once they are teaching in the classroom, they should at least follow a route to a formal qualification. We should make that process as easy as possible, because it is desirable. When I did my post-graduate certificate of education, I learned important things in the classroom that people cannot necessarily obtain outside the classroom. We should not be worried about bringing in people from different backgrounds.</p> <p pid="b.249.0/4">The hon. Members for Wigan and for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield,_Heeley">Sheffield, Heeley</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meg_Munn">Meg Munn</a>) have mentioned discipline. In specific circumstances, the power to search pupils there and then is important. One may have concerns about the wording of the provision, but sometimes situations arise in schools where classroom teachers need to act immediately-I can think of a number of situations in which it would be important to conduct a search there and then for the safety of other people in school. The power is important, but it is a permissive power, because Ministers would prefer teachers not to have to search young people.</p> <p pid="b.249.0/5">On notice for detentions, there are times in teachers' careers when they need to act there and then, because it is important to deal with an issue at the end of the school day. I taught at an incredibly difficult school, and I remember a huge problem on the local estate when a large number of our young people got involved in physical fights with another school-the situation also involved some parents, which was not helpful. We needed to deal with that situation there and then, and writing to say that we wanted to see a child in 24 hours' time was not helpful. We had to deal with the situation there and then, but we were hamstrung by the rules.</p> <p pid="b.249.0/6">The hon. Member for Wigan has raised the issue of discipline. I did not want to write home to some pupils' parents to tell them that their child had a detention; I wanted to deal with the situation myself, because I knew that if I made contact with some of those young people's homes, their lives would be made much more difficult. I would prefer to deal with such issues in the way in which I see fit rather than necessarily by engaging with parents. There is a protection issue for young people.</p> <p pid="b.249.0/7">I do not have a great deal of time left, so I will not discuss exclusions, but I will comment on the curriculum and standards. I welcome the review of Ofsted, but the issue always comes down to interpretation. It is virtually impossible for a school to put itself through an Ofsted inspection in an honest way. The school has to step up to a mark that is not necessarily sustainable throughout the whole school year and jump through hoops that are impossible in any other circumstances. Classroom teachers are asked to do things that it is not possible to do all the time. I welcome the changes, but I hope that Ofsted's interpretation will change.</p> <p pid="b.249.0/8"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_English">The English</a> baccalaureate is not simply a case of requiring schools to do certain subjects. However, it is probably drawn a little too narrowly, particularly where schools are required to do modern foreign languages. It might be very good to get young people to do modern foreign languages-I make these remarks as a history teacher, who will benefit from the change-but in a selfless act I appeal for the baccalaureate to be drawn a little more widely, because we will end up with its being used as a measure. In schools such as the one where I used to teach, engaging children and young people in modern foreign languages who may not receive support at home is incredibly difficult, and those schools will be judged against that standard, no matter how much we try to make it a secondary standard.</p> <p pid="b.249.0/9">I am sorry that I do not have time to continue in further detail. I say to Ministers that the Bill is good and that I will support it, but please will they think again about the English baccalaureate?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.251.0/1">Thank you, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>, for instinctively knowing that I wanted to be called after <a href="/mp/?m=40119" title="Our page on Andrew Percy - 'the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy)'">Andrew Percy</a>, who talks an awful lot of sense particularly about the English baccalaureate.</p> <p pid="b.251.0/2">Today is an opportunity for us to discuss the principle of the Bill, which is why it is so disappointing that the first 52 minutes of the debate were about politics. A number of elephant traps were set to try to make the Labour party look as though it were the roadblock to reform, which is not the case.</p> <p pid="b.251.0/3">The Bill raises important issues. It includes a shift from <a href="/glossary/?gl=101" title="Whitehall is a wide road that runs through the heart of Westminster,..." class="glossary">Whitehall</a> to the classroom, but it also goes in other directions. It goes from local people, in the form of local authorities, to individual schools. Parts 5 and 6, in particular, relate to local authorities and schools admissions and they will remove the admissions role of schools adjudicators, increase the emphasis on academies and remove the requirement to consult on them. Also relevant are free schools, appropriate consultation and the disappearance of local admissions forums. All those issues point to a broad but consistent agenda that seeks to undermine the role of local authorities and each of us in our individual locations. We are losing the sense that we are together making decisions in our towns and cities about how we educate our young people. There are trade-offs involved and we should not seek to minimise them. This is our role in debating the principles behind the Bill.</p> <p pid="b.251.0/4">There has been a lot of talk on both sides about the number of young people coming from a free school meals background and going to Cambridge. I came from a free school meals background and went to Cambridge, so I would have been included in the figures. Much as I am concerned about that issue, I am more concerned about the young people in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> who come from a free school meals background, or just above that line, and who are not achieving the results that they should. I went to a comprehensive school in Luton and when I left school in 1998, which is not so long ago, only one third of young people in my constituency were achieving five <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCSEs">GCSEs</a> at grades A to C-the kind of thing that would help them to get on in life. At the time of the last election, the figure was two thirds, so real progress was made under Labour.</p> <p pid="b.251.0/5">I concede that much of that progress was made as a result of the arguments about whether we should have more choice and more autonomy in schools. We have two excellent academies in Luton, one of which started in my constituency and will shortly move into a new building. I do not want to undermine the ability of people to come in and turn around schools that are really struggling, but we should not pretend there is no trade-off in relation to the power of individual heads versus power being pooled, or to the sense that together we are educating our young people.</p> <p pid="b.251.0/6">The situation in Luton illustrates those points very well. We had 11 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Schools_for_the_Future">Building Schools for the Future</a> projects cancelled in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSF">BSF</a> cancellations. For us, the projects were not just about providing world-class facilities but about providing the additional capacity that we desperately need. We have a major issue with our primary schools: we have projected that we will need another 5,000 places at a cost of &#163;76 million, but we will get only &#163;4 million over the next four years. As a result of more providers coming in, there is a disjointed admissions policy and successful free schools and academies, will serve only to increase the gap. My concern is that we are squeezing provision and narrowing the options in places such as Luton about how to respond to the diverse challenges required in education. The choice is between academies and free schools or nothing. There is not even a chance to expand good-quality comprehensive education because no additional is money coming in and there is no scope for local people to step in, through the realms of the local authority, and choose what type of school is appropriate for them.</p> <p pid="b.251.0/7">Last weekend, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League">English Defence League</a> was in Luton and it raised the issue, once again, of community cohesion in our town. Education is about more than children achieving what they can in terms of grades and results. It is also about the kind of society that we want to create. If we want a comprehensive and mixed society in which people from different backgrounds come together, surely in a place such as Luton comprehensive education is the ideal. We have schools that are doing the work and want to expand, so why close them off and tell them that the only route is through free-school education? Schools are drilling down into more reduced catchment areas and the only route to expanding capacity is through academies or free schools. The slimmed-down admissions codes that are coming might make the situation even worse.</p> <p pid="b.251.0/8">In his speech, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> cast himself as a brave reformer and cast Labour Members as the luddites who refuse to adapt to a changing world, but that is not the case. I believe there is a move, which started under the previous Government and continues under this one, to put more power into the hands of individual head teachers and away from local authorities, which are tasked with the responsibility of together finding a response that is appropriate to their setting. We have to accept that doing that comes with a cost. If the very principle of the Bill is to suck power away from the pooling of heads, we will have a model for education that is prescribed, controlled and modelled. In Luton, the effect of the Bill will be to store up problems for the future and for that reason-for my constituents-I will not vote for it tonight.</p>            </div>

As a recipient of free school meals who went to his local comprehensive and then to a red-brick university, I think there has been too much concentration on Oxbridge in the debate tonight. There are significant aspects of the Bill that need improving in Committee, but we should recognise the improvements that the Bill will bring to education across the country.</p> <p pid="b.252.0/2">As I have gone round the schools in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, I have seen that they share a number of concerns. In the last year of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a>, they received 5,000 pages of diktats and orders from <a href="/glossary/?gl=101" title="Whitehall is a wide road that runs through the heart of Westminster,..." class="glossary">Whitehall</a>. They faced unnecessary bureaucratic interference. In most schools, which are excellent, head teachers know what to do, teachers know what to do, and they can get on with the job. They do not need diktats from Whitehall telling them how they should behave and how they should operate. I am glad that that will be swept away by the Bill.</p> <p pid="b.252.0/3">All the schools in my constituency have excellent disciplinary records, with firm discipline and leadership from the top. They say that when they have to exclude a pupil, they do so regretfully. They do not rush to do so. They try to support the pupil all the way until, regrettably, an exclusion is necessary. I speak as someone who served on a governing body for a long time and had to chair exclusion panels and go through the appeals process after the exclusions were upheld. It is a nightmare for the head teachers and for the governors, and it is unfair to the poor children who are excluded. We must give head teachers and teachers the power to do what they need to do to maintain discipline in the school so that those children can be taught in a properly disciplined way, and so that they can aspire to be the best that they can be. Without strong discipline, there can be no learning.</p> <p pid="b.252.0/4">I would like to see some aspects of the Bill improved. The first concerns the anonymity of individuals who have been accused of crimes, about which others have spoken. I agree that teachers should be protected, but so should support staff. In a school where I was a governor, the school caretaker, sadly, was accused-falsely, I am pleased to say-of the rape of a young child. The stain on his character after being named everywhere left his life in ruins. It is not fair for that individual or any member of school staff who has been falsely accused to suffer that. We should extend anonymity to support staff.</p> <p pid="b.252.0/5">We need to get right the issue of standard assessment tests, which are not mentioned in the Bill. For far too long, teachers in primary schools have had to teach to the SATs and the league tables, rather than teaching the children to the best of their ability and as broadly as possible.</p> <p pid="b.252.0/6">We must look at the subjects taught in our schools. I share with <a href="/mp/?m=40380" title="Our page on Gavin Shuker - 'the hon. Member for Luton South (Gavin Shuker)'">Gavin Shuker</a> the fact that the vast <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of the schools in my constituency have a majority of children for whom English is an additional language. Far from learning French or German, learning Hindi or Gujarati would be far more appropriate for them. It should be an option for them to achieve in schools. When we are talking about global expansion and our relationship with India and the far east, why should we limit ourselves to teaching European languages? That aspect must be examined as the Bill progresses.</p> <p pid="b.252.0/7">Finally, we need to consider the bureaucracy that has built up and the ability of academies to set themselves free and be a beacon of excellence in their communities. I was one of those who opposed the Labour Government's academy programme because I felt that it was far too elitist. It encouraged people who did not necessarily have the best interests of education at heart to take over schools.</p> <p pid="b.252.0/8">The beauty of the Bill and of the agenda that we are pursuing is that they offer all children the opportunity to succeed to their optimum ability. They will not be limited necessarily by their parentage or by where they come from. By offering that opportunity to everyone, from all walks of life and all backgrounds, we will give children the opportunity to succeed in a much more equal society where their ability can come to the fore and where that is what is important, rather than the accident of their birth. I strongly support the Bill.</p>            </div>

Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman)'">Bob Blackman</a>, who has broken the overwhelming trend in the contributions we have heard from the Government Members, which has been to paint a virtually dystopian picture of education in our country in which virtually every classroom is a battlefield, every teacher is incompetent and lacking in inspiration, every child is badly taught and where examination results are lamentable in comparison with other countries.</p> <p pid="b.254.0/2">The ability of children who receive free school meals to make it to Oxbridge seems to have been the recurring theme. <a href="/mp/?m=40155" title="Our page on Mel Stride - 'The hon. Member for Central Devon (Mel Stride)'">Mel Stride</a>, who was the most recent Member to make that contribution, gave the example of Westminster school. If he is so concerned, why is he not arguing ferociously with the Government to fund pupils in our schools to the level charged in fees by Westminster and for class sizes to be as small as the standard not only in Westminster, but in every private school in this country?</p> <p pid="b.254.0/3">As far as I can see, the Bill is a typical Government piece of legislation; it purports to be under the overarching aegis of giving back to people in this country the right to make local decisions that affect them in their local areas, but it does exactly the opposite. It will put powers into the hands of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> that are currently undreamt of by many local authorities and by the schools in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>.</p> <p pid="b.254.0/4">What I find most paradoxical is the way Government Members have bought what the Government are attempting to sell in the Bill. It starts with early-years education, because the Govt have trumpeted loud and long that every disadvantaged two-year-old-we are yet to know what will constitute that disadvantage because the Government have given us no detail-will be able to have nursery education. They then attempt to convince us that a child going from age two to five will of course be given a place in a local primary school-there is a desperate need for primary school places in my constituency-and that there will then be a gradual progression on to secondary school. Hang on a moment, because it looks, certainly from what the Government have said and from what has happened in my constituency, as though when children get to the age of 11 there will be no comprehensive schools left, only academies and free schools. The central and monstrous aspect of the Bill is that is will reintroduce a form of selection in schools. If there is no concerted local area agreement on what constitutes an admissions policy for all schools, we will see a return to what people of my generation lived through, which is the "them and us" approach to education for all our children.</p> <p pid="b.254.0/5"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State's speech this afternoon culminated with the example of two schools that he admires and wants us to admire, but he ignored the fact that they rose to their present heights under a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a>.</p>            </div>

I shall not go down the road of discussing the abolition of the education maintenance allowance for those who stay on at school until aged 18.</p> <p pid="b.255.3/3">For Liberal Democrat party members-who I presume obtained their degrees from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontius_Pilate">Pontius Pilate</a> school of political philosophy-to support this Bill is yet something else of which they have real cause to be ashamed.

Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40076" title="Our page on Graham Stuart - 'the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart)'">Mr Stuart</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Committee">Education Committee</a> Chairman, who, towards the beginning of the debate, talked about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a> and how important education was to him.</p> <p pid="b.255.4/2">When Disraeli was talking about education, however, Bismarck was launching secondary education in Germany, and we did not get around to that until 1944. Education has always been a case of catch-up for us, and that is one reason why it is so important to focus on international comparisons. The first battle that we have to fight is the battle between ourselves and other nation states. It is an important battle and one for which we have plenty of weapons. One is having trust and confidence in our head teachers, another is having trust and confidence in our teachers and another is ensuring that our reform of the education system empowers schools to get on with their job.</p> <p pid="b.255.4/3">The second battle that we have to fight is the battle for fairness, and this legislation helps in that regard, too, because, first, 120,000 two-year-olds will receive proper reading support, which is absolutely imperative, and secondly, we are investing &#163;2.5 billion in the pupil premium. Those are signal efforts to ensure that we can win the battle for fairness. So there are two battles, and both are critical.</p> <p pid="b.255.4/4">I shall comment on a few aspects of the Bill which have not been mentioned. First, on our proposals to reform Ofsted, we are right to ensure that it focuses on teaching, leadership and management, not on peripheral matters which are important, but not to the exclusion of what goes on in the classroom. So the first thing I say is, "Get it right over Ofsted." That leads me on to <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>.</p>            </div>

In my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> we have one or two, but a failing school is not a good school and we should never, ever tolerate it. So we have to ensure that action is taken.</p> <p pid="b.256.1/3">Secondly, I welcome our focus on 16 to 19-year-old education. We are empowering the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> to be in charge of that budget, and quite right too, because we cannot have people sitting in the same college classroom receiving funding from different sources and, often, different levels of funding. That is not satisfactory, and we should not tolerate it, because we have to address the skills shortage and tackle the fact that too many people do not receive sufficient training when they need it. That is bad for the first battle to which I referred, in terms of our contest with other nation states, and it is bad for the small and medium-sized businesses in our constituencies. Let us be clear about this: our focus on skills training is absolutely right.</p> <p pid="b.256.1/4">On the baccalaureate, it is not right to say that children should not have proper education in the key subjects-they should. That is what we are saying in the Bill, and quite right too. I fully support that.</p> <p pid="b.256.1/5">The responsibility for ensuring that the leadership and management of a school are properly focused will come down to governance, and the Bill needs to say more about that. We must remember two things about governance. First, we must focus on the skills of governors to ensure that they are willing and able to challenge the teachers and head teachers when appropriate. They must have the confidence to stand up and say, "Enough is enough", because they are standing up for our children. Secondly, we should think less about the representative side of governance and more about what governors do and the responsibilities they have. I should like to draw that to the attention of the Secretary of State.</p> <p pid="b.256.1/6">In summary, I support the Bill. Of course it can be improved, as can all pieces of legislation. However, the two battles that I mentioned are the battles we fight and the battles we must win.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.256.2/1">I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Government on bringing it before the House.</p> <p pid="b.256.2/2">We have heard many passionate speeches today about education. I agreed with <a href="/mp/?m=40325" title="Our page on Barry Sheerman - 'the hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr Sheerman)'">Mr Sheerman</a> when he said that across the House we want all children to achieve their potential. I think we all agree with that.</p> <p pid="b.256.2/3">Education will determine our country as a nation, creating a strong foundation on which we can build for the future. It is about giving children a great start in life, increasing a child's options, reducing crime and strengthening our entrepreneurship ability and the growth of our economy in the long term. That is one of the reasons I came into politics. If I could do one thing in politics, it would be to create aspiration for all across society, as my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40598" title="Our page on Christopher Pincher - 'the Member for Tamworth (Christopher Pincher)'">Christopher Pincher</a> said. That is why I became a school governor, like so many others here. Like my hon. Friends the Members for Gosport (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Dinenage">Caroline Dinenage</a>) and for Salisbury (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Glen">John Glen</a>), I have been visiting all the schools on my patch, including Heathland school, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Green">The Green</a> school, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isleworth_and_Syon">Isleworth and Syon</a> school and Chiswick community school.</p> <p pid="b.256.2/4">I would like briefly to mention three issues, the first of which is discipline. Like my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40155" title="Our page on Mel Stride - 'the Member for Central Devon (Mel Stride)'">Mel Stride</a>, I think it is an absolute scandal that every school day nearly 1,000 children are excluded from school for abusing and assaulting staff and fellow pupils. Major assaults on staff have reached a five-year high, and that cannot be tolerated. Discipline, as my mother would say, starts at home, but sadly not all children have this. In my experience of working as a school governor, discipline is absolutely critical to the success of a school. The head of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland_Park">Holland Park</a> school, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Hall">Colin Hall</a>, who is also a constituent of mine, transformed the school by introducing a structure, values, pride, order and expectations. He introduced a clear code of conduct that was about creating a standard of zero tolerance whereby certain things were no longer acceptable, and the students abided by it. I believe that the measures in the Bill will help to restore that balance of power in schools, giving heads and teachers more support in their efforts to maintain discipline in the classroom.</p> <p pid="b.256.2/5">My second point is about the curriculum. My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40333" title="Our page on Andrew Turner - 'the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr Turner)'">Mr Turner</a> mentioned the international league tables for education. It is unacceptable that in the UK we have been falling down those league tables. My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40123" title="Our page on Charlotte Leslie - 'the Member for Bristol North West (Charlotte Leslie)'">Charlotte Leslie</a> spoke eloquently about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> figures, which show that we have slipped from 7th to 25th in reading, from 8th to 28th in maths, and from 4th to 16th in science. This has to be changed, and we must sort it out. I want to restore academic excellence in the UK. I agree with introducing the English baccalaureate because we want academic excellence for all. We want all children to have the opportunity to achieve that excellence. Education has traditionally been the core strength of this country, but we have let it slip and need to get it back on track. The proposals in the Bill will raise educational standards and give the next generation the education that it deserves.</p> <p pid="b.256.2/6">On post-16 education, I welcome, especially in national apprenticeships week, the Government's approach to apprenticeships. That investment is about creating skills and jobs for the future.</p> <p pid="b.256.2/7">Finally, as my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40067" title="Our page on Richard Fuller - 'the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)'">Richard Fuller</a> said, the Bill gives us the inspiration to create free schools. Given that I need a new school in Brentford and Isleworth, I encourage parents, teachers, co-operatives and charitable trusts to create something for the future.</p> <p pid="b.256.2/8">In conclusion, we need to give all children the best possible chance in life by giving them a great education, skills and aspirations so that they can go on to do their best and be the best that they can be. Teachers have a special role in helping children to believe in themselves and achieve their potential. The Bill will allow them to do that by restoring discipline, reducing bureaucracy and raising standards, which will create a better future for us all.</p>            </div>

Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40529" title="Our page on Meg Munn - 'the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn)'">Meg Munn</a> and others to ensure that the proposals are not window dressing, but a genuine enhancement of what we achieved in office. We will consider whether they will cause more problems for teachers and schools. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_1">Part 1</a> of the Bill seeks to build on the revolution in early-years provision that Labour pioneered in office. In particular, we will look closely at the power the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> is awarding himself to decide who gets early-years teaching, how much and when. We will approach the Bill in Committee in that way.</p> <p pid="b.258.4/3">Overall, we oppose the Bill on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> because, along with a number of other pieces of legislation, it fits in with the ideology of the coalition Government; an ideology that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lib_Dems">Lib Dems</a> appear to have been duped into going along with, having been seduced, it seems, by Lady Localism. Well, she is not what she seems in this Bill and I ask the Lib Dems to consider carefully what the Bill does about localism. Localism, for them, used to mean enhancing local democracy. This fits in with the Orwellian use of language that the Government have adopted. Just as for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a> a curfew has become an "overnight residence requirement", localism is used to describe a Bill that takes away local democratic power from communities, teachers and parents, and puts the power into the hands of one man-the Secretary of State. The Bill is described, unbelievably, as a decentralising measure, but he is taking more than 50 new powers to himself to control almost every single aspect of the schools system.</p>            </div>

As the title suggests, there are two characters. Pinky is good-natured, but he is dominated by the Brain, who is self-centred and thinks he is a genius. Every episode, after the opening titles, there is the following piece of dialogue: Pinky says, "Gee, Brain, what do you want to do tonight?", and the Brain says, "The same thing we do every night, Pinky. Try to take over the world." That could almost be a transcript of the ministerial meeting at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Education">Department for Education</a>. I know the Secretary of State thinks he is clever, possibly the cleverest boy in the Government, but trying to create an education system in his own image, with all the powers in his own hands, is ultimately a recipe for chaos, not world domination.</p> <p pid="b.259.3/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State is so intent on making sure that he grabs all the power to himself that he is getting rid of some of the bodies that might get in the way of his scheme not once but twice. Bodies such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Teaching_Council">General Teaching Council</a>, which was set up to give teachers the same professional autonomy as other valued professions, are abolished not only in this Bill but in the Public Bodies Bill, presumably just in case abolishing them once is not enough to make absolutely certain that they are absolutely dead. It is in case they suddenly rise up, like the false ending of some schlock horror film. We knew that the Secretary of State had a penchant for drama-we see it every week in the Chamber-although, I hasten to add, not enough of a penchant to include it in the English baccalaureate. However, killing a body twice to make sure it is dead is a bit over the top, even for him.</p> <p pid="b.259.3/4">Why this centralising power grab? It is not just power for power's sake, it is part of his vision of education. In their mind's eye, the Secretary of State and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_State">Minister of State</a> see serried ranks of schoolchildren sitting at individual desks, preferably wearing short trousers, chanting after their teacher their conjugated Latin verbs and copying down the dates of the kings and queens of England from the board. <i> [Interruption.] </i>Did I hear a "Hear, hear" from the Conservative Benches? I think I might have done.</p> <p pid="b.259.3/5">If the Secretary of State thinks that is how to raise standards, he is wrong. A curriculum designed to train a few people to run the empire is not a system that will inspire and motivate the next generation to use their talent and creativity to the maximum benefit of themselves and the country. He has made it clear that in his mind a grade C GCSE in an ancient language, a laudable achievement in itself, is more valued than an A* in engineering or information and communications technology. He is, to coin a phrase, creating an analogue curriculum for a digital age.</p> <p pid="b.259.3/6">All pupils need the basic building blocks of literacy and numeracy, but beyond that, corralling pupils into a narrow range of subjects post-16 restricts choice and stifles creativity. Schools up and down the country, having been nudged by the Secretary of State with his loaded gun, are busily rewriting their timetables and pressurising pupils into taking <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCSEs">GCSEs</a> that are not necessarily the best ones for them to fulfil their individual talents. We must bear in mind the fact that they will already have studied history, geography, science and a modern language through the national curriculum. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_English">The English</a> bac took a bit of a kicking from some Members on his own side of the House today, and he should listen to what they had to say.</p> <p pid="b.259.3/7">Why is the Secretary of State doing all this? Just so that at the end of this Parliament, he can point to a measure that he invented and imposed ex post-that is a bit of Latin, in case anybody did not know-and say, "Look how we've improved things. More people are studying the subjects that we have retrospectively said they should have been studying all along." It is actually pretty hard for people to fail a test when they have set the questions themselves. The provisions in the Bill on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA">PISA</a> tables are fine, but the Secretary of State had better stop misquoting statistics that he knows the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> has disowned, and he had better stop ignoring evidence, such as that from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> or Scandinavia, when it does not suit his overall vision.</p> <p pid="b.259.3/8">When the Secretary of State finally gets round to saying something about vocational education, which he seems fundamentally to believe is for people who do not do well academically, he should remember that medicine is a vocational training that he ought to support. His problem is that he sees the English baccalaureate as the premiership and any league table of vocational qualifications as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beazer_Homes">Beazer Homes</a> league-<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I agree that there is nothing wrong with the Beazer Homes league.</p> <p pid="b.259.3/9">Finally, presumably the Secretary of State blames the previous <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> for the decline in social mobility in Government Ministers, and believes that it is our fault that the Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> is dominated by old Etonians, because we did not do enough on social mobility in government. On that point, I shall sit down.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.261.0/1">This has been an excellent debate, with speeches delivered with passion and expertise on a subject that could not be more important. In the words of <a href="/mp/?m=40624" title="Our page on Kate Hoey - 'the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)'">Kate Hoey</a>, who made a principled speech in support of the Bill, the debate is about the education of the next generation and a Bill that will determine the kind of society we have in 20 or 30 years' time.</p> <p pid="b.261.0/2">Between April 2009 and March 2010, 20,094 children rang <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChildLine">ChildLine</a> because they were being bullied at school. The median age of the children concerned was between 10 and 14, and 342 of those children were so traumatised that they were considering suicide. It is unacceptable that a child's education and childhood should be blighted by such stress. The coalition Government are committed to tackling all forms of bullying in our schools, including homophobic bullying, and the Bill makes a start by tackling the root cause of bullying-poor behaviour in our schools.</p> <p pid="b.261.0/3">Last year, 2,890 pupils were expelled from school for violent or abusive behaviour, and, as my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40492" title="Our page on Rob Wilson - 'the Member for Reading East (Mr Wilson)'">Mr Wilson</a> pointed out, 1,000 pupils were suspended every day for such behaviour. The Bill ensures that when such a pupil is expelled, the appeals panel will be unable to require a school to take them back against its wishes.</p> <p pid="b.261.0/4">We want to tackle violent behaviour, but we also want to tackle the widespread and corrosive, low-level disruption that challenges teachers throughout the day, which serves to deter people from entering the profession and pushes many to leave it. According to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Foundation_for_Educational_Research">National Foundation for Educational Research</a>, two thirds of teachers say that negative behaviour is driving teachers out of the profession. Dealing with that is about even more than tackling low level disruption. In some schools, children refuse to do their homework and teachers know that their pupils will not do their French vocabulary or read the next chapter of the set novel. Tackling that culture of low expectation and the school ethos by which it is not cool to study and work hard is central to our educational reforms, because that culture is at its strongest in the weakest schools in the most disadvantaged areas.</p> <p pid="b.261.0/5">The attainment gap between those from wealthy and poor backgrounds is unacceptably wide. Fifty-nine per cent. of non-free school meal pupils last year achieved five or more good <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCSEs">GCSEs</a>, compared with 31% of pupils who qualify for free school meals. That 28-point gap has remained stubbornly constant over the years. Our objective is to shift the balance of authority in schools away from the pupil and towards the teachers and heads-away from the child to the adult.</p> <p pid="b.261.0/6">My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40227" title="Our page on Damian Hinds - 'the Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds)'">Damian Hinds</a> is right that we need to tackle the I-know-my-rights attitude of the disruptive child and enforce the rights of the overwhelming <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of children in schools, who just want to get on and learn in a safe, happy and stress-free environment. Pupils in schools make it clear that they know when they are being let down by poor behaviour, an inadequate curriculum or poor teaching. Addressing those issues is at the core of the Bill.</p> <p pid="b.261.0/7">That is also why we have launched a major review of the national curriculum-we want to ensure that our schools are teaching at least the core knowledge of the main academic disciplines-and why we have introduced the English baccalaureate to include GCSEs in English, maths, science, history or geography and a language. My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40123" title="Our page on Charlotte Leslie - 'the Member for Bristol North West (Charlotte Leslie)'">Charlotte Leslie</a> was right to argue in a powerful speech that this is not an elitist education. It is elitist to say that children from poorer backgrounds are not entitled to a broad academic education. That is elitist and backward looking. It is that attitude that has led to this country having wider equality gaps than most other countries in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a>.</p> <p pid="b.261.0/8">My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40076" title="Our page on Graham Stuart - 'the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart)'">Mr Stuart</a> asked whether the duties in the Bill on school provision of independent careers advice will apply to new academies. They will do so through their funding agreements. He also asked how we can prevent competition from damaging co-operation between schools. Our whole approach is to encourage the best professionals and schools to support the improvement of other schools. That is why outstanding and good schools converting to academies are required to support weaker schools, and why we are increasing the number of national and local education leaders. <a href="/mp/?m=40325" title="Our page on Barry Sheerman - 'The hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr Sheerman)'">Mr Sheerman</a>, the former Chairman of the then Select Committee on Children, Schools and Families, is right to say that we need to take the party battles out of the education debate, and to look at the evidence-an approach that he always took when I served under his excellent chairmanship of the Select Committee. I welcome his comments about the Bill.</p> <p pid="b.261.0/9">I felt that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>, <a href="/mp/?m=40361" title="Our page on Andy Burnham - 'the right hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)'">Andy Burnham</a>, overstated his case, perhaps for internal Labour party reasons and the need to be seen to oppose. However, he was also wrong on a number of issues. Local authorities will continue to be responsible for co-ordinating admissions, parents will continue to be able to complain to the school governing body and then to the Secretary of State, and, on exclusions, parents will have the right to appeal to an independent review panel. My hon. Friends the Members for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Cornwall">North Cornwall</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Rogerson">Dan Rogerson</a>) and for Bedford (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Fuller">Richard Fuller</a>) will be pleased to learn that we are considering the expertise on the panel, including that on special educational needs. The adjudicator will continue to investigate complaints, and we are extending his role to academies, which I hope will reassure my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?m=40395" title="Our page on Annette Brooke - 'the Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)'">Annette Brooke</a>. The shadow Secretary of State was also wrong about apprenticeships. Under the Bill, every 16 to 18-year-old who secures an apprenticeship place will have their training funded. Next year's budget will be more than &#163;1.4 billion, funding more than 350,000 apprenticeships.</p> <p pid="b.261.0/10">The key objectives of the Bill are to raise standards of behaviour in our schools, to return authority to teachers and head teachers, and to send a message to schools that this is a Government who will support teachers. If teachers tell us that we are not doing enough on discipline, we will do more: clarifying and strengthening the rights of teachers, anonymity when facing damaging false accusations and abolishing the statutory requirement for 24 hours' written notice of detentions. We are sweeping away swathes of bureaucratic burdens from the desks and staff rooms of the teaching profession in order to send the message that we trust teachers as professionals. We are abolishing five quangos while strengthening accountability and increasing choice for parents. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>, "The Importance of Teaching", set out a programme of reform designed to close the attainment gap between those from the poorest and wealthiest backgrounds, and to reverse this country's decline in international performance tables so that all who are educated in our state schools have the opportunity to compete with the school leavers and graduates of countries with the best performing education systems.</p> <p pid="b.261.0/11">We want an education system in which left-leaning journalists no longer feel they have no choice but to send their children to the independent sector. We want an education system where high performing schools such as Durand primary school, Mossbourne academy in Hackney and Twyford Church of England school are no longer regarded as extraordinary. This is a Government serious about education reform. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Paper">The White Paper</a> sets out our path, and this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Bill">Education Bill</a> marks a further stride towards delivering high-quality education for all. I commend the Bill to the House.</p> <p pid="b.261.0/12"><i> Question put, </i>That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p> <p class="italic" pid="b.261.0/13"> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> proceeded to a <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing.
