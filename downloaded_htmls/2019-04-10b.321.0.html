I seem to be here to discuss either this area, the middle east or, indeed, Turkey, a debate to which I was responding in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Hall">Westminster Hall</a> earlier today.</p> <p pid="b321.3/2">I emphasise at the outset both to the right hon. Gentleman and to the House that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> are acutely aware of our enduring responsibilities to Hong Kong. We were a joint signatory to upholding the joint declaration between the UK and China some 35 years ago, and the joint declaration is of course lodged with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a>. As such, we remain absolutely committed to monitoring and ensuring the faithful implementation of the joint declaration and the principle of one country, two systems. I reassure the House that we clearly and consistently raise our concerns with the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities. Parliament is updated on developments in Hong Kong through our six-monthly reports submitted by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>, the most recent of which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2019-03-27">27 March</phrase>. We always stand ready to comment publicly and robustly when appropriate.</p> <p pid="b321.3/3">Yesterday, the Hong Kong courts gave their verdict on the nine key figures in the Hong Kong Occupy movement. The protesters were arrested after large-scale protests in 2014. Each was found guilty of at least one public nuisance offence, and such offences carry a maximum sentence of seven years in prison. We shall have a better understanding of the severity of the sentence, and therefore the signal that the decision purports to send to others who choose to exercise their rights under Hong Kong&#8217;s Basic Law and Bill of Rights, once sentences have been handed down. Sentencing is due on <phrase class="date" code="2019-04-24">24 April</phrase>, and the defendants have the right to appeal. It would therefore not be appropriate to comment further or in detail on the ongoing legal cases, but suffice it to say that this is a potentially protracted legal process that may take years rather than months.</p> <p pid="b321.3/4">I have visited Hong Kong twice as a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and have held meetings with a number of senior legal figures. On my most recent visit in November, I raised the issue of the rule of law directly with the deputy chief justice, as well as with representatives from the legal, political and business communities. All staunchly defended the independence of the judiciary and it remains our position that Hong Kong&#8217;s rule of law remains robust, largely thanks to its world-class independent judiciary. Many Members will know that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroness_Hale">Baroness Hale</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Hoffmann">Lord Hoffmann</a> and others are part and parcel of the panel that is based in Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="b321.3/5">Hong Kong citizens are guaranteed the right to freedom of assembly and demonstration under the Sino-British joint declaration of 1984 and the Basic Law, and it is  essential that those rights are properly respected in a democracy. Hong Kong&#8217;s success and stability depend on its high degree of enduring autonomy and its respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the joint declaration and the Basic Law. The Foreign Secretary recently pronounced that he was</p> <p class="indent" pid="b321.3/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;concerned that on civil and political freedoms, Hong Kong&#8217;s high degree of autonomy is being reduced.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b321.3/7">It would be deeply concerning if the ruling discourages legitimate protest in future or discourages Hong Kong citizens from engaging in political activity.</p>            </div>

This country has both a moral and a legal responsibility to pursue this matter with all vigour. We made commitments to the people of Hong Kong at the time of the handover to China and we still have those commitments under the Sino-British joint declaration.</p> <p pid="b322.0/5">The one country, two systems framework promised the people of Hong Kong progress towards democracy, but these convictions are not an isolated incident.

We take very seriously our responsibilities under one country, two systems, and we have expressed concerns in consecutive six-monthly reports that there has been a tightening of individual rights.

The joint declaration must remain as valid today as it was when it was signed three and a half decades ago. It is a legally binding treaty that is registered with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a>.

Some criticism has been addressed to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCO">FCO</a> in relation to the idea of having a six-monthly report, which we feel is a particularly important foundation for ongoing confidence within Hong Kong that we take very seriously the responsibilities to which we have signed up.</p> <p pid="b322.1/3">The right hon.

He has raised the potential impact of the proposals on business confidence in Hong Kong and has explained our concern that, given the sensitivity of the issues raised by these extradition proposals, considerably more time should be given for a full and wide consultation with interested parties before the Hong Kong authorities seek to put it into law.</p>            </div>

Our view is that the approach is very much in China&#8217;s interests, and China has implicitly recognised the importance of Hong Kong as a financial capital market and business centre. It is therefore equally important that we impress upon China that the uniqueness of Hong Kong will be properly maintained, with Hong Kong reaching its full potential, only if we ensure that &#8220;two systems,&#8221; as set out in the joint declaration, is every bit as important as &#8220;one country.&#8221;</p>            </div>

We are often criticised for speaking endlessly about trade and other opportunities. Clearly, Hong Kong was very much a mercantile base for the UK from the 1840s onwards. However, we do not in any way take lightly the importance of addressing human rights issues, particularly for those living in Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="b325.2/2">We have made it very clear that for Hong Kong to fulfil its potential&#8212;and, indeed, for China to do so in areas such as the belt and road initiative&#8212;the independence of, dare I say it, a common law system such as the British legal system is seen as more reliable for investors than perhaps the more doubtful, or at least less orthodox, systems in Shanghai and elsewhere. Although Pudong in Shanghai is a very important financial centre for China and does a lot of domestic work, Hong Kong still enjoys the confidence of many international capital markets.</p> <p pid="b325.2/3">On the specifics of free trade agreements in a post-Brexit world, clearly Hong Kong would be towards the top of the list, given the strength of our relationship. We have made it very clear to China that one of the reasons we want one country, two systems to be properly promoted is that it is very much in the interests of China&#8217;s plans for its own economic development in the years to come. I thank the hon. Gentleman for his focus on that particular issue, but we should not deny that human rights issues will remain extremely important as far as our own commitment to one country, two systems is concerned.</p>            </div>

I reassure her that it remains the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a>&#8217;s view that for Hong Kong&#8217;s future success it is absolutely essential that it enjoys, and is seen to enjoy, the full measure of the high degree of autonomy and the rule of law, as set out in the joint declaration and enshrined in the Basic Law, and in keeping with the commitment to one country, two systems.</p> <p pid="b326.0/2">In my earlier response to <a href="/mp/?p=10785" title="Our page on Alistair Carmichael - 'the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)'">Mr Carmichael</a>, I referred to issues regarding the planned extradition law, which is a good example of how difficult cases make for tough law. As my hon. Friend may be aware, it has come about because of an important case where an individual was murdered in Taiwan and the accused has ended up in Hong Kong but there is no extradition treaty in place. For that reason, given that Taiwan is regarded as part of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_China">One China</a>, the issue suddenly has far greater implications.</p> <p pid="b326.0/3">I believe, as I am sure my hon.

I will see her later this afternoon for a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Hall">Westminster Hall</a> debate on other matters&#8212;it is one of those busy days. Obviously, we are concerned by some of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>&#8217;s comments about the joint declaration. Our view is that it is and must remain as valid today as it was when it was signed more than 35 years ago. It is a legally binding treaty, as has been pointed out, registered at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a>, and it continues therefore to be in force. We are committed to monitoring closely its implementation and we will continue to do so.</p> <p pid="b326.2/2">Of course we are concerned. We only need to look at the last half a dozen or so six-monthly reports to recognise that we think there is a deterioration in the way in which China is looking at this particular issue,  but we will stand up for the rights of all Hong Kong people. As I have said, this is also in the interests of China, and it is an important part of the process to make that very clear to ensure that one country, two systems prevails.</p>            </div>

I remember being on the Back Benches for many years, so I do not in any way criticise you, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>.</p> <p pid="b327.4/2">I very much agree with <a href="/mp/?p=10219" title="Our page on Mike Gapes - 'the hon. Member for Ilford South (Mike Gapes)'">Mike Gapes</a>. We need to do our level best to ensure that we stand up for our rights. I do not think that the Chinese are entirely unknowing of that. Of course, they know exactly what is going on and want to squeeze those rights. It is interesting, however, that in a significant number of areas they recognise the benefit of two systems, including commercially, where the idea   of a settled rule of law will allow capital to go into Hong Kong. We need to do our level best to ensure that all aspects are maintained, and we shall do so.</p>            </div>

Gentleman and I were on a trip to Hong Kong more years ago than I care to imagine&#8212;I think it was about 13 years ago. Obviously, it was the first time that I had been to the area as a parliamentarian. Our concerns are over the right to protest and press rights. Members have already referred to the issue of the very sudden withdrawal of the visa of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Mallet">Victor Mallet</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times">Financial Times</a> journalist. There are a number of issues in the area that we would call civil rights, but, as far as the legal system is concerned, there is a sense that that remains independent. Equally, though, we are concerned. In relation to the judgments that took place yesterday, there is likely to be a long and winding road of appeals that will take place over some considerable time. It is one reason why we are not commenting directly on this, because, obviously, we want to read the full judgments, but we recognise that there will be appeals from virtually all the defendants.</p>            </div>

It is important to make a distinction between Taiwan and Hong Kong. Much as we are concerned about increasing  pressure being put on Taiwan, the Hong Kong situation is different, as it is set out in a joint declaration. Indeed, the whole idea of one country, two systems that came into place in July 1997 absolutely protects the position of Hong Kong. There is a slight danger&#8212;dare I say it&#8212;in trying to equate the situation in Taiwan with that in Hong Kong. It may well be in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>&#8217;s interest so to do as we then potentially undermine the Hong Kong situation. Hong Kong&#8217;s rights are set out and it is the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a>&#8217;s responsibility, as we have all pointed out, to make sure that they are maintained.</p>            </div>

People who voted in 2016 did not anticipate the muscular, aggressive, authoritarian approach of China, which means that we are now seeing extraditions, the arrests of people engaged in peaceful protest, Canadian nationals facing the death sentence, and Britain in a much more vulnerable position, as it will have to rely on trade with China and therefore turn a blind eye to human rights.

Gentleman makes a fair point in this regard: we must not take our eye off the ball when it comes to standing up for human rights as we come to make trade agreements. I am actually much more optimistic and hopeful than he is, and I say that from the perspective of a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>. As we leave the European Union, we will have to work hard&#8212;and we are working hard&#8212;and redouble our efforts to make sure that the strongest relationship in a range of multilateral organisations is maintained&#8212;whether it be in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a> in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York">New York</a> and Geneva, or in organisations such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank">World Bank</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF">IMF</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a>. I am very confident that we will rise to that challenge. It is certainly important that we keep the connection open as much as we can. For example, in the UN, we are working extremely closely&#8212;and will continue to do so for some considerable time&#8212;with France, which is a permanent member of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council">Security Council</a>, and with Germany and Poland, which are important partners in the European Union and also now on the Security Council this year.</p>            </div>

We were particularly concerned by the Hong Kong authorities&#8217; unprecedented rejection of a visa extension&#8212;it was actually a small visa extension for the senior British journalist <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Mallet">Victor Mallet</a> who is now the Paris correspondent. It was simply a matter of the last two or three months of his time in Hong Kong that was at stake. In the absence of an explanation from  the authorities, we can only conclude, as my hon. Friend rightly points out, that this move was politically motivated. I believe that it undermines the basic idea of freedom of speech and freedom of the press in Hong Kong, which, as I have said, are guaranteed by that joint declaration.</p>            </div>

In many ways, the joint declaration and the Sino-UK discussions were a fantastic template for broader co-operation and it is to our regret that that is now under pressure, and we will continue to stand up for it. I will, if I may, make this point. Obviously, there has been speculation in relation to what might happen in the broader region around Shenzhen&#160;and Guangzhou, which may be linked together as a particular region along with Hong Kong. Again, we will keep our eye on exactly what changes are being made in that regard, although one can see the importance of the interconnections economically within the broader region. I shall certainly be noting what happens in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Bay_Area">Greater Bay Area</a>, which is an area that I am looking to visit later this year. I will be going to Guangzhou and Shenzhen and then to Hong Kong at the same time. Obviously, we will report back to the House after that time.</p>            </div>

The lobbying that our own consul general has received from business connections makes it very clear that there is a reduction in broader confidence. On the rights of British national (overseas) passport holders, my hon. Friend will be aware that the right of abode in the UK is defined under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_1971">Immigration Act 1971</a> and only British citizens and certain British subjects have that right. However, we have ongoing responsibilities to Hong Kong citizens, and even to those who do not enjoy that right of abode, and we will continue to make the strongest of cases to ensure that, up to 2047 and potentially beyond, such rights are properly upheld.</p>            </div>

I am working on this issue in many ways with our Hong Kong desk at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a> and with our consul general. It is rather important that we try to work through a pathway, rather than just stepping back and taking a view that we do not like what is going on; let us try to work together constructively. As I alluded to earlier, the belt and road initiative is a good example of where working together to ensure that Hong Kong&#8217;s freedoms are maintained will actually be in China&#8217;s own interests&#8212;not just in trading terms. If I were Chinese, I might also think that there is an important opportunity to utilise Hong Kong as a chance for experimental changes in freedoms that may or may not be in the mind of this regime or future Chinese regimes. There is a lot of work in progress, and I am working closely with my counterparts on the issue.</p>            </div>
