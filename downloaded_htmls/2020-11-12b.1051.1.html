China&#8217;s National People&#8217;s Congress <a href="/glossary/?gl=248" title="In a normal session there are up to ten standing committees on bills. Each..." class="glossary">Standing Committee</a> imposed new restrictions that mean that any Hong Kong legislator who is deemed to support independence, refuse to recognise China&#8217;s sovereignty, seek foreign forces&#8217; interference or endanger national security should be disqualified from membership of Hong Kong&#8217;s Legislative Council. This decision led to the immediate removal of four elected Members of the Legislative Council, who were, at that moment, sitting in the Chamber.</p> <p pid="b1051.2/2">It is my unfortunate duty to report to the House our judgment that that decision breaches the legally binding Sino-British joint declaration. It breaches both China&#8217;s commitment that Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy and the right to freedom of speech, guaranteed under paragraph 3 of the declaration. This is the third time that the Government have called a breach of the joint declaration since 1997, but the second time that we have been forced to do so in the last six months.</p> <p pid="b1051.2/3">This decision is part of a pattern designed to harass and stifle all voices critical of China&#8217;s policies. The new rules for disqualification provide a further tool in that campaign, with vague criteria open to wide-ranging interpretation. Hong Kong&#8217;s people are left now with a neutered legislature, and 15 pan-democratic legislators have already resigned en masse in protest.</p> <p pid="b1051.2/4">China has yet again broken its promise to the people of Hong Kong. Its actions tarnish China&#8217;s international reputation and undermine Hong Kong&#8217;s long-term stability. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> has already offered a new immigration path for British nationals overseas, suspended our extradition treaty with Hong Kong and extended our arms embargo on mainland China to Hong Kong. The permanent under-secretary at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign,_Commonwealth_and_Development_Office">Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office</a> has today summoned the Chinese ambassador to register our deep concern at this latest action by his Government.</p> <p pid="b1051.2/5">Hong Kong&#8217;s prosperity and way of life rely on respect for fundamental freedoms, an independent judiciary and the rule of law. China&#8217;s actions are putting at risk Hong Kong&#8217;s success. The UK will stand up for our values. We will stand up for the people of Hong Kong. We will call out violations of their rights and freedoms. With our international partners, we will continue to hold China to its international obligations.</p>            </div>

Today I have a very simple question. What are the Government going to do as &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; disappears before our eyes? The disqualification of pro-democracy lawmakers from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Council_of_Hong_Kong">Legislative Council of Hong Kong</a> means it has effectively been reduced to a rubber-stamp Parliament and democracy on the peninsula is now in mortal peril.</p> <p pid="b1051.3/2">Although the previous actions of this Government are to be commended, it is time to do more. Indeed, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> told the House in July that the Government</p> <p class="indent" pid="b1051.3/3" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;will hold China to its international obligations.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2020-07-20">20 July</phrase> 2020; Vol. 678, c. 1832.]</p> <p pid="b1051.3/4">Yet here we are again. Through these actions, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> are making a mockery of the joint declaration. I ask the Minister what legal routes to defend the joint declaration are being considered. What has the Minister done to co-ordinate a response with our allies internationally, in particular the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">USA</a>, including <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President-elect_Biden">President-elect Biden</a>, and the European Union? Will the UK finally impose Magnitsky-style sanctions on those individuals in Hong Kong and China who are responsible for human rights abuses, and, if not that model, will he look at a sanctions register, as used by the US?</p> <p pid="b1051.3/5">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> citizenship scheme excludes those who need it, particularly young people who have so bravely protested in the best traditions of democracy. We must protect them. The estimated true cost for a Hongkonger to come here for five years is &#163;3,000, and that is before living costs. Many simply cannot afford it. Will the Minister confirm how many applications have been made under the scheme and how many have been granted? Will he consider introducing a bursary scheme for those unable to pay, and will he introduce a lifeboat policy for all Hong Kong citizens regardless of age and, if not, will he agree to meet me to discuss this matter further?</p> <p pid="b1051.3/6">In 1996, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Major">John Major</a> underlined our commitment to Hong Kong when he said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b1051.3/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;If there were to be any suggestion of a breach of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Declaration">Joint Declaration</a> we would have a duty to pursue every legal and other avenue available to us.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b1051.3/8">He concluded:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b1051.3/9" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Hong Kong will never have to walk alone.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b1051.3/10">It is time for actions, not just words.

One of her points was about whether I would meet her; of course, I am more than happy to meet her. I know how important this issue is to her and other Members of this House, and my door is always open for conversations with me and my team. I can tell her that we have already seen statements from our partners thus far on this particular issue. Australia, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">USA</a>, Canada and Germany have all made statements on the matter and we will continue to work with all our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a> partners to hold China to account. The actions we have taken at the UN over the last few months are testament to that and proof of our leading diplomatic role in this regard.</p> <p pid="b1052.0/2">The hon.

Lady asked about the number of BNOs. From July 2020, BNO citizens and their dependants have been eligible to be granted six months&#8217; leave outside the rules at the border to the UK, and from <phrase class="date" code="2020-07-15">15 July</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2020-10-14">14 October</phrase> 2020, a total of 2,116 BNO citizens and their dependants have been granted that. That data is not a reliable proxy for the number of people who may apply for the visa when it opens in January, but it does suggest that the number of BNO citizens seeking to come to the UK in the short term is unlikely to be at the high end of the scale.</p>            </div>

We have a high level of ambition for our trade partnership. We want to work with it to increase trade, but as we strive for that positive relationship we will not sacrifice our values or our security. We are very clear-sighted about the challenges.

Secondly, when will we see details of what the UK Government are offering by way of support to Hongkongers born after 1997? Thirdly, will senior Hong Kong Executive officials now be added to the Magnitsky list? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> has been asked this question many times and he has consistently declined to give a definitive answer. Who in Government is holding this up?

Friend for his continued efforts on this issue, and for working positively with the Government. We will continue to consider designations under the sanctions regulations. I fear I am repeating myself, but he will know, given his background, that it is not appropriate to speculate on who may be designated in the future, as putting that on the record may well reduce the impact of the designations. I completely agree with his opening comments, but we have offered a new immigration path for BNOs; we have suspended our extradition treaty with Hong Kong; we have extended our arms embargo on mainland China to cover Hong Kong; and we have led international efforts to hold China to its international obligations. Gaining 39 signatures at the UN is no mean feat. We have also, rightly, consistently raised our concern with the Chinese authorities.</p>            </div>

He is absolutely right to raise the issue of academic interference. UK universities are international at their core, and we warmly welcome overseas students, including from China, and the valuable contribution that they make, but we will not tolerate any attempt to interfere with academic freedom, or freedom of speech. As I have said before in the House, if any universities experience any attempts to undermine free debate, we encourage them to get in touch with the Government.</p> <p pid="b1055.2/2">The hon. Gentleman mentioned data infrastructure. The long-term security and enduring resilience of our telecoms network are incredibly important, and we are taking difficult decisions to protect those interests. The position in January on high-risk vendors was based on the need to balance security with the need for us to level up and be a world leader in our digital infrastructure. I hope that answers the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point, but I am more than happy to have a direct meeting with him when he returns to London, as I have said to the Lib  Dem and Labour spokespeople, the hon.

We could not be any clearer; our assessment is that this action is a breach of the joint declaration. This is a subject on which we have been incredibly robust over the past 12 months, as the hon. Lady will know. The joint declaration is in force and the policies contained within it should remain unchanged for 50 years. It is a legally binding international agreement that is registered with the UN, and we are fully committed to upholding Hong Kong&#8217;s high degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms.</p>            </div>

On Monday, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_State_Department">United States State Department</a> announced that it was to impose further sanctions on four more Chinese officials over their alleged role in recent crackdowns on democracy in Hong Kong, and that is further to its sanctions on officials with regard to the actions in Xinjiang and the unacceptable treatment of the Uyghur Muslims. My question is on sanctions, but it is slightly different to the questions being put by others. Can the Minister explain  the difference in terms of why emergency Magnitsky-style sanctions were rightly imposed in Belarus and why they are not being imposed on Chinese officials with regard to their behaviour in Hong Kong or their behaviour in Xinjiang on the treatment of Muslims?</p>            </div>

Frequently, it is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Benchers">Back Benchers</a> in this House who are dragging the Government to make more categorical statements and to stand up to the cross words, which is so far all we have had.

The one thing that they could do they repeatedly refuse to do, which is to implement Magnitsky-style sanctions against <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Lam">Carrie Lam</a> and others. I do not know what more the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> needs to know. We have a country that has millions of people in concentration camps. We have people who are being refused the right to their own religion, and women who are having forced abortion and sterilisation. We have the whole of democratic systems being suppressed, and, frankly, communism today looks remarkably like fascism.
