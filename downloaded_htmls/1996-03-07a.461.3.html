As we now know that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGC">IGC</a> will be published next <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuesday">Tuesday</a>, will the Leader of the House tell us whether there will be a statement to the House that day, and if so, which <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will make it? And can the right hon. Gentleman tell us when the two significant <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> that have not yet come before the House&#8212;the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_Bill">Broadcasting Bill</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Law">Family Law</a> Bill&#8212;will be debated? When will the Government make it clear whether they intend to reverse their defeats in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=191" title="The house of Lords is the upper chamber of the Houses of Parliament. It is..." class="glossary">House of Lords</a> on the vital issues contained in those two Bills?</p> <p>
In view of the real anger that was felt by Conservative as well as <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members during yesterday's statement on the judgment of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice">European Court of Justice</a> in relation to the so-called Spanish quota hoppers, and the importance of that judgment to the British fishing industry and the operation of the common fisheries policy, will the Leader of the House find time for a debate on an issue that has aroused a great deal of parliamentary as well as public concern?</p> <p>
Following today's publication of the report on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Empress">Sea Empress</a> disaster, may we have a debate on whether immediate lessons can be learned from that devastating event, or whether a fuller, independent inquiry is needed, so that there is no question of minimising the impact of one of the worst environmental catastrophes to hit Britain's coastline?</p> <p>
Finally, has the Leader of the House seen the press reports suggesting that the South-East Staffordshire <a href="/glossary/?gl=45" title="A by-election occurs when a seat in the House of Commons becomes vacant..." class="glossary">by-election</a> will not be held until 2 May? Given the understanding that writs are moved within three months of a vacancy occurring, will the Leader of the House refute those reports and confirm that, if the three-month limit is to be met, the writ for the by-election must be moved next week?</p>            </div>

I do not wish to intrude on last night's operation of the usual channels, and, in any event, the hon. Lady will have noted that we have rescheduled the debate on the regulations.</p> <p>
The hon. Lady asked about the intergovernmental conference and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a>. I can confirm that I expect the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper">White Paper</a> to be published next <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuesday">Tuesday</a>, 12 March, and that its publication will be accompanied by a statement, which I believe will be made by my right hon. and learned Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>.</p> <p>
I cannot yet give dates for debates on the Broadcasting and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Law">Family Law</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a>. The Government are, quite properly, considering matters that have been the subject of debate and, indeed, decision in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=191" title="The house of Lords is the upper chamber of the Houses of Parliament. It is..." class="glossary">House of Lords</a>.</p> <p>
As for Factortame and the common fisheries policy, I cannot add to what was said yesterday by my right hon. and learned Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> of Agriculture, Fisheries and


Food. My right hon. and learned Friend indicated, however, that the Government would seek to raise those matters, and I mentioned the debate on the forthcoming <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGC">IGC</a> in my statement.</p> <p>
A special bulletin containing interim findings relating to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Empress">Sea Empress</a> was indeed issued today, but that, of course, is not the report of the full inquiry, which I understand will be published as soon as possible. It may be more appropriate to think in terms of a debate at that later stage.</p> <p>
As I have said on a number of occasions, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=45" title="A by-election occurs when a seat in the House of Commons becomes vacant..." class="glossary">by-election</a> is not a matter for me, but I have no doubt that the hon.

Why is it that consultants offer private treatment to many people who are seeking treatment in national health service hospitals, and that people are often pushed into accepting it, to deal with the medical crisis in their family?

I understand that there may be an interest one way or the other, but I see no reason for not giving a straightforward answer to such a simple question.</p>            </div>

Friend arrange a debate on early-day motion 564 next week?</p> <p><i>[That this House deplores the pressure upon <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ealing_Council">Ealing Council</a> by a Labour councillor to house labour voters in a property to which they have no entitlement; further deplores that councillor's written statement that the same Labour Council should be building up <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party">Labour Party</a> support in his ward by manipulation of the housing waiting list; supports the fury of people on Ealing Council's housing waiting list who regard this cheating as depriving them of the council home they need; and further regrets that Ealing Council have lost the file relevant to the case in advance of an official enquiry in this scandal.]</i></p> <p>
Such a debate would enable me to bring before the House the complaints of a large number of my constituents who are on the housing list. They object to a Labour councillor putting pressure on Ealing council to put Labour voters into council properties at their expense. I refer also to an untrue statement by a Labour Member, who said that the leader of Ealing <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_council">Labour council</a> took immediate action once the matter was drawn to his attention. That incident occurred last May and was brought to public notice only two weeks ago by the Conservative members of Ealing council. No action had been taken by the Labour council in all those months, and my constituents are furious.</p>            </div>

The motion shows how Mr. Leonard Steinberg of the Conservative Board of Treasurers managed to make &#163;7.8 million in four short days after the publication of a Green Paper. In the light of that, should we not debate party political funding? Could the reason why the Prime Minister has not come to the House to talk about Hong Kong be that he is frightened that he will be asked questions about whether he met Conservative party contributors who might contribute towards the next general election?</p>            </div>
