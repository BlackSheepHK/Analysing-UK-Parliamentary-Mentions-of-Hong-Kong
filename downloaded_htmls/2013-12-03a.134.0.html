I would like in particular to thank those head teachers who are, through the new school direct programme of teacher training, recruiting more superb new graduates to teach in our state schools. But while the quality of our teachers is improving, today&#8217;s league tables sadly show that that is not enough. When people ask why, if teachers are better than ever, we need to press ahead with further reform to the system, today&#8217;s results make the case more eloquently than any number of speeches.</p> <p pid="a.129.3/4">Since the 1990s, our performance in these league tables has been at best stagnant, at worst declining. In the latest results, we are 21st in the world for science, 23rd for reading and 26th for mathematics. For all the well intentioned efforts of past Governments, we are still falling further behind the best-performing school systems in the world. In Shanghai and Singapore, South Korea and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, indeed even in Taiwan and Vietnam, children are learning more and performing better with every year that passes, leaving our children behind in the global race.</p> <p pid="a.129.3/5">That matters because business is more mobile than ever, and employers are more determined than ever to seek out the best-qualified workers. Global economic pressures, far from leading to a race to the bottom, are driving all nations to pursue educational excellence more energetically than ever before, and today&#8217;s league tables show that nations that have had the courage radically to reform their education systems, such as Germany and Poland, have significantly improved their performance and their children's opportunities.</p> <p pid="a.129.3/7">There is no single <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> or single nation which has all the answers to our education challenges, but if we look at all the high-performing and fast-improving education systems, certain common features recur. There is an emphasis on social justice and helping every child to succeed. There is a commitment to an aspirational academic core curriculum for all students. There is a high level of autonomy from bureaucracy for head teachers. There is a rigorous system of accountability for performance, and head teachers have the critical power to hire who they want, remove underperformers and reward the best with the recognition that they deserve.</p> <p pid="a.129.3/8">Those principles have driven this coalition&#8217;s education reforms since 2010. The first reform imperative is securing greater social justice. It is notable that many of the high-performing jurisdictions set demanding standards for every child, whatever their background, and Germany in particular has improved its standing in these league tables by doing more to promote greater equity to ensure more children from poorer backgrounds catch up with their peers.</p> <p pid="a.129.3/9">The good news from the PISA research is that in England we have one of the most progressive and socially just systems of education funding in the world. But we in the coalition Government believe that we must go further to help the most disadvantaged. That is why we have made funding even more progressive with the pupil premium, extended free pre-school education to the most disadvantaged two year-olds and changed how we hold schools accountable so that they have to give even greater attention to the performance of poor children. I hope that today the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> will acknowledge these steps forward and give their support to our reforms.</p> <p pid="a.129.3/10">The second reform imperative is a more aspirational curriculum. In successful Asian nations all students are introduced to more stretching mathematical content at an earlier age than has been the case here; and in the fastest-improving European nation, Poland, every child now follows a core academic curriculum to the age of 16. Our new national curriculum is explicitly more demanding, especially in mathematics. It is modelled on the approach of high-performing Asian nations such as Singapore. The mathematical content is matched by a new level of ambition in technology, with the introduction of programming and coding in the national curriculum for the first time.</p> <p pid="a.129.3/11">In our drive to eliminate illiteracy, we have introduced a screening check at age six to make sure that every child is reading fluently. Our introduction of the English baccalaureate, which is awarded to students who secure <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCSEs">GCSEs</a> in English, maths, the sciences, languages and history or geography, matches Poland by embedding an expectation of academic excellence for every 16 year- old. I hope that today the Labour <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> will confirm its support for our new curriculum, the phonics screening check and the English baccalaureate. Our children deserve to have these higher standards adopted universally.</p> <p pid="a.129.3/12">The third reform imperative is greater autonomy for head teachers. There is a direct correlation in these league tables between freedom for heads and improved results. That is why we have dramatically increased the number of academies and free schools and given heads more control over teacher training, continuous professional development and the improvement of underperforming schools. By giving heads control of teacher recruitment, the School Direct programme has improved the quality of new teachers. The creation of more than 300 teaching schools has put our most outstanding heads in charge of helping existing teachers to do even better. The academies programme has allowed great heads, such as those in the Harris and Ark chains, to take over underperforming schools, such as Downhills Primary in Tottenham. I hope that today the Front Bench will signal its support for these reforms and show that, like us, it trusts our outstanding heads to drive improvement.</p> <p pid="a.129.3/13">The fourth pillar of reform is accountability. Those systems which have autonomy without accountability often underperform, but accountability has to be intelligent. That is why we have sharpened Ofsted inspections, recruited more outstanding serving teachers to inspect schools and demanded that underperforming schools improve far faster. The old league table system relied too much on a narrow measurement of C passes at GCSE, which generated the wrong incentives and wrote too many children off. We have changed league tables to ensure that every child&#8217;s progress is rewarded and ensured that children are not entered early, or multiple times, for GCSEs simply to influence league tables. I hope that today the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_Front_Bench">Opposition Front Bench</a> will endorse those changes and join us in demanding greater rigour and higher standards from all schools.</p> <p pid="a.129.3/14">The fifth pillar of reform is freedom for heads to recruit and reward the best. Shanghai, the world&#8217;s best-performing education system, has a rigorous system of performance-related pay. We have given head teachers the same freedoms here. I hope that today we can have a clear commitment from all sides of the House to support those brave and principled heads who want to pay the best teachers more.</p> <p pid="a.129.3/15">The programme of reform we have set out draws on what happens in the best school systems, because we want nothing but the best for our children. Unless we can provide them with a school system that is one of the best in the world, we will not give them the opportunities they need to flourish and succeed. That is why it is so important that we have a unified national commitment to excellence in all our schools for all our pupils&#8221;.</p> <p pid="a.129.3/16">I commend the Statement to the House.</p>            </div>

Any serious <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> would regard these results as a call to action and a reason to scrutinise very carefully government policy in the light of the findings.</p> <p pid="a.131.0/4">Instead, and typically, this Secretary of State&#8217;s line of defence has been one of attack, I think to try to divert attention from his own record. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State claims that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a>&#8217;s current position in the international league tables is,</p> <p class="indent" pid="a.131.0/5">&#8220;a verdict on the last government&#8221;.</p> <p pid="a.131.0/6">I say to the Minister, and believe profoundly, that if we had not had a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> prioritising and investing in education year on year, the UK would be at the bottom of the league table. Without doubt, if the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> had been comparing countries in 1996&#8212;it was not&#8212;the UK would have been on the floor. After 18 years of a Conservative Government, the education system in this country was in tatters, with crumbling schools, standards flatlining, teacher morale at rock bottom and a school system in chaos. The Labour Government, quite simply, had to rebuild that system from top to bottom.</p> <p pid="a.131.0/7">That is why we saw the first and biggest transformation ever for pre-school children, with free early years education for all three and four year-olds and, later, for disadvantaged two year-olds. We also saw capped class sizes in primary schools and radical reform of the secondary curriculum. We introduced academies in disadvantaged areas because the Labour Government really did care about social justice and equity in our education system. We also saw massive investment in teacher and head teacher training and development, including the introduction of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teach_First">Teach First</a>, and year-on-year improvements in GCSE and A-level results&#8212;achievements which this Secretary of State has ridiculed and said were a fiddle.</p> <p pid="a.131.0/8">When we left office in 2010, the coalition inherited record results and the best cadre of teachers this country has ever had, by common acclaim, including from Ofsted. That was a solid foundation for the continued progress that we agree is undoubtedly still needed for us to compete with the rising economies elsewhere in the world. It would have been good to hear the Secretary of State acknowledge that progress, but instead of doing that and trying to build on it, this Secretary of State is in danger of squandering those advances by taking our education system backwards to didactic teaching and a rampant free market between schools.</p> <p pid="a.131.0/9"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> selected certain factors that he thinks these results tell us. However, if PISA tells us anything, it is that the countries doing better have understood and are relentlessly implementing three important lessons. First, as a teacher using the Singapore maths model said on the news this morning, learning by rote is simply not good enough for the innovative technological world in which our children will work. However, this Secretary of State is returning the UK to an obsolete curriculum and an exam system that measures what children remember, not what they can actually do.</p> <p pid="a.131.0/10">The second lesson is that collaboration between schools and schools challenging each other drive up standards. However, this Secretary of State has abolished the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Challenge">London Challenge</a>, where schools worked together, challenged each other and produced the fastest rise in achievements. He also abolished the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester">Greater Manchester</a> and Black Country Challenges, which were beginning to produce similar results in some of the most disadvantaged parts of the country. If the Minister cares about social justice and equity in education, that should not have been done, as the scheme was addressing extreme disadvantage in our education system.</p> <p pid="a.131.0/12">The third lesson is that qualifications, along with continuing development of teachers, is the single most important factor in improving education and achievement. However, this Secretary of State, as we just discussed in Questions, has allowed academies and free schools to employ unqualified people to work as teachers, even in core subjects. As I said, we have seen some academies putting out adverts for unqualified people with four <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCSEs">GCSEs</a> to teach maths.</p> <p pid="a.131.0/13">I could not agree more with the Minister about the need to focus on social justice and equity, to introduce rigour and standards into the education system and, particularly, to make sure that those from disadvantaged backgrounds can gain the most. However, although we support some of the Government&#8217;s reforms, I cannot agree that all of their measures, taken together, will achieve those ends. Will the Minister explain to the House why the Government&#8217;s policies are flying in the face of the lessons from elsewhere in the world, which I have just outlined, that emanate from the PISA results today?</p> <p pid="a.131.0/14">I agree that this is a most important subject and we should use the OECD findings to our advantage as far as we can. Will the Government bring forward a considered and comprehensive analysis of the OECD findings so that we can have an informed debate in public about the implications for the UK, and regear some of the Government&#8217;s reforms to ensure that we can position our young people to compete with the best in the tiger economies?</p>            </div>

With her experience, she probably knows better than to suggest that we can be expected to have turned round the education system after only three and a half years, as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Schleicher">Andreas Schleicher</a> acknowledged only yesterday. It is far too early to form a verdict on the coalition&#8217;s reforms. However, we have stopped the decline. Between 2000 and 2009 we fell from fourth to 16th in science, eighth to 28th in maths, and seventh to 25th in literacy. We have now stabilised at 23rd in literacy and 26th in maths, although we have done worse in science.</p> <p pid="a.133.0/2">I agree that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> spent 87% more in real terms on the education system, but it is all about what results you get rather than how much money you spend. We must have a concept of value for money. It does not look as though we got very good value for money. We are now building schools at half the cost per pupil of Labour&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Schools_for_the_Future">Building Schools for the Future</a> programme; we are building many more purpose-designed schools, and more quickly.</p> <p pid="a.133.0/3">I acknowledge that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teach_First">Teach First</a> was a splendid idea. We have expanded that dramatically. I acknowledge that the academy programme was a splendid idea&#8212;indeed,</p> <p pid="a.133.0/4">I would not be here if it was not for the academy programme. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Challenge">London Challenge</a> was an excellent example of co-operation between schools. That is why we have taken these ideas and expanded them dramatically; for example, from 200 to 3,500 academies, working together in close geographic local clusters, with schools supporting each other locally, which we believe is the only model. We agree entirely with the collaborative approach.</p> <p pid="a.133.0/5">The unqualified teacher story seems to run and run. It is a bit of a red herring. We have brought the numbers down to 14,800 from 17,800 under Labour. It is still a tiny proportion. It is interesting that the area that the noble Baroness refers to&#8212;London, which had some of the best results&#8212;has the highest incidence of unqualified teachers. It is also true that we have a high incidence of unqualified teachers in our academies and free schools because we have nationalised quite a few independent schools. However, we are interested in the best teachers with the best qualifications and now 75%&#8212;up from 61%&#8212;of our teachers enter the profession with a 2.1 or better.</p> <p pid="a.133.0/6">However, it would be so much better if, rather than throwing stones at each other, we all acknowledged that these <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA">PISA</a> statistics are a wake-up call for our school system and that we should work together in a unified way to improve it. I am delighted that the noble Baroness supports some of our reforms. I know that my <a href="/glossary/?gl=172" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to another MP of..." class="glossary">right honourable friend</a> the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Education would love to know which reforms, and I look forward to discussing that with her further.</p> <p pid="a.133.0/7">The PISA report contains an extremely intelligent analysis, which I recommend to everyone in this House. In particular, it states that the schools that succeed are those with high levels of autonomy and accountability&#8212;both of which the Government are focusing on&#8212;and a core academic curriculum.</p>            </div>

His ministerial colleague, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Truss">Liz Truss</a>, addressed the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishers_Association">Publishers Association</a> and very largely deplored the disappearance &#8212;which may surprise many of us&#8212;of the textbook from the classrooms of both primary and secondary schools. I was astonished to learn from a <i>Telegraph</i> report today that, as compared with 10% use of textbooks in primary schools here, Germany and Poland have around 80% or 90%. Only 8% of pupils in English secondary schools have textbooks in their hands, whereas the figure for Finland is 80%. I compare the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> largely with other European countries because of the huge cultural differences which make comparison with Taiwan and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> a bit difficult. In view of what Liz Truss said yesterday, why does the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> think that there is such a gap between our countries and other European countries in the simple use of textbooks in classes?

I think that the answer to his questions in brief, although I will elaborate, is that this situation has been caused by a lack of rigour in the curriculum and in teaching methodology. I agree entirely that this lack of rigour and methodology, which is expressed in one way in textbooks, is one of the reasons why we have declined. One also needs to look at workbooks. In far too many state-maintained schools, there is a complete absence of workbooks. We are finding that some of the much more successful schools&#8212;not just academies but maintained schools&#8212;insist that all their pupils have a workbook. A workbook is something pupils can be proud of and it can be marked. Pupils do more homework and they get more feedback. In all senses, we need to instil more rigour in our school system.</p>            </div>

I was recently visited by a delegation from Sweden consisting of MPs and others involved in education. They were here to study our accountability system because they acknowledge that they have half of the equation right&#8212;autonomy&#8212;but not the other half. They have been impressed with what they have seen here in Ofsted and our move to a more rigorous accountability system in examination analysis. That is why they acknowledged that they have failed; I do not think that it has anything to do with autonomy.</p> <p pid="a.136.0/2">We are learning from Singapore, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> and Shanghai, particularly in maths. We sent 50 of our head teachers, with their heads of department in maths and science, to Shanghai earlier this year. I agree entirely that parents need to get more involved. When I first got involved in the academy programme, we had one ghastly meeting in Pimlico with all the antis. They were clearly not representative of parents, so to reach out to the parents, we organised eight one-hour meetings in Camberwell and Brixton, where the parents lived, to tell them what we were doing. There were 1,300 pupils so you would think that there would be 2,500 parents. I would like to ask noble Lords to guess how many parents turned up but I will tell you&#8212;one parent came to all eight meetings. We now have more than 90% attendance at parents&#8217; meetings, because all state schools must now send out a message to their parents that if their children go to that school, they must turn up. That is what happens in independent schools and we must try to replicate that in the state system. I entirely agree with the noble Lord.</p>            </div>

Across the academy system a great many sponsors have taken over schools where, frankly, the previous behaviour was very poor indeed, and put in place a very effective behaviour management system. I saw a behaviour management system in America which I thought was particularly effective. You start the pupils on the left-hand side of the page, where they basically behave because they will get into trouble if they do not, and you slowly move them across to the right-hand side of the page, where they behave because that is the society they want. They want a calm society in their school because that is the only way they can learn. More sophisticated behaviour management systems are coming into place. We have strengthened teachers&#8217; ability to confiscate mobile phones, particularly in the appalling incidents of sexting, and given more power for detention, and so on, but I agree entirely with my noble friend.</p>            </div>

I have to say that it is ludicrous beyond belief, and silly, for my friends in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> to complain that it is the fault of the coalition. Two years is a nanosecond for change and it is ludicrous to make such connections. I would argue that although the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> went a bit far in his Statement in throwing stones, it is also a case of &#8220;What&#8217;s sauce for the goose&#8221;.</p> <p pid="a.137.0/2">I do not go on many school visits these days but I was in a secondary school about a month ago. It has been dramatically turned around in the last six months, since a new head arrived. He described his office to me as being set out like a war room, with all the key five factors. I asked him, &#8220;What about the staff turnover in this period?&#8221;. There were very few changes; I had walked around the school and talked to the staff as well. In other words, the dramatic changes in the school had been brought about by leadership&#8212;not by going in to clear out teachers but by leading them. Even this head will therefore require help in future. I take the point about the leadership of schools being absolutely crucial. You cannot just put the best teacher in the role of head teacher. They have to be trained to lead but it can be done. Finally, if this is a wake-up call to the schools, it is equally a wake-up call to the governing bodies. More work needs to be done there because if governing bodies take the issues seriously, it is more likely that parents will take them seriously.</p>            </div>

Whether the school is a local authority maintained school, a church school or an academy chain, real decisions can often be made in the governing bodies and we are focusing much more on them. We have recently made it absolutely clear that governing bodies should focus on a few key things: the vision and strategy of the school, holding the head to account for the attainment and progression of pupils, the performance management of his or her staff, and the finance. We need smaller governing bodies, in many cases, but with many more of the appropriate skills.</p>            </div>

For many years I worked as a teacher in Wales, so it was with a great deal of sadness and disappointment that I read the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA">PISA</a> results for Wales today. Wales performed worse than the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> average in all measures: maths, science and reading. Since 2009, Welsh pupils have slipped from 40th to 43rd in maths, from 30th to 38th in science, and from 38th to 41st in reading&#8212;a disastrous performance which shows Wales to be the poorest performing nation in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a>.</p> <p pid="a.138.0/2">All this makes the ambition of Wales&#8217;s Labour First Minister to be in the top 20 by 2015 almost laughable, if it were not so serious. This is the culmination of nearly 15 years of Labour control of the struggling Welsh education system. I recognise that education is a devolved matter, but will the Minister be having discussions with Ministers from the devolved nations to ensure that standards improve throughout the United Kingdom?</p>            </div>

He will know that dedicated and committed teachers see the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> as being arrogant and failing to value the commitment and quality of teachers, their advice and their experience, which in my judgment is a very bad position for any Secretary of State to take.

We have looked at examination systems across the world in improving the examination systems in this country. We have reduced, or rather will be reducing&#8212;again, going to the point about turning the ship around quickly, a lot of these reforms have not even come into effect yet&#8212;the number of modules and the amount of coursework and continuous assessment in exams, and we will be reducing the scandal of equivalence that went on in recent years. You could take a higher diploma in construction, a subject that even someone as hamfisted as myself would probably pass because there were no exams at all and it was entirely continuous assessment, and it counted for four GCSE equivalents. I could give noble Lords many other examples of exams that were massively overrated, doing their pupils no favours at all and not valued by employers. We have taken into account a lot of what we have seen in international systems in our reform of the exam system.</p>            </div>
