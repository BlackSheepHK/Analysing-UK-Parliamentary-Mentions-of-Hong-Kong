I hope that it will be for the convenience of the House if, on this occasion, I confine myself to general matters and, at the same time, publish a more detailed account in the OFFICIAL REPORT.</p> <p>
At the ministerial meeting in March I asked for a full report to be prepared jointly by officials setting out the positions of both the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community">European Economic Community</a> and the United Kingdom on each sector of the negotiations and the arguments put forward to support them, together with a summary of the work done by officials in exploring the differences that existed. This report was ready on time, on 14th April, and has since been studied by all the Governments concerned and the Commission.</p> <p>
My purpose in asking for this progress report was to enable Ministers to see clearly where we had established common ground and what the gaps were between our positions after five months of analysis and explanation. This was essential before we could proceed to the point of considering satisfactory solutions to the problems involved in our application.</p> <p>
Our principal task at the ministerial meeting in Brussels last Friday and Saturday was to consider fully this progress report. This marked the end of the first or exploratory stage of the negotiations. Over almost the whole field the issues have now been clearly defined. The way is now open for the negotiation of solutions.</p> <p>
To facilitate the task of finding solutions, the British delegation tabled immediately before the ministerial meeting substantive proposals in three different sectors. First, we put forward a detailed plan for the treatment of exports of manufactures from Canada, Australia and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand">New Zealand</a>. Secondly, we submitted a general formula for the treatment of Commonwealth exports of temperate foodstuffs both in the short and the long term. Thirdly, we proposed detailed measures on various problems relating to United Kingdom agriculture.</p> <p>
At the ministerial meeting, a large part of which was in restricted session, Ministers had a preliminary discussion on the substance of these problems. We instructed our officials to work out possible solutions, within agreed terms of reference, which are to be reported to us in some sectors at our next meeting. In addition, the Ministers authorised the setting up of a working party to deal with particular aspects of horticulture in both the United Kingdom and the European Economic Community.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chairman">The Chairman</a> of the Ministers of the Community informed the ministerial meeting that the delegations of the Six member Governments had accepted my request, made at the March ministerial meeting, that our objective should be to determine at least the main outlines of a possible agreement covering the whole field of problems by the end of July. That is, therefore, agreed between us.</p> <p>
There will, of course, be a great deal of work still to be carried out after this stage has been reached. But we have now entered upon the stage of negotiations proper. Many of the problems we have to solve are complex and difficult. The United Kingdom Delegation will pursue their solution with determination.</p> <p>
It was agreed that the next ministerial meeting should be held in Brussels on the 29th and 30th of this month and a further four-day meeting from 27th to 30th of June.</p>            </div>

Wilson:</p> <p>I am sure that I speak for the House when I thank the Lord Privy Seal for making this statement after the first round of the discussions. Will he undertake that following each of the rounds of Ministerial dis-


cussions a comparable statement, if possible more forthcoming, will be made to the House?</p> <p>
May I ask two questions? First, just before the meeting there were some important pronouncements by the German <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_President">French President</a>. Was any reflection of those pronouncements and their effect on Britain's entry into the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Market">Common Market</a> felt in the talks in Brussels? Will the right hon. Gentleman make it quite plain that as far as pronouncements of that kind are concerned, Her Majesty's Government will stand absolutely firmly to what they believe to be the minimum terms for Britain's entry and will not be pushed around by any statements made elsewhere?</p> <p>
Secondly, with regard to the proposals for the Commonwealth, the right hon. Gentleman referred to a general formula on agricultural commodities. Can he tell us a little more about this general formula, since there is a lot about it in the Press? Will he recognise that we on this side of the House, at any rate, feel that any formula which merely provides a temporary easement to the problems will not be regarded as satisfactory? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth">The Commonwealth</a> problem must be settled, if it is to be settled at all, on a basis which provides a permanent safeguard for the entry of Commonwealth goods into this country and into Europe and must not be bought off by temporary relief. Will he address his mind to that point?</p>            </div>

Gentleman will find that in the detailed account which I am publishing in the OFFICIAL REPORT further information is forthcoming, but I think that he realises the problem of making a statement to the House, at the end of Questions, which is not too long or too detailed.</p> <p>
As far as the political statements from Bonn and Paris were concerned, there was no change in the atmosphere in the Ministerial negotiations in Brussels last week. I received an assurance from the leader of the German delegation that the policy of the Federal German Government is in no way changed and that

they support and will work for our admission as a full member of the Community.</p> <p>
As far as the proposals for temperate foodstuffs from the Commonwealth are concerned&#8212;Canada, Australia and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand">New Zealand</a>&#8212;there are further details in the statement in the OFFICIAL REPORT. It deals with both the short term and the long term. It is a context into which can be fitted transitional arrangements commodity by commodity, when they are agreed upon, leading to a review of those arrangements and then arrangements for the long term or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Market">Common Market</a> period. At the same time, the Government, as well, I believe, as the Commonwealth Governments, look to the time with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community">European Economic Community</a> when worldwide arrangements may be possible in some commodities. In that case, of course, those arrangements would not be necessary.</p>            </div>

The political negotiations are carried on by the six members of the Community themselves. Following the Bonn Declaration, in which the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heads_of_Government">Heads of Government</a> looked forward to a closer political arrangement between member countries, the Fouchet Commission prepared texts. It has now become the Cattani Commission: Signor Cattani, head of the Italian Foreign Office, is chairman. We have been kept fully informed about the nature of these texts. We have not asked to take part in that Commission because we are not members of the Community. We are not asking now to take part in that Commission.</p> <p>
In my speech to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_European_Union">Western European Union</a> on 10th April, I said that when there was general agreement between Ministers of the Six about the texts, but that before there was final agreement for a meeting of Heads of Government, we should wish to take part in discussions about that. I think that the whole House will support us in that because of their great importance both to Parliament and to the British people. Since the meeting in Paris on 17th April there has been no further discussion amongst the Ministers of the Six about the texts.</p>            </div>

Can he throw a little more light on the relationship between these two things?</p> <p>
Furthermore, he will be aware that in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rome">Treaty of Rome</a> many decisions fall to be taken by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=205" title="An informal reference to the Council of the European Union." class="glossary">Council of Ministers</a> by what is called a qualified <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament.

Finally, can he give us an assurance that it is the view of Her Majesty's Government that the same power of veto which any one of the three major Powers in the Common Market possesses

For this reason, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, the other countries of E.F.T.A. are carrying on and will be carrying on individual negotiations with the Community, some for full membership&#8212;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark_and_Norway">Denmark and Norway</a>, in addition to the application from Eire for full membership&#8212;as well as those applying for associate membership. The pattern of voting at the end will depend on which of the other E.F.T.A. countries have full membership with ourselves. It was, therefore, thought best that we should leave this matter until later when we can see more fully the pattern of membership.</p> <p>
As to the relationship between these two sets of negotiations, the Six members of the Community are of the view that the full members of the Community should also be members of whatever political arrangements are agreed between them. It would, therefore, be essential for us to consider most carefully what the arrangements of a political nature should be at the same time as we consider the negotiated arrangements in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rome">Treaty of Rome</a>.</p>            </div>

Of course, we would take the view that the rights of the major Powers should be the same. After all, it was only a week ago that we knew that Norway was to apply for full membership. It is not possible to work out a new voting relationship until one knows exactly how many countries will be full members.</p> <p>
Again, I agree with the right hon. Gentleman on the vital necessity of expressing our views and taking part in discussions on the political arrangements. That was why I specifically made that request in my speech at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_European_Union">Western European Union</a> on 10th April. That request was acknowledged by the other Ministers there. The point at which we should take part in the discussions is a matter for arrangement between us and the Six. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Six">The Six</a> have taken the view that it was better for them to work out the preliminary stages of this amongst themselves, knowing what our views were from the statements made by my right hon.

I put our views again in my speech on 10th April. I think that in the way in which the political arrangements are working out there are no major differences between the views I expressed on 10th April and the views which are being expressed in the texts at the moment.</p>            </div>

the agenda for the ministerial meeting last week. The present position with regard to the various problems under discussion is briefly as follows.</q></p>            </div>
