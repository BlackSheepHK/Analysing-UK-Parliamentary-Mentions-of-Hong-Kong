For decades, people have travelled across the globe to study in the UK because we are one of the few nations in which free, fair and lawful speech at university is truly valued. It is no coincidence that the most academically free countries in the world are also the most socially progressive, the most democratic, the most peaceful and, of course, the most prosperous.</p> <p pid="b69.0/2">Free speech is as fundamental to what academics and students do on university campuses as it is to what we do in the House.

In fact, since we last debated the Bill, the UK has become the only country in the top tier of academically free countries to be significantly downgraded by the academic freedom index. A report published by the Varieties of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Institute">Democracy Institute</a> determined that despite the UK&#8217;s status as a historic bastion of academic freedom and scientific excellence, not only is academic freedom in the UK declining but that decline appears to be accelerating.</p>            </div>

Of course, they deserve and have a right to be able to air their views and debate that subject.</p> <p pid="b70.1/2">In oral evidence, Dr Arif Ahmed spoke about how his fellow academics told him that they supported his campaign for free speech but were concerned that their careers would be impacted if they aired that publicly. We also heard from Professor <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Stock">Kathleen Stock</a>, who has been the subject of the most grotesque and sustained campaign of threats and abuse, which compelled her to resign. Is it therefore any wonder that, in 2019, a King&#8217;s College London survey found that, chillingly, one in four students believed that physical violence was justified to shut down views that they deemed to be hateful?</p> <p pid="b70.1/3">The following year, a report by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_Exchange">Policy Exchange</a> found widespread self-censorship among university staff, but students and staff did not need to wait for those damning studies or for oral evidence to be published to know that there was a problem. The students forced to self-censor know that there is a problem. The academics bullied off campus, excluded by colleagues or forced to censor their lectures know that there is a problem. Legitimate organisations, speakers and guests who have been no-platformed or physically and verbally abused on campus know that there is a problem. It is just the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> who have their heads in the sand.</p> <p pid="b70.1/4">The Government not only understand that there is a problem&#8212;we have a plan to solve it by requiring providers to not only protect but promote free speech and academic freedom, by placing freedom of speech duties directly on student unions and by introducing effective enforcement mechanisms through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Students">Office for Students</a>. We all know that a law with no enforcement mechanisms is toothless. The new director for freedom of speech and academic freedom on the OfS board will be able to force improvements and impose penalties, including fines, if the new duties are breached.</p>            </div>

In new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 2, &#8220;constituent institutions&#8221; mean colleges. It is right that we should not have a potential loophole in the Bill. When forming new clause 2, I worked very closely with the university sector, including the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, so I ask him, respectfully, to talk to it again.</p> <p pid="b71.5/2">A number of important issues were raised in Committee. <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members expressed concerns that the Bill would protect hate speech on campus. I have been clear throughout the passage of the Bill and will make the point once again: the Bill is only about lawful free speech. Let me be clear that this cheap shot has no actual validity. It is the Opposition&#8217;s attempt to discredit the Bill. It is a strong signal that they are content for an intolerant minority to silence those they disagree with, content for academics to feel the need to self-censor, content for students to miss out on the ability to debate, to critique and to challenge, and, ultimately, content to stifle debate. The Bill does not override the existing duties under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_Act_2010">Equality Act 2010</a> regarding harassment and unlawful discrimination, nor the public sector equality duty and the prevent duty. Nor does it give anyone the right to be invited to speak at a university.</p> <p pid="b71.5/3">There were also questions from Members on both sides of the House, including my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24857" title="Our page on Fiona Bruce - 'the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce)'">Fiona Bruce</a>, on whether junior researchers and PhD students will be covered as academic staff. That was laid as an <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> by my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10265" title="Our page on John Hayes - 'the Member for South Holland and The Deepings  (Sir John Hayes)'">Sir John Hayes</a>. To clarify, the Bill uses the term &#8220;staff&#8221; to broaden the existing reference to employees, as not all those who work for a higher education provider have an employment contract or employee status. I can confirm that it will include those on short-term, casual contracts and PhD students undertaking teaching.</p> <p pid="b71.5/4">I now turn to the Government amendments tabled in the name of my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>. New clause 2 and Government amendments 13 and 14 will impose a duty on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Students">Office for Students</a> to monitor the overseas funding of registered higher education providers and their constituent institutions, so as to enable it to assess the risk from such funding on freedom of speech and academic freedom. The duty will include a requirement to consider this in the context of a finding of a breach of new section <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1">A1</a> in clause 1. Higher education providers will be required to supply to the OfS information about overseas funding from certain individuals and organisations, with the details to be set out in regulations. The funding will cover not only the income that providers receive, but that of their constituent institutions, their members and their staff in their capacity as such. Similar provision will also apply to student unions. The OfS must include a summary of the information in its annual report, along with relevant patterns of concern.</p> <p pid="b71.5/5">Our amendments are proportionate, but we must ensure that our higher education system remains world leading, safeguarding an environment in which freedom of speech and academic freedom can thrive.</p>            </div>

I can confirm explicitly that the Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> will include educational partnerships, including Confucius institutes, and that the OfS will be able to impose a wide range of proportionate remedies as specific conditions of registration. That could include requiring a provider to make available alternative provision, or even to terminate a partnership if necessary to protect free speech. We will ask the OfS and its new director to make it clear that those are possible remedies in the guidance that will be published.</p> <p pid="b72.1/3">We of course continue to welcome foreign investment and donations to higher education as a key part of supporting innovation and development, but the amendments will increase the transparency of overseas income by requiring granular data to be reported to the OfS.

Do the Government genuinely believe that the Confucius institutes pose a threat? Other Governments in the free world have banned the institutes from campuses, not only because they limit free speech, but because they have been involved in spying on Chinese students, especially those who show any kind of disregard for what China does. The institutes are very dangerous, and the issue goes wider than just the ability to shut down free speech: they are also reporting back about Chinese students, many of whom live in fear.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b73.5/1">I have recently been alerted to this issue and I am actively investigating it. I will update my right hon. Friend in coming days.</p> <p pid="b73.5/2">Government amendments 3 and 4 and 6 to 10 make provision on the payment of security costs for events. The amendments place a duty on higher education  providers, colleges and student unions not to pass on security costs unless in exceptional circumstances to secure freedom of speech within the law. The Government want to put an end to the practice of no-platforming by the back door, raised by many Members in Committee, including my right hon. Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Holland">South Holland</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Deepings">The Deepings</a>.</p> <p pid="b73.5/3">I said then that I was listening, and the amendments address the concerns. We have seen reports that a student society faced a &#163;500 security bill from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_University">Bristol University</a> student union to allow the Israeli ambassador to give a talk, while charging nothing to allow his Palestinian counterpart to do the same. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Jewish_Students">Union of Jewish Students</a> has reported to me that some Jewish societies have even been billed for security costs for having stalls at freshers&#8217; fairs. That is outrageous. If a university has a culture on campus in which security is required for inviting routine speakers, it has a culture in which intimidation, threats and violence are seen as acceptable. That does not constitute promoting free speech. The solution is to stamp that unacceptable culture out and stop student societies paying the price for those who break the law.</p> <p pid="b73.5/4">Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 5 will change the coverage of college student unions, often called junior and middle common rooms. It makes it clear that the Bill does cover the activities of JCRs and MCRs, thereby clarifying the position.</p> <p pid="b73.5/5">Government amendment 11 will make it clear that the OfS is not required to make a decision as to the extent to which a free speech complainant is justified if that complaint is then withdrawn. Government amendments 12 and 15 set out how publication under the scheme will work in relation to the more general publication provisions recently inserted into the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_and_Research_Act_2017">Higher Education and Research Act 2017</a> by the Skills and Post-16 Education Act 2022. In particular, the Bill provides for absolute privilege against defamation claims arising from publication of OfS&#8217;s decisions under the complaints scheme, whereas the general provisions give qualified privilege to other publications. The absolute privilege matches the approach taken by Parliament to the complaints scheme run by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Independent_Adjudicator_for_Higher_Education">Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education</a>.</p> <p pid="b73.5/6">Government amendments 1, 2 and 16 will remove the express limitation on the definition of academic freedom that it covers only matters within an academic&#8217;s field of expertise. Once again, the Government have listened carefully to Members who raised issues in Committee, including my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton and my right hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings.</p> <p pid="b73.5/7">The Bill marks the Government delivering on our manifesto pledge, while listening and strengthening the Bill throughout.</p>            </div>

His appointment was something of a surprise to many; he himself admitted that he had no experience in the  higher education sector. It seems that the only criterion for his appointment by this Government was that he had run the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>&#8217;s leadership campaign.</p>            </div>

What is most surprising of all&#8212;this arose both in the Bill Committee and during our witness sessions, as my hon.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b78.2/1">Of course it was a throwaway line, but the job does pay &#163;100,000. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman has a second job, but I do not, unlike so many on the Government Benches who may have second jobs. It goes without saying, in my book, that that person should resign if he or she is a member of a political party&#8212;that a person in such a sensitive role should be seen to be unalloyed by association, because perception is so important in this context. Of course I made that remark in jest, but it does seem to be a staggering amount of money that the Government are throwing at this post.</p> <p pid="b78.2/2">Let me now move on. The sector expects those leading the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Students">Office for Students</a> to be credible. If we really are to have a director for free speech, a person tasked with the job of settling contentious cases, it is in all our interests for that person to have a broad understanding of the sector, the legal framework around free speech to which I have referred, and the sector&#8217;s regulatory framework, but those elements are apparently not included in this job description. Such considerations would endow the director with greater legitimacy and authority, especially if he or she is to command the confidence of the Select  Committee and both Houses. In short, new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 4 is a common-sense <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> prioritising independence, accountability, and authority over top-down, partisan decision making.</p> <p pid="b78.2/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment_17">Amendment 17</a>, also tabled in my name, touches on one of the central tenets of the Bill, namely academic freedom. This can clearly be a fluid concept that has different meanings for different people in different contexts. Before I speak to that amendment, however, I want to address Government amendments 1, 2 and 16, which would remove the words</p> <p class="indent" pid="b78.2/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;and within their field of expertise&#8221; from the definition of academic freedom. Although, both on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> and in Committee, we expressed our concerns and those of the sector about how the Bill in its current form would in fact curtail academic freedom, only now have the Government moved on this. It is a shame that it took them just shy of 400 days to sit up and take note. Perhaps that demonstrates not just the disdain that Ministers show to academics and teaching staff, but their failure to appreciate the nature of our rightly admired, polymathic academic environment. Amendment 17, however, gives Ministers and the Conservative party an opportunity to demonstrate the extent of their support for academics.</p> <p pid="b78.2/6">Labour&#8217;s second amendment is partly inspired by part <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VI">VI</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO">UNESCO</a> definition of academic freedom. In the UNESCO definition, the concept of academic freedom is broken down into five parts: freedom of teaching and discussion, freedom to research and publish the results thereof, freedom for higher education teaching staff to express their opinion about the institution or system in which they work, freedom from institutional censorship, and freedom to participate in professional or representative academic bodies.</p> <p pid="b78.2/7">Let me briefly address the issue of research. Evidence submitted to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Bill_Committee">Public Bill Committee</a>, notably by Professor <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Whittle">Stephen Whittle</a>, highlighted instances in which some universities have blocked research that they deemed too controversial. While such cases are few and far between&#8212;partly owing to the Government-encouraged marketisation of the sector and the promotion of students as customers&#8212;I see no reason why the research interests of academics should not be protected under the definition of academic freedom. That said, academics are employees of higher education providers, institutions that will always require an academic to deliver teaching and research that satisfy the needs of students.</p> <p pid="b78.2/8">It is also important to link academic freedom to internationally recognised standards, given the Government&#8217;s stated desire to rip up the Human Rights Act. Before the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> tabled an amendment to remove the words</p> <p class="indent" pid="b78.2/9" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;and within their field of expertise&#8221;,</p> <p pid="b78.2/10">coupled with plans to repeal the Human Rights Act, that would have left academics less protected than those in Europe. Nothing can be more important in this Bill than the scope of academic freedom, and that is why Labour&#8217;s amendment is so vital. Protecting academic freedom goes beyond partisan political lines, as it provides a solid basis on which academics feel secure enough to test and challenge perceived wisdom. I urge Conservative Members to consider the interests of academics, and to support our amendment this evening.</p> <p pid="b78.2/11">I now want to turn to amendment 18, which recognises that in many cases where freedom of speech is called into question there are competing freedoms at play. It would therefore require the director to consider the right of students to feel safe, along with other legal duties of the provider when reaching a decision about a particular case. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> herself acknowledged on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_4">Radio 4</a> that the Bill emboldens holocaust deniers and other purveyors of hate speech by giving them the power to make vexatious complaints against universities. Invariably, there are competing interests at stake when speakers are invited on to our campuses.</p> <p pid="b78.2/12">Freedom of speech is not a trump card. Students also have a right not to be harassed, a right not to be subjected to hate speech and, perhaps most importantly, a right to protest. The right for students to feel safe on campus sometimes requires greater protection than that afforded to them under the Equality Act, especially in instances of reprehensible but lawful speech, such as holocaust denial. Professor Stephen Whittle from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Metropolitan_University">Manchester Metropolitan University</a> acknowledged as much in the Bill Committee, recognising that the Equality Act would afford protection only if the speech were directly addressed to the complainant. That is important because front groups such as Hizb ut-Tahrir, which is not a proscribed organisation but which often espouses antisemitic views, could come on to campus under the guise of freedom of speech. That point was not lost on the director of the Antisemitism Policy Trust, Danny Stone, who views it as a &#8220;real concern&#8221;. In such cases, the right of students&#8212;in this example, Jewish students&#8212;to feel safe on campus clearly must be considered. The Minister&#8217;s approach to the sensitive issues reported in the press overlooks those competing freedoms. It is perhaps a symptom of the Government&#8217;s singular desire to</p> <p class="indent" pid="b78.2/13" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;create political and cultural dividing lines mainly for&#8221;&#8212; their&#8212;</p> <p class="indent" pid="b78.2/15" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;advantage&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b78.2/16">Those are not my words but those of <a href="/mp/?p=24827" title="Our page on Jesse Norman - 'the right hon. Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire (Jesse Norman)'">Jesse Norman</a>.</p> <p pid="b78.2/17">I want to turn briefly to new clause 5. It would introduce a <a href="/glossary/?gl=235" title="A sunset clause is a provision of a law which causes the law to (in effect)..." class="glossary">sunset clause</a> to the Bill, ensuring that it expired after three years, and provides for clauses to be removed if they are not working. The new clause does not deny the importance of freedom of speech or academic freedom, or our commitment on this side of the House to both. It addresses the flimsy evidence base underpinning the Bill. Last week at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Policy_Institute">Higher Education Policy Institute</a> annual conference, the Minister struggled to provide concrete evidence to show that there was a freedom of speech crisis in our universities, other than anecdotes and what she believed to be true.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b81.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for her contribution. Yes, there are issues out there, but that is about the scale of it. That is what has been uncovered in the surveys and analysis done by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Students">Office for Students</a> and by others. The scale is being exaggerated by the Government in order to make this legislation. It would be nonsensical to ignore shifting attitudes, and new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 5 would allow for well-informed public policy guided by evidence rather than by Ministers&#8217; latest lightning rod of choice.</p> <p pid="b81.1/2">Our amendments 19 and 20 would ensure that non-disclosure agreements or confidentiality agreements between those listed in the Bill and higher education providers did not inhibit freedom of speech, save where it was expressly agreed to between the parties to protect <a href="/glossary/?gl=261" title="patents (for inventions), trade marks, protected designs, and copyrights;..." class="glossary">intellectual property</a>. I will defer to my hon. Friend the Member  for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Yardley">Birmingham, Yardley</a>, with whom I have tabled <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 19, to explore that further. She is a tireless campaigner on the issue and I commend her work in bringing it to the House&#8217;s attention on Report. I hope that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, who has previously stated her commitment to stamp out that practice, will take on board our suggestions.</p> <p pid="b81.1/3">Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to push the Minister on some of the finer points of the Government amendments. The illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia has rightly thrown a spotlight on the source of foreign investment and money in our public institutions. The misguided &#8220;golden era&#8221; ushered in by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron">David Cameron</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Osborne">George Osborne</a> in 2015, in which foreign nation states acquired substantial control over key parts of our national infrastructure, must come to an end.</p> <p pid="b81.1/4">The Government&#8217;s new clause 2 is much preferable to new clause 1, tabled by Conservative Back Benchers, particularly on the risk-based approach of the Government&#8217;s suggestion, but I have some concerns about new clause 2&#8217;s practical effect. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> suggests that it is her stated aim to reduce the data burden in the higher education sector. It is for that reason that I am interested in ascertaining how the new clause will be both proportionate and balanced. For example, the threshold at which providers have to report foreign donations is set to be determined by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> in regulations, so it is disappointing that once again the Minister seemingly chose to brief it to <a href="/glossary/?gl=49" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/" class="glossary">The Times</a> that the threshold would be set at &#163;75,000&#8212;as she mentioned earlier&#8212;rather than allow the House to have a meaningful debate on what is appropriate. This is not on the face of the Bill. Interestingly, when we contrast this to the reporting threshold in the United States, which is $250,000&#8212;just over the equivalent of &#163;200,000&#8212;the Government seem at risk of disincentivising foreign investment by implementing additional bureaucratic burdens.</p> <p pid="b81.1/5">I am also concerned about the scope of new clause 2, and I would be grateful if the Minister could expand a bit more on what is meant by &#8220;constituent institutions.&#8221; How much direct control does a higher education provider need to have over a constituent institution for it to fall under the remit of the new clause? For example, would  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_University_Press">Cambridge University Press</a> be covered? My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25386" title="Our page on Daniel Zeichner - 'the Member for Cambridge (Daniel Zeichner)'">Daniel Zeichner</a> referred to that earlier. Relatedly, some of the requirements in the new clause are quite technical and may require fine judgment. It is likely that the value of non-monetary benefits&#8212;human capital and access to data, for example&#8212;will be difficult to ascertain. Could the Minister therefore detail what steps she is taking to ensure that universities are supported in determining the value of the partnerships they sign?</p> <p pid="b81.1/6">The Government&#8217;s proposal hands the responsibility for the new clause to the director for freedom of speech, making the director&#8217;s appointment all the more important. This adds further justification to our new clause 4, and I hope that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_MPs">Conservative MPs</a> will consider that when they go through the Lobby later. Given that the regulator has limited prior experience of dealing with research partnerships or commercial arrangements, what additional resources will be provided to the OfS to handle this new responsibility?</p> <p pid="b81.1/7">Labour has tabled some important amendments in the same manner and spirit as we did in Committee. Let us remember that we debated a staggering 80-plus amendments in Committee at that time&#8212;it is a 19-page report&#8212;and now we have these few. Such a number would seem to underline just what a big dog&#8217;s breakfast the legislation is, and I am sure that those in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a> will spend many an hour realising what poor quality red meat lies at the bottom of it.</p>            </div>

I want to focus my comments on new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 3, tabled by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25906" title="Our page on Alicia Kearns - 'the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alicia Kearns)'">Alicia Kearns</a> and signed by myself and others. The issue that I wish to touch on is the behaviour of some universities with regard to funding from countries that have the exact opposite view from ours on how freedom of speech should work. It was suggested earlier that we should be very careful about trying to insert ourselves into the funding of universities, but I think to the contrary to some degree, and I shall raise a case relating to that. I believe that when money is accepted from countries whose purpose is to undermine the nature of how we live our lives&#8212;including in regards to freedom of speech&#8212;that helps to pervert the processes of the institutions and universities.</p> <p pid="b82.0/2">One important question is whether there is a weakness in the Bill in one particular area, and that is to do with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius_Institute">Confucius Institute</a>. I do not apologise for naming that particular organisation, because countries such as Germany, the United States and others that are quite close to us have already decided that that institute is not based around learning and academia and that it is in fact set up for an ulterior purpose, which is essentially to bully Chinese students in particular, but even other students, and to report back on the behaviour of many Chinese students studying in British universities. This has been evidenced in a number of countries. I would therefore have liked to see the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a>, in line with this <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> and national security, take the power to stop such organisations where there is clear and compelling evidence that their purpose is not the stated purpose of delivering Chinese language and cultural instruction but enabling the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> to understand who is saying the right things and who is saying the wrong things.</p> <p pid="b82.0/3">To that extent, the Confucius institutes have even inserted themselves into schools. Many Confucius institutes have developed strong ties with local schools, and their provision of language assistance is seen as a very high-value contribution. It starts early now, and it extends.</p>            </div>

He and I are both members of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPAC">IPAC</a>, and we have seen all this ourselves. Colleagues on both sides of the House are involved in IPAC, and there is compelling evidence of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>&#8217;s growing influence on British academia through various organisations. Many do not recognise it. We have had meetings with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Group">Russell Group</a> universities and individual colleges&#8212;I will address  one in particular&#8212;in which we have explained this. Many had not really thought about it but, on reflection, realised there was a problem and that they had to start diversifying. One or two arrogantly refused point blank to admit or even accept the situation.</p> <p pid="b83.3/2"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_College,_Cambridge">Jesus College, Cambridge</a> has been incredibly deliberate and arrogant, which is why the Government need to go further. The Jesus College Global Issues Dialogue Centre received a grant of &#163;200,000 from the Chinese state in 2018 through its <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Development_and_Reform_Commission">National Development and Reform Commission</a>. The Jesus College China Centre also has close financial and organisational links with the Cambridge China Development Trust, which is funded by the Chinese state. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCDT">CCDT</a> donated &#163;80,000 to the Jesus College China Centre over three years, and they share the same director. CCDT funding has been used to fund the Jesus College China Centre&#8217;s doctorships, scholarships, administrative support and seminars.</p> <p pid="b83.3/3">Jesus College received &#163;155,000 of funding from Huawei in 2018. We have banned Huawei from our telecoms system because it is a security risk, yet it has set up a huge centre in and around Cambridge. For what purpose? To get in through the back door.</p> <p pid="b83.3/4">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIDC">GIDC</a>&#8217;s <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">white paper</a> on global technology governance claimed an equivalence between the Chinese Government&#8217;s mass online censorship regime and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a>&#8217;s attempts to eradicate child abuse online&#8212;that is the key. The same paper falsely claimed that Huawei had freely shared all its <a href="/glossary/?gl=261" title="patents (for inventions), trade marks, protected designs, and copyrights;..." class="glossary">intellectual property</a> on 5G technology, leading the college to be accused of &#8220;reputation laundering.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b83.3/5">To those who say that money does not have an impact, I say, &#8220;Oh yes it does.&#8221; When money is repeatedly on offer, it tends to bend institutions towards the idea of having that extra money. I understand their concerns and their need for financial support, but the Government need to take this seriously.</p> <p pid="b83.3/6">The Chinese Government are committing genocide and using slave labour to produce goods in Xinjiang, and technology derived from UK universities is being used to spy on those slave labour camps. China is also using slave labour in Tibet, and it is imposing itself and locking up peaceful democracy campaigners in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>.</p> <p pid="b83.3/7">We rightly talk of free speech and the importance of our young people developing an instinct for argument, debate and balance, but these are lost to China and Chinese students, who are fearful when they come here. I accept that the Government think they have this covered, but I wish they would look again.</p> <p pid="b83.3/8">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton enormously on tabling new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 3. If the Bill is not tightened up to that degree, many of us on the left and the right of politics will ensure in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a> that these abuses cannot happen. The lives of Chinese students and Chinese people more widely remain our responsibility. If freedom of speech is the subject of our debate, we should cry for how damaged and destroyed it is elsewhere.</p>            </div>

Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith)'">Sir Iain Duncan Smith</a>. I fear that Cambridge University will not come out well from my speech either.</p> <p pid="b84.0/2">The debate is about freedom of speech on campus. My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25803" title="Our page on Kim Johnson - 'the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Kim Johnson)'">Kim Johnson</a> pointed to six cancellations&#8212;in my view, that is six too many&#8212;but I am going to talk about the silencing in non-disclosure agreements, which thousands of people are suffering from.</p> <p pid="b84.0/3">We know that the data on violence and abuse, and certainly on sexual violence, is a tiny fraction of the reality, but even that data shows that millions of pounds are being spent on this issue. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend and near neighbour <a href="/mp/?p=25701" title="Our page on Matt Western - 'the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Matt Western)'">Matt Western</a>, would stop young men and women&#8212;including university staff&#8212;being prevented from speaking about their experiences on campus. That is what this is all about, isn&#8217;t it? It is about people being able to talk about their lives, experiences, beliefs and freedoms on campus. Currently, we are all sitting by while that section of the community, who may have been raped on campus, bullied, harassed or racially abused, can be silenced by that very institution and cannot speak about it at all. I am going to talk about those people.</p> <p pid="b84.0/4">Horrendous examples of silencing have been reported in the press. Brave women have spoken out even though they know the risks. According to one student, her university imposed a &#8220;blanket gagging order&#8221; on her after she alleged she was violently raped by another undergraduate. The victim claimed she was warned she would be expelled if she went to the press to report this violence or to talk about the college procedures. That gives you a clue as to where some of these people are from, because I said the word &#8220;college&#8221;; most other universities do not say that. The non-disclosure agreement was imposed. Apparently, the college had tried</p> <p class="indent" pid="b84.0/5" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;desperately to convince her not to complain&#8221; and she had</p> <p class="indent" pid="b84.0/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;lost count of the members of staff who tried to silence, scare, threaten and undermine&#8221; her.</p> <p pid="b84.0/9">According to an investigation by the magazine Elle, a student alleged she was sexually assaulted and then endured terrible treatment from the university relating to her claim of violence. Post-graduation, she complained to the university about how it had handled her situation. She was eventually offered &#163;1,000 compensation, without any admission of wrongdoing, and with a non-disclosure agreement to prevent her from talking about it. The student, exhausted by her experiences, signed the NDA.</p>            </div>

Has he seen the figures on police rape recording and reporting? In the first instance that I was talking about, the individual absolutely went to the police. Of the 66,000 women&#8212;I am speaking only about women now; there will have been more&#8212;who came forward and said that they had been raped last year, a charge will have been faced in  about 600 of those cases; and then look at the number of convictions. Are we expecting our institutions, our workplaces, our university institutions not to have a role to play in supporting people when that has happened? As I am sure the right hon. Gentleman know, the balance of probability has a different relation to civil law than criminal law, so the idea that if a woman did not go the police she should not be allowed to complain to her institution is not one that I recognise and it is not one that this House recognised when we set up an independent complaints system. However, what often gets said to women when they come forward to their employer, to their institution, is, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell the police?&#8221;</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b86.1/1">I will absolutely come on to naming some of those institutions. As I said, this was found by Elle magazine, which is collecting this data, unlike the Government at the moment. The article said the student claimed this arrangement felt</p> <p class="indent" pid="b86.1/2" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;worse than the assault&#8212;Dealing with this abuse of power was far more traumatic. It was emotionally exhausting and humiliating.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b86.1/3">Earlier this year, the Express took a day off from talking about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Diana">Princess Diana</a> and its investigation revealed that more than 3,500 cases of assault were reported in 78 institutions in the UK in the last five years. The figure consists of confirmed cases of sexual violence and disclosures made by both staff and students pending investigation. The 135 freedom of information requests sent to every university in the UK also revealed that many do not record figures of sexual assaults, so the overall number is likely to be much higher. So it is, &#8220;Just don&#8217;t record it and then it doesn&#8217;t happen.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b86.1/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_2020">In 2020</a>, a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC">BBC</a> investigation found that over 300 NDAs were used by universities in student complaints between 2016 and 2020, and that almost a third of all universities in England had used such deals in these circumstances. The probe discovered that universities had paid out &#163;1.3 million on these deals, although the true scale is thought to be much larger. The campaign Can&#8217;t Buy My Silence was started by the brilliant and formidable Zelda Perkins, once an assistant to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein">Harvey Weinstein</a> and someone who had an NDA imposed on her related to his crimes, and Professor Julie Macfarlane. Their campaign has survivors&#8217; testimony reporting that NDAs had gagged them from speaking of their experiences with family or loved ones, or even their therapists. I pay tribute to them and the work they are doing alongside the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, whom I know speaks to them. However, like me, they agree that legislation is necessary to tackle this.</p> <p pid="b86.1/5">So far, 66 universities have signed the Government&#8217;s pledge. I made this speech on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> and since then the Government added &#8220;looking at non-disclosure agreements&#8221; into the violence against women and girls strategy, which was published late at the end of last year. I stand here in complete respect for the Minister. She has sought to do what she can to improve the situation.  She has worked with the campaigns that I have talked about to get universities signing pledges. She is working with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Students">Office for Students</a> to look at regulation and at what needs to happen if these things are breached. Every <a href="/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a> will have had to try to get a regulator to do something about their bad cases, and we are here with universities signing &#8220;pledges&#8221;. I do not know how we are going to know whether they are breaking their pledge if people have been gagged.</p> <p pid="b86.1/6">So far, 66 universities have signed the Government&#8217;s pledge. That is great, but why haven&#8217;t the others? I encourage every university to do this. There are over 130 universities in the UK. What about those students? What about their right to speak out? As <a href="/mp/?p=25906" title="Our page on Alicia Kearns - 'the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alicia Kearns)'">Alicia Kearns</a> pointed out, she would want to hear about this. I am not going to list all the universities that have not signed it, but here are some: the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, King&#8217;s College London, the London School of Economics, the University of Wolverhampton and the University of Sunderland. That is just to name a few. Perhaps it is taking time and perhaps they are getting around to it. I very much encourage them to do it.</p> <p pid="b86.1/7">Just to show the House what I am talking about, I have an example here of one of these NDAs. This is the kind of thing that students are asked to do. It is not necessarily called a non-disclosure agreement, and that is a way out of this; <a href="/mp/?p=11389" title="Our page on Maria Miller - 'the right hon. Member for Basingstoke (Dame Maria Miller)'">Dame Maria Miller</a> and I often challenge organisations when they say they do not have NDAs, because we have them in our inboxes and they call them something else. They will call them a &#8220;confidentiality agreement&#8221;. In lots of cases in universities we have seen the growth of &#8220;no contact arrangements&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b86.1/8">I will read this agreement out&#8212;this is from the university. It says, &#8220;We recognise the sensitive nature of the allegation involved. In consideration of our duty of care to both parties, we have therefore concluded that in the interest of both parties a non-contact arrangement is required.&#8221; This young woman who had been raped was told, exactly as the person accused of raping her was told, that she had to stay out of certain places; she could not go to certain things at certain times. She was told that she, &#8220;Is not to enter the building&#8221;, that her, &#8220;Fob access will be disabled&#8221; and that she is, &#8220;Not to enter the building unless for tutorials and classes notified in advance.&#8221; She is told, &#8220;Fob access will be disabled unless we have had advance notification&#8221;&#8212;this is a rape victim being told that she has to report to a guard so that she can go to her classes. She is also told, &#8220;You are asked not to make any information about these allegations, the police investigation or the safeguarding arrangements that we have made available on any form of public media&#8221;&#8212;so she should not talk about this document. Finally, she is told, &#8220;Evidence of repeated breaches of this arrangement and/or a serious breach of conditions&#8212;entering an embargoed building or publishing material in the press&#8212;will result in your expulsion.&#8221; That is from one of the finest universities in the world.</p> <p pid="b86.1/9">This is about people&#8217;s silence, but not just their silence; it is about their movement, their freedom and every element of their freedom of expression being stopped. Yet there is nothing in the Bill about freedom of speech,   freedom of expression or freedom to study. There is nothing that the Government are proposing to do or to put in legislation. I simply do not understand why they would not have taken this opportunity to do something.</p> <p pid="b86.1/10">I met the Minister last week and, as I said, I do not doubt her total and utter commitment. Incidentally, she said earlier that &#8220;legislation of this nature can spur culture change.&#8221; Yet she told me last week that legislation is not always the answer&#8212;[Interruption.] I will take the <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>, by all means. No? Okay. She also explained to me that the Office for Students is looking at regulation to, for example, take away the status of a university if it is guilty of a breach. I responded&#8212;and I say again&#8212;that the idea that a rape victim who has signed a non-disclosure agreement will take down Cambridge University is the stuff of cinematic hopeful glory. I will believe that when I see it, which everybody in this building knows will be never. Why would we want to push universities and victims into that position? Why would we not legislate to stop the use of non-disclosure agreements?</p>            </div>

By the way, I stimulated a number of others to do the same, and  I have no doubt that they will want to chip in on a similar basis this evening.</p> <p pid="b89.0/13">The conclusion I drew, having thought about it, was that those decent people on the Labour Benches who certainly believe in free speech and the exchange of honestly held opinion find that hard to reconcile with a zeitgeist that is preoccupied with a fear of causing offence. We are perpetually told now that because we must not make people feel uncomfortable, we must not offend them. We in this House know, do we not, that the ability to alarm is closely associated with the ability to inspire, that the ability to disturb is intrinsically linked with the ability to enthral, and that even the capacity to shock is necessary in the development and exposure of new ideas and fresh thinking?</p>            </div>

I thank him for being one of the few Conservative Members who listens to the contributions. On the point he is making, it is not about disagreeing with this idea of shocking people or of having different opinions; the fundamental problem, as I have said repeatedly, is how this piece of legislation interacts with existing legislation already in place. How does this interact with equality legislation? How does this interact with other existing pieces of legislation? My concern is further developed when I see the person who is making the decision on how these different pieces of legislation interact with each other. It is, as has been mentioned&#8212;and this is the reason for new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 4&#8212;somebody appointed by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> of the day, which then leads to all those issues around impartiality of process. We have a situation here where we have a piece of legislation that almost buts up against existing equality legislation, but it is not quite clear how their processes will rub together, yet there is no specification that the person making the decisions has to have legal experience or knowledge; they are instead a political appointment. That is where we have the difficulty&#8212;it is not with freedom of speech, but with the legislation itself.</p>            </div>

We could end up with a situation where free speech is the preserve of students who attend university, but those outside university will have their free speech limited unless they are very, very quiet and do not protest too loudly. We could end up with more conflict, with one part of the Government saying one thing in terms of restricting protest, and another part of the Government saying something else about supporting free speech. It is fair to say that having this Bill along with existing and proposed legislation will create a muddle.</p>            </div>

Free speech by its very nature means people saying all kinds of things in all kinds of ways about all kinds of subjects. The hon. Lady is right that there will be tensions to be settled, which is precisely why the Government have put in place mechanisms to do that. They are going to appoint, as was said earlier, an office with responsibility for ensuring that this Bill&#8217;s intentions and provisions are applied consistently. The Government acknowledge the difficulties that she has highlighted, which is precisely why they are putting in place a person and team to do exactly that.</p>            </div>

My hon. Friend is right. This Bill is significant, but modest, so let it be the beginning of a crusade to establish freedom as the default position across all our legislative considerations in exactly the way&#8212;with erudition and diligence, matched by experience&#8212;that my right hon. Friend illustrates.</p> <p pid="b91.5/2">Free speech is complex and, in the words of the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington, may be seen as an abstraction, but if it is an abstraction, it is one that is essential for the wellbeing of our free society, for it is at the very heart of what an open society is all about. The ability to say things which, as I said earlier, alarm, disturb, or even shock, and hear things with which we disagree is the very nature of what good universities are all about. I fear that that is jeopardised by some of the thinking that permeates universities, particularly university leaders and managers. For example, Professor Ahmed also spoke of</p> <p class="indent" pid="b91.5/3" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;issues to do with race, with transgender, and with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_Palestine">Israel and Palestine</a> on which they were simply unwilling to say what they thought&#8221;&#8211;&#8211;[Official Report, Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Bill_Committee">Public Bill Committee</a>, <phrase class="date" code="2022-09-07">7 September</phrase> 2021; c. 13, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q22">Q22</a>.]</p> <p pid="b91.5/4">people fear the consequences of doing so.

Gentleman is offended, he is never offensive, so I always enjoy debating with him. On the issue of the need to challenge and to shock, there is always a line to be drawn somewhere. In Committee we talked about the offensiveness of holocaust denial. Okay, there is not a physical threat from holocaust denial, but I think that we would all agree that it is very offensive and it is therefore very hurtful. A line will always have to be drawn when it comes to free speech, but we have the difficulty, which I keep going back to, of who makes the decision on where that line is drawn&#8212;what experience do they have, what criteria is set, what is their knowledge, and what is their understanding of the subject. Having the right person at the top is important. I am sure that the right hon. Member will accept that, yes, someone might want to offend, to shock or to stimulate discussion, but there is always a point at which we say, &#8220;No, that is not intellectual stimulation.

How does that prepare them for going out into the real world, where they are, whether they like it or not, going to hear things that are not to their liking?

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b93.5/1">I thought my right hon. Friend was going to challenge my literary knowledge, but let us move to the amendments.</p> <p pid="b93.5/2">The Government have moved a considerable way since we debated the matter in Committee, and I congratulate and thank my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Universities for her earlier words and especially for what she has done. She listened carefully in Committee. Often, when Ministers in Committee say, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take that away and think about it.&#8221;, we know they are going through the motions, but not this Minister, any more than I did when I was a Minister.</p> <p pid="b93.5/3">I think it is important that <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> metamorphosise through scrutiny and that Governments listen to argument&#8212;including arguments from those on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Benches, by the way. When I was a Minister, I would often go back to my civil servants and say, &#8220;Well, what the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> Minister said seemed to make a lot of sense to me. Why aren&#8217;t we doing that?&#8221;. That is a very effective way for Ministers to challenge their own officials when they hear cogent and sensible arguments put from all parts of the House. That is precisely what this Minister did, and the Government amendments, on which I will not comment in any detail, reflect her consideration of the strong arguments that we used to strengthen this Bill, which she has now done in a number of respects.</p> <p pid="b93.5/4">Having said that, I want the Minister to go further. She will have seen the new clauses and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> in my name, and I will deal with them very briefly. The first deals with the matter of staff beyond those who are full-time employees of the university. That point was made by hon. Members across the House, because the character of employment at universities has changed. Very often, universities now employ temporary staff, visiting staff and so on, and it is important that everyone associated with the university is protected by the provisions of this legislation. The purpose of new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 6 is to include,</p> <p class="indent" pid="b93.5/5" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;any academic staff (however engaged or employed), honorary, visiting and emeritus academic members&#8221;,</p> <p pid="b93.5/6">and providers of academic expertise.</p> <p pid="b93.5/7">New clause 7 and amendment 21 deal with exactly the point that the hon. Member for Kingston upon <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_West_and_Hessle">Hull West and Hessle</a> raised: the relationship between this legislation and the Equality Act. We received assurances from the Minister about that in Committee, and I have made further representations to her since then. Of course, I have no doubt that the upper House, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>, will return to those matters, but the hon. Lady is right that it is important from a legislative perspective that the Bill works with other statute and that its provisions are not successfully challenged by recourse to other <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a>. I hope the Minister might say a word or two more about that in respect of the new clause and amendment in my name and that of my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25811" title="Our page on Tom Hunt - 'the Member for Ipswich (Tom Hunt)'">Tom Hunt</a>.</p> <p pid="b93.5/8">In summary, I believe this Bill is an appropriate, apposite and sensible response to growing concerns in universities about free speech being inhibited. I am disappointed with the Opposition&#8212;I say that with some distress&#8212;that they voted against <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>. I thought they would not as I thought they would try to improve and amend it. They were caught on the horns of a dilemma, because in Committee they did just that, and again today I see amendments, some of which I have some sympathy with, in the name of the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington and others. Their amendments are designed to improve the Bill, yet simultaneously they deny that there is a problem.</p> <p pid="b93.5/9"><a href="/mp/?p=24709" title="Our page on Bridget Phillipson - 'The hon. Member for Houghton and Sunderland South (Bridget Phillipson)'">Bridget Phillipson</a> has said that we should not &#8220;pick fights with students&#8221;. If we have to pick a fight with the tyrants among students, then so be it; there are people among student bodies who do not believe in freedom in the way that most people in this Chamber do, who want to see that freedom restricted and inhibited. I am worried that the hon. Lady has described an emphasis on free speech as a distraction. How can the advocacy of freedom, how can the pursuit of open debate ever be a distraction? The Government will not be distracted, and neither will Conservative Members in our campaign to ensure that, in the words of Disraeli and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Newman">Cardinal Newman</a>, universities remain places of &#8220;light, liberty and learning&#8221;.</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 1, which stands in my name and in the names of my colleagues, my right hon. and learned Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24843" title="Our page on Robert Buckland - 'the Member for South Swindon (Sir Robert Buckland)'">Sir Robert Buckland</a> and my right hon.

I thank Professor John Heathershaw and his colleagues at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Exeter">University of Exeter</a> for their input.</p> <p pid="b94.0/2">This Bill is a very serious one, and the issue I raise of transparency in our universities is a very serious one. It has been much publicised of late in the newspapers in relation to some very distinguished and famous universities that have been alluded to already in this House, and rightly so. It is often misunderstood or underappreciated in the higher education sector how important the issue of undue influence and non-transparency is to the reputation of that sector, which is one of the crown jewels of our country both economically and culturally.</p> <p pid="b94.0/3">Universities exercise a wider influence not only over the young people whom they educate, but more widely in our public life, yet no standard approach has existed to date for handling foreign donations. No single standard has been created to allow donations to be made transparent, to be made public and to be properly tracked, and, therefore, for students and other donors and the public at large to understand whether there are pressures of a financial nature, and if so what pressures there may be, on the institutions with which they may have to deal.</p> <p pid="b94.0/4">Instead of this panoply of different approaches and different thresholds, and this lack of transparency and culture of non-disclosure, it is important that the Bill addresses those matters and brings some order to the situation. That is what my new clause and the other new clauses, which I am delighted to see have been tabled in a similar spirit, are designed to address. In my case, the measure is aimed not at any specific country or individuals, but generally so that there should be a wide understanding of the lack of transparency and a wider solution to it. I take my hat off, metaphorically, to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, her <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> and her officials, because the Government have substantially accepted my new clause, and indeed&#8212;dare I say?&#8212;arguably even improved it in relation, for example, to politically exposed persons. I thank her and other Ministers for the very constructive attitude that she and they have taken in relation to this important issue.</p> <p pid="b94.0/5">I will make a couple of small points in passing because this is still a live matter and officials will wish to think about the implementing regulations. The first is about the enlarged role for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Students">Office for Students</a> and the need for it to be given a role that it can dispatch rapidly and effectively as well as impartially. More widely, I note the essential importance of the higher education sector and of our universities being zealous in themselves, as institutions, in preserving freedom of speech and the culture of a deeper freedom of speech that, as so many Members have said, they have sought to defend in their treatment of students and colleagues. That remains vital.</p> <p pid="b94.0/6">I am delighted to support the Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> and withdraw my new clause 1 as a result.</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 3, but I wish first to welcome the significant work done by my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24827" title="Our page on Jesse Norman - 'the Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire (Jesse Norman)'">Jesse Norman</a>, which has had an implication for that which I sought to achieve, and to touch briefly on new clause 19, tabled by <a href="/mp/?p=25364" title="Our page on Jess Phillips - 'the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Jess Phillips)'">Jess Phillips</a>, with which I have  enormous sympathy. When you are an alumnus of a university, you have a great ability, you would hope, to influence it, so I place on record that if <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzwilliam_College,_Cambridge">Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge</a> is using NDAs, it can expect this not to be the last it will hear of it. I will work with the hon. Lady to call it out if it is doing it, but I am sure that there is absolutely no way that the place that gave me an incredible three years would be doing that.</p> <p pid="b95.0/2">New clause 3 was tabled to solve a series of problems that we face in our education system. We exist in a state of hybrid warfare where we do not necessarily know that we are at war. Indeed, more often than not our enemies do not tell us that we are at war&#8212;the most effective manner to attack us. In this war they use every possible lever of influence to attack us. It is naive, sadly, but our universities are failing to accept that they are being weaponised and used against us in a state of hybrid warfare. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist">Chinese Communist</a> party is at war with us, because between now and 2050 it expects there to be a war between two world orders&#8212;theirs and ours, ours being the one that believes in the rule of democracy and standing up for freedom of speech, which this Bill so focuses on. We might not realise that we are at war, but we are, and for decades now we have failed to recognise that. It is not enough to say, &#8220;Bad Chinese Communist party&#8212;stop doing what you are doing in trying to achieve your goals and the continuance of your power.&#8221; We have to take the fight to it in terms of standing up for what we believe in, standing up for our world order, and, most importantly, building resilience within our system.</p> <p pid="b95.0/3">That is what my new clause focuses on doing&#8212;tackling the unintentional ignorance, or potentially wilful deceit, of those who do not recognise the seriousness with which our education system is under attack. Everyone plays a role in protecting freedom of speech. That is why I am so grateful to the very many colleagues who over the past few days have spoken in support of the new clause and given support on the issue across the House. I also thank the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Education">Department for Education</a>, and particularly the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, who has been in constant dialogue with me and has adopted the ambitions of the new clause completely. I know that in coming months we will work together to make sure that we build the resilience that is needed in the education system.</p> <p pid="b95.0/4">My new clause particularly seeks to focus on Confucius institutes, which play an enormous role in the teaching of Mandarin and all that comes with learning that language&#8212;cultural understanding, historical understanding, debates about the present day, and debates about the entire concept of the country and how it feels, breathes, lives and sees itself. We have 30 Confucius institutes in this country. Nowhere else in the world has anywhere near 30. One might ask why Scotland has the highest number of Confucius institutes in the entire world. There is a reason why the Chinese Communist party has chosen to infiltrate Scottish education and to try to force its own narrative within those areas. More concerningly, almost all <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> spending on Mandarin language teaching in schools, which is &#163;27 million from 2015 to 2024, goes through Confucius institutes.</p> <p pid="b95.0/5">Our students and our kids&#8212;our under-18s&#8212;are being taught Mandarin by Confucius institutes, which are an arm of the Chinese state. Confucius institutes are supervised by the Chinese Communist party through the Ministry of Education. They are not allowed to hire teachers  unless they have been vetted by the Chinese Communist party. I have recently discovered that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_University">Edinburgh University</a>&#8217;s Confucius institute has representatives of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>&#8217;s embassy on its board. This is absolutely outright political <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>. Teachers are not allowed to cover issues such as Taiwan or Tibet, which are apparently sensitive. This is deeply concerning. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster_University">Lancaster University</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_Hill_University">Edge Hill University</a> rely on CIs to provide teaching for undergraduates. We cannot allow a hostile power to capture our education provision. That is why we need transparency.</p> <p pid="b95.0/6">I thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Hereford and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Herefordshire">South Herefordshire</a> because his new clause has allowed us to bring in the requirement to report when universities take in foreign funding. These safeguards bring us into line with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US">US</a>, Germany and the Netherlands, all of which discourage their universities from using Confucius institutes or introduce mandatory financial disclosures, because British students deserve a choice. They should not be forced to learn a language through the prism and narrative of a genocidal regime. That is all we are trying to do. We are not anti-China; we are trying to create resilience within our system. I am pleased that the Government are taking action and that under their amendments universities and student unions will be required to register funding arrangements. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Students">Office for Students</a> will have the power to force universities to provide alternative Mandarin education or to terminate Confucius institutes&#8217; contracts.</p>            </div>

Friend, who has been enormously supportive of the new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a>. I agree. I would have preferred to see these powers sit with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>, but the Government are not willing to give on that. However, they have made it clear&#8212;I challenged the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> in her opening remarks and she confirmed this&#8212;that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education">Secretary of State for Education</a> will have the ability to direct the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Students">Office for Students</a> if required.</p> <p pid="b97.1/2">I would argue that it is impossible for Confucius institutes to operate in this country without undermining our national security. They are an instrument of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> and their propaganda wing with one sole goal. It is therefore critical that the Secretary of State directs the OfS where needed, and I urge him to regularly review its progress. I believe that the message going out from this House today is clear&#8212;that we have the power to terminate hostile states&#8217; programmes and we must protect academic freedom.</p> <p pid="b97.1/3">On next steps, this is about not just building resilience but offering alternatives. As China&#8217;s role on the world stage grows, we have an amazing emerging pool of talent of Chinese speakers and China experts. We must provide alternative opportunities for the learning of Mandarin. I can think of no better way to do that than  through our friends in Taiwan, whose track record in providing language courses is exemplary. They already work with our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a> and intelligence services in providing these language lessons. We must also fund Mandarin education.</p> <p pid="b97.1/4">I thank the Minister for working with me to adopt these measures and for safeguarding academic freedom. My new clause provides a duty on financial disclosures, and it offers an alternative in the ability to terminate Confucius institutes and the power of the Secretary of State to direct, but I will not press it to a vote. We should be proud of British universities and proud to stand up for liberty and academic freedom. Without academic freedom, there is no open dialogue; without dialogue, there can only be <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">division</a>. It is important we use this Bill as the first step in sending a clear message to the entire education sector and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist">Chinese Communist</a> party that we will not give them a back door to undermine our country and our national security through our universities.</p>            </div>

The belief that human life starts at conception is a scientifically valid belief, and one that I hold myself. Students and staff should absolutely be protected in reflecting that view. He leads me on to my next point, which is that for every high-profile case we have discussed in the House today, many more never make the headlines. Underneath these incidents lies a culture where students and academics alike are becoming afraid to discuss and share their views. Last October, the University and College Union published a report showing that 35% of UK academics had undertaken self-censorship for fear  of negative repercussions, such as the loss of privileges, demotion or even physical harm. The report&#8217;s authors commented:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b98.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Self-censorship at this level appears to make a mockery of any pretence by universities of being paragons of free speech and&#8230;the pursuit of knowledge and academic freedom.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b98.2/3">The evidence is clear: free speech and academic freedoms in our universities are under threat, so I welcome the Government amendments that will strengthen the Bill further. Amendments 1, 2 and 16 extend protections to academics by removing the express limitation that academic freedom covers only matters within an academic&#8217;s field of expertise. They are important: first, because in many disciplines it would be hard to define exactly where the boundaries of a particular field lie; and secondly, because it is right to recognise that research and ideas do not exist in silos. There are obvious crossovers, for example, between science and ethics, politics and economics, philosophy and history. We need our greatest minds to be free to write, to speak and to conduct research in an unrestricted way for the benefit of our whole society.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b99.1/1">My right hon. Friend is right: this Bill is an important marker for universities, which will be forced to recognise that these are not specific isolated issues, but that there is a culture change that needs to be addressed across our whole country. We are also seeing it in other countries in the world, particularly America.</p> <p pid="b99.1/2">I support the amendments to remove the restriction on field of expertise, and I also support Government amendments 3, 4 and 6 to 10, which will ensure that higher education providers cannot require visiting speakers or hosting bodies to bear some or all of the costs of security. This will prevent no-platforming by the back door. As my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> has already said, if universities have a physical safety and security issue on campus, they should urgently address the root of that.</p> <p pid="b99.1/3">On safety, <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 18, in the name of <a href="/mp/?p=25701" title="Our page on Matt Western - 'the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Matt Western)'">Matt Western</a>, would compel the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Students">Office for Students</a>, when considering a free speech complaint, to be mindful of the right of students to feel safe on university campuses. I have no doubt that the amendment is well meant, and I listened carefully to his arguments, but I fear that it would further embed the culture and attitudes that have led to the chilling effect on free speech and that have made this Bill necessary.</p> <p pid="b99.1/4">In the amendment, as on campus, we see the conflation of physical safety with intellectual and emotional comfort. Students should of course be physically safe, and higher education institutions have a duty to follow health and safety law, like all other organisations, but I suspect that is not what the amendment is getting at. Universities should absolutely not be cultivating an atmosphere on campus where students believe they are or should be  free from emotional and intellectual discomfort. Just as our bodies must go through training, challenge and discomfort to become physically fit, so our minds must experience challenge, discomfort and sometimes even offence to become stronger, more resilient and more wise.</p> <p pid="b99.1/5">In the recent book, &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coddling_of_the_American_Mind">The Coddling of the American Mind</a>&#8221;, the authors describe &#8220;anti-fragility&#8221;, the idea that young people&#8217;s brains must be exposed to challenges and stresses, or they will fail to mature into strong and capable adults able to engage productively with people and ideas that challenge their beliefs. Nowhere is it more important to understand the concept of anti-fragility than in our universities, where institutions are cultivating minds that will become the thought leaders of tomorrow. Since our universities act as an incubator for wider public culture, we will fail to uphold freedom of debate in this country if we fail to uphold it on campus.</p> <p pid="b99.1/6">Freedom of speech is the bedrock of democracy. As a recent <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times">New York Times</a> editorial put it:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b99.1/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Ideas that go unchallenged by opposing views risk becoming weak and brittle rather than being strengthened by tough scrutiny.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b99.1/8">We saw the impact of that cancel culture in political and social debate during covid, where damaging, un-evidenced, ineffective and wasteful policies went unchallenged. If we value the kind of rigorous debate that upholds democracy and ensures the best policies are produced, we must not allow this concept creep of the term &#8220;safety&#8221; on campus.</p> <p pid="b99.1/9">Despite levelling up, Brexit and enormous economic challenges, this is possibly one of the most important <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> making its way through Parliament, because our ability to unite and level up in this country is threatened by the culture on campus. The starkest <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">division</a> in British society&#8212;not only in voting behaviour, but in social values&#8212;is between graduates and non-graduates. The trend towards a homogenous worldview in our higher education institutions is exacerbating this division. Instead, we need our universities to be places where it is the norm for competing ideas to co-exist and to be openly interrogated and challenged by evidence.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b101.0/1">With the leave of the House, I will speak on the non-Government amendments. New <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 1 seeks to improve transparency, especially in relation to foreign donations, and new clause 3 would place a duty on higher education providers as part of the promote duty to report information about foreign language, culture and exchange programmes and courses to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Students">Office for Students</a> and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State would then be empowered to direct them to terminate the partnership or offer an equivalent if there were concerns about freedom of speech.</p> <p pid="b101.0/2">My hon. Friends are absolutely right to promote the importance of transparency of overseas financial arrangements, and we agree, which is why Government new clause 2 addresses those concerns. New clause 2 also requires the reporting of funding from certain overseas educational partnerships, including Confucius institutes, which addresses new clause 1 and the first part of new clause 3.</p> <p pid="b101.0/3">New clause 3 would have unintended consequences and place an unnecessary burden on the sector. Under new clause 2, there would be a financial threshold and countries such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> allies would be exempt. New clause 3 has no exemptions, which would mean that every single kind of partnership would be covered from the Turing scheme and third-year language students studying abroad with partner universities to important international research exchange programmes. The burden on providers to deal with that information would be disproportionate and would stifle the ability of our world-class universities to work with global partners on important research programmes.</p> <p pid="b101.0/4">The Government take the concern regarding foreign interference extremely seriously, however, which is why we developed a cross-Government programme of work to counter those threats, and we are continuing to work with providers to help them to understand the threats and respond. Government new clause 2 will help us to do that, and the Office for Students could utilise a range of enforcement powers to issue fines, close programmes such as Confucius institutes, or mandate universities to offer alternatives to students if that was necessary to secure free speech. As I said, however, new clause 3 would have unintended consequences.</p> <p pid="b101.0/5">Amendments 19 and 20 would provide that a non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement with the governing body of a provider did not mean that members, staff or students and visiting speakers could not speak freely. I stress that I fully support the spirit of this <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>; it is almost unimaginable to think of anything worse than suffering sexual assault and then being pressurised into being silent. I have been very vocal about the fact that our universities should never use NDAs to silence victims of sexual harassment, which is why I launched a pledge in January to end the use of NDAs. Some 66 universities are now signed up, 62 of which are in England, and three Oxford colleges.</p> <p pid="b101.0/6">We have a long way to go, which is why I am constantly talking to universities and working with Can&#8217;t Buy My Silence to call out those who have as yet failed to sign the pledge, but I know that a number will sign imminently.  When it comes to the use of NDAs and sexual assault, the higher education sector has an opportunity to lead the way and show others what can be done.</p> <p pid="b101.0/7">We have also asked the Office for Students to impose a binding condition of registration on universities to ensure that they properly tackle sexual misconduct, which we intend to deal with that sort of behaviour. This would have teeth and it would mean that universities could be fined up to half a million pounds; they could even lose their degree-awarding powers. The ramifications would be big, and it would mean that the lawyers who developed those NDAs would be breaching the registration condition by doing so. We are the first Government who are prepared to tackle this issue, and I shall continue discussing with colleagues on both sides of the House all the ways in which we can tackle sexual harassment in universities, because that issue is very important to me and we will be doing more.</p> <p pid="b101.0/8"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment_17">Amendment 17</a>, which would widen the definition of academic freedom, is not necessary, because all the proposed new paragraphs are already covered by Government amendment 1, which will remove the requirement for academic freedom to be within an academic&#8217;s field of expertise. New clause 6 would add a new definition of academic staff, which I outlined in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=30" title="The Opening Speech is the first speech in a debate. The MP who has moved,..." class="glossary">opening speech</a>.</p> <p pid="b101.0/9">New clause 7 and amendment 21 would change the definition of harassment in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_Act_2010">Equality Act 2010</a> and under the Bill. I fully agree that there are occasions when universities have misapplied the Equality Act and have relied on it to wrongly shut down lawful free speech. There is both a subjective and an objective element as to whether harassment has taken place, and that should not be based on the views of just the complainant. Indeed, we saw a case last week where the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Essex">University of Essex</a> had to amend its policies following welcome pressure from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Speech_Union">Free Speech Union</a>. I assure hon. Members that once the Bill has passed, the new director of the Office for Students will ensure that providers are complying with the Equality Act as it is written, rather than overreaching.</p>            </div>

This is an incredibly contentious area, and it requires someone who is above any form of suspicion of party political linkages.
