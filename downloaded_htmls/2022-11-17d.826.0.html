The targets were innocent people and civilian infrastructure; the aim, to cast the population into darkness and cold. Once again, Russia has shown its barbarity and given the lie to any claim that it is interested in peace.</p> <p pid="d825.1/3">During the bombardment of Ukraine on Tuesday, an explosion took place in eastern Poland. The investigation into this incident is ongoing and it has our full support. As we have heard the Polish and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Presidents">American Presidents</a> say, it is possible that the explosion was caused by a Ukrainian munition which was deployed in self-defence. Whether or not this proves to be the case, no blame can be placed on a country trying to defend itself against such a barrage. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Hear, hear.&#8221;] The blame belongs solely to Russia.</p> <p pid="d825.1/4">I spoke to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Duda">President Duda</a> yesterday to express my sympathy and pledge our solidarity. I also spoke to President Zelensky on a joint call with <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> Trudeau to express our continued support, and I met my <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> counterparts at the sidelines of the G20. We will help our Polish allies to conclude their investigation and we will continue to stand with Ukraine in the face of Russia&#8217;s criminal aggression.</p> <p pid="d825.1/5">The Bali summit took place amidst the worst economic crisis since 2008. The G20 was created to grip challenges like this, but today&#8217;s crisis is different, because it is being driven by a G20 member. By turning off the gas taps and choking off the Ukrainian grain supply, Russia has severely disrupted global food and energy markets. The economic shockwaves will ripple around the world for years to come. So, together with the other responsible members of the G20, we are delivering a decisive response.</p> <p pid="d825.1/6">Almost all G20 members joined me in calling out Russia&#8217;s actions, declaring that</p> <p class="indent" pid="d825.1/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;today&#8217;s era must not be one of war.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d825.1/8">We will work together to uphold international law and the United Nations charter, and we will act to protect our collective economic security. The G20 agreed to use all available tools to support the global economy and ensure financial stability. That means international financial institutions mobilising more resources to support developing countries, it means continuing to call out those who exploit their lending power to create debt traps for emerging economies, and it means tackling the causes of rising inflation head on, including by delivering fiscal sustainability.</p> <p pid="d825.1/9">We pledged our support for the UN-brokered deal to keep grain shipments moving in the Black sea. I am pleased to say that that deal has now been renewed. Two thirds of Ukraine&#8217;s wheat goes to developing countries. With famine looming, it is desperately needed and Russia must uphold its part of the deal.</p> <p pid="d825.1/10">We agreed action to improve energy security by accelerating the transition to clean energy. We launched a new just energy transition partnership with Indonesia, which will unlock billions in private finance for new green energy infrastructure. Finally, we committed to maintain free markets and free trade and to reform the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organisation">World Trade Organisation</a>.</p> <p pid="d825.1/11">Yesterday, I held my first meeting with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Biden">President Biden</a>. We pledged to redouble our support for Ukraine and to continue deepening our co-operation, including on energy security and managing the challenges posed by China. I met <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_Modi">Prime Minister Modi</a>, when we reviewed progress on our forthcoming free trade agreement. I discussed our accession to the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Ministers">Prime Ministers</a> of Japan, Canada and Australia, and I met almost every other leader at the summit, with the exception of Russia.</p> <p pid="d825.1/12">In each of those discussions, there was a shared determination to restore stability, deliver long-term growth and drive a better future&#8212;one where no single country has the power to hold us back. In just a few moments, my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> will build on those international foundations when he sets out the autumn statement, putting our economy back on to a positive trajectory and restoring our fiscal sustainability.</p> <p pid="d825.1/13">By being strong abroad, we strengthen our resilience at home. We will continue to support Ukraine, we will continue to stand up for the rule of law and the fundamental principles of sovereignty and self-determination, and we will build a global economy that is more secure, more stable and more resilient, because that is what the gravity of the moment demands and that is how we will ensure that our country emerges from this crisis stronger than it was before. I commend this statement to the House.</p>            </div>

Civilian infrastructure was targeted across Ukraine and a war of aggression rumbled on as world leaders tried to reach agreement.</p> <p pid="d826.0/3">Whatever the outcome of the investigation into the missile incident in Poland, it is a stark reminder of the danger that Russia&#8217;s unjustifiable war has brought to the border of our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> allies. We must remain vigilant and united in our <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> to this pointless and brutal conflict. As I have said many times from this <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> and to the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> personally, whatever other differences we may have across the House&#8212;and there are many&#8212;when it comes to the defence of Ukraine, we stand as one.</p> <p pid="d826.0/4">On behalf of Members across the House, I send our condolences to those killed in Poland. Poland&#8217;s measured reaction to the incident and the calm heads that have prevailed over the past two days are welcome. I listened carefully to what the Prime Minister said about that and I agree with him that no country can be blamed for defending itself. We need to get to the bottom of this. Obviously, the investigation is ongoing, but when does the Prime Minister expect those investigations to be finalised?</p> <p pid="d826.0/5">Russia is losing this war, so I welcome the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20">G20</a>&#8217;s communiqu&#233;, which set out:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d826.0/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine&#8221;.</p> <p pid="d826.0/7">Has further support for Ukraine been discussed among western allies? What efforts are taking place to open a diplomatic road map to rid Ukraine of Russian troops and bring an end to the conflict?</p> <p pid="d826.0/8">It is crucial that we work to find international unity to further isolate Putin. That will include working with China. We do not underestimate the challenges that China poses to global security and we must defend the human rights of the Uyghur and democracy in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, but our approach must be measured, and it is in our interest to work with China on the climate crisis, trade and, most importantly, isolating Putin. I was glad to see constructive dialogue on those issues between <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Biden">President Biden</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Xi">President Xi</a>. Does the Prime Minister believe that the summit marks a change in west and China relations, and are his Government now taking a different approach from his predecessor to British-China relations?</p> <p pid="d826.0/9">After a decade of low growth in this country, it is crucial that we open new trade opportunities. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> said that he had met <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_Modi">Prime Minister Modi</a>, when a future UK-India trade deal was discussed. That deal has previously been put in doubt by his Home Secretary, who indicated that she would not support it. Labour does support a trade deal with India, which we believe can bring new opportunities to promote and create new jobs here in Britain. Will the Prime Minister tell us when he now expects the deal to be completed, and whether measures on visas will be included in the overall deal? If so, can he guarantee that his whole <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> will actually support it? Will he also tell us whether in his meeting with President Biden, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK-US">UK-US</a> trade deal was discussed&#8212;or can we assume that this deal now has no prospect of being delivered any time soon?</p> <p pid="d826.0/10">Lastly, may I ask the Prime Minister whether the Northern Ireland protocol was raised by either US or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU">EU</a> colleagues? Failure to make progress is hurting British research, development and trade, all at a time when we need to remove barriers for British business. Fixing this issue could lead to a better relationship with our biggest trading partners, an opportunity for our scientists and exporters, and an end to the past two years of unnecessary fights and <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">division</a>; so when is the Prime Minister going to deliver?</p> <p pid="d826.0/11">Our international alliances have never been so crucial, for global stability and our own stability. We on the Opposition side of the House know that standing up to Russia's aggression will require further sacrifices, but we must make those sacrifices because taking no action is not an option. The message from all of us must be clear: Ukraine will win and Putin will lose. Democracy and liberty will defeat imperialism again.</p>            </div>

He will know that we have provided &#163;1.5 billion in economic and humanitarian support for Ukraine, alongside, obviously, the military assistance. We are hosting a reconstruction conference in the UK next year, and there is an ongoing dialogue about what further support the Ukrainian Government need from us and others. In the short term, we are in the process of providing 25,000 pieces of winter equipment for the brave Ukrainian soldiers, but also funds to help restore some of the damage done to Ukraine&#8217;s energy infrastructure, which I know have been warmly welcomed by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Zelensky">President Zelensky</a>.</p> <p pid="d827.0/3">Let me briefly turn to some of the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#8217;s other questions. On China, I very much supported <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Biden">President Biden</a> in his meeting with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Xi">President Xi</a>. President Biden and I discussed that meeting at length. I believe that our approach is entirely aligned with that of the United States, and indeed our other allies such as Canada and Australia. Of course China poses significant challenges to our values, our interests and indeed our economic security. It is right that we take the necessary steps to defend ourselves against those challenges, but it is also right to engage in dialogue when that can make a difference in solving some of the pressing global challenges that we all collectively face.</p> <p pid="d827.0/4">The right hon. and learned Gentleman asked about Northern Ireland. I have discussed this issue with my European counterparts and, indeed, with the President at various meetings, not just at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20">G20</a>. I remain committed to finding a solution to the challenges posed by the protocol. It is clearly having an impact on families and businesses on the ground in Northern Ireland. The people of Northern Ireland deserve to have a functioning Executive, particularly at a time like this, and that is something that I will devote my energies to bringing about. So far I have had very constructive relationships and discussions about this issue with both the President and our European counterparts, including the Taoiseach last week.</p> <p pid="d827.0/5">On trade, the broad, overarching comment I would make to the right hon. and learned Gentleman is that when it comes to trade deals, whoever they may be with, what I will not do is sacrifice quality for speed. I think it is important that we take the time to get trade deals right. Of course this Government believe wholeheartedly in the power and the benefits of free trade, which is something that we will champion around the world.</p> <p pid="d827.0/6">I discussed the free trade agreement with India, and both the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> of India and I committed our teams to working as quickly as possible to see if we can bring a successful conclusion to the negotiations.</p> <p pid="d827.0/7">The priorities of the US are in a lot of different areas, but with regard to trade&#8212;the President and I discussed this&#8212;we are deepening our economic relationship. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_States">The United States</a> is already our single largest trading partner. We are doing more with individual states to broaden our trade relationships, and we have seen recent action on tariffs with regard to steel, aluminium and agricultural exports. All of that is good for the UK economy.</p> <p pid="d827.0/8">Of course, we are in the process of some exciting conversations about joining the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership. That is real evidence of our country&#8217;s commitment to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pacific">Indo-Pacific</a> region, and is supported by the Prime  Ministers of Canada, Australia and Japan. I hope that we can bring those negotiations to a conclusion in the near future.</p> <p pid="d827.0/9">Lastly, my reflections on the summit and on attending COP are that the United Kingdom is at its best when we are an engaged and active member of the global community &#8212;when we are standing up for our values, defending our interests, spreading prosperity, and alleviating poverty and suffering. I am pleased to have had conversations with so many leaders over the past couple of days that confirmed to me that they very much welcome the UK&#8217;s support in achieving all those objectives, and that is what this Government will set about doing.</p>            </div>

I am very pleased that, after concerted efforts on our part and from other allies with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Secretary-General">United Nations Secretary-General</a>, the grain deal, which just days ago was in some doubt, has indeed been extended. That demonstrates the pressure put on Russia by the international community. My right hon. Friend knows the importance of the free flow of food and fertilisers to the developing world through those ships. I would be delighted to meet him to see what more we can do, but I think for now we should be very pleased that the grain deal is being extended. It is already leading to a decline in wheat prices, which will bring some alleviation to the food inflation that we are seeing, particularly in the African continent.</p>            </div>

Our relationship and partnership with India is much broader than just a trading relationship. I was pleased to discuss increasing our security co-operation with India. That work began before my tenure, but I am keen to carry it on. We also announced the mobility scheme to enable young people from India to come here and young Brits to go there, which is a sign of what is possible. Such exchanges are positive both for our countries and for the young people who benefit.</p>            </div>
