China has undergone an extraordinary transformation in recent decades, grounded in one of the world&#8217;s ancient cultures. Not only is China the world&#8217;s second largest economy, but it has a huge base in tech and science. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> recognise China&#8217;s remarkable success in raising millions of its own people out of poverty. China is also the world&#8217;s biggest investor in renewable technology, and it will be an essential global partner when it comes to tackling global climate change. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese">The Chinese</a> people travel, study and work all over the world, making an extraordinary contribution.</p> <p pid="c1831.1/3">Let me be clear: we want to work with China. There is enormous scope for positive, constructive engagement. There are wide-ranging opportunities, from increasing trade to co-operation in tackling climate change, particularly with a view to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COP26">COP26</a> summit next year, which the UK will be hosting. However, as we strive for that positive relationship, we are also clear-sighted about the challenges that lie ahead. We will always protect our vital interests, including sensitive infrastructure, and we will not accept any investment that compromises our domestic or national security. We will be clear where we disagree, and I have been clear about our grave concerns regarding the gross human rights abuses being perpetrated against the Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang.</p> <p pid="c1831.1/4">It is precisely because we recognise China&#8217;s role in the world as a fellow member of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20">G20</a>, and fellow permanent member of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</a>, that we expect China to live up to the international obligations and responsibilities that come with that stature. That is the positive, constructive, mature and reciprocal relationship that we seek with China, striving for good co-operation, but being honest and clear where we have to disagree. We have been clear about the new national security law that China has imposed on the people of Hong Kong. That is a clear and serious violation of the UK-China joint declaration, and with it a violation of China&#8217;s freely assumed international obligations.</p> <p pid="c1831.1/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2020-07-01">1 July</phrase>, I announced that we are developing a bespoke immigration route for British nationals overseas and their dependants, giving them a path to citizenship of the UK. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> will set out further details of the plans for a new bespoke immigration route for BNOs and their dependants before the recess. That bespoke route will be ready by early 2021, and in the meantime the Home Secretary has already given <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Force">Border Force</a> officers the ability to grant leave to BNOs and their accompanying dependants at the UK border.</p> <p pid="c1831.1/6">Beyond our offer to BNOs, today we are taking two further measures, which are a necessary and proportionate response to the new national security legislation that we have now had the opportunity to assess carefully. First, given the role that China has now assumed for the internal security of Hong Kong, and the authority that  it is exerting over law enforcement, the UK will extend to Hong Kong the arms embargo that we have applied to mainland China since 1989. To be clear, the extension of the embargo will mean there will be no exports from the UK to Hong Kong of potentially lethal weapons, their components or ammunition, and it will also meet a ban on the export of any equipment not already banned that might be used for internal repression, such as shackles, intercept equipment, firearms and smoke grenades.</p> <p pid="c1831.1/7">The second measure relates to the fact that the imposition of this new national security legislation has significantly changed key assumptions underpinning our extradition treaty arrangements with Hong Kong. I have to say that I am particularly concerned by articles 55 to 59 of the law, which give mainland Chinese authorities the ability to assume jurisdiction over certain cases and to try those cases in mainland Chinese courts. The national security law does not provide legal or judicial safeguards in such cases, and I am also concerned about the potential reach of the extraterritorial provisions.</p> <p pid="c1831.1/8">I have consulted the Home Secretary, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Secretary">Justice Secretary</a> and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=138" title="The Attorney General, assisted by the Solicitor General, is the chief legal..." class="glossary">Attorney General</a>, and the Government have decided to suspend the extradition treaty immediately and indefinitely. I should also tell the House that we will not consider reactivating those arrangements unless and until there are clear and robust safeguards that can prevent extradition from the UK being misused under the new national security legislation.</p> <p pid="c1831.1/9">There remains considerable uncertainty about the way in which the new national security law will be enforced. I just say this: the United Kingdom is watching and the whole world is watching. In the past few weeks, I have been engaged with many of our international partners in a concerted dialogue about how we should best respond to the unfolding events we are seeing in Hong Kong. On <phrase class="date" code="2020-07-08">8 July</phrase>, I spoke with our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a> Foreign <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> partners. We agreed on the seriousness of China&#8217;s actions and the importance of pressing Beijing to meet its international obligations. I welcome the fact that Australia, Canada and the US have taken a range of measures with respect to Hong Kong including, variously, export controls and extradition, as we have done today.</p> <p pid="c1831.1/10">I also discussed the situation with our European partners, including <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josep_Borrell">Josep Borrell</a>, the EU&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Representative">High Representative</a> for Foreign Affairs. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> Government also welcome the EU announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2020-07-13">13 July</phrase>, which sets out further proposed measures in response to the national security legislation.</p> <p pid="c1831.1/11">A number of our international partners are also considering what offers they may be willing to make to the people of Hong Kong following the UK&#8217;s offer in relation to BNOs. I can reassure the House that we will continue to take a leading role in engaging and in co-ordinating our actions with our international partners, as befits our historic commitment to the people of Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="c1831.1/12">As I said at the outset, we want a positive relationship with China. There is a huge amount to be gained for both countries. There are many areas where we can work productively and constructively to mutual benefit together. For our part, the UK will work hard and in good faith towards that goal, but we will protect our vital interests. We will stand up for our values, and we will hold China to its international obligations. The specific measures  I have announced today are a reasonable and proportionate response to China&#8217;s failure to live up to those international obligations with respect to Hong Kong, and I commend this statement to the House.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c1833.0/1">I thank the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> for his statement and for advance sight of it. May I be clear that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> strongly welcome both of the measures he has announced today? He is right to ensure that Britain does not allow our exports to be used against the people of Hong Kong, and I thank him warmly for taking this step forwards.</p> <p pid="c1833.0/2">I am particularly glad that the Government have listened to my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=11656" title="Our page on Emily Thornberry - 'the Member for Islington South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry)'">Emily Thornberry</a>, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Trade">International Trade</a>, and suspended the export of surveillance equipment alongside the suspension of the export of crowd control equipment, which was demanded of the Government by the Labour Opposition last year. Will the Foreign Secretary go further and also review the training of the Hong Kong police by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_Policing">College of Policing</a> and other UK police forces to ensure that we are playing a part in helping to uphold, and not suppress, the rights of the people of Hong Kong?</p> <p pid="c1833.0/3">May I also welcome the indefinite suspension of the extradition treaty and the safeguards that the Foreign Secretary announced today? It affords protection to the Hong Kong diaspora community here in the UK, and particularly to the brave young pro-democracy activists, whom I recently had the pleasure to meet.</p> <p pid="c1833.0/4">We believe it is vital that the world shows a co-ordinated front on this issue. I was heartened to hear that the Foreign Secretary had discussions with our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a> partners. Canada, Australia and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">USA</a> have already taken this step. Will he speak to other key allies, including Germany, to ensure that there is a co-ordinated international response? He also made no mention of our Commonwealth partners. Has he reached out to those Commonwealth countries that have extradition treaties with Hong Kong, to ensure that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> passport holders and pro-democracy activists can travel freely without fear of arrest and extradition?</p> <p pid="c1833.0/5">The Foreign Secretary could take a number of other steps. He made a commitment today that the UK will not accept investment that compromises our national security. Will he confirm that that will extend to the proposed nuclear power project at Bradwell, and will he tell us what assessment the Government have made of the security implications of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sizewell_C">Sizewell C</a>?</p> <p pid="c1833.0/6">Elections are due to take place in Hong Kong in the autumn, and we are concerned that, just as in the case of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Wong">Joshua Wong</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> may seek to bar candidates from standing. A clear statement from the Foreign Secretary today that candidates selected through the primary process are legitimate and must be allowed to stand in those elections would send the message that, as he says, the world is watching. I also ask him to work internationally to ensure that independent election observers are allowed into Hong Kong to oversee those elections.</p> <p pid="c1833.0/7">The Foreign Secretary was a little irritated by my suggestion yesterday that the UK ought to impose Magnitsky sanctions on Chinese officials involved in  persecuting the Uyghur people and undermining basic freedoms in Hong Kong, but I gently say to him that we have known that Uyghurs have been detained in camps since at least 2017. Has any work at all been done on that by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a>? Given that the USA has already imposed similar sanctions, is he working with our US counterparts to build the case for UK sanctions, and will he discuss this with the US <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> tomorrow when he meets him?</p> <p pid="c1833.0/8">The Foreign Secretary may not have done the groundwork to enable him to impose Magnitsky sanctions now, but his Government have the power right now to take action. He could, as the US has done, bar Communist party of China officials from the UK. Why has he not done that? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese">The Chinese</a> ambassador said yesterday that he reserves the right to take action against British companies. What discussions has the Foreign Secretary had with British companies operating in China to offer advice and assistance? I have asked him a number of times whether he has had discussions with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSBC">HSBC</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chartered">Standard Chartered</a> about their stated support for the national security law. He must condemn that support. We should be showing the best of British business to the world, not the worst.</p> <p pid="c1833.0/9">I was pleased to hear that the Foreign Secretary had discussions with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand">Australia and New Zealand</a> about their making a similar offer to BNO passport holders, but we are concerned, after asking a range of parliamentary questions, that there are serious holes in this offer. We have been told by the Government that BNO passport holders and their families will not receive home status for tuition fees, will not have access to most benefits and will have to pay the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a> surcharge. That seems wrong.</p> <p pid="c1833.0/10">We are welcoming BNO passport holders to the UK for similar reasons to refugees, but these measures are completely out of step with that. Without serious action before these proposals are published, we will essentially be offering safe harbour only to the rich and highly skilled. That may benefit the UK, but it lacks the generosity and moral clarity that this situation demands. The Foreign Secretary will also know that many young pro-democracy activists are too young to be eligible for BNO passports. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> said last week that she was considering a specific scheme for 18 to 23-year-olds. Will those details be published before the summer, and can he provide more detail today?</p> <p pid="c1833.0/11">Finally, this must mark the start of a more strategic approach to China based on an ethical approach to foreign policy and an end to the naivety of the golden era years. If it does, the Foreign Secretary can be assured that he will have the Opposition&#8217;s full support. Like him, our quarrel is not with the people of China, but the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong, the actions of the Chinese Government in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China">South China</a> sea and the appalling treatment of the Uyghur people are reasons to act now. We will not be able to say in future years that we did not know. I urge him to work with colleagues across government to ensure that this marks the start of a strategic approach to China and the start of a new era.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c1834.0/1">I thank the hon. Lady for her response and in particular for her support for the two measures that we are taking today: suspending the extradition treaty arrangements and extending the arms embargo. I note that there is a drastically different tone being taken by <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Front Benchers from that taken even a  few weeks ago, but we welcome her support, and do so in a spirit of cross-party endeavour and the importance of sending a very clear signal to Beijing, and indeed to our international partners, about where we stand.</p> <p pid="c1834.0/2">The hon. Lady asks about the review of policing. Of course she is right about that: it is a question of balance. We will keep that under constant review. She mentions a range of details on BNOs, and they will be set forward by the Home Secretary shortly in the way that I have described. I urge the hon. Lady to wait for the detail before critiquing it. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> have been doing a huge amount of work since September last year on all that, and of course we also need to bear in mind the offers that other countries quite rightly and usefully will be making.</p> <p pid="c1834.0/3">I welcome what the hon. Lady says on international co-ordination. She is right about the importance of working with my German opposite number. I am seeing him this week, and it is something that is squarely on the agenda. We have also, through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a> membership, already touched base with a number our Commonwealth colleagues, but I will continue to do that. She is right that it needs to be more than just the Europeans and the UK with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Americans">North Americans</a>&#8212;the traditional Five Eyes and Europeans&#8212;because there is a whole range of non-aligned countries out there that are very much influenced by what China is doing and saying. We want them to support us in upholding the international rule of law, which in all areas, including, as she mentioned, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China">South China</a> sea, will be very important.</p> <p pid="c1834.0/4">We rigorously review not just all investments into this country from a security point of view but whether our powers are sufficient. That is something that we will keep under review, and I know that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Business is looking at it very carefully.</p> <p pid="c1834.0/5">The hon. Lady is right as well about the September LegCo elections. I have made it clear that we want to see them allowed to take place in the way that is recognised in not just the joint declaration but the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law">Basic Law</a>. I agree with her point about the disqualification of candidates. We also need to be realistic, if I am honest with her, about the likelihood of China, or the Hong Kong authorities, accepting international observers.</p> <p pid="c1834.0/6">The hon. Lady asks about the Magnitsky sanctions. She is simply wrong to say that we have not done our homework on them; we have done our homework since August of last year, which is why we could introduce those sanctions for the situation with Jamal Khashoggi, Sergei Magnitsky and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea">North Korea</a>. Of course, the national security legislation, which we are responding to, has only just been enacted, let alone started to be enforced. We will patiently gather the evidence, which takes months. It is not, as the hon. Lady has previously suggested, just something that can be done on a political whim; indeed, it would be improper if that were the case. Of course, if we introduce those targeted sanctions in this field, and indeed any other, without having done our factual evidential due diligence, not only are they likely to be challenged but we are at risk of giving a propaganda coup to the very people that we are seeking to target.</p> <p pid="c1834.0/7">The hon. Lady mentions <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSBC">HSBC</a>. She may or may not have already heard the comments I have made about that. Certainly, we will not allow the rights and the autonomy of the people of Hong Kong to be sacrificed on the altar of bankers&#8217; bonuses. We urge all businesses to look  very carefully at how they respond. They are, of course, going to be nervous about any potential retaliatory measures that may be taken by Beijing. In any event, we are very clear on the path that we are taking.</p> <p pid="c1834.0/8">As I have said before, we want a good relationship with China. It is very important that we have a balanced, open debate about this in the House, recognise the opportunities of a good relationship with China, but be clear-eyed, as this Government are, about the risks and what we do to protect against them.</p>            </div>

The reality is that we have taken, I think, a proportionate approach and one that recognises the severity of what is happening in Hong Kong, but also, in the way I have described, seeks to have a balanced&#8212;and to telegraph a balanced&#8212;message to the Government in Beijing that our relationship is there, with good will and with respect for international obligations, to be a positive one.</p> <p pid="c1836.1/2">My hon.

Indeed, we led, for the first time in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council">United Nations Human Rights Council</a>, on a statement on the situation on human rights in both Hong Kong and Xinjiang. Twenty-seven countries in total signed the statement, and it was the first time that has been done.</p> <p pid="c1836.1/3">My hon. Friend asks about judges on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court">Supreme Court</a> in Hong Kong. That is something we obviously keep under careful review, given the need&#8212;and, indeed, the commitment in the joint declaration and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law">Basic Law</a>&#8212;for the autonomy of the judiciary as well as the autonomy of the legislators to be respected, so we will discuss that with our international partners.</p> <p pid="c1836.1/4">Finally, my hon. Friend asks about extraterritoriality. It is not entirely clear, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, quite how that will work in practice&#8212;whether it would just apply to Hong Kong residents when they are outside the country or whether, indeed, it is intended to apply to non-Chinese and non-Hong Kong nationals. That is one of the factors, among others, that informed our approach to the suspension of extradition.</p>            </div>

He picks up on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a>&#8217;s change of tone, and there has been something of a change in the Government&#8217;s position as well of late. I think we should all recognise that this is evolving fast.</p> <p pid="c1837.0/2">I associate the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNP">SNP</a> with supporting both the measures in the statement, which I think is proportionate and fair. We also want a positive relationship with China&#8212;it is a key partner in renewable energy, as the Foreign Secretary rightly says&#8212;but it is making things increasingly difficult with its actions particularly in sub-<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saharan_Africa">Saharan Africa</a> and with one belt, one road; over Hong Kong, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China">South China</a> sea, the situation in Taiwan, of course, and Xinjiang; and with commercial piracy and industrial espionage. There is lots of cause for concern about the actions of the Chinese state, so we do support these measures.</p> <p pid="c1837.0/3">I will, however, press the Foreign Secretary on three further points. First, on the Magnitsky sanctions, I accept fully that this has to be done properly, but it could be done properly faster. I think there is a need to accelerate, particularly in the case of the Uyghur situation, proportionate sanctions there.</p> <p pid="c1837.0/4">On the suspension of the extradition treaty, this is not something to be celebrated. The breakdown of criminal and judicial co-operation will make the fight against organised crime, which is prevalent in Hong Kong and London, harder, so what comes next? Will this be done on a case-by-case basis, or are we looking to evolve some new arrangement to deal with that pressing problem, because it is and will remain a pressing problem?</p> <p pid="c1837.0/5">On students, which is where this debate will get to quite quickly, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_University">Stirling University</a> in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> and universities up and down the UK, including in Scotland, welcome thousands of Chinese students. We value academic freedom and we are glad to see them here, but that is precisely the academic freedom that the state of China is looking to take advantage of. Could guidance be provided to universities about the implications of having so many Chinese students in their institutions from both a security and a financial perspective, and is any analysis under way of the Confucius institutes, which I believe do need a bit more attention than they have had today?</p>            </div>

It is very important that these targeted sanctions are done right, not quick. If we do them too quickly, they will be legally challenged. Not only would they then be ineffective, but we would risk, as I said to the hon. Lady, giving a propaganda coup to the very individuals whom we are seeking to hold to account.</p> <p pid="c1837.1/3">On extradition, the approach we have taken, and I set it out quite deliberately, was that we are suspending&#8212;not just wholesale terminating, but suspending&#8212;the extradition treaty arrangements, so that it is clear that they could be resuscitated in the future. As I also made clear, we would need to have clear, adequate and robust safeguards to protect against the potential abuses that we see in the national security legislation before that could even be contemplated. That is the approach that we would consider.</p> <p pid="c1837.1/4">The hon. Gentleman also referred to my comment about there being a different tone on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Benches. I hope he does not mind my noting that it was not that long ago that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government">Scottish Government</a>&#8217;s China engagement strategy called for Scotland to be seen as the &#8220;preferred&#8221; trade and investment partner in China. I sense that there is a slight nuance in position in 2020.</p>            </div>

Friend for his support for these measures and for withdrawing his amendments; I appreciate his magnanimity in that regard. On the Magnitsky sanctions, he raises two different issues: their potential application in relation to, first, Hong Kong and, secondly, Xinjiang. We, of course, have a process for gathering all the evidence on those potential cases. The national security legislation is newly enacted, so that will take some time, but he is right to point to that. I have been reading over the weekend reports by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International">Amnesty International</a> in 2019 and 2020 on the range of abuses in Xinjiang, reports by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> between 2018 and 2020 on the mass detention and political indoctrination, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Committee_on_the_Elimination_of_Racial_Discrimination">United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination</a> report in 2018 on the massive internment camps with no rights. We are looking at this carefully. As he rightly notes, it is important to assess this carefully, and it is a question of  not only whether the abuses took place but whether individual responsibility can be ascribed to someone on whom we wish to impose a visa ban or asset freeze.</p>            </div>

He mentioned Uyghurs just once in his statement, but he knows that the whole House is concerned about the human rights abuses taking place in Xinjiang. If there is enough evidence for the Americans to apply sanctions on officials in Xinjiang, can the Foreign Secretary have sight of that evidence to see whether we can do the same here? He of course repeatedly states that &#8220;genocide&#8221; is a legal term and we need international courts to apply it, but when it comes to the UN and China, the UN is a busted flush. Will the Foreign Secretary consider convening an independent inquiry so that we can collect evidence to see whether genocide is taking place in Xinjiang?</p>            </div>

Of course, one of the points about the Magnitsky regime that we have introduced is that we have already put in place a co-ordination mechanism so that we can more regularly and generically co-ordinate with our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a> partners and share information. There was quite a significant overlap&#8212;although not exclusively; it is the UK regime&#8212;in the designations that we have already made. We are putting in place that co-ordination. It is a reasonable point to make.</p> <p pid="c1840.0/2">On genocide, I can only repeat the points that I have made before, but I have been clear that this is a gross violation of human rights and China does need to be answerable to and accountable for it. My hon. Friend talked about setting up an inquiry to examine the evidence and to glean it; we have to be realistic about what China would allow into Xinjiang. In the absence of that access, it is very difficult to see how we could do that. It is of course available to all the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committees">Select Committees</a> in this House&#8212;as well as to the Government in their efforts to assess the evidence&#8212;to look at that independently of Government and, indeed, the United Nations.</p>            </div>

We need a much more significant reset in our relationship in respect of not only Hong Kong but foreign lobbying, foreign investment, espionage&#8212;industrial or otherwise&#8212;human rights and our alliances and defence posture. Will the Secretary State confirm whether we are approaching all these issues piecemeal or whether there is a wider reset? If there is a wider reset, will he explain how the Government are interacting with parliamentarians and outside experts, and how that more comprehensive reset is going to be presented to Parliament so that we can all get to debate it and contribute to it?</p>            </div>

We could talk about universities, freedom of expression&#8212;there are many&#8212;but, for balance, it is important to say that there are also areas of co-operation. China is one of the biggest investors&#8212;the biggest investor, I think&#8212;in renewable technology. If we are to shift the dial significantly on climate change, China will to have to be a constructive and, indeed, positive partner, with which to engage.</p> <p pid="c1841.0/2">More strategically, my hon.

When the Magnitsky sanctions were originally debated, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Government">Russian Government</a> said that the measure was solely aimed at Russia and when it was originally debated, discussed and enacted in the US, there were different <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a> in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. We were very clear in the model that we adopted that this would be a universal mechanism, that it would allow us to target the individuals, whether they were state or non-state actors, and that it did not involve us, as a wider economic embargo or sanctions would do, in punishing the individual people of the country. This is a very bespoke, forensic tool, but it gives effect to exactly what he describes.</p>            </div>

The hon. Gentleman makes an important point about not allowing a vacuum to appear in multilateral institutions. We are discussing that with our US partners, our European partners and across the board. He gave a few examples; the most obvious recent example of concern is <a href="/glossary/?gl=261" title="patents (for inventions), trade marks, protected designs, and copyrights;..." class="glossary">intellectual property</a> theft, where there was a Chinese candidate to lead the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Intellectual_Property_Organisation">World Intellectual Property Organisation</a>, and there  was a groundswell of diplomatic activity to support the Singaporean candidate for precisely that reason.

It was clear in the original decision on Huawei that we wanted to reduce reliance on high-risk vendors; it is equally clear&#8212;we have to be honest about it&#8212;that we had to take the measures that we took based on technical necessity, following US sanctions and their impact on the supply chain. We have been clear and honest about that, but there is a much broader challenge for us and our international partners, which is diversifying supply chains and telecoms providers so that we can build up greater diversity of high-trust vendors in the field, and that is what we have focused on.</p>            </div>

Whether it is the pictures of Uyghur Muslim children who have been separated from their parents, the horrifying footage of Uyghurs in chains being herded off the trains and into the camps, or the news that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> are selling the hair of Uyghurs on the internet, I am sure that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> will feel deeply that many of these things are reminiscent of the darkest moments of 20th century history. Does he agree that as we work across <a href="/glossary/?gl=101" title="Whitehall is a wide road that runs through the heart of Westminster,..." class="glossary">Whitehall</a> to think about all our different points of leverage on the Government in Beijing, we must recognise, first, that they are on a path of increasing aggression externally and increasing repression internally? Does he agree that we must also recognise that some things we do to have the most leverage over them may also be in our economic interest, be that restricting takeovers of companies in this country or restricting their ability to extract technology from our universities? Does he agree that the only way to stand up to a regime that is becoming more and more bullying is to confront it now?</p>            </div>

Friend makes a range of good points, and we will, of course, continue to look at all of them in the round. I share his concern about what we are hearing in some of those reports and the harrowing echoes of what we have seen in the past. He is right to say that we need to use every potential lever we have to try to positively moderate or change the behaviour of China. We also need to be realistic about the size and scale of China, and, whatever the debate in this House, about the likely appetite and disposition of not just Europeans and north Americans, but the non-aligned countries in the UN. We will be at our strongest when we unite people together.</p>            </div>

Lady; I think the whole House&#8212;every individual&#8212;will share the disgust and the horror at the idea that, anywhere, there is any number of cases of forced sterilisation. The testimony that we saw on &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Andrew_Marr_Show">The Andrew Marr Show</a>&#8221; yesterday was truly harrowing&#8212;I had certainly not seen anything of that nature before.</p> <p pid="c1846.2/2">The hon. Lady asks, quite rightly, about how we are trying to assess the evidence base. We need to bear in mind two factors: first, the evidential points that I have already mentioned and, secondly, the balance of international opinion. We can work with our traditional partners, which is really important, but we also need to build up a groundswell of wider support among like-minded partners and countries&#8212;particularly those that share our values, but maybe in the region or more broadly&#8212;that feel vulnerable to pressure from China. That is a challenge. The way the debate is viewed in some of those countries and by some of those Governments is different from the way it is seen here, so we need to be smart about the way we approach this so we gain consensus and build up a groundswell of support for the measures we have taken. I believe that in the approach we have taken on Hong Kong, grounded in the joint declaration and the very specific obligations that have been violated, we are in the best position to do that.</p>            </div>

My right hon. Friend speaks about China&#8217;s economic rise, but I believe that that has coincided with a demise in a collective sense of duty and responsibility of the west. For decades, we have turned a blind eye to China&#8217;s democratic deficit and its human rights violations in the hope that it would mature into a globally responsible citizen, but that clearly has not happened. So, given its actions in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China">South China</a> sea and given its veto, which it constantly uses at the United Nations, as well as the fact that it ignores <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a> advice and is ensnaring so many poorer countries into debt, is this now the turning point where we drop the pretence that China shares our values? I very much welcome the statement today, but it is tactical. Can we have a strategic overhaul of our foreign policy in relation to China?</p>            </div>
