As all Members will know, Hong Kong&#8217;s historic success was built on its autonomy, its freedoms and the remarkable resourcefulness and determination of its people. We have long admired their prosperity and their values, respected through China&#8217;s own expression of the one country, two systems approach&#8212;an approach that China itself has long articulated and affirmed as the basis for its relations with Hong Kong. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a>, through successive Governments, has consistently respected and supported that model, as reflected both in China&#8217;s Basic Law and also the joint declaration, which, as Members will know, is the treaty agreed by the United Kingdom and China, registered with the United Nations, as part of the arrangements for the handover of Hong Kong that were made back in 1984.</p> <p pid="d681.3/2">Set against this Chinese framework and the historical context, on <phrase class="date" code="2020-05-22">22 May</phrase>, during a meeting of the National People&#8217;s Congress, China considered a proposal for a national security law for Hong Kong, and then on <phrase class="date" code="2020-05-28">28 May</phrase> the National People&#8217;s Congress adopted that decision. China&#8217;s Foreign <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Councillor">State Councillor</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi">Wang Yi</a>, made it clear that the legislation will seek to ban treason, secession, sedition and subversion, and we expect it to be published in full shortly.</p> <p pid="d681.3/3">This proposed national security law undermines the one country, two systems framework that I have described, under which Hong Kong is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy with Executive, legislative and independent judicial powers. To be very clear and specific about this, the imposition of national security legislation on Hong Kong by the Government in Beijing, rather than through Hong Kong&#8217;s own institutions, lies in direct conflict with article 23 of China&#8217;s own Basic Law and with China&#8217;s international obligations freely assumed under the joint declaration. The Basic Law is clear that there  are only a limited number of areas in which Beijing can impose <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> directly, such as for the purposes of defence and foreign affairs, or in exceptional circumstances in which the National People&#8217;s Congress declares a state of war or a state of emergency.</p> <p pid="d681.3/4">The proposed national security law, as it has been described, in terms of the substance and detail, raises the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes, which would undermine the existing commitments to protect the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong, as set out in the joint declaration, but also reflecting the international covenant on civil and political rights. Finally, the proposals also include provision for the authorities in Hong Kong to report back to Beijing on progress in pursuing national security education of its people&#8212;a truly sobering prospect.</p> <p pid="d681.3/5">We have not yet seen the detailed published text of the legislation, but I can tell the House that if legislation in those terms is imposed by China on Hong Kong, it would violate China&#8217;s own Basic Law. It would upend China&#8217;s one country, two systems paradigm, and it would be a clear violation of China&#8217;s international obligations, including those made specifically to the United Kingdom under the joint declaration.</p> <p pid="d681.3/6">Let me be clear about the approach that the United Kingdom intends to take. We do not oppose Hong Kong passing its own national security law. We do strongly oppose such an authoritarian law being opposed by China, in breach of international law. We are not seeking to intervene in China&#8217;s internal affairs, only to hold China to its international commitments, just as China expects of the United Kingdom. We do not seek to prevent China&#8217;s rise&#8212;far from it. We welcome China as a leading member of the international community, and we look to engage with China on everything from trade to climate change. It is precisely because we recognise China&#8217;s role in the world that we expect it to live up to the international obligations and the international responsibilities that come with it.</p> <p pid="d681.3/7">On Thursday, working closely with our partners in Australia, Canada and the United States, the UK released a joint statement expressing our deep concerns over this proposed new security legislation. Our partners in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand">New Zealand</a> and Japan have issued similar statements. The EU has too, and I have had discussions with a number of our EU partners. The UK stands firm with our international partners in our expectation that China lives up to its international obligations under the Sino-British joint declaration.</p> <p pid="d681.3/8">There is time for China to reconsider. There is a moment for China to step back from the brink and respect Hong Kong&#8217;s autonomy and respect China&#8217;s own international obligations. We urge the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China">Government of China</a> to work with the people of Hong Kong and with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Government">Hong Kong Government</a> to end the recent violence and to resolve the underlying tensions based on political dialogue. If China continues down this current path, if it enacts this national security law, we will consider what further response we make working with those international partners and others.</p> <p pid="d681.3/9">I hope the whole House agrees that we, as the United Kingdom, have historical responsibilities&#8212;a duty I would say&#8212;to the people of Hong Kong. I can tell the House now that if China enacts the law, we will change the arrangements for British National (Overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong. The House will recall that the  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> status was conferred on British dependent territories&#8217; citizens connected with Hong Kong as part of the package of arrangements that accompanied the joint declaration in 1984 in preparation for the handover of the territory. Under that status currently, BNO passport holders are already entitled to UK consular assistance in third countries. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_British_Government">The British Government</a> also provide people with BNO passports visa-free entry into the UK for up to six months as visitors.</p> <p pid="d681.3/10">If China follows through with its proposed legislation, we will put in place new arrangements to allow BNOs to come to the UK without the current six-month limit, enabling them to live and apply to study and work for extendable periods of 12 months, thereby also providing a pathway to citizenship.</p> <p pid="d681.3/11">Let me just finish by saying that, even at this stage, I sincerely hope that China will reconsider its approach, but if it does not the UK will not just look the other way when it comes to the people of Hong Kong; we will stand by them and live up to our responsibilities. I commend this statement to the House.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d683.1/1">I thank the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> for coming to the House to make this statement and for advance sight of it. In particular, I thank him for the sentiment of solidarity that he expressed at the end of his statement.</p> <p pid="d683.1/2">We are deeply concerned about events in Hong Kong. We share the Government&#8217;s <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> to the national security law. We want to see real action to address police brutality and the steady erosion of the joint declaration. We want the people of Hong Kong to know that the world is watching. We also want them to know that the world is prepared to act. Can I press the Foreign Secretary for more clarity on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> passport holders? We welcome the announcement that visa rights will be extended. He says that they will be able to come to the UK if China continues down this path and implements this legislation. Will he tell us at which stage he envisages our taking action? When will these measures be brought before the House? I also ask him for more details about how this will apply. Will it apply to the 350,000 people who hold valid passports, or to the 2.9 million who are eligible? For this to be meaningful, surely it has to apply to people&#8217;s families. Will he confirm whether this is the Government&#8217;s intention, and what assessment he has done of the numbers?</p> <p pid="d683.1/3">The first rule of any sanction against China must surely be that it does not harm the people of Hong Kong. Will he tell us what assessment he has made of the potential loss of millions of highly skilled people from Hong Kong; and what assessment he has done of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">USA</a>&#8217;s recent announcement, which I understand he supports, that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous? Will he therefore support the withdrawal of trade preferences and economic sanctions? There are implications for China and, of course, implications for the UK, but there are also serious implications for the people of  Hong Kong, many of whom he does not appear to be offering safe haven to. What impact does he believe that that will have on them?</p> <p pid="d683.1/4">We have been asking for concrete steps, and I welcome the fact that the Government are now signalling that they are prepared to take these, but the joint declaration has been repeatedly undermined since 2012. As the former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Hong_Kong">Governor of Hong Kong</a> put it, that has been met with only &#8220;tut-tutting&#8221; and &#8220;embarrassed clearing of the throat&#8221; from UK Ministers. Why has the Foreign Secretary not pressed for an independent inquiry into police brutality? Given the serious implications for human rights, does he welcome, as we do, the suggestion by former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretaries">Foreign Secretaries</a> that an international contact group should be established? He knows that the only long-term solution to this is universal suffrage. We must see pressure from Britain on the Hong Kong authorities to begin the process of democratic reform.</p> <p pid="d683.1/5">I was astonished that, in his statement, the Foreign Secretary did not address how the UK intends to respond to the threat of countermeasures by China. It is increasingly clear that we need an alliance of democracies to ensure that we can maintain, as he says, a constructive dialogue with China on shared challenges, not least on climate change, while standing up to aggressive behaviour and clear breaches of international law. He referenced the statements by the UK, Australia, Canada and the US, which was welcome, and the additional statements from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand">New Zealand</a>, Japan and the European Union. It is time for an international democratic alliance to come together and speak with one voice. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a> is now off. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20">G20</a> is not meeting. The discussion at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a> has been blocked by China. It is time for Britain to be far more proactive. In recent weeks, Australia has shown real leadership on the search for a vaccine for covid-19 and France has led the charge for a global ceasefire. On this of all issues, why is Britain not stepping up and showing the leadership the world needs?</p> <p pid="d683.1/6">Finally, I am concerned that this exposes some serious, deep contradictions in the Government&#8217;s approach to China. For a decade, we have been told that we are in a &#8220;golden era&#8221; of Sino-British relations, whereas the right hon. Gentleman has said that we cannot go back to &#8220;business as usual&#8221; with China. What does any of this mean in practice? The Government have finally accepted that there are concerns about the threat the Huawei contract poses to national security and are reportedly working with other countries to explore an alternative, but will he rule out Chinese involvement in any new nuclear projects beyond Hinkley? With a long and deep recession likely, the need for a coherent approach is only becoming more urgent. We do not have a strategy abroad. We do not have a strategy at home. This needs a calm and sensible approach, to maintain a constructive dialogue and build far greater strategic independence; the two are not contradictory but go hand in hand. Now is the moment that Britain must step up, show global leadership and begin to take this seriously.</p>            </div>

Lady for her solidarity and support, as expressed at the commencement of her remarks. She asked about the trigger point for changes. It is only right, in order to do this in a very careful and accurate way, to wait for the legislation to be published,   so that we can see the full text, because, of course, it is only at that point, or indeed at its application, that we would be able credibly and reliably to say it was in violation of the joint declaration in the way I have described. I think that is a common-sense approach, which allows China, or other countries around the world that are watching and that we want to stand up in support of international law, to see that we are proceeding on the basis of principle and on the facts.</p> <p pid="d684.0/2">The hon. Lady asked about the detailed arrangements. I have been working with Ministers, in particular, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a>, on this since last September. As I said, we will wait to see precisely what the legislation says before making any further announcements, but the Home Secretary will set out the details at the appropriate time.</p>            </div>

Lady rightly pointed out that the threat to Hong Kong is not just to its autonomy and freedoms, but to its economy and to investment in Hong Kong, which the UK and many others have serious interests in. The actions of China are, inexplicably, putting at risk what has long been regarded as one of the jewels in the economic crown for China. So she makes important points on that.</p> <p pid="d685.1/2">The hon. Lady asked why we had not called for an independent investigation into the police, but in fact I called for it in August 2019 and made that clear, having spoken to chief executive <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Lam">Carrie Lam</a>. The hon. Lady also asked about universal suffrage, which of course is envisaged in the basic law for Hong Kong; I set that out as our position in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> last September. On both points I welcome her support and that of the Labour party. She then asked about international action, where the United Kingdom has been in the vanguard. We have been co-ordinating with our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a> partners&#8212;I had a virtual meeting with them yesterday evening, where we reaffirmed our solidarity on this point. I have had calls and been engaged with the European Union, which has put out a statement&#8212;it is not as strong as the one we put out, but it shows that the EU is engaged actively on this. I have been speaking to my German, French and other European partners about it, and I also spoke to my Japanese opposite number today. The issue was discussed in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a>, but of course China, and indeed Russia, will veto any more substantive debate.</p> <p pid="d685.1/3">The hon. Lady asked about the specific measures we are proposing. I have been very clear on BNOs. Equally, we will work closely with our international partners on what the right next steps are. I think the focus right now, in order to proceed in a productive way that is likely to give ourselves the best chance of the outcome we want, is on setting out our position clearly and working with our international partners, and the ball is in the court of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_in_China">Government in China</a>. They have a choice to make here: they can cross the Rubicon and violate the autonomy and the rights of the people of Hong Kong, or they can step back, understand the widespread concern of the international community and live up to their responsibilities as a leading member of the international community.</p>            </div>

He is absolutely right to focus on what is the most effective way to build a groundswell of support for the principled stance that we are taking and for <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> to the actions of China where they flout international law. He will also know from his position and his widespread experience, to which I pay tribute, that beyond <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a>, the European Union and others, there is a whole range of different opinions on how to engage and deal with China and a range of approaches that China takes&#8212;from inducements to intimidation&#8212;to cajole, sway and, frankly, coerce countries to bend to its will.</p> <p pid="d686.1/2">The approach that we are taking is trying to maximise the number of countries around the world&#8212;not the usual suspects that China will dismiss as trying to weaken it or to keep it down&#8212;to make the most powerful statement and, ultimately, to moderate the actions of China. Unless we can build up that bigger caucus of opinion&#8212;my hon.

In fact, anyone who has the heel of state oppression on them right now&#8212;let us be honest, that is increasing by the day&#8212;deserves our support.</p> <p pid="d686.3/2">I can accept that this is tricky: it is not a black-and-white situation, given the nature of the actors involved. I think that what the Government are doing on BNOs is right, but is there not a danger that allowing so many people to leave is actually exactly what Beijing wants? While I think it is the right thing to do to allow people  to come here and, as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> mentioned in his statement, to provide them with a path to citizenship, when West Berliners were threatened with oppression, we did not just offer them all visas to leave; we actually stood up for them and offered to defend them. Beyond the statement on BNOs, which is I think right, what else are the Government planning to do in future to support those who are not BNOs and who will be left behind in Hong Kong to deal with the effects of this new law?</p> <p pid="d686.3/3">I would also like to ask the Foreign Secretary&#8212;the Chair of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> took the question out of my mouth&#8212;to expand on how he is teasing together a greater international coalition, because that will be tricky if he is going to bring in the middle east, Africa and others, given China&#8217;s enormous global economic footprint through such things as the belt and road initiative and the China strategy. Can I ask him when he expects to see the text of the law? Is there anything in the joint agreement that allows the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> to see that sooner rather than later? At what point does he envisage having to take further steps? No one is calling for sanctions just yet, but surely work must be going on to put together something that constitutes a price for Beijing&#8217;s heavy hand. Can he confirm whether the law that the authorities in Beijing want to impose has directly led to a reversal on the Huawei decision?</p>            </div>

We fully welcome his support, as indeed we welcome the support from all sides in the Chamber. This is a powerful opportunity for us to show a united position on this. It is something that successive Governments have agreed on. He asked whether, if we offered to change BNOs&#8217; status, that would be a gift to Beijing. I do not think that that is true. I do not think, from the response of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>, that that is correct. They are very sensitive about this, and in any event it is a point of principle. We have fought to live up to our international responsibilities and commitments, and, as I explained in my statement, we regard this as part of the package that went with the joint declaration. If that is upended because of action on the national security legislation, it is only right that we should rethink the position of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> passport holders. That also explains, in relation to the question from <a href="/mp/?p=24831" title="Our page on Lisa Nandy - 'the hon. Member for Wigan (Lisa Nandy)'">Lisa Nandy</a>, why we have been quite careful about timing. We have been prepared for this, and we have hoped it would not come, but as has often been said in this House, we hope for the best and prepare for the worst. The hon. Gentleman asked about how we build up international support. In my view, we do so based on principle and the rules of international law. The obvious riposte will be that we are intervening in internal affairs, but we are not. We are seeking to uphold China&#8217;s own freely assumed international obligations. And no, I am not expecting advance sight of the legislation from Beijing.</p>            </div>

I do think Hong Kong is part of a pattern, although it is not a uniform one. He referred to the violation of the UN convention on the law of the sea&#8212;I think that is what he was referring to in relation to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China">South China</a> sea&#8212;and we could add cyber-attacks and the treatment of the Uighur Muslims. At every step, the right approach for the United Kingdom, as a matter of principle and also of effectiveness, is to call out behaviour that is contrary to international law on its own terms. In answer to the Chairman of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> and others, that is how we will build a coalition of like-minded countries to stand firm in the face of such behaviour.</p> <p pid="d688.0/2">My right hon. Friend asked about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> passport holders. We have made a commitment, which he has heard today. It is important that we did that as a matter of principle, rather than waiting for others to agree in concept. However, we are already discussing with our partners&#8212;I raised it on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a> call yesterday&#8212;the possibility of burden sharing if we see a mass exodus from Hong Kong. I do not think that that is likely in the last analysis, but he is right to raise it, and we are on the case diplomatically.</p>            </div>

I spoke to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marise_Payne">Marise Payne</a> yesterday evening about this subject, and we will be working even more intensely in the future.</p> <p pid="d689.1/2">Of course, even to get to this point&#8212;the work that we have done and the commitment that we have made&#8212;we have been talking to the Australians and our other international partners for months, and that will continue constructively. I know that the Australians feel very much that this situation is in their neighbourhood and backyard, and are taking a very principled point of view, but they are right up against it; they see all the impacts of what China is doing, even closer than we do, and we will be working hand in glove with them.</p>            </div>

Friend is quite right to reflect, as others have done already, on the fact that if China is willing to interfere on political and autonomy grounds, it is also likely to pose a longer-term threat to the economic prosperity and economic model that Hong Kong reflects and embodies. We in the UK are mindful of that, not only from an investment point of view but, frankly, from the point of view of individuals who are trying to run livelihoods or invest in Hong Kong. The sad reality is that if China continues down this track, it will strangle what has long been the jewel in the economic crown. It is clear to me that China is putting politics, as it views it, ahead of economics. I am afraid that is a natural consequence of the creeping violation of Hong Kong&#8217;s autonomy that we see.</p>            </div>

We want to make sure that we live up to our responsibilities, but it is also important, as we try to change the long-term trend to which he rightly refers, that we are clear about the basis on which we would do it. The basis is the ripping up of the essence of the joint declaration. We need to wait and see what the national security legislation looks like, to see affirmed the terms that have already been described by the Government in Beijing. We are right to say that that particular trigger point would change our minds, because then we would be able to stand on the firm point of principle and international law as the basis on which we were extending those rights. The stronger the position we are able to be in in that regard, the more likely we are to carry wide international support for the actions that we take.</p>            </div>

We will, with our international partners, press rigorously and robustly to try to require China to live up to its obligations and, frankly, the responsibilities that come with wanting to be treated as a leading member of the international community.</p>            </div>

The ideal thing would be for China to step back. If China does not step back, we will consider all the possible actions and measures that we might wish to take. Fundamentally, rather than just wait for international co-operation on the specific issue of what will happen to those who are not willing to stay in Hong Kong, we feel that we have a duty&#8212;as a matter of international law, moral responsibility and historical responsibility&#8212;to come out and lead. That is why we have said that we will allow the 300,000-plus passport holders, along with their dependants, to come to the UK in the way I described.</p>            </div>

Friend because I know he stands for the cause of liberty wherever it may be&#8212;I have always been shoulder to shoulder with him and I am glad to be again. In relation to the people of Hong Kong, we have set out a very principled and generous approach. If we look at the numbers potentially involved, we are talking about over 300,000 holders of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> passports and, in terms of those eligible, close to 3 million. So I think the UK, in the terms that I have described, is doing its bit, but we also need to work with our wider international partners who have significant Hong Kong communities, and a significant stake and interests in Hong Kong, to make sure that that is a broader international response. He is right to exude some scepticism about whether China will row back, but we have to give it every opportunity, even if it is only a marginal one.</p>            </div>

Where does he think the United Nations is with this issue? The democratic freedoms of the people of Hong Kong are enshrined in international law and an international treaty lodged at the UN, but given what he said a few moments ago about the way China uses its negative influence to try to silence other countries, does he regard the UN as a lost cause when it comes to defending the people of Hong Kong?

Friend has been doing with other parliamentarians on this subject. He is right to press for what we are doing at the UN. There are, of course, some inherent limitations on what we can do in relation to a permanent member, with the veto that comes with it in the Security Council. We have raised this in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a>, although there are all sorts of challenges, as the hon. Member for Wigan described, and we have raised China&#8217;s behaviour in the past in relation to human rights in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Council">Human Rights Council</a>. Fundamentally, I think it is important&#8212;this is why we have framed our response in the way that we have to garner as much support in the United Nations and equivalent bodies as possible&#8212;to base this on principle, international law and the UN&#8217;s own international covenant on civil and political rights. That seems to me the surest way to build up the groundswell of support in the UN that my right hon. Friend described.</p>            </div>

We have consistently raised it since. The so-called <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Police_Complaints_Council">Independent Police Complaints Council</a> is in place. We have serious concerns about its independence.

Of course, though, as the hon.

It allows <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> passport holders to come here. We are removing the six-month limitation. They can apply to work and study, and that will itself create a path to citizenship. I have been engaged with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a> and, indeed, other Ministers since last September, looking at the detail. There is further consideration that we are giving to it. Of course, it is about giving effect to those rights as effectively as possible, but also doing it in the most straightforward and swift way we possibly can.</p>            </div>

We have said throughout that we are not seeking to contain China as a matter of dogmatic strategy; we are seeking to engage with it. There are also opportunities in the relationship&#8212;on trade and on climate change, with some of the green technology it is capable of innovating as well as in relation to its role as a major emitter&#8212;and we want to engage to accentuate those opportunities and mitigate the risks involved. The issue with Hong Kong is different. It is a point of principle and relates to the historic ties to which Members on both sides of the House have referred. That is why we have set out such detail. We will stand by this relationship and continue to seek to engage, as difficult as it may be, but we will also be clear that if China flouts international law, or those wider values and principles that we hold dear, we will stand up and act. Equally, we will defend the key equities that we have in this country, whether in relation to intellectual property theft or telecoms.</p>            </div>
