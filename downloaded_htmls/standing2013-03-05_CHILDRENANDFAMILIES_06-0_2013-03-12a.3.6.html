                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> I should have said earlier that it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Chope, given that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> managed to make that clear earlier to Mr Havard and I did not.</p> <p>We share the Government’s frustration at the fact that black and minority ethnic children wait on average a year longer than other children to be placed for adoption. Like the Minister, we believe that it is important to eradicate all unnecessary delay for all children, so we welcome the Government’s decision to focus on this group of children and young people, who wait longer than others.</p> <p>We also agree with the Minister that it is somewhat anachronistic that this consideration is written into primary legislation, while other important factors relevant to a child’s life and identity are set out in secondary legislation. Consideration of ethnicity ought to remain one important, but not overriding, consideration in determinations about a child’s future. We agree with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=191" title="The house of Lords is the upper chamber of the Houses of Parliament. It is..." class="glossary">House of Lords</a> Select Committee on Adoption Legislation that it ought to be placed on to the welfare checklist to be considered alongside other important aspects of a child’s life and identity.</p> <p>When the former Children’s Minister, the hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Worthing">East Worthing</a> and Shoreham (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Loughton">Tim Loughton</a>), first raised the issue while speaking to Community Care magazine, he talked about “hints of political correctness” among social workers searching for a “dream ethnic match.” Research simply does not support the belief that political correctness is the main reason why black and minority ethnic children wait longer to be adopted; nor does it explain why fewer black and minority ethnic children are adopted altogether. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> will be aware of the recent Ofsted report, “Right on Time”, which made that point strongly and noted</p> <p class="indent">“little evidence of delay caused by an unrealistic search for a perfect ethnic match.”</p> <p>It also said that inspectors had found that</p> <p class="indent">“Processes for matching children with adoptive placements were generally robust.”</p> <p>In addition, research by Professor Julie Selwyn, who gave evidence to the Committee, found that the most important factor in delays in adoption for black and minority ethnic children was the age at which they came into care. Her research also found that other factors were important, such as children from black and minority ethnic communities having a more complex or patchy medical history, which is relevant to prospective adopters, and young people coming from overseas with no medical history. Research by Thoburn et al. has shown that, for cultural reasons, certain communities, such as Caribbean communities, prefer long-term foster care to adoption. Just because fewer black and minority ethnic children are adopted, it should not be assumed that that is necessarily an indication that the outcomes for those children will be poorer, or that the placements will not be as appropriate.</p> <p>Professor Elaine Farmer has also done some research, of which I know the Minister is aware, that is extremely relevant to our discussion. She found that ethnicity was a cause of delay for a significant number of young people, but she also found that other factors were significant, and I want to draw the Committee’s attention to them. Although, as I said, we very much welcome Ministers choosing to focus on this group of young people to ensure that all unnecessary delay is eradicated, the picture is complex. Ethnicity often goes to the heart of the child’s identity and can be, in itself, a reason for delay, if the child feels that it is important.</p> <p>I do not deny that, in some isolated incidents, political correctness or caution on the part of social workers may result in black and minority ethnic children facing unnecessary delay because their ethnicity is taken to be more important than it actually is. The research is extremely clear that it does not happen routinely. Where it does happen, it should be eradicated, but I agree with the witnesses to the House of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_Select_Committee">Lords Select Committee</a> who strongly said that they did not consider it to be an issue of legislation; in fact, they considered it to be an issue of practice. That is why I started my remarks by saying that although we very much welcome the Minister’s decision to focus on this group of children, we are not entirely convinced that the change that Ministers seek to make is the right approach for children or will solve the problem.</p> <p>Like the previous Government in their 2007 guidance, this Government have rightly sent out a strong message to the profession that a loving home for every child should be the priority, and that considerations of ethnicity should never get in the way of that, where that is in the child’s best interests. Ethnicity can be very important to children, however, especially those who come into care at an older age. That is relevant because when we talk about black and minority ethnic children in the care system, one of the features of that group is that they tend to come into care at an older age. That is one reason why Professor Julie Selwyn said that they tend to be less likely to be adopted. We know that age is a strong predictive factor in whether children will be adopted. For older children, being able to take forward ongoing issues about their previous identity into their new family and knowing that they will be respected is incredibly important. That is why article 20 of the United  Nations convention on the rights of the child sets out that children who cannot be looked after by their own family have a right to special care and must be looked after properly by people who respect their ethnic group, religion, culture and language.</p> <p>Young ambassadors from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Society">National Society</a> for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children have made that point strongly. When I visited <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChildLine">ChildLine</a> just a couple of weeks ago, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSPCC">NSPCC</a> staff said that children participating in their online forums over the past few weeks had said strongly that ethnicity and particularly religion mattered to them. Those aspects had helped many of the children who were involved in that discussion make sense of their place in the world. They wanted the message to be passed on to me and to this Committee.</p> <p>I am having an online chat with some of the young ambassadors this evening. I will check with them again, but they felt extremely strongly about the matter only two weeks ago and I have no reason to believe that they would change their mind.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> I am not aware of any evidence that says that that should take precedence, nor am I aware of any children who believe that to be the case. Many children feel strongly that they want the right match. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Association">The Association</a> of Professors of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Work">Social Work</a> calls it the chemistry between the child and the new family. We should never ever forget that, nor let other considerations get in the way. That is certainly not the position of my party, and I am certain that that is not the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>’s position either. However, it is an important consideration, not to all children but to some, and it is very important to a small number of children.</p> <p>Charities have expressed concern that the policy may send the wrong message to social workers that they cannot consider ethnicity at all. Given that there has been no great clamour for a change in the law, as I have pointed out, and that there is no great evidence that there is poor practice that puts politically correct considerations above children’s best interests, the policy runs the risk of sending the wrong message to social workers about whether they should consider ethnicity.</p> <p>The provision in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption_and_Children_Act_2002">Adoption and Children Act 2002</a> was introduced as a result of damaging placements that took no account of ethnicity. We are concerned that, by removing the consideration from primary legislation but not giving it a place among the other factors in the welfare checklist, as our <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> would allow, the Government might unintentionally swing the pendulum back that way.</p> <p>A recent report on interracial adoptions by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Association">British Association</a> of Adoption and Fostering highlighted a number of issues. The first was that interracial adoption can be a positive experience. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee">The Committee</a> should not ignore that; it can be important for young people. However, it also highlighted the real and lasting damage that may be done to some children by ignoring aspects of their identity that are important to them. It was the first study of the long-term impact of interracial adoption  in Britain, considering the experience of Chinese orphans who came to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> from <span class="hi"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a></span> and who were adopted largely by white British parents. Overall, their experiences were positive, but for some, the negative impact was significant. More strikingly, the report said that many women stressed that being internationally and transracially adopted added another specific dimension to the adoption experience that should not be ignored.</p> <p>Instead of removing this entirely, we would like to see it remain a consideration. This is not simply so that those young people for whom it is important are placed with a family whose ethnicity matches their own. Even where they are not, we must give thought to the importance that they place on those factors. We must also increase the likelihood that those young people are supported to ensure that those aspects of their identity remain and to help those aspects to flourish.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> said previously that placing the factors in question in the welfare checklist would give them excessive weight. I do not accept that. By definition, they would have to be considered alongside other factors. Children believe that they are as important as age, gender and other factors. On this occasion, we really ought to listen to them.</p> <p>Finally, it is clear that legislation in this area is no substitute for better practices. None of the witnesses to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=191" title="The house of Lords is the upper chamber of the Houses of Parliament. It is..." class="glossary">House of Lords</a> Select Committee on Adoption Legislation called for wide ranging changes to legislation. Instead, they said that</p> <p class="indent">“there was overwhelming evidence that the big issues of concern—delay in the adoption system and the shortage of adopters—were the result of failures in practice.”</p> <p>The hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Bann">Upper Bann</a> has previously mentioned the shortage of adopters in particular. We would like to see the Government and local authorities do more to target black and minority ethnic communities to bring a greater supply of prospective adoptive parents. We would like to see greater support and training for adoptive parents in order that they can meet the race, religious and cultural needs of the child. However, we would also like to see those factors placed in the welfare checklist so that they can be considered, as children wish, among other factors.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> I agree with my hon. Friend that placing a child with parents of a different race certainly adds a dimension that should be considered when the placement is made. But of course I accept, and agree with her, that the most important consideration is to ensure that a child is placed in a loving, supportive and stable placement as quickly as is appropriate given the complexity of the circumstances in that particular case. I also welcome efforts to speed up the adoption process, and indeed to increase the number of adoptions for children from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. Children from those backgrounds are over-represented in the care system but are less likely to be adopted for a variety of reasons—including the age at which they enter the system to which my hon. Friend referred in her presentation.</p> <p>However, any potential adoptive parents need to understand the identity of the child whom they seek to adopt. That includes their religious persuasion, their racial origin and their cultural and linguistic background.  The 2012 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Chinese">British Chinese</a> adoption study refers to cases of children adopted from <span class="hi"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a></span> and brought into the United Kingdom. It explores how they found being brought up in families of a very different cultural and racial background. One of the conclusions was this:</p> <p class="indent">“For some it was not easy living with the fact of being from a different ethnic background and visibly different from their adoptive families.”</p> <p>That could result in</p> <p class="indent">“a sense of not belonging or not feeling able to identify with either white British or Chinese communities.”</p> <p>It will benefit the child as well as the adoptive parents if concerns that that may be a consequence of a placement are taken into account while the placement is made and while the adoptive parents are considering how best to bring up the child placed into their care.</p> <p>My hon. Friend also referred to some of the views expressed by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSPCC">NSPCC</a>’s young ambassadors on the matter of interracial adoption. It is worth quoting a couple of those to put them on the record. The first was, “It is important that young people can find similarities and understanding with new adoptive parents around race and religion.” Another young person said, “If the child and adoptive parents had contrasting cultural beliefs that could cause problems.” Those are both very sensible points of view. It is right to ensure that we take the views of children into account as we shape this legislation.</p>            </div>

Friend the Member for Wigan has proposed something that is fairly modest that will enable us to continue to take into account ethnicity. I hope that the Government will take that on board and support the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>.</p> <p>The particular comment that Dr Atkinson made that really struck me was when she quoted a young person from a black minority ethnic background, who said:</p> <p class="indent">“You have to understand who I have been and who I am, as well as where I am going and who you want me to be.”</p> <p>Dr Atkinson said that that was one of the strongest things that had ever been said to her as the Children’s Commissioner. She described him as a very proud young man</p> <p class="indent">“who considered that his background, ethnicity and religion were not being taken into account where he was.” ––[Official Report, Children and Families Public Bill Committee, 5 March 2013; c. 89, Q196.]</p> <p>We all want those things to be taken into account. My hon. Friend the Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croydon_North">Croydon North</a> has spoken powerfully about why those factors are important to a young person and why they must be considered. The modest recommendation that they should be in the welfare checklist is something that we all hope the Minister can support.</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> stand part, I thank hon. Members who have contributed to this short but important debate. It is a serious issue and one that we do not deal with lightly, hence the long consideration over the most appropriate way forward, which always has the child at the very heart of our thinking.</p> <p>The clause amends section 1 of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption_and_Children_Act_2002">Adoption and Children Act 2002</a> so that subsection (5) does not apply in England. This removes the explicit requirement to give due consideration to a child’s religious persuasion, racial origin and cultural and linguistic background when matching a child and prospective adopters. As we have heard from the hon. Member for Wigan, we propose to do that because of the unacceptable situation in which black children take, on average, a year longer to be adopted than white children or children of other ethnicity. The express legal provision has caused some professionals in some local authorities to place too much weight on that one factor. I agree with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Martin_Narey">Sir Martin Narey</a>, the Government’s adviser on adoption, who said that the fact that there is a problem is not in doubt.</p>            </div>

Lady has provided is a list of groups and organisations that are implacably hostile to our position, which is at one with that of many other groups. As we heard from the hon. Members for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Bann">Upper Bann</a> and for Croydon  North, ethnicity should not be a barrier to a match and an adoption placement, but it should be one of the factors that has to be taken into consideration.</p> <p>I will come on to how the welfare checklist has operated since 1989. From the cases I have done in court, I have seen that within the welfare checklist, which mentions the age, sex, background and characteristics of the child, those characteristics should not be an exhaustive list. As soon as one tries to specify particular elements of a child’s characteristics in an exhaustive list, one then starts to prioritise one characteristic over another. The checklist has always operated in a non-exhaustive way. That means that elements of a child’s characteristics that may be to do with their ethnicity, religion, culture or language—I have seen all those in cases before the courts—can all be considered in the welfare checklist that is already in operation under the “characteristics” element. That can ensure that anything, including ethnicity, is taken into account, but not as a factor that will override other factors and be a barrier to a successful match.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will give me time to complete my answer—I apologise if it was too long for him to wait for me to do that. The hon. Member for Wigan pointed to Professor Julie Selwyn, who has done some research on exactly this issue. Her conclusion was:</p> <p class="indent">“We found that local authorities were much quicker at changing the decision away from adoption for minority ethnic children than they were for white children. They looked harder and longer for families for white children… There were a great number of minority ethnic children for whom no families were found and the decision was changed away from adoption.”––[Official Report, Children and Families Public Bill Committee, 5 March 2013; c. 18-19, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q42">Q42</a>.]</p> <p>Recently, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_City_Council">Birmingham City Council</a> brought out an honest report after speaking to a number of prospective adopters who had been through the process of being matched. In one case, for example, a respondent said:</p> <p class="indent">“We feel we were quite broad minded … However we were effectively barred from … adopting non-white children by the system”.</p> <p>We do not want to see any cases where ethnicity becomes a barrier. Even one case is too many. As the hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Bann">Upper Bann</a> rightly pointed out from his personal experience, he is acutely aware of issues that prevent a child from getting a loving and stable family home as soon as possible. The hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croydon_North">Croydon North</a> made that point.</p> <p>There is good and strong evidence, from Julie Selwyn’s research and from the recent report by Birmingham City Council about the experience of prospective adopters within its local authority area, that black children taking longer to be adopted remains a problem. In evidence to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_Select_Committee">Lords Select Committee</a> on Adoption Legislation, Barnardo’s stated:</p> <p class="indent">“It is our understanding that it was not the intention of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_Act_1989">Children Act 1989</a> that ethnicity should be the main determinant of whether a child is put in a particular placement. Ethnicity was only supposed to be one factor to be taken into consideration”.</p> <p>We agree with that. Barnardo’s continued:</p> <p class="indent">“Over time, Barnardo’s believes that the importance of ethnic matching as a prime determinant when making placements has become exaggerated, and this is not supported by the original legislation”.</p> <p>That was why when the list was read out of organisations deemed to be against the Government’s position, I made the point that I was not sure that that was necessarily in the context in which they had set out their position.</p>            </div>

Far be it from me to be at odds with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroness_Butler-Sloss">Baroness Butler-Sloss</a>, having crossed swords with her in a different environment, but throughout this whole debate there has been a misconception. As I have already articulated, there is provision within the welfare checklist—there has been for the past 25 years, nearly—for the characteristics of each individual child to be taken into account.</p> <p>The hon. Lady said at the start that this issue should not be one for legislation. We are removing specific reference to some aspects of a child’s characteristics from legislation and putting them all on an equal footing, which is what the welfare checklist was originally intended to do, so that we do not reach the point—as Barnardo’s believes we already have—at which ethnic matching becomes an exaggerated element of any placement decision.

Members spoke about on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>. I have carefully considered that Committee’s recommendation on the wording relating to a child’s ethnicity being placed on the welfare checklist, and the rationale behind it. I understand the concern raised by hon. Members about removing the wording altogether, and their desire find a compromise. I am afraid that I find the present situation unacceptable, and I have articulated why, citing the support of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Martin_Narey">Sir Martin Narey</a>, as well as research by Professor Julie Selwyn and the recent report by Birmingham city council. It cannot be right that, for some children, their race and racial background seems to be the most important thing to some professionals. That situation has arisen despite the attempt in the 2002 Act at some form of balanced wording. I therefore do not share the confidence of hon. Members that the subtle change that the amendment proposes—moving the wording of the  2002 Act into the welfare checklist and putting it a couple of lines higher—will cause that misguided practice to change.</p> <p>As I said on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Reading">Second Reading</a>, we are not saying that ethnicity should never be a consideration. We know that there are cases in which it is in the child’s best interests to be placed with prospective adopters who match them in cultural background or religion. We do not want to prevent children from being matched on that basis in appropriate cases. Adoption agencies will continue to be required by section 1(2) and (4) of the 2002 Act to make a child’s welfare throughout his or her life their paramount consideration, and to have regard to a range of matters, including the child’s needs, wishes and feelings, his or her background and other relevant characteristics in reaching a placement decision. They will therefore continue to be required to consider a child’s ethnic background in that process, along with all other relevant factors.</p> <p>In practice, my experience is that if one were to trawl through reports from a children and family reporter and look at the cases in which children have an ethnic, religious, cultural or linguistic element to their characteristics that needs to be taken into account, one would find that that element is taken into account by children and family reporters and by social workers both as part of their training and good practice and because it is set out already in the welfare checklist that they have to take all characteristics into account. Local authorities are also required by section 1(3) of the 2002 Act to bear in mind that any delay in coming to a matching decision is likely to prejudice the child’s welfare.</p> <p>In summary, section 1 of the 2002 Act, amended as we propose in <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 2, will most effectively serve the best interests of children. Ethnicity should not be considered more important than a child’s other characteristics, background and needs. We have to listen to the views of children, but this measure does not go against their view that their ethnicity has to be a consideration when a decision is being made. There might be medical, emotional or behavioural needs to consider as well as the child’s ethnicity, religious persuasion, culture and linguistic background. There may be specific circumstances that make language or religion, for example, a pressing issue for a particular child; our proposed change will still allow for that and will be very much in the continuing spirit of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_Act_1989">Children Act 1989</a>. As currently drafted, clause 2 will in our estimation make a significant difference to the lives of some children who, because of some of the practice that still prevails, do not have the opportunities that they should. I urge the hon. Member for Wigan to withdraw the amendment.</p>            </div>

It is..." class="glossary">House of Lords</a> Committee and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> in asking for ethnicity to remain one important but, as the Minister says, not overriding consideration in a child’s life. I am particularly disappointed that he chose to ignore the overwhelming view of both children and the host of organisations, which is that he is simply not taking the right approach.</p> <p>I am also particularly disappointed that he did not address any of my points about practice, which many other organisations raised with us. Like them, I believe  that the issue is not generally one for legislation, but is one of practice. How social workers chose to deal with the issue on the ground will be central to the key questions about whether a child’s identity is upheld. Yet we have heard nothing from the Government about how they intend to encourage a greater supply of black and minority ethnic adoptive parents, nor have we heard anything about making greater training available to prospective adoptive parents from all backgrounds to ensure that they best meet the needs of children, whatever their ethnic backgrounds and considerations.</p> <p>Coupled with the fact that the thrust of the Bill is about getting greater speed into the process and reducing unnecessary delay, and the fact that social workers are under intolerable pressure—as are independent reviewing officers, who currently often report case loads of two or three times the recommended amount—the Government are mistaken in not listening to the whole host of organisations outside Parliament that work day in, day out with those children or to the children themselves, and in not saying that the issue must be given some prominence if it is not to get lost in practice.</p> <p>Although we do not disagree with the Government’s position in principle, I am extremely disappointed that they continue to close their ears to the evidence and views from outside Parliament telling them that they are doing the wrong thing. I am very disappointed, but I know that the Minister is a reasonable man, and I want to give him the opportunity to go away and consider the matter further. I expect that we will return to this discussion as the Bill progresses, but on that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>.</p>            </div>
