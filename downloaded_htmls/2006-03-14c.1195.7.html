                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.1150.5/1">My Lords, first I thank the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and her Bill team for our briefing meetings. They have been most helpful, as is reflected in the large number of agreements that we have been able to secure during the passage of the Bill. Perhaps she will convey our thanks to her team for their efforts.</p> <p pid="c.1150.5/2"><a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> No. 1 is grouped with Amendment No. 2&#8212;in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick of Undercliffe, my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Avebury">Lord Avebury</a> and me&#8212;as well as with Amendments Nos. 35 and 36. I turn first to Amendment No. 1. It is probably the most non-controversial amendment that we have had and the Minister should have little difficulty in accepting our proposal. Sections 88A, 90 and 91 of the 2002 Act restrict rights of appeal against a refusal of entry clearance in respect of some visitors and categories of cases specified in an order made by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>. <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 4 substitutes for these sections a provision to limit all appeals against refusal of clearance and entry to certain limited grounds&#8212;for example, human rights and race discrimination&#8212;with the exception of those in the listed categories. I welcome the fact that a right of appeal for family visitors and people wishing to join dependants in the United Kingdom is maintained.</p> <p pid="c.1150.5/3">The purpose of our amendment is to give the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> a power to restore rights to further groups should he determine that to be necessary. The amendment does not force the Government to do anything. It provides a power so that if in the future the Government determine that certain groups need to retain the right of appeal despite the points system, the right can be restored. Under the clause, rights of appeal can be restored only to visitors and dependants.</p> <p pid="c.1150.5/4">The amendment also probes the Government's intention in refusing to retain for themselves a power to restore a wider range of appeal rights, given that in debate the Minister has made much of the flexibility afforded by secondary legislation. We doubt the power of secondary legislation if it retains no flexibility whatsoever. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> had proposed to take a power at large to restore appeal rights under what had been new Section 88(2)(b), which it was proposed would be used for unaccompanied children. Of that provision, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegated_Powers_and_Regulatory_Reform_Committee">Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee</a> stated:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.1150.5/5">"<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State is empowered to give rights of appeal to others by order subject to the affirmative procedure. We consider it appropriate that he should be empowered to do so, and that the exercise of the power should be subject to the affirmative procedure".</p> <p pid="c.1150.5/6">The Home Office memorandum making the case for a delegated power appears as Appendix 1 to the report. Thus there is no scope for the Minister to refuse the amendment on the basis that it would introduce in secondary legislation a wide-ranging power to restore appeal rights.</p> <p pid="c.1150.5/7">It is difficult to square promises of efficiency in the decision-making process of entry clearance officers thanks to training, guidance and review with the fact that provision for all that is currently made in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_Service">Diplomatic Service</a> procedure and yet that system does not work. Overall, the Government are not obliged to do anything. The amendment would simply provide a power if, in the future, the Government considered there to be a need to retain the right of appeal in certain cases.</p> <p pid="c.1150.5/8">I resist the temptation at this point to talk about Amendment No. 2. I shall speak to it only after the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, has done so.</p> <p pid="c.1150.5/9">Amendments Nos. 35 and 36 deal with Clause 62, concerning the commencement of the Act. The purpose is to make the implementation of the abolition of appeals in entry clearance cases subject to affirmative procedures. Our amendments are designed to ensure that standards in decision-making have been raised by the time of commencement. These are non-controversial measures designed to assist the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, who, I am sure, would welcome powers to ensure that the system is geared towards making such provisions as may be necessary for the operation of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause_4">Clause 4</a>. I beg to move.</p>            </div>

My intention in returning to the issue is not to force the matter to a vote&#8212;I should like to make that clear at the outset&#8212;but rather to provide an opportunity for the House to probe the Government one final time on the shape of the proposed administrative review. Given the planned abolition of the right of appeals in entry clearance cases, this becomes a matter of central importance for me and for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_UK">Universities UK</a>, in which I declare an interest as chief executive.</p> <p pid="c.1152.0/3">The Government have recognised that even under the new points-based system mistakes may well occur, so they have reiterated their commitment to introduce an administrative review scheme to ensure that, where an entry clearance decision is disputed, there is an opportunity for applicants to seek to have the decision reconsidered. Last week, the Government published their <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_Paper">Command Paper</a> <i>Making Migration Work for Britain</i>. It sets out in more detail what the points-based immigration system will look like.</p> <p pid="c.1152.0/4">There is no doubt in my mind that the points-based system is likely to improve the quality of initial decision making. Some of the changes that the new system will introduce are very welcome. The emphasis on objective decision making, institution-specific visas and efforts to produce a quality-controlled register of approved education providers are all welcome. But some significant questions still need to be answered. Crucially, from my point of view, the design of the promised administrative review is still unclear. Indeed, I am worried that the wording of the relevant section&#8212;paragraphs 52 to 54&#8212;will not provide the wide scope I had hoped for, but might limit the review to a consideration only of the facts. That is a very important issue, because there is a general recognition that not all subjectivity can be removed from the process. As the immigration <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_McNulty">Tony McNulty</a>, said in <a href="/glossary/?gl=112" title="During a debate members of the House of Commons traditionally refer to the..." class="glossary">another place</a>:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.1152.0/5">"100 per cent objectivity is a fool's errand . . . It is not about simply ticking boxes and adding points up, although that is a large part of the measure".&#8212;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons <a href="/glossary/?gl=248" title="In a normal session there are up to ten standing committees on bills. Each..." class="glossary">Standing Committee</a> E, 20/10/05; col. 116.]</p> <p pid="c.1152.0/6">I have shared with the Minister and other <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_the_House">Members of the House</a>, for whose support I am enormously grateful, an outline of the scheme that I would like to see. In my view, the administrative review should require entry clearance officers to provide detailed written reasons for the refusal of an application; should allow all unsuccessful applicants to request a review; should be overseen, preferably by the regional tier of UK visas staff; should enable sponsoring institutions to make representations on behalf of applicants; should be completed within a reasonable timescale; and should allow for the clarification of existing evidence. In addition, it is important that the entry clearance monitor should have oversight of the operation of the scheme. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me on these points.</p> <p pid="c.1152.0/7">Perhaps it would be useful if I ask four specific questions. Paragraph 53 of the Command Paper states that administrative review will be available if,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.1152.0/8">"an applicant believes a factual error has been made in the consideration of his application".</p> <p pid="c.1152.0/9">If the Minister accepts, as I believe she does, that there will be some element of subjectivity in the process, can she reassure me that the administrative review will be able to consider judgments and points of law, as well as facts? The Command Paper states, on page 12, that the points-based system will be supported by administrative review, where appropriate. Can the Minister confirm that, as she said to me on Report, administrative review will be available to anyone who is refused a visa under the new system? Will she undertake to consult fully on the design of the administrative review and to publish the final scheme so that all parties know what to expect?</p> <p pid="c.1152.0/10">Finally, many in this House are uneasy about the fact that, under the system as we currently understand it, entry clearance officers and their immediate managers will be responsible for reviewing their own decisions. If the Minister accepts that there will be cases where subjective judgments are involved in reaching a decision, does she agree with me that there should be an opportunity to involve a third party&#8212;someone within the immigration system but not involved in that initial decision&#8212;in the review? Will the Minister consider, for example, how the regional tier of UK visas staff might be involved in the administrative review?</p> <p pid="c.1152.0/11">I have shared these questions with my noble friend the Minister in advance of this debate, because this really is the last opportunity for us to secure reassurance, on the Floor of this House, about the operation of the new system during the passage of the Bill. I hope that my noble friend and, indeed, all Members of this House will understand that I have pressed this point simply because I want the system to be as fair and effective as possible. I know that that is a shared goal and I look forward to the Minister's reply.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.1153.0/1">My Lords, I thank the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for being as good as her word and letting us have the Home Office consultation on the points-based system before we came to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Reading">Third Reading</a>, although I obtained a copy only on Thursday evening&#8212;I would have liked longer in which to study it and to consult others. A great many questions still remain unanswered, as we have heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick. I do not think that we have enough information to assess how the system is likely to work; nor do I think that anybody could have taken up the Minister's invitation in col. 534 of the <i>Official Report</i> to submit examples of wrong decisions made under the existing system that would not have been dealt with correctly under the new one. We have still not been told what points will be awarded, except in tier 1 and tier 2. Nor have we been given any details of the financial securities that will be required of applicants coming from certain unidentified countries, particularly those who have certain unspecified characteristics. If the Minister would care to fill in those blanks, we could see what could be done to provide her with comparators. Of course, by that time it will be too late for us to do anything about it.</p> <p pid="c.1153.0/2">Under the points-based system, decisions on entry clearance and leave to remain are supposed to be based on objective criteria only. As the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, has said, there is no such thing as total objectivity. In those cases where the decision is made entirely on the facts, the necessity for appeal is eliminated; we concede that. An offer from an approved institution will be a proxy for intention and ability to study, backed by the sponsors undertaking certain responsibilities for the student while in the UK. There is an equivalent duty on employers when the application is for entry clearance to work. That is, as the noble Baroness has said, a marked improvement on the present system, although as we already have a register of <i>bona fide</i> universities and colleges I still do not understand why this scheme could not have been realised in the educational sector by changes to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Rules">Immigration Rules</a>, as I suggested at an earlier stage. In the Minister's letter to me of <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-23">23 February</phrase>, she said that it could not be done until,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.1153.0/3">"the system of sponsorship is up and running and underlain by certain clearly defined responsibilities for institutions and appropriate monitoring and compliance functions within <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IND">IND</a>".</p> <p pid="c.1153.0/4">If the institutions' offer of a place is to be treated as a proxy for intention and ability to study&#8212;as we agree it should&#8212;what more will be required of the institutions? The new document says that pilots are running at 30 institutions, which are required to report non-enrolment or discontinuation of studies by any overseas student to whom a place is offered. I assume that this will include special provisions for recording any who drop out temporarily for reasons of ill health or bereavement, for example. Is it the intention to use this reporting system to identify and return those who use the offer of a place to gain entry for some other purpose? Do the Government have any reason to believe that, with fees at their present high levels, this is a problem? Or are the pilots meant simply to confirm, statistically, that where particular institutions offer places the students normally comply with reporting conditions and complete the courses?</p> <p pid="c.1153.0/5">The new document does not explain how the two classes of educational institution, A and B, are to be defined, and on what criteria the number of points each will attract is to be determined. There is even greater uncertainty over how the applicant will demonstrate that he has sufficient funds to cover fees and living expenses. The document does not say so but, although an applicant is awarded points for the amount of money that he can produce up front, there must be a subjective element in assessing whether he will be able to sustain himself for the duration of his course. With regard to the financial securities that will be required of those whose personal circumstances or migration route suggest that they present a higher risk of breaching the Immigration Rules, the Government say that they have listened to the objection&#8212;raised, for example, by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUS">NUS</a>&#8212;that demanding securities will make it harder for students from the poorest countries to come here. They will therefore require securities only where objective evidence shows that taking a particular route or belonging to a particular class means that migrant students are disproportionately likely to breach immigration conditions.</p> <p pid="c.1153.0/6">It is only too likely that the routes in question will be taken by those from poor countries. Although the procedure may reduce the overall number of students who breach their conditions, it may also skew the overseas student population towards the richer countries. What does the document mean by "personal circumstances"? Is this related to the financial circumstances of the student or his family, so that if, for instance, he has no bank account or his parents are both unemployed, he will be disqualified? That is one of a great many uncertainties that remain.</p> <p pid="c.1153.0/7">If the Government insist on introducing these financial guarantees, why could they not do so under existing rules? Rule 57(6) already requires that a student should be able to,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.1153.0/8">"meet the costs of his course and accommodation and the maintenance of himself and any dependants without taking employment or engaging in business or having recourse to public funds".</p> <p pid="c.1153.0/9">At the moment, the published <i>Immigration Directorates' Instructions</i> add nothing on how to assess the applicant's ability to satisfy this condition. Here is another area where pilots under the existing rules could have allowed different criteria to be tested before the new system goes live. I would like to know from the Minister why that was not done. An objective test of the student's ability to support himself could be implemented now; it would enormously reduce the number of appeals under the existing system.</p> <p pid="c.1153.0/10">That brings me to the question of how long it will be until the points-based system is introduced. We have an <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> to <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 62 saying that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause_4">Clause 4</a>(1) should come into force on a date to be appointed by affirmative resolution, as my noble friend has already explained. That is to ensure that the transition is properly managed and properly monitored by Parliament. I believe that it has been said that the timing would not be the same for the different tiers. However, if in each tier the proposed tests are first applied under the existing rules, there should be no problem. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_1">Tier 1</a> should be extremely easy to cope with because it does not rely on sponsorship, and tier 2, for skilled migrants with a job offer, could be the next, since there is already a provisional scheme for the points&#8212;as we read in the document that we have now been given&#8212;which could be read across into the rules.</p> <p pid="c.1153.0/11">I have a couple of questions about the inclusion of ministers of religion in tier 2. First, would they be required to show competence in English, as in tier 1, and how would that be assessed? Secondly, although the treatment of prospective earnings as a material factor in gaining admission may be appropriate in other occupations, it is not necessarily appropriate for ministers or priests, whose value is not measured by their incomes. How will the system treat Buddhist monks, who do not earn or handle money? I declare an interest as a patron of the Buddhist prison chaplaincy.</p> <p pid="c.1153.0/12">For tiers 3, 4 and 5, it may be a long wait, which is why we on the Liberal Democrat Benches have been so desperately concerned to do something about the shocking defects that have been identified in the existing system by the previous monitor on entry clearances, Ms Fiona Lindsley, as we emphasised both in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Committee">Grand Committee</a> and on Report. We had hoped to see her final report&#8212;the first draft of which she submitted before she left office at the end of November last year&#8212;before this debate. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> told me in her letter of <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-23">23 February</phrase> that the final draft was submitted in late January&#8212;I believe that it has now been narrowed down to <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-23">23 January</phrase>&#8212;and that arrangements were being made to lay the report before Parliament. Seven weeks later and after several inquiries behind the scenes, including a personal approach to the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Triesman">Lord Triesman</a>, followed up by a letter the same day and a Question on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=5" title="The order paper is issued daily and lists the business which will be dealt..." class="glossary">Order Paper</a>, Ms Lindsley's report still has not appeared. I am very unhappy that the Government have avoided a discussion on the recommendations that she has no doubt made on improving the present system, particularly as we now hear that the new system may not be introduced until 2008, which means that we shall have to cope with all the defects in the current system for at least another two years.</p> <p pid="c.1153.0/13">Finally, I wish to make a couple of remarks about a meeting that the Chinese community had with the Minister, Mr <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_McNulty">Tony McNulty</a>, about which I heard only just before I came into the Chamber. As your Lordships will recall, on previous occasions we have discussed the particular problems that arose with the Chinese community. I am very grateful to the Minister and her colleagues for the thorough way in which they discussed those with the representatives. However, at the meeting with Mr McNulty, the issue was raised that chefs were unlikely to have any formal qualifications. The Minister said that he recognised that chefs were not specifically addressed in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_Paper">Command Paper</a> and that it would be wrong to have a system that excluded ethnic cuisine chefs. He said that there would be a skills advisory board specific to each sector and that the Chinese and Bangladeshi restaurant communities would be consulted on issues of experience and remuneration levels and whether the relevant job was considered a shortage occupation. Incidentally, that is where I got the 2008 date from, because that was what Mr McNulty told the representatives. We had not heard that from any other source, so far as I am aware. It is a pity that we did not know earlier that there would be this long delay before the roll-out.</p> <p pid="c.1153.0/14"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese">The Chinese</a> community expressed concern that the abolition of the sector-based scheme would create serious problems for the low-skilled workers category. The Minister acknowledged that and said that the solution was for them to talk to his team about the issues of remuneration, qualifications and shortage occupations. He went on to explain that,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.1153.0/15">"for the new business to the work permit system, then if approved as sponsor, will always be on the A list".</p> <p pid="c.1153.0/16">I did not express that very well, but that is how the briefing is phrased. I think that it means that every person on application would be classified as being on the A list until there was any information leading the department to think that they were not reliable employers. Again, that is something that we had not heard before&#8212;that new applicants, if they had not been involved in employing people from overseas previously, would always be classed as being on the A list until there was some reason to suppose that they were not reliable. That illustrates that even at this late stage people are still discovering a great deal of the detail about how the points system will work, which we might have been told at an earlier stage to our great advantage.</p> <p pid="c.1153.0/17">On our amendment, the best that I can do is to quote Mr Donald Rumsfeld, who said, "We know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns&#8212;the ones we don't know we don't know". That is why we believe that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> should have this power. It may never have to be used if the system is as wonderful as Ministers claim, though one of the knowns is that returning residents who have been abroad for more than two years for legitimate health or family reasons may now be excluded from their homes for ever under this scheme.</p> <p pid="c.1153.0/18">We say that it is impossible to prove that every decision will be a matter of simple arithmetic. The partial description that we have of the points system leads us to conclude&#8212;as the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, has said&#8212;that subjectivity has not been entirely excluded. It is only sensible and reasonable, then, to have this power in reserve.</p>            </div>

I would like in particular to support <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> No. 2, spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick. The universities continue to be extremely anxious about what the effect of all this will be on students coming to them. They appreciate, as we all do, that publication of the details of the points system is enormously helpful. We may say a little more about that when we come to Amendment No. 3. If Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are not accepted, I hope that Amendment No. 3 will be, because it seems to me a very practical way of approaching the problem.</p> <p pid="c.1157.0/2">We need to know from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> the circumstances in which administrative review will be available. Will it be available to anyone who is refused? I see that the Minister nods. It would be a great comfort if she could confirm that. Will the review be possible if there are factual or legal errors or subjective decisions that are questionable? Some good examples have been given of decisions on whether a student can pay for a course. That will be a subjective decision and it may be that it should be reviewed. The record so far on the way in which these decisions have been made is clearly very weak. There is a lot of improving to do. I look forward very much to hearing the Minister answer those questions.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.1158.2/1">My Lords, I also rise to support the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> standing in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick of Undercliffe.</p> <p pid="c.1158.2/2">Many noble Lords, from all sides of the House, have expressed concern about the planned abolition of the right of appeal for international students who are refused visas, arguing that the right of appeal is an important safeguard. Numerous examples have been given of poor-quality decision-making under the current system. We know that, last year, 33 per cent of students were initially refused visas. Of those who appealed, about one in four was successful. I was alarmed to hear about the case of a student refused a visa because the entry clearance officer did not believe it credible that if the student wanted to improve his English, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> would be his destination of choice.</p> <p pid="c.1158.2/3">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> has argued that mistakes under the current system will no longer be made under the points-based system which will replace it. Although the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_Paper">Command Paper</a> published last week is light on that detail, I am prepared to accept that there will be substantial improvements in the way decisions are made. However, as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_UK">Universities UK</a> and others have pointed out, the system will not be 100 per cent objective. That is why it is so important to ensure that the administrative review scheme promised by the Government really provides an adequate means of redress where mistakes are made. It cannot be right, for example, that the administrative review should consider only factual errors. Since there will remain an element of subjectivity in the process, can the Minister reassure me that that review will be able to overturn faulty judgments?</p> <p pid="c.1158.2/4">Although the Minister has said that mistakes of the kind that I have described would not be made under the new system, what happens when there is human error? After all, the judgment in the case of the student who wanted to study in Northern Ireland would not have been supported by the current <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Rules">Immigration Rules</a>, and the same personnel will be making decisions under the new system. So what guarantee is there that personal prejudice will not creep in to influence the apparently objective allocation of points? After all, the Command Paper has given us no clear idea about how points will be allocated.</p> <p pid="c.1158.2/5">Another point that has caused concern is the question of who will have the right to ask for a visa refusal to be reviewed. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> told the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, on Report that the administrative review will be available to "anyone who is refused". Is that consistent with the statement on page 12 of the Command Paper that administrative review will support the points based system "where appropriate"? I want to know that anyone who feels they have been unfairly refused a visa will be able to have that decision reviewed, if they so wish. Can the Minister confirm that that will be the case?</p> <p pid="c.1158.2/6">I also agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, and others, that the person with final responsibility for the review should not be the person whose original decision is being questioned, or indeed their immediate manager. An official at least one step removed from the original decision should be involved. It is disappointing that the Government have insisted on moving to abolish the right&#8212;</p>            </div>

First, I congratulate the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> on the new scheme, which has with it the elements of a successful system. While I accept that much of the discussion today emphasises the fact that we do not know enough about its detail, I want to touch on one major factor influencing the acceptance of students when they get to the gate, as it were. That is the financial implication.</p> <p pid="c.1159.2/2">In the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, we spend a particularly long period trying to assess the financial limitations and obligations on the part of both the student and the university itself. We accept&#8212;as we have been doing for many years now&#8212;that we will not take in students who lack the financial backing to be able to carry the scheme forward. That in itself is an important factor and I am sure that Cambridge is not unique in that respect. It must apply to other universities.</p> <p pid="c.1159.2/3">At the end of the day, the university authorities will often have to deal with that problem themselves. They will have to try to deal with a situation as and when it arises, should there be a deficiency in the student's ability to pay fees. That ought to be considered. If this is a point of rejection, then it ought to be referred back, at least in part, to authorities such as the universities which have been looking into that particular situation.</p>            </div>

I have not studied the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_Paper">Command Paper</a> but I understand from specialised agencies such as Kalayaan and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Slavery_International">Anti-Slavery International</a> that this policy seems to run against what the Home Office has already said.</p> <p pid="c.1160.0/2">Those agencies have been told by officials working on the points system that domestic workers either qualify as part of tier 2&#8212;which few can do, since it requires them to have <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVQ">NVQ</a> level 3 or the equivalent&#8212;or will be given a maximum of six months' leave, which cannot be extended. The idea is that the employer recruits a replacement domestic worker, from the UK or European Union, and sends the original worker home.</p> <p pid="c.1160.0/3">In practice, the proposal means that migrant domestic workers would go underground. That is really contradictory when Home Office policy has been to ensure that there is no hidden slavery&#8212;an abuse taking place behind closed doors, where people are hidden away. The new proposals would put domestic workers at greater risk of such exploitation. I acknowledge that there is a mention of diplomatic employees but that is a small element in the total.</p>            </div>

Some amendments have indeed been brought forward, the most crucial regarding <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 1.</p> <p pid="c.1160.1/2">I shall refer briefly to <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> No. 1 in the name of the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Dholakia">Lord Dholakia</a>. I do not propose to speak on it today. We are at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Reading">Third Reading</a> and I have said all that I wished to say at other stages of the Bill. I hope that the noble Lord will forgive me if I end at that point. However, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, for bringing forward her Amendment No. 2. She is right to do so because, as she says, this is the time for further clarification and our last chance to get assurances from the Government. The noble Baroness is also right to say that she does not intend to press the matter to a <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">Division</a>. We are all agreed that the points system must be made to work. To do that requires goodwill from all of us so that we get as much clarification from the Minister as possible. The noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, was careful in her arguments to address herself simply to the administrative review process itself. I will say one or two words about that in a moment&#8212;in support of her, I hope.</p> <p pid="c.1160.1/3">When the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Avebury">Lord Avebury</a>, spoke he rather opened Pandora's box by taking us into a debate about the points system. I do not see that as a problem, since at <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> we had no opportunity to debate that system. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> very constructively assisted the delay of Third Reading so that noble Lords could put questions about the points system today. I had rather thought that it might come up in the next group of amendments, so I had stuffed all my questions in there. I have given the Minister notice that rather than double up I will ask those questions now. In a moment when I go through those questions and test the patience of the House, noble Lords will at least know that in the next group I can be extremely brief.</p> <p pid="c.1160.1/4">The noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, was very helpful to set out what she considers to be good practice with regard to administrative review. It will be important for the Minister now to go through that to say whether the Government see the limbs of good practice that she has set out as the ones that they wish to adopt. For example, she said that the entry clearance officer should provide written reasons for refusal. I hope that she would add "in the outcome of any subsequent review", as one needs to know how the process would continue. She also said that the review should allow for the clarification of the existing evidence. I hope that one would be able to submit further evidence and, if not, on what basis that would be denied. Overall, the noble Baroness has provided the good practice guide that the Government ought to follow.</p> <p pid="c.1160.1/5">On the issue of the Pandora's box and the points system, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, explained that last week the Government published a points-based system <i>Making Migration Work for Britain</i>. In <a href="/glossary/?gl=112" title="During a debate members of the House of Commons traditionally refer to the..." class="glossary">another place</a>, there was a Private Notice Question on that. I felt that it was not appropriate for me to clamour for that to be taken by way of a Statement in this House, because the Government had shown goodwill by delaying Third Reading so that we could debate it today. Therefore, I did not press for a Statement in this House, but it was so that noble Lords should be able to talk about the points system today.</p> <p pid="c.1160.1/6">Like the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, I am grateful to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lee">Christine Lee</a> of the North London Chinese Association for the very helpful briefing that she sent to Peers for this stage of the Bill. She makes some very pertinent points, which I would like to raise, and asks some questions that I would like the Minister to respond to. I have given advance notice of those, because they are in detail. In addition, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, referred to the fact that Ms Lee and her colleagues had a meeting today with the Minister, Mr McNulty. It would be very helpful if the Minister could give an update on that. I have been provided with a summary synopsis of the meeting by Ms Lee, but I am not sure whether the Minister has seen that yet. We may be going to have to conclude any discussions about that by way of letter following this debate; or indeed it may be appropriate for the Minister to answer questions on that when this Bill is debated in another place this Thursday and it takes Lords amendments.</p> <p pid="c.1160.1/7">On tier 3 of the points system, the Chinese community points out that it is important to know what will happen to low-skill workers. Will low-skill workers, including waiters, waitresses, kitchen porters and catering assistants, fall within tier 3 of the points system? The Minister will know that the Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Chinese and Indian communities place a heavy reliance on those workers, particularly in small businesses. They point out the problem areas that arise if they have to recruit from communities that do not reflect their ethnicity, such as communication, team cohesion, training needs and deployment.</p> <p pid="c.1160.1/8">On tier 2 of the points system, will the Minister confirm what requirements will be needed for restaurant managers and chefs to fall within tier 2? Would that include those chefs and managers with at least three years' experience? The Minister will recall that Mr McNulty said categorically that chefs would fall within tier 2, but the section describing the architecture of the new system is not clear about that. It seems to set a points menu that could deny the opportunity for chefs and most managers to come here. That is at pages 25 and 26 of the Government's document.</p> <p pid="c.1160.1/9">Would it be right to say that in practice a chef would either have to satisfy a requirement that the job offer had been made in a shortage occupation, or that the job offer passes the test that the applicant would not displace a worker in the domestic UK market, plus the additional test that he or she would be earning a minimum of &#163;21,000 a year in the UK from a registered employer? I realise that some points can be earned by having a Masters degree or a PhD but, without intending to underestimate the ability of chefs, that does not seem particularly relevant to the employment of most chefs in this country.</p> <p pid="c.1160.1/10">Last week, the Minister offered me the opportunity to meet her. I raised questions about this then, with regard particularly to the test of &#163;21,000 a year as the qualifying salary. Will that &#163;21,000 be expressed merely in monetary terms, or do the Government intend to take into account benefits in kind when calculating that qualifying salary? I realise that we have asked a lot of questions today on an opening group of amendments, but I anticipate that if the Minister is able to satisfy us, some of the remaining groups may pass a little more quickly.</p>            </div>

They have been magnificent in their efforts.</p> <p pid="c.1162.0/2">I start by saying to the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Avebury">Lord Avebury</a>, that I made sure that the paper was sent to him on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">Tuesday 7 March</phrase> as it was published, and he was invited to a meeting that his noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Dholakia">Lord Dholakia</a> had with me and the Bill team on Thursday of last week, when we went through all the points that were raised. I apologise if, for whatever reason, that did not get to him or he did not get notification. As I indicated, I tried to keep my promise to make sure that noble Lords received copies as it was published, had a chance to read it, and had meetings with me and my officials to go through it. I will try to answer all the questions that the noble Lord has raised as best I can. If I fail to do so I will ensure that they are answered properly. I would not want anyone in your Lordships' House to think that I did not try, even if I clearly did not succeed.</p> <p pid="c.1162.0/3">The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, raised the question that I want to deal with now about the independent monitor. A letter was sent to him yesterday and e-mailed, which included a suggestion that the noble Lord meet my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Triesman">Lord Triesman</a>, who is concerned to pick up the points that the noble Lord raised. It has taken me a little time to achieve that because my noble friend is often out of the country, but he is very determined to support the noble Lord in the answers that he seeks on that point.</p> <p pid="c.1162.0/4">I point out as I said in the letter that the time delay in producing the report of the independent monitor is not unusual, in the sense that we need a few weeks to sort it out. I understand that there are 59 recommendations made in the report, on some of which we have to seek legal advice. I am keen that we get as much information as possible to the noble Lord.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.1163.1/1">My Lords, it is very common practice in my experience as a <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> that we are allowed as a department&#8212;whatever department it is&#8212;to look at the recommendations and determine our views. That is not uncommon. There is often a lot of appropriate dialogue between the organisations concerned. The few weeks that have passed do not form a substantive delay. Although I accept that the noble Lord will never accept my views on that, I have checked that this is not an unusual or unprecedented delay. I have made the offer about my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Triesman">Lord Triesman</a>, and I am sure that the noble Lord will find him receptive to his points. He will deal with them far more adequately than I could conceivably do at this point.</p> <p pid="c.1163.1/2">I shall deal with as many of the details of the amendments as possible. I am grateful that noble Lords have used the occasion, as I indicated, to talk about the points-based system. Not surprisingly, I am going to focus quite a lot on the administrative review, because in a sense it is at the heart of the acceptance of the points-based system. There was general agreement in your Lordships' House that the points-based system is a good thing; it is substantially better than the system it is replacing, and will enable more transparent, quicker and easier decisions to be made. This is to be welcomed. On that basis, the administrative review has an important part to play.</p> <p pid="c.1163.1/3">On <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> No. 1, tempting though it always is for the Government to take another power unto themselves, I intend to resist doing so. The issues that the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Dholakia">Lord Dholakia</a>, raised around, for example, the unaccompanied asylum-seeker children were well dealt with in Committee. We want to ensure that we capture those areas. Yet it is not right that we need an appeal system for the new points-based system. Issues that are or could be of concern about decisions will be dealt with by administrative review, so the principle of having an appeal system falls. On that basis it would be wrong for the Government to take a power unto themselves, because it would suggest either that we did not have faith in the system, or that we planned to change it, which we do not. If a new system were to be put in place, it should come to your Lordships' House by way of primary legislation, not secondary, because these issues are of such great importance. Tempting though it might be, I will resist that amendment.</p> <p pid="c.1163.1/4">I turn to the commencement amendments also spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. I listened carefully to what the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform said, and it made no comment on that <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a>. The noble Lord will know that I always do what it tells me. Had it told me to do something, I would have done it. It is also important to recognise that we have had a great deal of debate on this, and that we are keen to have a normal commencement provision in the Bill. We wish to do that appropriately. However, the debate around these issues will not end, and I will come on to some of the ways in which we plan to continue the dialogue.</p> <p pid="c.1163.1/5">My substantive comments start on the issues in Amendment No. 2, and specifically answer the questions raised by my noble friend Lady Warwick, which were echoed across your Lordships' House, especially by those involved in education. I will answer her questions so that my response will be firmly on the record, before coming to some of the broader questions. My noble friend sought clarification on four questions, and was kind enough to give me advance notice of them. I wanted advance notice to make sure I answered them properly, not for any other reason.</p> <p pid="c.1163.1/6">The first question was: if I accept that there is an element of subjectivity in the process, will the administrative review be able to consider judgments and points of law, as well as facts? We have said that we want to ensure that there is little scope for subjectivity, which I think my noble friend accepts. If a person is refused, then the entry clearance officer's letter refusing the application will set out exactly why, referring to the criteria for which points are awarded. That is part of our commitment to transparency. Someone who is refused entry clearance under the system will be able to apply for administrative review. The application for review will have to set out which aspect of the decision, as justified in the refusal letter, was incorrect. This encompasses both judgments and points of law, where they are relevant to the specific reason for refusal.</p> <p pid="c.1163.1/7">Secondly, my noble friend was concerned with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_Paper">Command Paper</a> saying that the points-based system would be supported by review where appropriate, and asked whether the administrative review would be available to anyone refused a visa under the new system. Yes, anyone refused entry clearance under the points-based system will be able to apply for administrative review. They have to allege that the decision was made in error on the basis of the entry clearance officer's refusal letter. We are arguing the "appropriateness" point to avoid people who might be being vexatious, or who should have provided evidence in their original application. On the basis that they are saying that they want a review based on the evidence provided, everybody will be entitled to claim.</p> <p pid="c.1163.1/8">Thirdly, on consulting fully on the design of the review, and publishing the final scheme so that we all know what to expect, one of the things that has become clear working with my colleagues in the Home Office, and especially with the officials, is their decision to involve as much as possible a broad range of stakeholders, including those from the education sector&#8212;especially from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_UK">Universities UK</a>&#8212;in the design of the detail of the administrative review programme. I hope all those invited to participate will do so fully, because this is a real opportunity. The full details of the process will be published in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_Service">Diplomatic Service</a> procedures, and will therefore be official government policy.</p> <p pid="c.1163.1/9">Fourthly, if I accept that there will be cases where subjective judgments are involved in reaching a decision, should there be an opportunity to involve a third party&#8212;someone within the Immigration Service, but not involved in the initial decision? The noble Lord, Lord Laird, felt particularly strongly about this as well. We have got to look at the detail of the design of the system, but I accept that in some circumstances there may well be good reason for a person outside the management chain to be involved, whether at regional or national level. As my noble friend will agree, we had a good meeting with some of her vice-chancellors last week, and discussed this at length. We talked about the different circumstances that could exist where one might wish to look outside. Noble Lords will not be surprised that it is particularly relevant in financial issues. For example, we considered areas where there might have been substantive issues of fraud or other kinds of financial irregularity. That might well be such a set of circumstances. I am committed, and have committed the Home Office, to there being such circumstances, though we hope to determine what precisely they are in discussion with stakeholders. The expertise that stakeholders can bring is critical to determine that.</p> <p pid="c.1163.1/10">There will be such circumstances, but they will be limited, because our ambition is for a transparent system. If a mistake is made, it can be overturned quickly&#8212;quickly enough that the person is not affected in their desire to come either to work or to study in this country. It will be quick, but where circumstances seem appropriate&#8212;in a clearly defined way, working with colleagues in the university sector&#8212;there will be the potential for that to be the case. I hope that gives my noble friend the strongest assurance that I can give.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.1166.1/1">My Lords, I will commit the Government to doing that. There is no problem in doing that at all; it would be positively beneficial. As my noble friend will realise from our meeting with the vice-chancellors, there is a lot of expertise and experience, from both employers and the universities, that we want to tap to ensure that we capture the system appropriately. This may be the last Home Office Bill I ever do, but I have no hesitation in committing to that.</p> <p pid="c.1166.1/2">I shall deal with the other issues that have been raised, particularly education. The noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Avebury">Lord Avebury</a>, asked what would be required of institutions as sponsors. Yes, sponsors will be required to report attendance. Also, visas will be granted for specific institutions, so in a sense they will be tied to that institution. Most of the institutions that have been in discussion with colleagues at the Home Office welcome this, because it gives them a greater degree of certainty. Yet there is an issue that needs to be thought about, and again there are discussions going on. We must find some way to be notified when a student has arrived but is believed to have disappeared&#8212;not that they are unwell, but have disappeared. That is important for immigration control, and officials are working with institutions to make sure that we are able to deal with those responsibilities appropriately. There is a general agreement that that is a good thing, as long as we get it right and do not make it onerous.</p> <p pid="c.1166.1/3">Those institutions that conform with their responsibilities can expect to be rated A, and those where we find a less good record will be rated B. That will encourage the Bs to become As, we trust, in the way that they approach it. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, identified the system from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_Paper">Command Paper</a>, and I will not repeat that at this point.</p> <p pid="c.1166.1/4">On the point of the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, about domestic service and slavery, which he linked, we have provisions in the Bill to prevent illegal working. We are concerned to ensure that, wherever possible, labour market needs are met from the UK market and the EU, as the noble Earl will know, so I cannot say anything specifically to him about how we might address that, except that the Home Office takes it seriously. Perhaps we can pick this up later. It should not necessarily hold up the Bill, but it certainly needs to be looked at so that we identify the problems clearly, as he has.</p> <p pid="c.1166.1/5">The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, raised issues about the Chinese community in particular. I note that they met with my noble friend today; I was grateful to receive two copies of the notes of that meeting. I was clearly looking puzzled, as I had not yet seen them. I have not yet had a chance to read them, but I believe it was a constructive meeting and hope it will have addressed some of the concerns raised along the way. I shall try to deal with all the points of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. I hope that she will leap up if I miss any.</p> <p pid="c.1166.1/6">First, there is the question of the &#163;21,000, and what is taken into account. The noble Baroness was helpful in our earlier discussions as to what these issues might be. Indeed, members of different communities have talked to us. On benefits, the obvious example is that somebody comes and is given accommodation, perhaps not only for themselves but for their family, and would therefore expect a lower salary. For the UK, I always think of those involved in the Church, who receive a smaller salary, but get their accommodation provided. That is also true in certain professions across the world of employment. There is a plan to find a way to allow those allowances to be taken into account, but the noble Baroness will accept that we do not want to see that as a substitute for paying people properly. There is a balance to be struck between recognising that people should be in receipt of a proper wage, and recognising the benefits. That balance is being looked at.</p> <p pid="c.1166.1/7">The skills advisory body which will be responsible for monitoring sector shortages in all areas of the economy needs to take into account&#8212;</p>            </div>

It is good to know that the benefit in kind of housing will be taken into account in assessing the value of the overall package provided, but religious orders are international bodies. There is considerable movement between them. This applies to all the different religions. There may occasionally be problems with religious leaders being imported from elsewhere.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.1167.2/1">My Lords, I am sorry but we are on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Reading">Third Reading</a>. I am not going to play Committee at this stage. I was of course going to address the point of the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Avebury">Lord Avebury</a>. I will do it precisely now, and try to guess what the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, might have been saying to me. But I will try to stick to the rules, because we want to get through the rest of the groups of amendments.</p> <p pid="c.1167.2/2">The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, had two questions. One was about the English language skills. There will be an expectation that an appropriate level of English will be spoken. As the right reverend Prelate rightly said, there are issues over earnings. I am referred by my officials to paragraph 95 of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_Paper">Command Paper</a>, which makes clear that we will amend requirements to enable these categories to enter. We will not expect ministers of religion to meet the usual minimum salary requirements under tier 2, for exactly the reasons that the right reverend Prelate would expect.</p> <p pid="c.1167.2/3">The skills advisory body will be able to draw on the Skills for Business Network, and would ensure that bodies representing the ethnic cuisine sector should be engaged with their relevant sector skills councils. We want to ensure&#8212;it is a theme throughout the Bill&#8212;that those involved in small businesses, whether in the provision of the wonderful food that I love to eat or in any other small business, have opportunities to talk about the skill sector shortages within their area appropriately. We take that seriously.</p> <p pid="c.1167.2/4">We also recognise, thinking about chefs in particular&#8212;again, a theme running through the Bill&#8212;that some skilled workers do not have paper qualifications. There is a trade-off within tier 2 against salary. I have already identified that, within salary, we would also take into account benefits and qualifications. In general&#8212;and this generality is not specifically relevant to the particular sector in question&#8212;a higher salary tends to suggest that someone is at an appropriate level of skill for tier 2. That will not always be the case, partly because of extra benefits and partly because of the area. As a generality, however, it is true.</p> <p pid="c.1167.2/5">On lower skilled workers under tier 3, we obviously expect a lot of our requirements to be met either within the UK or the EU, but tier 3 schemes will be set up if it is clear that there is insufficient labour to meet demand. They would be quota-based, operator-led, time-limited, subject to review and from countries where we have a returns policy. Waiters, kitchen porters and others will fall into tier 3 only if the scheme that encompasses them is established. In general, we expect domestic and EU labour to be sufficient for these positions, but we will of course keep this under review to ensure that&#8212;again, in conversation with the skills sector council&#8212;we have clarity over what might be required.</p> <p pid="c.1167.2/6">On the question of chefs and managers with three years' experience and whether they fall within tier 2, the precise model is not finally determined; that is partly because there are still conversations to be had, particularly with small business and those involved in particular sectors. We are hoping to end up with a system where, in the round, people who fail to have points in one area&#8212;because they do not have paper qualifications, for example&#8212;will get points in another area&#8212;because, for example, their salary level is higher&#8212;so that we end up with a balance. We have more work to do, working with our stakeholders, on getting that balance right. The Command Paper makes it clear that we would seek to do that. But that is basically how we would seek to do it, not least because it gives us a clear, transparent system where people can identify for themselves that they have got the right number of points before they apply. That is particularly relevant to the education sector, though not exclusively. One of the issues I hope will be addressed by the new system is that people will know that they have got the right number of points, and will therefore apply. It may cut out those who wish to exploit the system, an issue that we are concerned about for some countries. It also ensures that we increasingly get successful applicants, because they know in advance that they are able to apply. That would be of great value.</p> <p pid="c.1167.2/7">We cannot make the required changes under rules only, because we need primary legislation first. I seem to remember answering that question a couple of times before. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, will feel that I have addressed it. I think I have addressed Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 35 and 36, so it is time for me to sit down. I hope on that basis that the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Dholakia">Lord Dholakia</a>, will feel able to withdraw his <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>.</p>            </div>

I have been reminded by my noble friend Lord Mar and Kellie that I should not make another speech, having already spoken. I shall resist the temptation, and simply comment on some of the issues that the Minister has raised before withdrawing my <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>.</p> <p pid="c.1169.0/2">I was disappointed that we did not have the opportunity to listen fully to the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Laird, on the grounds that&#8212;we were told&#8212;he was making a <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> speech. This is the first time we have had the opportunity to discuss the points system. It is right that we should have discussed it fully, and I do not think the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Reading">Second Reading</a> excuse is the right one in this case. Let us hope that there will be another opportunity, particularly in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>, where there could be a fuller discussion on the basis not only of the Government's own document but&#8212;I very much hope&#8212;of the report of the independent monitor, who obviously has made observations on this matter. When the Home Office publishes that document, it will be clearly demonstrated whether an administration review is needed. If the independent monitor is satisfied, we need not take the case further, but I suspect that the independent monitor has made the type of comments that makes an administrative review very important indeed.</p> <p pid="c.1169.0/3"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> referred to the appeals system. If appeal rights are retained under <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 1, why is that not possible under <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause_4">Clause 4</a>? We have been told about the points system. That system, or any system, can be effective only if it has proper means of review at various stages. I do not believe that any system can be foolproof, which is one reason why we strongly support the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick.</p> <p pid="c.1169.0/4">My second point relates very much to the issues raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. The Minister has given an explanation in relation to the concerns of the Chinese community and other communities in a number of meetings. Let us hope that that can be monitored over time to see that it does not have an adverse effect, especially when we consider the substantial contribution that such communities make to the economy.</p> <p pid="c.1169.0/5">The Minister has rightly explained how the system will work, especially in relation to some of the concessions in the type of administration review that we are looking for. We shall certainly examine it carefully. Obviously there will be an opportunity to put questions to the Minister in the future. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>            </div>

I am grateful to the Minister for giving me the opportunity to use the resources of the Home Office Bill team to have it redrafted in a more appropriate form. I put my thanks to the team on record.</p> <p pid="c.1170.1/2">The drafting that the Home Office Bill team came up with fully meets the objectives of the amendment that I tabled last time. It is important for Parliament to have the guarantee that it will have the chance to hold the Government to account for the whole system of administrative review of applications for leave to enter the UK to study or work&#8212;in other words, a chance to review the operation of the Government's new points system to which we referred in the previous group of amendments. There is also the chance to review the abolition of appeals against refusal of a visa for work and study.</p> <p pid="c.1170.1/3">The amendment requires the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> to lay a report before Parliament within a period of three years that kicks off as soon as the Government bring <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 4 into operation. I chose a period of three years as being what I hope is an appropriate target time, as I want Parliament to be able to review the following matters: first, how the phasing in of the points system is working; secondly, how the training of the entry clearance officers is improved; and, thirdly, how they are coping with what should be a more objective way of allocating visas. The Government have said previously that they expect a roll-out to tier 1 in the next 18 months and then they may go on to tier 2. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> gave us further information about the roll-out time today.</p> <p pid="c.1170.1/4">The Government will have to put in place training and guidance of allocation on points very early, otherwise it will not work. I expect that a debate after three years of the scheme should give a fair reflection of concerns and, one hopes, the successes of the new system. If we had to wait until the scheme has been fully rolled out, we might have to wait for so long that it would be too late to make suggestions about improvements to it, and the rot might have set in, so it is important to get early <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>. As I say, we hope that it will be successful, but experience means that a lot of tweaking always has to be done. I hope that my amendment will give the chance for that tweaking to take place at the right time.</p> <p pid="c.1170.1/5">The amendment would require the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> to set out an extensive range of information in the report, including the number of applications made in the period under review, the number refused, and the number granted after initial refusal was reversed as a result of further consideration by the administrative review procedure that the Government had put in place. I hope that proposed new paragraphs (e), (f) and (g) will give Parliament the opportunity to debate more generally how the system itself is working, and the reactions to it of both the users and the staff operating the system, including the views of the entry clearance monitor. I beg to move.</p>            </div>

The noble Baroness rightly put me on the spot suggesting that the fabulous word "effluxion" was perhaps not in keeping with the Government's or my stated aim of using simple English where simple English will do. Parliamentary counsel watched me squirm and recognised, as he said, that this was not a term in common usage. Therefore, I propose that we take out the word and insert "passage" which tells everyone what we seek to do, with grateful thanks to the noble Baroness.

I can only hope that the parliamentary draftsman has made a note to substitute "passage" for "effluxion" where it occurs in other statutes and statutory instruments, except perhaps where reference is made to the exercise of options as in the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992, or the expiration of tenancies or licences as in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilities_Act_2000">Utilities Act 2000</a>, or of contracts of employment as in the Schools Standards and Framework Act 1998.

First, it remains concerned that civil penalties and repeat checks on certain employees subject to immigration control could be divisive and is not in the spirit of race relations legislation; and that civil penalties may make employers less likely to employ legal migrants or anyone, including UK-born ethnic minorities, perceived to have an immigration issue.</p> <p pid="c.1173.4/4">Those points were raised properly at <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill.

What work do the Government intend to carry out as soon as the Bill receives <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Assent">Royal Assent</a> to address these concerns and resolve any unintended consequences of the introduction of the civil penalty? For example, do they have plans to set up regular meetings with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRE">CRE</a> to monitor any problems? The second issue it raised refers to the fact that <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 23 states that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> must consult the CRE and consider representations before placing the code of practice before Parliament although the code of practice can be laid before the House with or without modifications to reflect the representations. The CRE points out that it is unclear how the new code will relate to the 2005 CRE statutory code of practice on race equality and employment. What work are the Government now doing to see how the two codes will be reconciled before they place the code of practice before Parliament? I beg to move.</p>            </div>

The consultation will be undertaken in accordance with the better regulation executives code of practice on consultation which sets out the basic principles for effective government consultations. Therefore, the consultation will last for a minimum of 12 weeks. The responses will be analysed with particular attention paid to possible new approaches to the questions consulted on, further evidence given on the impact of the proposals, and the strength of feeling among particular groups. A report including a summary of responses received during the course of the consultation will be produced and published at the end of the consultation and a copy placed in both Houses and published on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IND">IND</a> website. We followed this practice in relation to the legal working measures in the 2004 order and will make sure that we do the same now. I hope that we have made it clear that we are receptive to comments made during the passage of the Bill. The same spirit will apply to the consultation exercise.</p> <p pid="c.1174.1/2">The draft code of practice under <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 19 was initially published in October. It has been revised and republished in the light of comments made in Committee. It contains the following changes: a revised definition of illegal employee to reflect the government amendments tabled on Report in this House in relation to cancellation, curtailment and revocation of leave; it explicitly states that consideration of the fairness of the financial penalty to be imposed must be made by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> together with the proportionality of the amount; that if objection to a civil penalty is made the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> must consider evidence as to the effect of the civil penalty on the viability of the employer's business; and it explicitly states that consideration will be given to requests from employers that payment of a civil penalty may be made in monthly instalments over a period of 12 months. As I have indicated, the draft code will be subject to full public consultation and may well be amended further in the light of the results of that consultation.</p> <p pid="c.1174.1/3">I turn to the issues raised by the noble Baroness regarding the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRE">CRE</a>. The CRE had sight of the original draft before it was published. We welcome its active participation in the consultation exercise, in particular over compatibility issues between Clause 23, the code and the 2005 CRE statutory code of practice on race equality. For example, the CRE might need to think about whether it needs to amend its statutory code in light of the Bill. We discussed with the CRE the fact that civil penalties were coming before the code was published. I hope that there will be a chance now to consider that again. It is a member of the illegal working stakeholder group chaired by my <a href="/glossary/?gl=172" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to another MP of..." class="glossary">right honourable friend</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_McNulty">Tony McNulty</a>. We shall work with the group on the implementation of civil penalties, thereby ensuring that it is indeed participating fully. We shall work with it in the industrial tribunal system and researches to monitor compliance with the statutory non-discrimination code.</p> <p pid="c.1174.1/4">I hope that that meets the commitment I made and that on that basis the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>.</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 34 does not breach the Sewel convention. As noble Lords will be aware, Clause 34 makes it an offence to fail to comply with a police request for passenger, crew, service or freight information under Clauses 32 or 33. Carriers will commit an offence unless they can prove that they had a reasonable excuse for not supplying the information. Passengers and crew members will also be guilty of an offence if they fail to provide information to the carrier without reasonable excuse.</p> <p pid="c.1176.4/2">To comply with the Sewel convention, the police in Scotland can only require passenger, crew, service or freight information for police purposes that are or relate to reserved matters within the meaning of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_Act_1998">Scotland Act 1998</a>. The police in England, Wales and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> can require passenger, crew, service or freight information for any police purposes. The reason for this difference&#8212;I am conscious that the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, and the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, are present in the Chamber&#8212;is that police powers are in general a matter devolved to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a></p> <p pid="c.1176.4/3">A concern has recently arisen that Clause 34 is insufficiently clear as to whether a passenger or crew member who refuses to provide information to a carrier in Scotland in response to a request from a police constable in England, Wales or Northern Ireland for police purposes, would have committed an offence under English or Scots law. If the request had been made for police purposes, which would, in Scotland, not be police purposes in relation to reserved matters, and the failure to comply was an offence committed under Scots law, this would mean that a UK statute would be creating an offence in Scottish law in relation to matters that are not reserved&#8212;namely, general police purposes&#8212;thereby breaching the Sewel convention. This amendment seeks to put the matter beyond doubt.</p> <p pid="c.1176.4/4">With that rather technical explanation, which is necessary for <i>Hansard </i>purposes, I beg to move.</p>            </div>

These powers are being extended to domestic flights starting and ending in the UK under <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 9 of the Police and Justice Bill. I would be grateful if the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> could say whether this procedure of amending one Bill in another when both are going through Parliament at the same time has ever been adopted before, and why it was necessary to do that in this case. It could not be that the Government decided that it was necessary to have information about domestic flights only when this House had already considered this Bill on Report, because the Police and Justice Bill was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-25">25 January</phrase>.</p> <p pid="c.1177.0/2">Whatever the explanation, if the carriers have to provide <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNR">PNR</a> information in advance, any failure on the part of the operator to comply with Clause 32(2) or Clause 33(2) would be inadvertent, and the operator would have a reasonable excuse. The data might not have been entered, or there might have been a fault in the software, and the penalties would not bite. On Report, we referred to my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Carlile">Lord Carlile</a>'s strictures on lax security at small airports, as reported at col. 565, and the Minister slid out of answering that question directly by saying that there were resource implications of using these powers to monitor all flights at all airports. She then wrote to my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Dholakia">Lord Dholakia</a> on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-23">23 February</phrase> to say that under the e-borders programme, the request for PNR information would be made for all scheduled and charter flights and all cargo services arriving in or departing from the UK. I presume that, under the Police and Justice Bill, that is now to be extended to domestic flights. I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm whether the operators have been consulted on that, and whether they have agreed to these new requirements.</p> <p pid="c.1177.0/3">On Report, my noble friend Lord Dholakia also raised the question of rendition, which took the Minister by surprise. She did not appear to grasp the relevance of what he was saying to the question of how passenger information might be used to prevent or deter serious crime. Since then we have learnt from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Ingram">Adam Ingram</a>'s reply to my <a href="/glossary/?gl=172" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to another MP of..." class="glossary">right honourable friend</a> the leader of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> that at least 14 <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA">CIA</a> flights landed at Northolt and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brize_Norton">Brize Norton</a>, although the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> said previously that he was unaware&#8212;</p>            </div>

If I may, I shall reflect on it. The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, was, I think, referring to whether there was a way to ensure that what is already in statute about the Government here and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a> might be dealt with more easily. That is a valid point on which I shall reflect.</p> <p pid="c.1179.3/2">As I said to the noble Earl, the Motion did not go through the Scottish Parliament because it did not need to. The basis on which the measure is drafted means that we do not need to do that. If I may, I shall explain that to the noble Earl separately.</p> <p pid="c.1179.3/3">The noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Avebury">Lord Avebury</a>, knows perfectly well that if I can address his concern, I will do so. I intervened because I hope that the noble Lord will recognise that my briefing from the Home Office is entirely to support the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> before your Lordships' House. He widened the debate substantially. I do not believe that I have done anything other than seek to address every concern that he has put before your Lordships' House, both within and outside this Chamber, and I shall continue to do so. I shall read with great care the points that the noble Lord has raised and ensure that he receives an answer on this occasion, as on every other.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.1179.6/1">My Lords, in this group of amendments we return to the question of who should be authorised to arrest, detain and search passengers arriving at United Kingdom ports of entry, or the juxtaposed control force at Calais and Dunkirk, which began operations on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-01">1 March 2004</phrase>, and in Brussels at the Gare du Midi, Paris, Lille and Calais Fr&#233;thun, for passengers on Eurostar, since early 2004. Your Lordships may recall that we expressed particular concern about the delegation of those powers to private contractors at the juxtaposed controls, in particular, where the person exercising the power will be a foreign citizen subject to foreign <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> and to only intermittent oversight by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Inspector_of_Prisons">Chief Inspector of Prisons</a> and the Children's Commissioner.</p> <p pid="c.1179.6/2">When the Chief Inspector of Prisons appeared before Sub-Committee F of your Lordships' <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Committee">European Union Committee</a> on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February</phrase>, she said that she had just produced a report on the Calais arrangements. She did not know what others were envisaged, but she had the power to inspect Calais and had just done so. Will the noble Baroness confirm that the chief inspector and the Children's Commissioner have the power to go into all the other juxtaposed control points that I have mentioned?</p> <p pid="c.1179.6/3">The chief inspector went on to say that she did not believe that there were sufficient measures in place to take account of the special needs of children in terms of the decision to detain, the effect of detention or removal and what happens afterwards. She expressed the view that the Children's Commissioner also had concerns about the treatment of children and what happens when they are removed.</p> <p pid="c.1179.6/4">The chief inspector says that she is not satisfied with the arrangements for Calais and that she has not looked at them anywhere else. So I think that we were justified in raising those concerns both in Committee and on Report. We understand that the Children's Commissioner has been to Calais and that he has been in touch with his French opposite number. Is the noble Baroness satisfied with the arrangements made for vetting staff to be employed by private contractors? Does she know whether there is an effective sex offenders register in France, such as will ensure that no person is employed in a capacity that will give him those powers?</p> <p pid="c.1179.6/5">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.1179.6/6">"All persons will be checked for the existence of a criminal record in France. These records contain all charges or other issues around sex offences".&#8212;[<a href="/search/?pop=1&s=date:20060207+column:577+section:lords"><i>Hansard</i>, 7/2/06; col. 577</a>.]<i> </i></p> <p pid="c.1179.6/7">We are not yet in a position to assess the merits of the French system of child protection, but there have been criticisms of some aspects of immigration detention at ports by the French from the D&#233;fenseure des Enfants. In particular, she criticised the treatment of children held at Roissy airport in January 2005 and, just last month, she received a letter from the Collectif de Soutien d'Urgence aux R&#233;fugi&#233;s about the plight of unaccompanied children from abroad in Calais. Previously, we spoke about the controls at Calais, but there are other places in France where there are juxtaposed controls. In addition, we should not overlook the Gare du Midi, in Brussels, where completely different arrangements may be in place. We know nothing about whether there is a Children's Commissioner in Belgium or whether there are arrangements for ensuring that people employed at the Gare du Midi are subject to sufficient controls as we would see them in England.</p> <p pid="c.1179.6/8"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> said in her letter to me of <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-23">23 February</phrase> that, since the control over who accesses the UK control zone in northern France is solely a matter for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UKIS">UKIS</a>, we would extend the right of access to the Children's Commissioner. I repeat the question: do the Children's Commissioner and the chief inspector have the same rights in the other control zones in France and Belgium?</p> <p pid="c.1179.6/9">The Minister also said in her letter that the code of conduct applying to contractors' staff with those powers would be the same as it is for detention custody officers, but that code was part of the operational policy standards and procedures, which are agreed between the contractor and the detention services, which,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.1179.6/10">"follow the principles of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PACE">PACE</a> but cannot be placed in the public domain for reasons of commercial confidentiality".</p> <p pid="c.1179.6/11">I want to challenge that statement; this is an additional reason why we are wary of the use of private contractors. We do not agree that commercial confidentiality should be used in that way. As long as those services are carried out by public servants, we know what code of conduct they must observe but, now that the operations are being privatised, the code is secret and we must rely on a general assurance about the principles on which it is based.</p> <p pid="c.1179.6/12">The exemption of information provided in confidence to a public authority under <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_41">Section 41</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_2000">Freedom of Information Act 2000</a> is not absolute. It can be overridden under <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_2">Section 2</a> if the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption, as it manifestly does in this case. After all our debates in which concern has been expressed on all sides about the use of private contractors to arrest, search and detain people, including children of any age, whether accompanied or not, I cannot imagine a clearer case where the disclosure of information would be more essential if confidence in the proposals is to be sustained. I invite the Minister to reconsider the matter in that light, giving her notice that, if necessary, I will take the matter to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Commissioner">Information Commissioner</a>.</p> <p pid="c.1179.6/13">The fact is that neither Parliament nor the media nor <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGOs">NGOs</a> will be able to scrutinise what happens in France or Belgium, and it is not likely that if there are irregularities members of the public will draw our attention to them, as often happens in this country. The magnitude of the powers being given to private contractors to deprive people of their liberty is being acknowledged by making the exercise of those powers subject to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Police_Complaints_Commission">Independent Police Complaints Commission</a>, although it would be a resourceful complainant who discovered the existence of that right and managed to log a complaint during the short time for which he would be detained.</p> <p pid="c.1179.6/14">As the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, commented in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Committee">Grand Committee</a>, those are powers more extensive than those that Parliament gave to uniformed community support officers under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Reform_Act_2002">Police Reform Act 2002</a>, after what the noble and learned Lord the <a href="/glossary/?gl=263" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Chancellor" class="glossary">Lord Chancellor</a> described as a long and hard debate. This is too far. I beg to move.</p>            </div>

Before I come to it I would like to say to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> that she was unable to guess what was in my mind in the course of the first group of amendments. Perhaps I may briefly say to her that it was the point of the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Avebury">Lord Avebury</a>, about competence in English for people seeking visas to enter this country. That point is well known to the Home Office and is extremely relevant to imams of the Muslim faith who are imported to this country to hold particular posts here. It is important because they need to be able to relate to the authorities and to society in general and they need to be able to advise their faithful on how to relate. I hope that that point will not be overlooked.</p> <p pid="c.1182.1/2">I turn to Amendment No. 8. This is the first time that we come to the important point of a drafting nature about the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> acting only when he is satisfied. We will come to it again later. It avoids the sloppy drafting about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> being required only to think. Having said that, the noble Baroness will appreciate that the amendment brings in only modest differences from what is with us in the Bill's existing text. The important thing about it from a practical point of view is that it provides a safeguard for what happens when persons who may be vulnerable adults in the language employed by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR">UNHCR</a>&#8212;or they may be children&#8212;are found in the course of searching ships, aircraft and vehicles.</p> <p pid="c.1182.1/3">I am sure that the whole House will remember the terrible incident at Dover when a lot of Chinese people fell out of a lorry having been frozen to death or suffocated. Very awkward situations can arise, which is why a high standard should be required of those who are undertaking such tasks. Finally, as far as I know the Government have given no reasons for a lowering of the standard to be expected of the people undertaking these tasks. So on all of those grounds I trust that the amendment will commend itself to the Government.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.1183.1/1">My Lords, I am grateful to noble Lords for raising the issues. I could not agree more about the principle of having high standards. That includes, as the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, said, making sure that people are competent and understanding about dealing with children. The noble Earl and I discussed that point earlier today: they are potentially the most vulnerable children.</p> <p pid="c.1183.1/2">I turn to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, about an earlier <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>. I read his mind sufficiently to have obtained the answer but I did not read it out, which was a fundamental flaw in what happened. As he said, it was about ministers of religion in tier two being required to show evidence of English language skills. They will have to speak an appropriate level of English. That is a requirement. I apologise; but at least I got 50 per cent of the way there, if not the whole way.</p> <p pid="c.1183.1/3">I do not accept Amendment No. 8 because it is not necessary. We have already said that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> has to consider each individual's level of training and suitability before issuing authorisation. The certification in a sense does not add anything to the process but I take what is underneath the amendment to be the opportunity to talk again about some of the principles within the legislation. We have to begin from an understanding that we are not delegating responsibility for these activities and the proposals will ensure that the borders receive additional resources. The operation of the UK border remains in the hands of the UK immigration authority. Noble Lords will recall that we spent some time on Report and particularly in Committee talking about the fact that it is possible to consider certain jobs to be carried out by people outside the Immigration Service and the type of expertise that will be necessary. That led us in a sense to being sure that we had the right level of expertise within the contract being given out by my <a href="/glossary/?gl=172" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to another MP of..." class="glossary">right honourable friend</a> the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> and ensuring that we do not hand over responsibility to private contractors. We retain responsibility and people are properly trained and understand the functions and roles with which they will be concerned.</p> <p pid="c.1183.1/4">That is a fundamental part of what is being considered here. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, raised issues about language, which I will address before I come to talk about children. If the person detained does not speak English, they will be transferred to the offices of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Immigration_Service">UK Immigration Service</a>, where there are facilities for the language line&#8212;a 24-hour translation and interpreting service. So their needs will be met in that way. Equally, a contractor who is brought in must be able to speak sufficient English to be able to converse with the officers of the UK Immigration Service, under whose supervision they will operate, and to be able to carry out their functions properly. It is inherent in the requirement that you have to be fit and proper for the purpose.</p> <p pid="c.1183.1/5">We talked in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Committee">Grand Committee</a> about the strict safeguards that will apply to the recruitment and the work of the contractors. These include security checks, which will be undertaken in both the UK and France. The training will include cultural awareness, race relations, the legal framework, interpersonal skills and care for vulnerable detainees, including&#8212;perhaps I would say especially&#8212;unaccompanied minors. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_French">The French</a> police will screen all contractors who work on the post, and will check criminal records, including those for sex offences. As noble Lords know, no freight searching is envisaged anywhere else other than at Calais port. There is no freight at the Gare du Midi, so that is not relevant in this context.</p> <p pid="c.1183.1/6">The noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Avebury">Lord Avebury</a>, asked about the inspection carried out by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Inspector_of_Prisons">Chief Inspector of Prisons</a> and the statutory right to inspect places of detention. Of course there is a statutory right there. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Children">The Children</a>'s Commissioner does not have a statutory right, but would be welcomed. In fact, an invitation has already been issued to him. He has not, to my knowledge, been to Calais. I will check that; I am pretty certain that he has not been, but he is invited to visit to have a look at what is going on there.</p> <p pid="c.1183.1/7">I also indicated on Report to the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, that my <a href="/glossary/?gl=173" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to an MP of the..." class="glossary">honourable friend</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_McNulty">Tony McNulty</a> would meet the Children's Commissioner to discuss these clauses, and he has done so. The Children's Commissioner wanted further information, which has been sent to him. We have also invited him to view the Immigration Service, as I said, and to look at the care of unaccompanied children at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport">Heathrow Airport</a>, which may be an area of particular interest.</p> <p pid="c.1183.1/8">As the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said, I told him in a letter that we will not award any contract to private contractors until the Bill is ratified, but we want to identify a contractor through an open and fair competition that will require any potential bidder to submit references and their work-related history for verification. We further propose that a contract will be awarded on the same basis as that issued to detention custody officers. Firms will have to operate in accordance with their operational policy standard and procedures that are agreed with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IND">IND</a>'s detention services department.</p> <p pid="c.1183.1/9">I note what the noble Lord said about what I said about commercial confidentiality. It is very common practice to retain commercially sensitive information, and we will of course put all that we can into the public domain. The noble Lord will probably know that I have responsibility for the Freedom of Information Act in my department, so I am very familiar with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_2">Section 2</a> and some of the issues that it raises, as well as with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Thomas">Richard Thomas</a>, who does a sterling job as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Commissioner">Information Commissioner</a>. I am very happy to talk further to the noble Lord about this, but I am clear that commercial confidentiality is always relevant. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, is right that that lends credence to his view that it should be kept in the public sphere, but we are trying to be as open and transparent about the work that the contractors will be doing. We are trying not to usurp the work of the Immigration Service or to de-professionalise the work of the professionals, but to recognise the particular functions that can be undertaken within a very clear set of guidelines and to a clear contract. Expectations will be high, and I think that we can reassure the noble Lord that there will be absolute clarity about the vetting of each individual. We will continue to talk about that because of my particular interest in freedom of information.</p> <p pid="c.1183.1/10">I take what my noble friend Lady Turner said about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee_on_Human_Rights">Joint Committee on Human Rights</a>. There is no desire, as I have said, to have anything other than a very professional service. I believe that by bringing in contractors to carry out particular functions, we can professionalise the service even more by allowing those who need to concentrate on particular issues and particular aspects of the work to do so more effectively.</p> <p pid="c.1183.1/11">I want to devote a little time to talking about children, a subject which the noble Earl and I have returned to over the years, often late at night; indeed, we will return to it later in our consideration of the Bill. I have been very grateful for the noble Earl's time. It is important to ensure that we give careful consideration to issues involving children. As I said to the noble Earl, the Immigration and Nationality Department has the Children's Champion, which is new. We will ensure that the contractors' training is appropriate and that children who need support from social services get it as quickly as possible. These children could be very vulnerable. If they are unaccompanied, they may even try to run away, and we will ensure that people know how to handle them properly, that we lessen their fears, and that they get the proper support as quickly as possible. We will involve the Children's Commissioner, as we have sought to do already, but, as the noble Earl and I discussed a few hours ago, I am conscious, as he pointed out to me, that the Children's Commissioner has a huge amount to do, so we will do this sensitively and in collaboration with him so that he feels he has the right level of information and involvement.</p> <p pid="c.1183.1/12">I make a commitment that I will keep the noble Earl in touch with those issues and that we will consider any questions that need to be further addressed. I absolutely commit that the Government are very alive to the sensitivities, especially around children, that have been raised. We want to make sure that this contract is awarded properly; that there is transparency to ensure that that is the case; and that we are very sensitive to ensuring that this job is done well by contractors, thus enabling the professionalism of the Immigration Service to continue within and under their control. I hope that that will enable the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.1186.0/1">My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for her assurances, which, to some extent, repeated those that she has already given. But she went beyond them in two respects, for which I am grateful, particularly that the Children's Commissioner would be welcome at any of these points abroad. He will no doubt want to take that up in due course. The noble Baroness reinforced what she had already said about the training of staff. It has occurred to me to wonder whether training in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calais_Frethun">Calais Frethun</a> would be in French or English. She said that anyone who did not speak English would be transferred immediately to immigration control, so that the language line would be employed. I do not think that we knew that before. If I understand the noble Baroness correctly, although persons other than the Immigration Service could arrest someone, as soon as they discover that that person cannot speak any English, they would not have the continuing power to detain which is provided for in this <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a>. Responsibility would have to be handed over the Immigration Service, so that the language line could be used.</p> <p pid="c.1186.0/2">I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her offer of further discussions on commercial confidentiality, because I think that it is bogus to say that the code of conduct, which, as already has been said, equates with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PACE">PACE</a> code of conduct in terms of principles, would in any way jeopardise the commercial rights of the firm concerned. The inference that I draw is that if the code was in the public domain, someone else could copy it. Surely, if that were the case, emulation between different contractors who are bidding to carry out those services would mean that higher standards would ultimately be achieved. Either that or the code of conduct is sufficiently constrained by the necessity to conform with the PACE principles. There would be no distinction between those that were drafted by different contractors providing these services. We are not asking for everything to be disclosed, only the code of conduct, which it is very reasonable to request bearing in mind the enormous importance of the code of conduct to the treatment of vulnerable adults and children. At this stage, we will not get any further with this discussion, but I look forward to conversations with the noble Baroness offline. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>.</p>            </div>

Unfortunately, there was insufficient time, and the Minister and the Whip agreed that this matter could be raised at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Reading">Third Reading</a>. Again, there was ample discussion on this matter in Committee. I do not intend to elaborate much on that, other than to express our concern. Perhaps these are the most serious items in this legislation.</p> <p pid="c.1187.1/2">Our concern is that when taking a decision to deprive someone of a right of abode or citizenship, the highest standard of test must be established, rather than a lowering of standards. We have been greatly assisted in our <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> by the briefing from the Immigration Law Practitioners' Association. The purpose of the amendment is simply to retain the current test for deprivation of citizenship; that is, having done something which is seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the UK or a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Overseas_Territory">British Overseas Territory</a>. To date, the Minister has coupled denials that this is sufficiently broad with examples that fall fairly and squarely within it. The consequential amendment is necessary because line 20 becomes the first reference to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Nationality_Act_1981">British Nationality Act 1981</a> in the Act.</p> <p pid="c.1187.1/3">Amendment No. 13 would apply to the new powers to deprive people of the right of abode the same test as is currently used and we suggest should continue to be used for deprivation of citizenship. That effectively means the existing test of having done something seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the UK or a British overseas territory. This meets the criticisms of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> that were voiced by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee_on_Human_Rights">Joint Committee on Human Rights</a>.</p> <p pid="c.1187.1/4">Further, this amendment will take out the subjective test involved with the phrase "the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> thinks"&#8212;this came up in an argument earlier on&#8212;and replace it with the phrase "is satisfied" as for deprivation of citizenship. The Bill contains "is satisfied that", even in the rare clauses that do not amend previous legislation, for example Section 33(2), 33(7) and 36(5). Any suggestion that this is mere plain English is obviously treated by us with extreme caution. I beg to move.</p>            </div>

As the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Dholakia">Lord Dholakia</a>, said, they were not taken because it was rather late.</p> <p pid="c.1187.2/2">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> to <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 56 would preserve the current law that a person has to do something seriously prejudicial to UK interests or an overseas territory before being deprived of British citizenship. As the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, explained, a similar amendment is proposed on the deprivation of the right to abode.</p> <p pid="c.1187.2/3">The effect of Clauses 56 and 57 if they are not amended is that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a> need no longer be satisfied that an individual has done something seriously prejudicial to UK interests. He needs only to believe that deprivation is conducive to the public good. This is a much easier test to satisfy and is drawn from the test which must be satisfied in order to deport a person, subject to immigration control. A further effect could be that such a person could be stripped of citizenship and thereafter be at risk of deportation. This is a very serious matter for the individual concerned.</p> <p pid="c.1187.2/4">The current test for deprivation of citizenship has been in force only since April 2003. Why is it necessary to make it far easier now to deprive individuals of citizenship? This drop in the standard of protection needs to be understood in the context that deportation itself is the most severe form of removal from the UK. The order remains in force after a person has been lawfully removed and prevents a person from returning lawfully until such time as it is revoked. This is a very important issue and it is not good enough for the test to be too general and subjective, which it is at the moment.</p> <p pid="c.1187.2/5">Similar arguments relate to the removal of the right of abode. I do not intend to make a long speech as we are at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Reading">Third Reading</a>, but I hope the Minister will seriously consider my comments or those of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, because, for the individuals concerned, these are matters of extreme gravity.</p>            </div>

The case for widening the power of deprivation so that it can be exercised when the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> considers it would be conducive to the public good has not been made out. The proposed test is one which has been used to deport or exclude foreign nationals since the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_1971">Immigration Act 1971</a>. The Government are equating migration control with deprivation of citizenship. We think these things are completely different.</p> <p pid="c.1188.0/2">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> said various things in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Committee">Grand Committee</a> and on Report about the new test. In Grand Committee she said,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.1188.0/3">"it is fundamentally wrong for those who engage in such activities"&#8212; meaning the "unacceptable behaviours" which has now been covered by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>&#8212;</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.1188.0/5">"and who have rights of residence elsewhere to be allowed to acquire and shelter behind their British citizenship".&#8212;[<i>Official Report</i>, 19/1/06; col. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GC">GC</a> 274.]</p> <p pid="c.1188.0/6">We are talking not about acquisition but about people who are existing dual nationals who have been deprived of their <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality">British nationality</a>.</p> <p pid="c.1188.0/7"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> also said of this provision that it was intended for use against <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Hamza">Abu Hamza</a> and how bad cases make bad law. Abu Hamza, who is a dual British/Jordanian citizen, was gaoled in February for seven years for inciting to murder and racial hatred, and is wanted on charges of trying to set up a terrorist training camp in Oregon. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-19">19 January</phrase> in Grand Committee the Minister referred to the effect of this <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> on Abu Hamza before he was convicted. However, the <i>Companion</i> makes it clear that the <i>sub judice</i> rule would have applied equally if it had been after his conviction while he still had a right of appeal. I have been personally warned in writing by the Clerks not to refer to a particular case under consideration by the courts, so I wonder whether the Minister sought the leave of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a> to refer to Abu Hamza under paragraph 4.58 of the <i>Companion</i> or how otherwise she justifies the reference she made to that particular case.</p> <p pid="c.1188.0/8">Perhaps I may leave that and make a general comment. First, when a person has been convicted of a very serious offence and an extradition warrant in another jurisdiction has been issued against him, is it a matter of immediate concern whether by depriving him of his citizenship we can send him back to his country of origin? Secondly, if incitement to murder and to racial hatred is not contrary to the vital interests of the United Kingdom, then what is? The use of this wording has never been tested in the courts, but the Minister has said that she knows of cases where the behaviour of dual citizens is not a danger to the United Kingdom, but is nevertheless completely unacceptable. In other words, the Government would interpret the power in new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_42">Section 42</a> as allowing them to deprive someone of his British citizenship on a subjective assessment of his behaviour, whether criminal or not. That is indeed how they have always used the powers to deport under <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_3">Section 3</a>(5) of the 1971 Act. A person I know was arrested on terrorist charges in September 1985 and was acquitted after two trials and 15 months in custody. He was then deported in December 1986 using the 1971 Act powers. We do not want that type of kangaroo justice extended into the area of citizenship.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.1190.0/1">My Lords, perhaps I may begin with the comments of the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Avebury">Lord Avebury</a>. He has implied that I may have said something inappropriate. I did not check with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a> and I am told by the Clerks that the rules governing <i>sub judice</i> do not apply to <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a>, so the rule would not apply in that context. Further, in everything I say I ensure that I am given proper legal advice. If the noble Lord wishes to pursue whether I have behaved inappropriately, he is of course at liberty to do so. I recommend that he takes it up with the Leader of the House. However, as I was referring to a particular case where the powers that exist were being used and had been dealt with in 2003, I do not think I am in breach of anything. However, the noble Lord will make his own mind up about it.</p> <p pid="c.1190.0/2">I agree with all those noble Lords who said that citizenship is seen, rightly, as a fundamental element of national and individual identity. We do not grant British citizenship lightly; nor do we contemplate deprivation of British citizenship lightly. The present criterion, referred to by noble Lords, is that the person has done something seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the United Kingdom or an overseas territory. It is a very high test. When noble Lords invited me to indicate how often it had been used, I indicated that it had not been used because it was indeed a very high test. Our experience, on looking back over cases from the past two or three years, is that the test is too high and the hurdles too great.</p> <p pid="c.1190.0/3">There are people living here who are&#8212;or have been in the past&#8212;war criminals, radical preachers and other activists who seek to provoke others, as well as those involved in serious and organised crime. Their activities are incompatible with the holding of British citizenship and their presence here is very much against the interests of this country and its people. For example, an individual involved in the large-scale trafficking of young women from eastern Europe for prostitution would not be covered under the current test, but could be under the test we are proposing. We are concerned that the holding of citizenship precludes the exclusion or deportation from the United Kingdom of such people. They are very few in number, but are none the less significant. We have various measures we can take against them. Our intention, of course, is to prosecute wherever possible, but we should also consider our options under immigration powers and elsewhere.</p> <p pid="c.1190.0/4">Where one of these people holds citizenship, we will consider its removal to enable other actions, such as deportation or exclusion, to be pursued on the basis&#8212;as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said&#8212;of their dual nationality. Replacing the currently seriously prejudicial test with a conducive test would greatly facilitate our ability to deprive of citizenship and enable other effective action to be taken. That is the basis upon which we have put forward the proposals within this legislation. As I indicated at previous stages, the Government take their responsibilities in this area seriously, and we believe it is right that the changes should be made. On that basis, I hope the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>.</p>            </div>

It was my intention to divide the House on this particular matter, but neither the government nor the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> Benches would forgive me if I were to do so at this late stage. I do not intend to go any further other than simply to say this to the Minister: having attended some of the citizenship ceremonies that are being held up and down the country, I wonder if the Minister could give some thought not only to telling people what citizenship is all about, but also how citizenship could be taken away when they are disloyal to this country? I think we can put that argument forward in order that people are aware of their obligations and duties. I do not think we will get any further. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> has been kind enough to give a lot of leeway in a number of previous amendments.

This is a rather complicated set of amendments, although the arguments for them are really quite simple. The justification for the amendment is that it attempts to exempt babies, certain categories of minor and British nationals without the right of abode, from the good character test in applications for registration by entitlement. <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 58 allows for the good character test to be extended to applications for registration as a British national. Currently this is applied only to naturalisation applications.</p> <p pid="c.1191.3/2">Registration by entitlement recognises that there are certain people who have a right to become British under nationality law. Naturalisation, on the other hand, is only ever discretionary. The distinction between the two is therefore important. To import a lower standard of good character removes that distinction.</p> <p pid="c.1191.3/3">People who will be affected in the main by the clause are minor children under 18. However, no justification has been advanced on public policy grounds. The good character test here goes far beyond terrorism. Although in appropriate cases there may be justification for denying someone <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality">British nationality</a>, the good character test is too wide for that justification. A more appropriate power would in that event be that of "seriously prejudicial".</p> <p pid="c.1191.3/4">Sections 3(2) and 17(2) of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Nationality_Act_1981">British Nationality Act 1981</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_6">Article 6</a>(3) of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> (British Nationality) Order 1986 all concern entitlement to registration for babies within 12 months of the date of their birth. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> said in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Committee">Grand Committee</a>:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.1191.3/5">"Concern has been expressed that we would extend the rule to very young children or even babies . . . Of course, the rules would state that that would be a silly thing to do, and it would not happen".&#8212;[<i>Official Report</i>, 19/1/06; col. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GC">GC</a> 279.]</p> <p pid="c.1191.3/6">Sections 1(3), 1(4), 15(3), 15(4) and 17(5) of the British Nationality Act 1981 all concern registration by entitlement of minors. I welcome the Government's amendment to the effect that children under the age of 10 should not be subject to the good character test under this provision. We shall debate that amendment later. However, it appears none the less that babies born to British parents overseas who would have to register within one year of birth as British still remain on the face of the Bill, even though other categories of babies have been deleted from it. That does not make much sense. In order to be consistent the amendment proposes that that category is deleted from the Bill also.</p> <p pid="c.1191.3/7">Although I welcome the Government's amendment I nevertheless remain concerned that children as young as 10 will be subject to a good character test. These minors have an existing right that is recognised under nationality law to become British. There is no justification for them to be subject to a good character test. We are concerned that a case might arise of a teenager brought up in the UK for some years who is unable to register on the basis of entitlement because of having received an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASBO">ASBO</a> or attended a public meeting deemed to be glorifying terrorism or some other subject. We seek assurance on that point. Children who have been troubled teenagers are not automatically bad adults or bad citizens. I beg to move.</p>            </div>

I agree with what she said about the good character test as it applies to minors.</p> <p pid="c.1192.0/2">I also welcome the concession that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> made that children under 10 will not be subject to a good character test. However, I question whether the age of criminal responsibility&#8212;which the noble Baroness mentioned at some point during our proceedings in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Committee">Grand Committee</a> or on Report; I cannot remember which&#8212;is a satisfactory criterion to use.</p> <p pid="c.1192.0/3">The 1981 Act does not give a definition of good character. The nearest I can come to it is a Written Answer by Mr McNulty in <a href="/glossary/?gl=112" title="During a debate members of the House of Commons traditionally refer to the..." class="glossary">another place</a> in which he said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.1192.0/4">"As part of the naturalisation process a police record check is made into all applicants. A check is also made on older minors".</p> <p pid="c.1192.0/5">I do not know whether he meant that, at the stage when he answered the Question in October 2005, the limit of 10 years of age had already been introduced as a matter of administrative practice rather than as a law. I should be grateful if the noble Baroness would clarify that.</p> <p pid="c.1192.0/6">Mr McNulty continued:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.1192.0/7">"In assessing whether any previous criminal activity would affect a person's ability to meet the good character requirement, we would take into account the nature of the offence, the age of the offender and the length of time that had elapsed since conviction. If sufficient time free of further offending had not elapsed since the offence, the application would normally be refused".&#8212;[<a href="/search/?pop=1&s=date:20051019+column:1031+section:wrans"><i>Hansard</i>, Commons, 19/10/05; col. 1031-32W</a>.]</p> <p pid="c.1192.0/8">We need only look to see what happens in cases of application for naturalisation.</p> <p pid="c.1192.0/9">I once had a case where the applicant was a bank manager married to a Swedish citizen. They would go home every summer to her parents in Sweden for the holidays&#8212;it was a regular occurrence. This person had an international driving licence, which he renewed while in Sweden. The question put to him by the interviewing officer with respect to his application was, "Have you ever applied for a British driving licence?" He said that he had, but that it had not been convenient for him to take the test, which was why he continued to rely on the international driving licence.</p> <p pid="c.1192.0/10">When, after persistent and relentless inquiry, I persuaded the Home Office to tell me why the man's application for citizenship had been refused, I was told that it was because he had dishonestly pretended that he had taken the driving test in the United Kingdom&#8212;but he had done no such thing. There may have been a difference of interpretation in what he had said in answer to the questions, but he was quite definite in asserting that he had never taken the test and never said that he had&#8212;and that he had told the interviewing officer that he continued to rely on his international driving licence. A triviality of that kind denied him citizenship, although, when he applied again three years later, that was overlooked.</p> <p pid="c.1192.0/11">Do we really want that kind of test to be applied to those that this <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> concerns? I believe that the age of 10 is not an appropriate one to have in the Bill, although it is better than where we started. I wish that the Minister had made a little more effort to look at the arguments that older children&#8212;up to the age of 18, as we believe&#8212;should not be subject to this test.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.1193.0/1">My Lords, it is interesting to discuss what is in the eighth group before what is in the ninth, as I would like to have dealt here with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> that I have put forward. I shall try to deal with this group of amendments in the right context.</p> <p pid="c.1193.0/2">We believe that it is right and proper, in general, that we should be able to say that those who have engaged in drug dealing, paedophilia or war crimes&#8212;those who are guilty of such serious crimes&#8212;fail to meet a good character test, in order to exclude them from the granting of nationality. That is important, which is why we have put these clauses in the Bill. The proposed alternative&#8212;that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> must grant registration unless satisfied that the applicant has engaged in conduct "seriously prejudicial to" vital state interests&#8212;does not capture the group of people whom we might wish to. It raises considerably the threshold for refusing registration from that currently being proposed. As I have indicated, it would not allow us to refuse an applicant who had engaged in serious criminal behaviour, much of which would fall short of what could be described as actively or "seriously prejudicial to" vital state interests. For that reason, I will not be able to accept Amendments Nos. 14 and 17.</p> <p pid="c.1193.0/3">I am not sure whether Amendments Nos. 19, 20, 23 and 24 would do what my noble friend Lady Turner intended. What they actually do is make acquisition of nationality at birth, by foundlings and on adoption conditional on good character. I think that that is exactly the opposite of what my noble friend is seeking to do. In other words, she does not want to bring in a good character test for those children at all. I am not accepting the amendments because, as my noble friend is indicating, she does not actually want to do that. Unfortunately, that is the way those amendments are worded.</p> <p pid="c.1193.0/4">My noble friend Lady Turner and the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Avebury">Lord Avebury</a>, also raised the question of those who are over the age of 10, an age that we will deal with in the next group. My noble friend described the issue of troubled teenagers; I accept that one has to put into context the matter of young people who have perhaps had issues. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, about those who have perhaps had anti-social behaviour orders. It is relevant to consider that there are young people who may have committed quite serious offences with whom we would wish to engage in terms of considering good character. I do not accept the premise that a 17 year-old or a 16 year-old is not responsible. That is where we come to the age of 10.</p> <p pid="c.1193.0/5">The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked whether my <a href="/glossary/?gl=173" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to an MP of the..." class="glossary">honourable friend</a> Mr McNulty had considered the age of 10 a few months ago. The first time that it came up was when I raised it in your Lordships' House having thought about it earlier in the day. I am wholly responsible for the amendment, which I am glad to say my honourable friend Mr McNulty was happy to go along with. It is entirely me&#8212;he is not responsible in any way for it. We think that we have captured what noble Lords were rightly saying about children and that we have captured it in a way that recognises that, within our law, we have an age of criminal responsibility. I will come on to that.</p> <p pid="c.1193.0/6">I am happy to accept Amendment No. 21. When we come to the next group, noble Lords will find that it fits perfectly well with what we are seeking to achieve. On Amendment No. 30, which is about the under-sixes, our Amendment No. 29 has the same effect but will provide greater legislative clarity. We just think that our amendment is better drafted. I hope that on that basis my noble friend will feel able to withdraw her amendment. This is an important test and we have positioned it appropriately. We have recognised the issues that were raised about children, which we will come on to deal with. On the basis of what I have said, I hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.1195.7/1">My Lords, I apologise for having to revisit the subject of tests for registration when we have already covered the matter very thoroughly. The first <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> in this group provides that any person who is a British citizen and who has no other nationality and has not renounced any other nationality should be entitled to the same benefit as those who were covered earlier in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a>. They would not have to satisfy the good character test.</p> <p pid="c.1195.7/2">Amendment No. 28, to leave out paragraph (d), would exclude people who register under the British Nationality (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>) Act 1997 from the good character test. I will not go into the arguments that have already been discussed today about the inappropriateness of subjecting a person who is solely a British national and is <i>de facto</i> stateless to a good character test in order to acquire British citizenship. Is it lawful to impose such a requirement on applicants for citizenship in the light of our obligations under the 1961 UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness? British national overseas status, like the status of British overseas citizens, British subjects and British protected persons, does not carry the right of abode anywhere. A British national overseas, who is not Chinese, will automatically lose the right of abode under the Hong Kong immigration ordinance if he ceases to be ordinarily resident in Hong Kong and has been absent for a continuous period of more than 36 months after obtaining settled status in any <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>.</p> <p pid="c.1195.7/3">As your Lordships will be aware, being settled in a country with no time limit on your stay does not amount to nationality or citizenship. Even in Britain, we have numerous long-term residents who are unable to obtain <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality">British nationality</a> and can be removed at the pleasure of the Secretary of the State, if he thinks it conducive to the public good. Like the vast <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of British overseas citizens, British subjects and British protected persons coming under Section 4B of the 1981 Act and ordinarily resident outside the UK, the group of persons covered by Amendment No. 28 are solely British and have no entitlement to any other nationality. It is a contradiction in terms for somebody who is already British and holds solely a British passport to be refused citizenship of this country.</p> <p pid="c.1195.7/4">There is one other important point to be considered on this amendment. In the run-up to the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, we extended what was then termed a "cast-iron guarantee" to the solely British ethnic minorities of Hong Kong. They were told that they would be admitted to the United Kingdom and would have an entitlement to register as British citizens. It is a disgrace for us now to renege on a commitment that we made to this group of solely British people.</p> <p pid="c.1195.7/5">Amendment No. 33 is of a different nature altogether. I would have asked for it to be degrouped had I not realised that it had been put with this group only when I came into the Chamber. As a matter of form, I wish that the groupings of amendments could be issued by the Government Whips' Office somewhat earlier in the day than was the case today. I know that that is not a matter for the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, but now it is on the record. I see the noble Lord, Lord Grocott. I do not know whether he heard what I said, but it would have been convenient to have had the groupings much earlier than we did, instead of having to look at them just as we came into the Chamber.</p> <p pid="c.1195.7/6">This amendment seeks to bring British nationals overseas into Section 4B of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Nationality_Act_1981">British Nationality Act 1981</a>. It follows the amendment that we tabled at an earlier stage to achieve the same effect by removing the "ordinarily resident" requirements of the 1997 Act, but I hope that your Lordships will agree that this present drafting is clearer and more elegant. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality,_Immigration_and_Asylum_Act_2002">Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002</a>, by inserting a new Section 4B into the 1981 Act, gave otherwise stateless British nationals the right to register as British citizens as long as they were solely British and irrespective of where they were resident. When the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a> announced in July 2002 that he was tabling an amendment to the then <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIA">NIA</a> Bill, he said that it would "right a historic wrong" that had left stateless tens of thousands of Asian people who had worked closely with the British colonial administration. Fiona Mactaggart, who is now a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office_Minister">Home Office Minister</a>, said that the coming into force of Section 4B meant that,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.1195.7/7">"the most racialist underpinning of Britain's immigration and nationality <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> is about to be swept away".&#8212;[<a href="/search/?pop=1&s=date:20021105+column:147+section:lords"><i>Hansard</i>, Commons, 5/11/02; col. 147</a>.]</p> <p pid="c.1195.7/8">In enacting this amendment, we will remedy the limbo status of probably the last remaining group of solely British nationals who have no other nationality or citizenship, who have not recently and deliberately given up another nationality or citizenship and yet who do not come under the provisions of Section 4B of the 1981 Act despite having no entitlement to acquire the citizenship of any other country. The group in question are solely British nationals overseas who were not ordinarily resident in Hong Kong on <phrase class="date" code="1997-02-04">4 February 1997</phrase> and can never satisfy the requirements of the 1997 Act. Consistent with the policy that all otherwise stateless British nationals without the right of abode in the United Kingdom should have the entitlement to register as British citizens, this small group of people should be entitled to do so, too. They hold only British passports, their sole identity is British and yet they do not have the right to reside in any British territory.</p> <p pid="c.1195.7/9">We have a strong obligation to this group of people under the UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, Article 10.1 of which says:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.1195.7/10">"Every treaty between Contracting States providing for the transfer of territory shall include provisions designed to secure that no person shall become stateless as a result of the transfer. A Contracting State shall use its best endeavours to secure that any such treaty made by it with a State which is not a Party to this Convention includes such provisions".</p> <p pid="c.1195.7/11">The 1984 Sino-British joint declaration on Hong Kong made specific provision for the indigenous Chinese population of Hong Kong to be recognised as Chinese citizens. Despite our convention obligations, it made no provision for the non-Chinese, solely British ethnic minorities of Hong Kong to acquire proper citizenship. That was made clear by the current <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>, Jack Straw, who, on <phrase class="date" code="1997-01-30">30 January 1997</phrase>, said that,</p> <p class="indent" pid="c.1195.7/12">"common sense and common humanity demand that we give these people full British citizenship. The limbo in which they will find themselves in July arises directly from the agreements which Britain made with China".</p> <p pid="c.1195.7/13">I know that the Minister has considered this matter and that she did not see the force of the arguments that we put earlier. However, I hope that she will be convinced by what I have said this evening and agree to this amendment. I beg to move.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.1198.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for again putting forward his views on this issue and for recognising some of the work we have done.</p> <p pid="c.1198.0/2">We are not suggesting in what we are doing that people cannot come, but it is appropriate to use the good character test for the reasons I gave in response to the previous set of amendments. It is important to be clear that there are people who have committed serious crimes&#8212;examples of which I gave earlier&#8212;whom we might wish to prevent gaining <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality">British nationality</a>.</p> <p pid="c.1198.0/3">To deal with the issues raised, our starting point was that we should not apply the good character requirement to those whose entitlement to registration derives from a provision of the 1961 UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. The Government then additionally agreed to exempt from the good character requirement those seeking to register as British citizens on the basis that they are already British overseas citizens, British subjects or British protected persons and hold no other nationality or citizenship. They have not made a general exception for all such nationals or for all such stateless persons. The noble Lord's <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>, as he has indicated, would introduce such a general exception, and the effect would be far reaching, since a significant proportion of those able to apply for registration are people who have some other form of British nationality. This is in direct conflict with the Government's commitment to seeing that the vast <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of those seeking to register are of good character.</p> <p pid="c.1198.0/4">As to the amendments relating to applicants under the 1997 Act, and British overseas nationals in general, these groups invariably have a right of residence in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>. Indeed, applicants under the 1997 Act are required to have been "ordinarily resident" there on particular dates&#8212;a concept which, while not necessarily equating to possession of a right of permanent residence there, at least implies lawful and, for the time being, stable residence in Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="c.1198.0/5">In 1997, those with only British nationality were told that they would be admitted to the UK if conditions deteriorated in Hong Kong, not that they would be given British citizenship. I do not believe that we have reneged on the agreement that we reached. British overseas territorities citizens normally have the right of abode in the British overseas territory from which their citizenship derives. By contrast, the right of many of those eligible for registration under Section 4B of the 1981 Act to remain in their countries of current residence is at best precarious. It was this lack of a secure residence in any country that prompted the Government to announce on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-04">4 July 2002</phrase> their intention to introduce a provision now having effect as Section 4B, and which at Report stage prompted us to move for their exemption from the good character test, which was welcomed.</p> <p pid="c.1198.0/6">We do not accept the position of those qualifying for registration under the 1997 Act, or of British nationals in general, is sufficiently close to that of persons presently entitled to registration under Section 4B of the 1981 Act to justify the support that the noble Lord's amendments clearly seek. Nor do we accept obligations towards stateless persons going beyond those we have accepted by ratifying the 1961 convention. It is always sad to disappoint the noble Lord, but I believe that the Government have the balance right. While wishing to continue to raise these issues, I am sure that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>            </div>

She said that they were precarious and that that was the reason for including them in Section 4B. I do not agree with her. Apart from the case of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idi_Amin">Idi Amin</a>, which was some 38 years ago, the other persons whom she says have only a precarious right of abode in the territories where they reside are in fact secure. I cite the people who live in countries such as Malaysia, for instance. It is a functioning democracy with rules of human rights. It will not suddenly kick out people who have a second-class <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality">British nationality</a>.</p> <p pid="c.1199.0/2">The noble Baroness said in a letter that she wrote to me the other day, for which I am most grateful, that there was a difference between the people that we are seeking to bring into Section 4B and all those other groups who are now enfranchised, as it were. I investigated whether there have been any other cases since the days of Idi Amin when British citizens have been kicked out of a territory where they had what the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> calls a precarious right of abode. I could not find any. If the noble Baroness has evidence of that, I shall be delighted to hear it. It is not a matter that we can pursue this evening, but once again perhaps we can put it on the list of unfinished business that she and I can discuss when the Bill has gone to <a href="/glossary/?gl=112" title="During a debate members of the House of Commons traditionally refer to the..." class="glossary">another place</a>. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>            </div>

Perhaps I may refer to the debate on contracting out for searches. I omitted to underline the importance of ensuring that Home Office monitors are properly equipped and trained. Perhaps the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will write to me on that point.</p> <p pid="c.1200.5/2">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> places a duty on various elements of the Immigration Service to give regard to promoting and safeguarding the welfare of children while performing its functions. I emphasise the duty to give regard. It is a soft duty which is already on the police service and Prison Service and does not interfere with their primary function.</p> <p pid="c.1200.5/3">I apologise for raising the matter at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Reading">Third Reading</a>. It does not fit the criteria we have been advised to accept. I hope that noble Lords will understand the unusual circumstances. At a late stage of the Bill, the Children's Commissioner and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Inspector_of_Prisons">Chief Inspector of Prisons</a> gave oral evidence to Sub-Committee F of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Committee">European Union Committee</a>. The sub-committee deals with home affairs. They expressed considerable concerns about the welfare of children in the Immigration Service. That prompted me to table an amendment on Report.</p> <p pid="c.1200.5/4">I am grateful to the Minister for her time in discussing the matter today and for the hope which was offered at that meeting. I refer to Yarl's Wood as an example where things have not been working. In doing so, I pay tribute to the men and women who work in that institution. The concerns are no reflection on their good will and the wish to do the best for the families detained. It is a reflection on the quality of thinking underlying the establishment of the facility just over a year ago. Improvements have been made but they have been slow and there is still a long way to go. The lack of partnership between the detention centre and local social services and the connection with those making decisions in the Home Office were identified as matters of serious concern by the joint chief inspectors in their report on safeguarding children. I hope that the amendment will contribute to addressing such an issue in future.</p> <p pid="c.1200.5/5">I recognise the immense difficulty that the Government face. Some noble Lords may have heard Mr McNulty this morning on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_4">Radio 4</a>. It is an extremely delicate and difficult matter. In the report by the noble Lord, Lord Laming, on the death of Victoria Climbi&#233;, a deputy manager of social services said that they lost their ability to be social workers because of the time they had to spend dealing with asylum seekers. There were no additional resources to cope with it. One must seek to manage migration in a sensible way and avoid too much pressure on scant resources in certain areas.</p> <p pid="c.1200.5/6"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> expressed concern about the legal implications and the implications for the successful removals of failed asylum seekers and irregular migrants. I hope that the legal opinion I gave her yesterday and circulated somewhat late to noble Lords&#8212;I received it only this weekend&#8212;may reassure the noble Baroness. It is a mild duty. She has a concern about education, in as much as a child being educated in this country might be removed to a second country that has a poorer education system, and the amendment might be used to resist that removal because a child should not be given a poorer education. That point is already covered by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a>. There was a case involving the prevention of the removal of a child. It focused on primary education. That case, the Holub case, was not accepted. I emphasise that this is a duty to give regard&#8212;a very weak duty in terms of judicial review.</p> <p pid="c.1200.5/7">In conclusion, I apologise once again for bringing this difficult matter back at Third Reading and I hope that noble Lords will appreciate the circumstances. I hope that the Minister will feel able to accept the amendment, or at least give an undertaking actively to review the area, look at guidance and see whether that might be improved.

I do not want to give the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, any hope that I would support requesting the Government to accept the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>, but it is right to bring it back on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Reading">Third Reading</a>. This is one of those occasions when there is justification for further assurances to be sought from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, because of the developments that have taken place during latter debates on this Bill.</p> <p pid="c.1202.2/2">As I said on Report, this is an important matter because it affects directly the question of how the welfare of children is to be safeguarded and promoted when they are in contact with immigration services. The noble Earl's amendment highlighted what I believe is a significant tension between the policies of protecting children as set out in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_Act_2004">Children Act 2004</a> and policies that require the speedy removal of those who have sought asylum here but have not been granted leave to remain. As well as policies that govern the treatment of those children caught up in non-asylum cases, we have those in relation to asylum cases.</p> <p pid="c.1202.2/3">I must say that that is a tension that I have found impossible to resolve in my discussion with my colleagues with other departmental responsibilities. So, admirable although the intentions of the amendment are, within the context of the Bill, it is impossible to make progress. However, the underlying issues need to be addressed by us all in future. We need to continue to challenge Home Office policies on that, even when we do not oppose them, to make the Home Office think how it is to take forward the welfare of children within the immigration system. I would be grateful if the noble Baroness would let us know whether it is being considered that one way forward could be to have cross-departmental work on the matter. That is often a proactive way forward, where one gets key people who have real enthusiasm for something to happen in departments to work together, so that we can try to reconcile the principles and contradictions between the Children Act and the responsibilities of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IND">IND</a>.</p> <p pid="c.1202.2/4">It would be useful to know what action the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Children">Minister for Children</a> has taken and will take on the matter. If the noble Baroness is undecided on the matter, I should be happy if she were to write to me. That is something that we need to consider in future.</p> <p pid="c.1202.2/5">As a result of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, bringing forward the amendment at our previous stage, I immediately tabled a Written Question asking the Government how many children were detained in February this year in asylum removal centres. I was told that internal management information showed that, as at <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-20">20 February 2006</phrase>, 37 children were detained with their families under Immigration Act powers, all of them at Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre. We would expect that. The children were all detained as part of families whose detention the Government considered to be necessary as a group. I was certainly interested to read the report by the Children's Commissioner of an announced visit to Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre last October, which was the basis of the evidence given to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> to which the noble Earl has already referred.</p> <p pid="c.1202.2/6">It is important at this stage to note that disturbing conditions were highlighted in that report of children having to go through locked door after locked door. One needs only to read the report to see what picture is built up of the impact of detention on children. As ever, we say&#8212;at least, I say&#8212;that there are circumstances in which I must support detention. I know that I may part company with the noble Earl on that; however, I feel that, although the parents have chosen a road that leads to their detention, it is not the children's fault. Despite that, governments have to take hard decisions and one of them may be to detain children who are part of a family group.</p> <p pid="c.1202.2/7">I was very interested to note in the conclusions that Yarl's Wood was trying to take significant steps to improve the conditions for children in its care. As a result of that, it is important for the House to ask the Government today not only to respond to the points of the noble Earl and say whether the Home Office has been able to take forward recommendations about how children's conditions may be improved, but outside the remit of the Bill to take the matter forward by pressing the Government in a series of debates. I return to where I started by saying that I cannot support the noble Earl, because I cannot see how the Bill will resolve this especially difficult issue.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c.1204.0/1">My Lords, first, I want to deal with the issue of apologies. I shall say this only once to the noble Earl: he really, really, really should not apologise for bringing up these issues. I think that I speak for everyone in your Lordships' House when I say that we have nothing but admiration for how he constantly reminds us of our responsibilities for children. Please do not apologise any more. There is absolutely no need to do so. I apologise to the noble Earl for having left my place to go to the Box, but I am about to go off-message from my notes and it is always wise to warn my officials that that I am about to do so.</p> <p pid="c.1204.0/2">I agreed with the noble Earl that I would say something about monitors. As I was dealing with the earlier <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>, I was wracking my brains to remember the one thing that I had forgotten. We were talking about the children's champion and I said that I would ask the children's champion within <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IND">IND</a> to consider the monitoring arrangements. I hope that that will address that point. Of course, the noble Earl can come back to me if that is not right. Perhaps I may also say how much we welcomed the children's commission report on Yarl's Wood and readily agreed that it should return to see the changes and initiatives that have been prompted by it. I know that noble Lords will want to keep in touch with it.</p> <p pid="c.1204.0/3">As I said, I will go off-message on to my own notes. I have indicated at previous stages why I cannot accept the amendment. The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and I are in the same place on the issue: there are tensions in the system raised by the amendment. We could not accept an amendment under the legal opinion that I have&#8212;I will return to the points made by the noble Lord, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Avebury">Lord Avebury</a>&#8212;because we believe that it could create circumstances where it could be used as a means of delaying or preventing people from being returned home, which we could not do.</p> <p pid="c.1204.0/4">I turn to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. I saw the legal opinion for the first time this morning. It was received late last night but I was doing other work and I did not get to see it until this morning, so I have not had time to study it as the noble Lord requested. However, it has influenced me to the extent that I recognise that those involved in the Home Office need to study it because, as he said, it is an important legal opinion and we will deal with it appropriately.</p> <p pid="c.1204.0/5">I agree with what the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, was saying about the potential to think about the issues in a broader way. I and my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Scotland_of_Asthal">Lady Scotland of Asthal</a> sit on a committee that meets under the auspices of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Children, whom I cannot say has considered the issue in detail, but it might be an appropriate forum. I will steal that suggestion with grateful thanks and see if there is a way in which we might be able to take it further forward rather than setting up something separate to do so. I want to commit us to take the issue further forward because I cannot accept the amendment, and if the legal opinion stands I will not accept it; I make no commitment to it, but we are back to the underlying issues within the amendments of trying to make sure that children are properly looked after and catered for&#8212;if I may describe it like that.</p> <p pid="c.1204.0/6">I want to commit to take the issue back to IND and ask it to carry out the kind of review that noble Lords are looking for across all the children's issues, part of which I committed to on earlier amendments, with a view to coming back to address the issues properly. The children's champion is in place&#8212;I do not know him but I know that the noble Earl was pleased to see that he is in that position. The noble Earl and I discussed earlier what process I need to follow. I want to add my personal commitment, because I have taken the Bill through, but I am committing everyone else too.</p> <p pid="c.1204.0/7">I do not quite have an answer and perhaps the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, can help me afterwards because we need a mechanism for the issue to come back. It may be through the traditional mechanisms of an Unstarred Question, a Starred Question or a Written Question, but I will commit that we will find a way of doing it: we will seek to continue the debate and to address the issues properly. On that basis alone I commit to take forward the issue, to review the legal opinion, to make sure that we are right to reject it for the grounds I have given but to seek to deal with the underlying issue, which the noble Earl and other noble Lords feel strongly needs to be dealt with. I hope that on that basis he will be able to withdraw his amendment.</p>            </div>
