Zhang Kai&#8217;s family do not know of his situation, and his lawyer has tried several times to ascertain it. The matter is also urgent because of wider concern that China&#8217;s human rights position should be raised directly with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Xi_Jinping">President Xi Jinping</a> during his state visit, which ends tomorrow.</p> <p pid="b.1125.3/3">Zhang Kai&#8217;s case is significant not only in itself, but because he is one of nearly 300 lawyers and human rights defenders who have been detained since July this year. At least 20 are still in custody or have disappeared, their whereabouts unknown. We know from the example of the case of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gao_Zhisheng">Gao Zhisheng</a>&#8212;another prominent human rights lawyer, who defended, among others, members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong">Falun Gong</a> movement and who was &#8220;disappeared&#8221; on several occasions and imprisoned in solitary confinement for three years, where he was severely tortured&#8212;that the consequences of secretive detention can be grave.</p> <p pid="b.1125.3/5">Lawyer Zhang Kai had been advising Churches in China&#8217;s Zhejiang province in connection with the demolition of churches and the forcible destruction of more than 1,500 crosses in Zhejiang over the past two years&#8212;a gross violation of freedom of religion or belief. The Churches affected include both unregistered and state-approved Catholic and Protestant Churches.</p> <p pid="b.1125.3/6">As we have heard, Zhang&#8217;s is not the only case. Nineteen-year-old student activist <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Wong">Joshua Wong</a> faces court next week for inciting unlawful assembly, and I understand that among those who are also in secret detention is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yu">Wang Yu</a>, a fearless defender of feminist activists and the victims of rape. Thousands of political prisoners also continue to languish in Chinese jails, the most famous being Nobel laureate <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Xiaobo">Liu Xiaobo</a>, who is halfway through an 11-year sentence for peacefully advocating democratic change. Members may well wish to raise other cases, including, perhaps, events in Tibet and Xinjiang, and the plight of the Uighurs.</p> <p pid="b.1125.3/7">As chair of the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, I welcome the opportunity to engage with China. The Select Committee on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Development">International Development</a> met representatives from the Chinese delegation yesterday to discuss the sustainable development goals, which include a commitment to promoting peaceful and inclusive societies and access to justice for all. I recognise the significance of the business relationship and the importance of dialogue with China on a range of issues, including trade, but I hope that dialogue on human rights, freedom of thought, speech and assembly, and the rule of law will also be placed at the centre of the relationship. It is well recognised that the promotion of such freedoms contributes to better business and economic outcomes for the peoples involved. The two go hand in hand.</p> <p pid="b.1125.3/8">As the United Kingdom&#8217;s relationship with China develops, it is good for us to remember the words of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King">Martin Luther King</a>:</p> <p pid="b.1125.3/9">&#8220;In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.&#8221;</p>            </div>

There is a whole range of cases about which we are concerned. The case in Zhejiang is not new. If the hon. Lady trawls back through <i>Hansard</i>,she will see that I answered a question raised by <a href="/mp/?p=13852" title="Our page on Ian Paisley Jnr - 'the hon. Member for North Antrim (Ian Paisley)'">Ian Paisley</a> on this back in June, when I talked about our concerns about restrictions on Christianity particularly in Zhejiang province. I went on to say:</p> <p pid="b.1127.1/2">&#8220;We raised these, and our broad range of concerns around religious freedom, directly with Chinese officials during the UK-China Human Rights Dialogue in April this year. We have also highlighted them publicly in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a>&#8217;s Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1127.1/3">Further to that, in September I answered a question from my hon.

I reiterate what I said then:</p> <p pid="b.1127.1/4">&#8220;I am aware of reports that lawyer <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Kai">Zhang Kai</a> was detained on <phrase class="date" code="2015-08-25">25 August</phrase>, alongside two of his assistants, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Peng">Liu Peng</a> and Fang Xiangui, and members of a Christian congregation.</p> <p pid="b.1127.1/5">I am concerned that this is reflective of the wider situation facing rights lawyers in China. Reports suggest that over 200 lawyers have been detained or questioned since <phrase class="date" code="2015-07-09">9 July</phrase>, and the space in which they operate is increasingly constrained.</p> <p pid="b.1127.1/6"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> supported an EU statement of <phrase class="date" code="2015-07-15">15 July</phrase> which said the detentions raised serious questions about China&#8217;s commitment to strengthening the rule of law. We have ongoing discussions with the Chinese authorities on human rights and rule of law issues, and discussed these matters in detail during the UK-China Human Rights Dialogue in April.&#8221;</p> <p pid="b.1127.1/7">I then went on to say what I have said in answer to an earlier question.</p> <p pid="b.1127.1/8">On the question of whether this case and other cases will be addressed, a number of cases are always being addressed. This is not just a one-off and I cannot gainsay what the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> might say. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> will of course be with the President in Manchester tomorrow, and there will be private meeting between the President and the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> at Chequers later this evening. I do not know what will be on the agenda, but I do know they have an ever-closer relationship and these matters are continuously being discussed.</p>            </div>

Does the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> agree that our ability to raise our voice and put pressure on China because of its gross violations of human rights is in part based on the recognition that this country has itself made a commitment to human rights? Does he recognise that the increasingly negative tone being used in this country to describe human rights as a problem&#8212;even to the point of describing the legislation as &#8220;Labour&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Act">Human Rights Act</a>&#8221;, which I cannot believe is a compliment&#8212;undermines our ability to champion human rights abroad? We cannot champion human rights abroad if we regard them as a nuisance at home. Will he ensure that he and his Government stand up for human rights in this country, as part of our policy of championing them in other parts of the world?</p>            </div>

I agree with him that the UK can show that we are able to have criticism, dialogue and debate and that, at the end of the day, no one is threatened by it. Freedom of religious expression is a fundamental human right. That is one of the things that all too often in this country we accept as the norm.
