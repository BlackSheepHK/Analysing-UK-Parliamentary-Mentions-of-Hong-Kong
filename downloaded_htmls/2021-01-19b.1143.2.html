                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b1133.2/1">The following Statement was made in the House of Commons on Tuesday <phrase class="date" code="2021-01-12">12 January</phrase>.</p><p pid="b1133.2/2">&#8220;With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to update the House on the situation in Xinjiang and the Government&#8217;s response.</p><p pid="b1133.2/3">The evidence of the scale and severity of the human rights violations being perpetrated in Xinjiang against the Uighur Muslims is now far-reaching. It paints a truly harrowing picture. Violations include the extrajudicial detention of over 1 million Uighurs and other minorities in political re-education camps; extensive and invasive surveillance targeting minorities; systematic restrictions on Uighur culture, education and, indeed, the practice of Islam; and the widespread use of forced labour. The nature and conditions of detention violate basic standards of human rights. At their worst, they amount to torture and inhumane and degrading treatment, alongside widespread reports of the forced sterilisation of Uighur women.</p><p pid="b1133.2/4">These claims are supported now by a large, diverse and growing body of evidence that includes first-hand reports from diplomats who visit Xinjiang and the first-hand testimony from victims who have fled the region. There is satellite imagery showing the scale of the internment camps, the presence of factories inside them and the destruction of mosques. There are also extensive and credible third-party reports from non-governmental organisations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, with the United Nations and other international experts also expressing their very serious concerns.</p><p pid="b1133.2/5">In reality, the Chinese authorities&#8217; own publicly available documents also bear out a similar picture. They show statistical data on birth control and on security spending and recruitment in Xinjiang. They contain extensive references to coercive social measures dressed up as poverty alleviation programmes. There are leaks of classified and internal documents that have shown the guidance on how to run internment camps and lists showing how and why people have been detained.</p><p pid="b1133.2/6">Internment camps, arbitrary detention, political re-education, forced labour, torture and forced sterilisation &#8212;all on an industrial scale. It is truly horrific&#8212;barbarism we had hoped was lost to another era is being practised today, as we speak, in one of the leading members of the international community.</p><p pid="b1133.2/7">We have a moral duty to respond. The UK has already played a leading role within the international community in the effort to shine a light on the appalling  treatment of the Uighurs and to increase diplomatic pressure on China to stop and to remedy its actions. I have made my concerns over Xinjiang clear directly to China&#8217;s Foreign Minister Wang Yi. We have led international joint statements on Xinjiang in the United Nations General Assembly Third Committee and the UN Human Rights Council. In the Third Committee, we brought the latest statement forward together with Germany in October last year and it was supported by 39 countries.</p><p pid="b1133.2/8">China&#8217;s response is to deny, as a matter of fact, that any such human rights violations take place at all. They say it is lies. If there were any genuine dispute about the evidence, there would be a reasonably straight- forward way to clear up any factual misunderstandings. Of course China should be given the opportunity to rebut the various reports and claims, but the Chinese Government refuse point blank to allow the access to Xinjiang required to verify the truth of the matter.</p><p pid="b1133.2/9">We have repeatedly called for China to allow independent experts and UN officials, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, proper access to Xinjiang, just as we in this country allow access to our prisons, our police custody suites and other parts of the justice system to independent bodies who hold us to account for the commitments to respect human rights that we have made.</p><p pid="b1133.2/10">China cannot simply refuse all access to those trusted third-party bodies that could verify the facts and, at the same time, maintain a position of credible denial. While that access is not forthcoming, the UK will continue to support further research to understand the scale and the nature of the human rights violations in Xinjiang. But we must do more, and we will.</p><p pid="b1133.2/11">Xinjiang&#8217;s position in the international supply chain network means that there is a real risk of businesses and public bodies around the world, whether inadvertently or otherwise, sourcing from suppliers that are complicit in the use of forced labour, allowing those responsible for violations to profit&#8212;or, indeed, making a profit themselves&#8212;by supplying the authorities in Xinjiang. Here in the UK, we must take action to ensure that UK businesses are not part of supply chains that lead to the gates of the internment camps in Xinjiang, and to ensure that the products of the human rights violations that take place in those camps do not end up on the shelves of supermarkets that we shop in here at home week in, week out.</p><p pid="b1133.2/12">We have already engaged with businesses with links to Xinjiang; we have encouraged them to conduct appropriate due diligence. More widely, we have made a commitment to tackling forced labour crystal clear. With the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act 2015, the United Kingdom was the first country to require companies by law to report on how they are tackling forced labour in their supply chains. Today, I can announce a range of new measures to send a clear message that those violations of human rights are unacceptable and, at the same time, to safeguard UK businesses and public bodies from any involvement or links with them.</p><p pid="b1133.2/13">I have been working closely with my right honourable friends the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for International Trade and the Chancellor of the Duchy  of Lancaster. Our aim, put simply, is that no company profits from forced labour in Xinjiang, and that no UK business is involved in their supply chains. Let me set out the four new steps that we are now taking.</p><p pid="b1133.2/14">First, today the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the Department for International Trade have issued new, robust and detailed guidance to UK businesses on the specific risks faced by companies with links to Xinjiang, and underlining the challenges of conducting effective due diligence there. A Minister-led campaign of business engagement will reinforce the need for UK businesses to take concerted action to address that particular and specific risk.</p><p pid="b1133.2/15">Secondly, we are strengthening the operation of the Modern Slavery Act. The Home Office will introduce fines for businesses that do not comply with their transparency obligations, and the Home Secretary will introduce the necessary legislation setting out the level of those fines as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p><p pid="b1133.2/16">Thirdly, we announced last September that the transparency requirements that apply to UK businesses under the Modern Slavery Act will be extended to the public sector. The FCDO will now work with the Cabinet Office to provide guidance and support to UK Government bodies to exclude suppliers where there is sufficient evidence of human rights violations in any of their supply chains. Let me say that we in the United Kingdom&#8212;I think rightly&#8212;take pride that the overwhelming majority of British businesses that do business do so with great integrity and professionalism right around the world. That is their hallmark and part of our USP as a global Britain. Precisely because of that, any company profiting from forced labour will be barred from government procurement in this country.</p><p pid="b1133.2/17">Fourthly, the Government will conduct an urgent review of export controls as they apply, specifically geographically, to the situation in Xinjiang, to make sure that we are doing everything we can to prevent the export of any goods that could contribute directly or indirectly to human rights violations in that region. The package that has been put together will help to ensure that no British organisations&#8212;government or private sector, deliberately or inadvertently&#8212;will profit from or contribute to human rights violations against the Uighurs or other minorities. I am of course sure that the whole House would accept that the overwhelming majority of British businesses would not dream of doing so. Today&#8217;s measures will ensure that businesses are fully aware of those risks, will help them to protect themselves, and will shine a light on and penalise any reckless businesses that do not take those obligations seriously.</p><p pid="b1133.2/18">As ever, we act in co-ordination with our like-minded partners around the world, and I welcome the fact that later today Foreign Minister Champagne will set out Canada&#8217;s approach on these issues. I know that Australia, the United States, France, Germany and New Zealand are also considering the approaches they take. We will continue to work with all of our international partners, but the House should know that in the comprehensive scope of the package I am setting out today the UK is again setting an example and leading the way.</p><p pid="b1133.2/19">We want a positive and constructive relationship with China, and we will work tirelessly towards that end, but we will not sacrifice our values or our security. We will continue to speak up for what is right and we will back up our words with actions, faithful to our values, determined, as a truly global Britain, to be an even stronger force for good in the world. I commend this Statement to the House.&#8221;</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b1136.0/1">My Lords, the serious human rights violations in Xinjiang are of enormous concern across all sides of this House. I welcome the Statement and the Government&#8217;s recognition of the need for the UK to act. However, it is disappointing that, once again, the Government have been unable to bring forward proposals for sanctions against those responsible for the abuses. We in this House have repeatedly asked whether they will apply Magnitsky-style sanctions to officials involved in the persecution of the Uighur Muslims, only to be told that they will not provide a running commentary on the designation of sanctions. The evidence of slave labour, in addition to forced detention and other serious abuses, is overwhelming. So, in the absence of such a proposal, can the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> at least confirm whether discussions with global allies are taking place to prepare for sanctions like those already authorised by the US?</p> <p pid="b1136.0/2">On the measures in the Statement, first, the Government have announced guidance to UK businesses on the specific risks faced by companies with links to Xinjiang. Such guidance is welcome but, unless it is legally enforceable, there may regrettably be some who do not feel the compulsion to comply. What representations has the Minister made to British companies that have supply chains running through the province, particularly those in the apparel industry? Considering that the European Union will introduce legislation next year on due diligence, does the Minister believe that such guidance should be legally enforceable?</p> <p pid="b1136.0/3">Secondly, on changes to the operation of the Modern Slavery Act, I appreciate that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> acknowledged that the Act is not working, and the proposed changes are welcome. Can the Minister indicate when we can expect the necessary legislation to be laid before Parliament, and will the affirmative procedure be used to allow both Houses to consider it in full? I hope that the Government will consider strengthening the Modern Slavery Act with more substantive changes; for example, Section 54 applies only to large companies with a turnover above &#163;36 million. Do the Government intend to broaden the scope of the provisions?</p> <p pid="b1136.0/4">Thirdly, on the guidance, is the Minister able to confirm that he is confident that this guidance alone is sufficient at this stage&#8212;or whether the Government intend to introduce necessary legislation to hold to account those who act against such guidance?</p> <p pid="b1136.0/5">Finally, on the review of export controls, I warmly welcome this step. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> will be aware of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> to the Trade Bill, in my name and those of the noble Lords, Lord Purvis and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Alton">Lord Alton</a>, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Albans">St Albans</a>; that amendment is, of course, being considered by the Commons as I speak. Whatever the outcome of the Commons&#8217; consideration of those amendments, I hope  that the noble Lord will be able to explain tonight how the Government will ensure future trade agreements will not contribute to human rights abuses such as those in Xinjiang. The best way is to give Parliament proper opportunity to scrutinise, which it has not had with the rollover agreements we have seen since Brexit.</p> <p pid="b1136.0/6">Whatever action we take must involve like-minded international partners. It is now over a year since the Government called for United Nations observers to be given &#8220;immediate and unfettered access&#8221; to Xinjiang to verify claims, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China">Government of China</a> continue to refuse. Can the noble Lord set out what steps the United Kingdom will take at the UN, including at the Human Rights Council, to hold the Government of China to account? What steps are being taken to support the appointment of a UN special rapporteur for the investigation of forced labour and ethnic persecution in Xinjiang?</p> <p pid="b1136.0/7">In addition to the UN, there is the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a> in June of this year, which the UK is set to host. Can the noble Lord tell the House whether there are any plans to place the horrendous human rights abuse in Xinjiang on that agenda? The human rights violations in Xinjiang have shocked the world in recent months, and it is now time for the world to respond and act.</p>            </div>

The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> describes an appalling situation, with which we have become familiar. It is vital that our businesses do not benefit from slave labour in Xinjiang or anywhere else. The possibility of genocide must always be at the forefront of our minds, not least as we come up to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_Memorial_Day">Holocaust Memorial Day</a>.</p> <p pid="b1137.0/2"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commons">The Commons</a> is indeed currently considering the amendments to the Trade Bill that we sent there. Ministers have been saying that Parliament, not the courts, should decide on genocide in relation to trade agreements. The noble Lord usually says international courts should decide on genocide, but he also admits that this is impossible when it comes to China. Yesterday, in relation to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh">Nagorno-Karabakh</a>, he said that</p> <p class="indent" pid="b1137.0/3">&#8220;it is a long-standing government policy that genocide is a matter for judicial decision rather than for Governments or non-judicial bodies.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id=", 18/1/21; col. 991.]"><i>Official Report</i>, 18/1/21; col. 991.]</phrase></p> <p pid="b1137.0/4">That seems in line with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> in the Commons. He said, &#8220;judicial decision&#8221;, not &#8220;international judicial decision&#8221; or &#8220;Parliament&#8221;: could he comment?</p> <p pid="b1137.0/5">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party">Chinese Communist Party</a> has described the forced sterilisation of Uighur women as &#8220;emancipation&#8221;. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN">The UN</a> convention on genocide clearly forbids this. The noble Lord will know that under the convention, when a state learns, or should have learned, of the serious risk of genocide, it must take action. Is his department making an assessment in relation to the Uighurs, and will he publish its conclusions? Given that China blocks routes to international courts, does he agree that the United Kingdom has a responsibility to find alternative routes to make the legal determination?</p> <p pid="b1137.0/6">The second area I want to ask about, as the noble Lord, Lord Collins did, is the Magnitsky sanctions. The Government always say they keep these under review. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will no doubt say that today, yet the US applies such sanctions in relation to China. Why do we not? The Foreign Secretary noted last week:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b1137.0/7">&#8220;Of course, many countries are nervous in their dealings with China because of its asymmetric economic clout.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, Commons, 12/1/21; col. 173.]</p> <p pid="b1137.0/8">That is indeed so. The noble Lord rightly says that sanctions are most effective when undertaken jointly with others. There are three major economic blocs in the world: the United States, China and the EU. We now have to work that much harder to gain traction among European allies, not just France and Germany, so what progress are the Government making here?</p> <p pid="b1137.0/9">The last area that I want to ask the noble Lord about is in relation to company law. I worked on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act_2006">Companies Act 2006</a>. We included supply chains. Can the noble Lord explain why neither the Companies Act nor the Modern Slavery Act have proved sufficient here? Clearly, reputation is vital. I noted how quickly companies acted after the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rana_Plaza">Rana Plaza</a> disaster when they realised that their reputations were at stake. What about public procurement? Can we be sure that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPE">PPE</a> that we so anxiously sought during the pandemic did not come from Xinjiang? There were reports of some of it originating in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea">North Korea</a>. Who will monitor and act on the proposed new measures? Which Minister in which department? Will legislation be brought forward as indicated&#8212;and, if so, when&#8212;to close the loopholes that the Government clearly identify exist in the Companies Act and the Modern Slavery Act?</p> <p pid="b1137.0/10"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_European_Union">The European Union</a>, as the noble Lord, Lord Collins, noted, intends to introduce legislation on due diligence, which will be mandatory. Are we working with it so that our standards are at least equivalent? Will this issue be considered at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a> or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D10">D10</a>, or however it is defined, in June? I look forward to hearing the noble Lord&#8217;s response and also to the questions and answers from noble Lords who have so much experience in this area.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b1138.0/1">My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Collins, and the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, for their welcome of the provisions that have been announced. I also reassure them that, as they will have seen, earlier today I was engaging with one of the key <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGOs">NGOs</a> that I speak to on a regular basis on issues of human rights, with a specific focus on Xinjiang.</p> <p pid="b1138.0/2">It is worth just taking a step back. I pay tribute to many in your Lordships&#8217; House and in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>, as well as other advocates around the world, in seeing where we have got to on this important issue, even over the last three years. There was a time where the issue of Xinjiang and the situation of the Uighurs was not often debated. However, because of the advocacy from across your Lordships&#8217; House and in the other place, there is a real strength and a real momentum behind the actions we have seen in international action, with the United Kingdom working with key partners. We have also had rich debates on various <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">Bills</a>, as well as more generally as we are doing today on specific matters relating to the situation in Xinjiang. I pay tribute to all noble Lords and Members in the other place for their continued not just interest but strong advocacy, for that is what is required.</p> <p pid="b1138.0/3">Picking up on some of the specific questions, first, on the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Collins, on guidance and working with businesses, from my  own experience of the private sector over 20 years I think that the approach of successive Governments, because of the nature of the environment we work in, has always been to work with business and to offer guidance and structure so businesses can act. This new robust and detailed guidance to UK business sets out quite specific risks faced by companies with links to Xinjiang, underlining the challenges of effective due diligence&#8212;a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, as well. There will be a <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>-led campaign of business engagement&#8212;which was a point the noble Lord, Lord Collins, again raised&#8212;led by my <a href="/glossary/?gl=172" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to another MP of..." class="glossary">right honourable friend</a> the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a> with an organised forum called the Business Against Slavery Forum made up of businesses, which I understand my <a href="/glossary/?gl=214" title="Right Honourable is a form of address used within the House of Commons, for..." class="glossary">right honourable</a> friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> will also attend.</p> <p pid="b1138.0/4">The noble Lord, Lord Collins, also raised sanctions and further designations, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Northover. I have to be consistent with what I said before: we keep the situation under review, across the world, because it is important in the new regime introduced by this Government that we continue to monitor abuses of human rights. I assure noble Lords that we will continue to act.</p> <p pid="b1138.0/5">Answering a point that the noble Baroness raised about acting with key partners, we have carefully noted the action taken by the United States. We worked closely with the European Union during the transition period and, as we have come to the end of that, we will build a new engagement and relationship. As my right <a href="/glossary/?gl=173" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to an MP of the..." class="glossary">honourable friend</a> the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> said, we want to be the closest ally and friend to the European Union, and we will work together on our shared values agenda.</p> <p pid="b1138.0/6">As I have said&#8212;and I stand by this, as it is important for sanctions policy&#8212;there is sometimes no necessity for institutional frameworks, as we have seen and demonstrated in our relationships with Australia, Canada and the US. But it is important for relationships to be strengthened further. We will continue to work with all our allies, including the European Union, as we bring forward sanctions, across the world, to ensure that those who abuse human rights are held to account and suffer as a consequence.</p> <p pid="b1138.0/7">The noble Lord, Lord Collins, talked of new legislation and confirmation through the affirmative procedure for some of the changes proposed to the Modern Slavery Act. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary will shortly bring forward details of those changes; these will be discussed through the usual channels. They will include further intent to impose financial penalties on businesses that do not comply with their transparency obligations in this respect.</p> <p pid="b1138.0/8">The noble Baroness, Lady Northover, and the noble Lord, Lord Collins, both raised this issue. I go back to 2015, when my right honourable friend the Member for Maidenhead, Theresa May, was Home Secretary. I remember working directly with her on this ground- breaking Act, when we were spurred on by what was happening in the UK. This was well supported across all parts of your Lordships&#8217; House. It set the premise and basis for actions that we can take today. Other countries, such as Australia, have followed the United Kingdom&#8217;s lead. Yes, more work needs to be done and more actions need to be brought, but the steps we are  taking on Xinjiang underline our commitment to further strengthening the Modern Slavery Act. It was set up to ensure that we stop supply chains that abuse people&#8217;s human rights. We will make full use of and, where necessary, strengthen the provisions of that Act.</p> <p pid="b1138.0/9">I also assure the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, that the Government will provide guidance and extend provisions to support all UK public bodies to use public procurement rules to exclude suppliers where there is sufficient evidence of human rights violations in supply chains. Compliance will be mandatory for central government, non-departmental bodies and executive agencies. We expect this to increase public sector bodies&#8217; ability and willingness to exclude specific suppliers, and we expect increased scrutiny to drive up standards and due diligence. Again, the noble Baroness raised this point on companies supplying the Government.</p> <p pid="b1138.0/10">Both the noble Lord and the noble Baroness raised international co-operation and continued advocacy. The noble Lord, Lord Collins, rightly raised action within the context of UN institutions, particularly the Human Rights Council. I look forward to engaging with him and the noble Baroness on this, as we look forward to the next Human Rights Council. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Kingdom">The United Kingdom</a> returns as a member, but it is also notable  to see China returning. I assure your Lordships that  we will focus on our agenda as we did at the previous Human Rights Council; our item 4 statement was specifically just on the issue in Xinjiang and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>. We will continue to retain focus and build momentum. We have seen success, as all noble Lords know, in the UN third committee, where 39 members, building on the 28 in June, supported our statement on the situation in both Xinjiang and Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="b1138.0/11">On the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a> agenda, which was raised by both the noble Lord, Lord Collins, and the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, obviously we are working through the importance of the agenda. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> recently announced that he himself will be hosting the G7 leaders in Cornwall, and of course the Foreign Secretary will be convening a meeting of G7 Foreign Ministers. As my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary has said, the importance of the values agenda and of defending human rights will very much be factored into our thinking. As we are able to share some of the specifics of that agenda, I will of course do so.</p>            </div>

One of the specific announcements that we made was that, while there were obligations on the private sector within the context of existing legislation, there was a notable omission in the guidance issued to UK public bodies. We have used the proposal to further detail what we expect. That guidance for all the agencies that I have already listed will be shared with all departmental bodies and executive agencies, and it will increase public bodies&#8217; ability and willingness to exclude specific suppliers. I think the sharing of evidence of where those specific suppliers are will also be helpful, particularly when you are talking about various departmental bodies. We also believe it will increase scrutiny to drive up standards and the due diligence that public sector bodies themselves apply when supplying to the Government. When we have the full details of that, I will be happy to share them with the noble Lord and put a copy in the Library.</p>            </div>

I assure her and all noble Lords, as I have the noble Lord, Lord Field, just now, about the new government guidance. We will work with public bodies to ensure that the rules are fully understood and that there is a sufficient focus on, and sufficient evidence of, human rights violations that occur in supply chains. We will make public bodies fully cognisant of these so that they can act appropriately. With that reassurance, I hope and am certain that we will strengthen our work within the public procurement sector.</p>            </div>

He makes very powerful points about the importance of the end result of the human rights sanctions regime that we apply. It sends a very strong signal to those who abuse human rights that there will be consequences to their actions. I also assure him of what I alluded to earlier: there has been a real move in international action on this important issue. As we look forward to strengthening our work with partners, I note, on China not co-operating, that we are pressing for access to Xinjiang for the human rights commissioner, whose visit is the next key stage. We will continue to work with our partners to ensure greater transparency on the Chinese side. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese">The Chinese</a> take note not just of debates here and in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords.

Given the denial of access to the region and refusal to admit that these abuses are taking place by the Chinese authorities, I wonder why we are being so slow in applying Magnitsky sanctions to the violators.

The new sanctions regime was only launched last summer. I am sure she would agree with me that many, if not all, the designations that have been made have been valid and done because of the strength of the abuses that have occurred. I say this very clearly: the situation in Xinjiang and the action we have taken is demonstrable of not just our concern but, as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> has said in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>, the dire situation faced by the Uighur Muslims and, let us also not forget, other minorities within Xinjiang. We have acted. Of course, I take note of the issue around sanctions, but the actions we have taken&#8212;in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, in engaging and showing international support, on the issues and limitations on extradition treaties with Hong Kong, arms exports and the recent provisions we have announced on forced labour&#8212;show that the Government are not sitting back. We are taking action, and there is a wide range of steps we can take. Of course, as ever, I note very carefully what the noble Baroness has put forward.</p>            </div>

While I support the measures set out in the Statement, we need to take more robust actions and proceed to declare the persecution as genocide, invoke Magnitsky sanctions and consider legislation similar to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_Forced_Labor_Prevention_Act">Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act</a> in the United States. Furthermore, if the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> on the Trade Bill is not accepted in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords.

I would also like to add that if China does not allow outsiders, including a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Commissioner">UN Commissioner</a>, to have access to Xinjiang, we must stop Chinese officials from coming to the United Kingdom.</p>            </div>

Some I believe have already answered, and I am sure my noble friend would acknowledge that. Of course, I share with him&#8212;as do the Government&#8212;the view that it is important to act and act now. As I have already illustrated, over the last few years we have seen real action being taken through multilateral fora, as well as directly, as the Statement from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> has demonstrated. Of course, this does not stop here. If China fails to co-operate, we will continue to look to see what further provisions and actions can be taken. We take note of what our international partners are doing as well. As I have said consistently before, the application of sanctions works most effectively when we do so in partnership. On the point of stopping access to the UK for officials, one thing I will share with my noble friend, particularly through my engagement on multilateral fora, even with your worst foe you should never stop talking because by talking you are able to deliver your point of argument. China remains an important partner, so I do believe we will continue to work constructively where we agree with China and raise issues of human rights concerns where we do not.</p>            </div>
