I am pleased to be opening this detailed consideration of part 5 of the Bill, which deals with matters relating to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Protocol">Northern Ireland Protocol</a>. I welcome this opportunity to discuss these provisions and the important issues they raise in depth today. Before I turn to the specific clauses and amendments in this group, let me begin by making it clear that the Northern Ireland protocol to the withdrawal agreement is designed to recognise and protect the needs and unique circumstances of Northern Ireland. Central to that is ensuring that the Belfast/Good Friday agreement, its successor agreements, and the gains of the peace process are protected. But, above all, we must ensure that the delicate balance between all communities in Northern Ireland is maintained and that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> pursue policies for sustained growth and stability in Northern Ireland. Those have always been and will remain this Government&#8217;s priorities.</p> <p pid="d647.0/2">Through this Bill, we are acting to uphold those priorities and deliver the commitments we made in our election manifesto that we would provide unfettered access between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and</p> <p class="indent" pid="d647.0/3" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;maintain and strengthen the integrity and smooth operation of our internal market.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d647.0/4">The protocol also explicitly depends on the consent of the people of Northern Ireland for its continued existence. As we implement the protocol, that must be kept in mind. Those commitments are, of course, entirely in accord with the protocol itself, which makes it clear that, among other things, Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom&#8217;s customs territory, that nothing in the protocol prevents unfettered access from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK market, and that in its application the protocol should impact as little as possible on the everyday life of communities in both <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland_and_Northern_Ireland">Ireland and Northern Ireland</a>.</p>            </div>

Friend is of course right about that, and we still hope to strike a free trade agreement with the EU. I also point out that these issues can and should be resolved through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a>&#8212;I will come back to that.</p> <p pid="d648.1/2">Both the UK and the EU signed up to the protocol on the basis I just outlined. We are committed to implementing the protocol and we have been working hard to ensure that it is done in a way that delivers the promises that have been made. That includes working with the EU to reach agreement through the Joint Committee process in a number of areas that the protocol left unresolved, and we very much hope that agreement can be reached shortly. But if it is not, the harmful legal defaults contained in some interpretations of the protocol, which were never intended to be used, would be activated. The consequences for Northern Ireland in that scenario would be very damaging. We cannot and will not run that risk.</p> <p pid="d648.1/3">The provisions we are considering today will therefore ensure that in any scenario, we will protect Northern Ireland&#8217;s place in the United Kingdom; ensure that businesses based in Northern Ireland have unfettered access to the rest of the United Kingdom; and ensure that there is no legal confusion or ambiguity in UK law about the interpretation of the state aid elements of the Northern Ireland protocol.</p>            </div>

We will take the necessary powers in the Finance Bill to ensure that this is defined in a reasonable and proportionate way, which ensures that legitimate traders are not penalised, while also resolving the outstanding issues relating to the payment of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAT">VAT</a> and excise duty.

That is why we are taking the powers in this Bill, and we would seek the consent of the House before those powers were exercised&#8212;it is to ensure that there is a legal default different from the one that he suggests. It is about taking these steps in parallel.</p> <p pid="d650.0/2">I want to recognise the significant concerns that many Members have raised, which is why we have agreed that a &#8220;break glass&#8221; provision should be included, requiring the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> to give its approval before these measures are commenced. I will return to the detail of that shortly, but the Committee should be in no doubt that this Government will always seek to ensure that the Belfast/Good Friday agreement is protected and that the political and economic integrity of our United Kingdom is maintained. That is what the Government amendments in this group seek to achieve.</p> <p pid="d650.0/3">Clauses 11, 40 and 41 of the Bill give effect to the Government&#8217;s commitment to give unfettered access to Northern Ireland goods to the whole UK internal market, in line with the protocol. They will ensure that we protect the vast <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament.

That will provide vital legal certainty for businesses in Northern Ireland, whose largest market is the rest of the United Kingdom&#8212;56% of Northern Ireland&#8217;s goods trade is with Great Britain&#8212;and deliver on a promise that has been repeatedly made throughout the process of our exit from the European Union.</p> <p pid="d650.0/4"><a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 11 sets out that qualifying Northern Ireland goods will benefit from mutual recognition and are not discriminated against. It ensures that the mutual recognition principle will apply to all such goods that will also benefit from unfettered access under clause 40. Clause 40 ensures that, in implementing the protocol, authorities must have special regard to the fundamental need to maintain Northern Ireland&#8217;s integral place in the UK&#8217;s internal market and customs territory and to facilitate the free flow of goods between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. That, of course, applies to trade between <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland">Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a> in both directions.</p> <p pid="d650.0/5">Clause 41 ensures that there will be no new checks, controls or administrative processes on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. This clause is in keeping with what the Government have constantly said, including in our manifesto, and in line with our commitments to businesses in the &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Decade,_New_Approach">New Decade, New Approach</a>&#8221; agreement.</p> <p pid="d650.0/6">Clauses 42, 43 and 45 set out the safety net that I have described. Clause 42 ensures that full unfettered access is guaranteed in any scenario by providing a power to disapply or modify the requirement for export declarations or other exit procedures when goods move from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. As <a href="/mp/?p=10669" title="Our page on Hilary Benn - 'the right hon.

It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>, there is no real justification for such declarations being needed to protect the EU&#8217;s single market or  customs union. It is a wholly reasonable suggestion from the UK that this issue can and should be resolved through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a>, but if it is not&#8212;and this is perhaps where he and I disagree&#8212;there needs to be a safety net in place.</p>            </div>

I want to press him on the safeguard measures that are provided in article 16 of the protocol and the extent to which they enable the Government to take action if they think the EU is being unreasonable. There is a one-month waiting period, but after that, the Government are able to take safeguard measures. Annex 7(5) goes on to say:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d651.0/2" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;The safeguard measures taken shall be the subject of consultations in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a> every 3 months&#8221;.</p> <p pid="d651.0/3">Could he clarify what would cause those safeguard measures to come to an end? Would it be a decision of the arbitration mechanism that the Government lost? Could it then go to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice">European Court of Justice</a>? In other words, could he explain why what the Government negotiated to protect the country from bad faith action by the EU is insufficient?

Friend knows well, the withdrawal agreement was negotiated by the UK and the EU and agreed with a view that certain elements would be resolved by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a>. I think there was a reasonable expectation on both sides that the Joint Committee would have made more progress on those issues, but unfortunately we have heard some harmful interpretations over the past few months. The point of these Government clauses is to ensure that we can rule those out and put in place the appropriate legal default.</p>            </div>

For that, we need to prove to the European Union that the UK can be trusted if various derogations are granted to the UK, but if we pass legislation that still contains even the merest threat of breaching the existing agreement, why would the EU be flexible and give us that trust as we will not have shown the ability to follow through with other previous agreements?</p>            </div>

I will come to amendments shortly&#8212;I realise that I need to make some more progress in addressing the many amendments we face. We do not consider necessarily that a unilateral interpretative declaration would be required, although as I said, we will use all the tools at our disposal to resolve the issue within the terms of the protocol before using the powers in the Bill. If that is one that we considered would help, we would not hesitate to use it, but we do not see the need for the amendment in that respect.</p> <p pid="d654.1/2">For the avoidance of doubt, let me confirm again that we are of course committed to implementing the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol, and have already taken many practical steps to do that. However, as a responsible Government, we cannot allow the gains of the peace process or the economic integrity of the UK&#8217;s internal market to be compromised inadvertently by unintended consequences and harmful legal defaults suggested by some interpretations of the protocol.</p> <p pid="d654.1/3">Finally, <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 50 disapplies certain provisions of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Internal_Market_Bill">UK Internal Market Bill</a> in the scenario that Northern Ireland&#8217;s representatives resolve, under the protocol&#8217;s consent mechanism, that articles 5 to 10 of the protocol should cease to apply. This is a practical step to account for and respect the principle of consent enshrined in the protocol. The protocol itself is not codified as a permanent solution for Northern Ireland, and neither should it be in the domestic legislation that implements it. Taken together, these clauses deliver on our commitments to Northern Ireland.</p> <p pid="d654.1/4">I want to address the amendments as briefly as I can, so I will have to be limited in the number of interventions I will take.</p>            </div>

With regard to the development  of technological solutions, I agreed with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Barnier">Michel Barnier</a> when he said that it is important that both sides look at innovative and flexible solutions. When it comes to the future debate in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly">Northern Ireland Assembly</a> on consent, it may be that technological progress can help with delivery, so I think that many of these arguments stand.

Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Secretary">Business Secretary</a>, make it clear that any regulations made under clauses 42 or 43 would, of course, be subject to judicial review, contrary to some of the claims that have been made over recent weeks, while ensuring that any claims must be brought within a three-month period. That ensures that any challenge to the regulations will be subject to a timely resolution before the courts, which is essential to ensure that Northern Ireland businesses and investors in Northern Ireland have the certainty that they need, which is at the heart of the Bill. I commend those amendments to the House. As they clarify the position on judicial review, <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 44 is not necessary.</p> <p pid="d655.3/3">Amendments 61 to 63, in the name of my right hon.

The principle of facilitating actions to protect biosecurity on an ongoing basis between <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England,_Scotland_and_Wales">England, Scotland and Wales</a> is already reflected in schedule 1 to the Bill. The amendments simply clarify that similar processes can also apply with regard to Northern Ireland where there is a genuine risk of a biosecurity threat that poses a serious threat to the health of humans, animals or plants.</p> <p pid="d655.3/6">I commend those amendments to the Committee.</p>            </div>

Amendment 53 similarly seeks to prevent authorities from exercising functions in a way that is incompatible or inconsistent with relevant domestic or international law. Amendment 52 appears to require the Government to follow the process agreed in the withdrawal agreement as the only mechanism for dispute resolution. Amendments 54 and 55 seek to prevent regulations made under clause 42 from having effect, notwithstanding international and domestic law. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment_46">Amendment 46</a> would remove the Northern Ireland protocol from the list of international law that may be set aside, undermining the intent of clauses 42 and 43.</p> <p pid="d656.3/3">Amendments 57 and 59 would prevent regulations under clause 43 from interpreting, disapplying or modifying the effect of article 10 of the protocol. Clause 43 is a necessary provision that will ensure that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>&#8217;s interpretation will achieve the correct effect in domestic law.</p> <p pid="d656.3/4">I repeat that the Government are committed to implementing the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol; however, as a responsible Government we cannot accept any amendments that would undermine the provisions in the Bill and render them no kind of safety net at all, thereby risking the compromising of the UK internal market&#8217;s economic integrity by unintended consequences or harmful defaults contained in some interpretations of the protocol, or creating confusion or uncertainty about the position in domestic law. I therefore urge right hon. and hon. Members to withdraw the amendments.</p> <p pid="d656.3/5">I recognise the spirit behind amendments 67 and 68. The Government have been clear that, as we set out in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_Paper">Command Paper</a>, we will ensure that there are no tariffs on any goods that remain within the UK customs territory. I hope Members will welcome the further relevant measures that will be set out in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Bill">Finance Bill</a>.</p> <p pid="d656.3/6">There will not be any new customs infrastructure in Northern Ireland.

This is a unique <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>, backed by &#163;200 million in Government funding to ensure that businesses of all sizes can draw on the support that it provides.

I have made the point about what we have said in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_Paper">Command Paper</a> and what the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has referred to in respect of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Bill">Finance Bill</a>.</p> <p pid="d658.0/2"><a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> 69 seeks to ensure that there would be no new costs for a Northern Ireland business to access or sell in the market. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> have already committed in legislation to delivering unfettered access for Northern Ireland businesses, including through the Bill, which will apply the principles of mutual recognition and non-discrimination to qualifying Northern Ireland goods, thereby ensuring that they can continue to be sold in the Great Britain market in the same way as now. The amendment is therefore unnecessary.</p> <p pid="d658.0/3">Amendment 70 seeks to ensure that goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain through Ireland will benefit from unfettered access. I reassure Members that we recognise the importance of trade from Northern Ireland to Great Britain that moves via Dublin to Holyhead. We are currently engaging with businesses and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Executive">Northern Ireland Executive</a> on the long-term means for delivering qualifying status for unfettered access. It would be wrong to pre-empt the outcome of that consultation, so the Government cannot accept the amendment.</p> <p pid="d658.0/4">On amendment 71, the Government have been working and will continue to work closely with the Northern Ireland Executive on the implementation of the protocol, including on unfettered access, but we do not agree that a restriction on the Government&#8217;s powers to make regulations effectively would be justified.</p> <p pid="d658.0/5">We resist amendment 72 on the basis that it is legally unnecessary. The current wording already encompasses distortions of competition between persons supplying goods or services in the course of a business within the UK internal market. Such wording is already sufficient to cover the regulation of subsidies that would have the effect of making Northern Ireland businesses less competitive in the Great Britain market.</p> <p pid="d658.0/6">Although the Government agree with the spirit of amendment 78, the whole Government are acutely aware of the need to maintain Northern Ireland&#8217;s integral place in the UK internal market, which is already referenced many times elsewhere in the Bill, so we do not believe the amendment is necessary.</p> <p pid="d658.0/7">On amendment 79, I understand Members&#8217; concerns and support mutual recognition and the non-discrimination principle, but the exception to mutual recognition that we have introduced for chemicals is there to allow the relevant authorities to respond to local factors. Authorisations granted by the EU after the end of the transition period will not take local conditions into consideration. I emphasise that the authorisations relate to the use of substances of very high concern. It is important that the Government and devolved Administrations can take local factors into account when they decide how to protect human health or the environment from the significant risks posed by such chemicals. I therefore urge Members to withdraw or vote against the amendment.</p> <p pid="d658.0/8">On new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 7 and amendment 45, I want to reassure Members that the Bill includes provisions that are there precisely to protect the essential basis of the peace process, by ensuring that, regardless of whether further agreement is reached in the negotiations, there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and that Northern Ireland businesses will continue to benefit from unfettered access to the rest of the UK market when the transition period ends.</p> <p pid="d658.0/9">I can also reassure hon. Members that our commitment to protecting the Belfast/ Good Friday agreement of course includes protecting north-south co-operation in areas specified under that agreement, and the protocol is clear on that. That commitment is already enshrined in UK legislation: in section 10 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, and through our continued support for this strand of the Belfast/Good Friday agreement throughout the process of exiting the European Union.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d659.1/1">As I have said repeatedly, we are absolutely committed to the Good Friday agreement, and I can give the hon. Gentleman an illustration of that in UK law on the very next <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a>. I can assure him that <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 48 is simply unnecessary. The protocol guarantees that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland under any circumstances. We are fully committed to delivering on that and no power in the Bill makes any change to that. We have already included in law our commitment not to</p> <p class="indent" pid="d659.1/2" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;create or facilitate border arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after exit day which feature physical infrastructure, including border posts, or checks and controls, that did not exist before exit day and are not in accordance with an agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d659.1/3">That is set out in section 10(2)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act, which I was pleased to take through the House. For those reasons, the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s amendments are unnecessary and I urge him not to press them.</p> <p pid="d659.1/4">On amendments 43 and 47, I can offer hon. Members an assurance that the recognition and protection of rights are fundamental values of the UK. Our human rights framework offers comprehensive, well-established and effective protections within a clear constitutional and legal system. The Bill is compatible with the European convention on human rights, and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> who presented the Bill has given a certificate of compatibility, pursuant to section 19(1)(a) of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Act_1998">Human Rights Act 1998</a>, in the usual way. We remain committed to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHR">ECHR</a>, as we have made clear time and again.</p> <p pid="d659.1/5">Further on amendment 47, the Government do not envisage any circumstances in which the powers set out in clauses 42 and 43 could be used to amend the Northern Ireland Acts of 1998 and 2006. That renders the amendment unnecessary. For this reason, the Government are not willing to accept the amendment. I hope that hon. Members will be reassured by our commitment on this very serious matter and will not press them.</p> <p pid="d659.1/6">New clause 6 would require the Government to</p> <p class="indent" pid="d659.1/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;use their best endeavours to seek through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a>&#8230;the disapplication of export declarations and other exit procedures&#8221;.</p> <p pid="d659.1/8">I appreciate the thought and sentiment behind the new clause, but I am happy to say that there is no need for it because, as I have already set out, the Government are committed to implementing the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol. We are continuing to work with the EU in the Joint Committee to resolve outstanding issues with the protocol, including export declarations. Although well intentioned, the new clause is unnecessary and I urge hon. Members to reject it.</p> <p pid="d659.1/9">I will now turn to the other amendments on our safety net clauses pertaining to subsidy control. Now that we have left the EU, we have the opportunity to design our own subsidy control regime in a way that works for the UK economy. My right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy set out the Government&#8217;s plans in this regard in a written statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2020-09-09">9 September</phrase>. Clauses 43 and 44 seek to mitigate the risks that stem from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=234" title="The European Commission is the politically independent institution that..." class="glossary">European Commission</a> imposing a broad interpretation of article 10. Ministers will still have respect for the rule of law and human rights when making regulations using these provisions, which is why amendment 56 is unnecessary. I remind the Committee that the purpose of the provisions in clause 43 is to strengthen our legal safety net and ensure that it is the Government&#8217;s interpretation of article 10 that UK public authorities must follow. That is why we must reject amendment 58.</p> <p pid="d659.1/10">Amendment 60 would amend clause 44 by limiting the scope of the Secretary of State&#8217;s interpretation of article 10 when notifying possible state aid to the European Commission. Given the complex and novel nature of the application of EU state aid law through the Northern Ireland protocol, it is the Secretary of State who is best placed to interpret and then make any possible state aid notification to the European Commission. The amendment would require the Secretary of State to ignore the safety net that the Government have proposed when making such a notification.</p> <p pid="d659.1/11">I will deal briefly with amendments 31 and 32. I recognise the spirit of the amendments, but I have to say that they are simply not necessary. An assessment of the legal implications of the clauses has already been provided in the Government&#8217;s statements of 10 and <phrase class="date" code="2020-09-17">17 September</phrase>. Nor is there any need to make regulations defining &#8220;incompatible&#8221; or &#8220;inconsistent&#8221;, because these are self-explanatory terms. There can be no serious doubt what they mean and no further definition is required. The true intention of the amendments may be to seek to provide another point for parliamentary debate. If that is the case, I trust that the hon. Members who have tabled them will support Government amendment 66. On that basis, I urge them not to press the amendments.</p>            </div>

Together, these amendments seek to provide a solution to the mess that the Government have got themselves into by removing the provisions in the Bill that put our country in conflict with international law. We do so, because we want to maintain our reputation as a country that respects the rule of law; because we want to see a successful internal market for the whole UK when we leave the transitional arrangements on <phrase class="date" code="2020-12-31">31 December</phrase>; and because we want the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> to deliver the &#8220;oven-ready&#8221; deal with the EU that he promised the British people last December&#8212;a deal that pledged tariff and barrier-free trade for services as well as goods, along with safeguarding workers&#8217; rights, consumer and environmental protection, and which offered a broad, comprehensive and balanced security partnership underpinned by continued adherence and giving effect to the European convention on human rights.</p> <p pid="d661.2/2">The Bill makes that less likely. Our talks with the European Union have been damaged, our reputation in the world appears trashed, and it is a mess that was completely unnecessary and is not resolved by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> tabled by the Government. This so-called compromise may calm some Government Members, but it does not resolve the issue: the breach of international law that has led to the resignations of the head of the Government legal service, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Jones">Jonathan Jones</a>, and of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocate_General">Advocate General</a>, Lord Keen, who said in his letter to the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> that he could not reconcile his obligations as a Law Officer with the Bill, as he could find no</p> <p class="indent" pid="d661.2/3" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;respectable argument for the provisions at clauses 42 to 45&#8221;.</p> <p pid="d661.2/4">In an interview on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_4">Radio 4</a> last week, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=263" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Chancellor" class="glossary">Lord Chancellor</a> was uneasy in his defence of the Bill, as he might well be, having sworn an oath when taking office to</p> <p class="indent" pid="d661.2/5" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;respect the rule of law&#8221;.</p> <p pid="d661.2/6">The situation could not be more serious, and we accept that the amendment tabled by <a href="/mp/?p=13736" title="Our page on Bob Neill - 'the hon.

The Government amendment does not change that fact. Let us look at the withdrawal agreement&#8212;as <a href="/mp/?p=10426" title="Our page on Theresa May - 'the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)'">Mrs May</a> did in her <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>&#8212;which was negotiated by the Prime Minister, signed by him and commended to the electorate as the reason to vote for the Conservative party in December&#8217;s election. Now, apparently, it is so flawed that we have been asked to break the law.</p> <p pid="d661.2/8">I saw the argument advanced by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=138" title="The Attorney General, assisted by the Solicitor General, is the chief legal..." class="glossary">Attorney General</a> that it is okay to breach international law if the decision is taken constitutionally. That clearly flies in the face of the Vienna convention, to which we are a signatory. Article 27 makes that clear:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d661.2/9" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty.&#8221;</p>            </div>

That quote was from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Chief_Justice_of_Northern_Ireland">Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland</a>, and it was about trust in relation to the Government&#8217;s actions. In terms of how we deal with the issues that the right hon. Gentleman refers to, I will come on to those subsequently.</p> <p pid="d664.0/2">The Government&#8217;s cavalier disregard for the rule of law has been condemned by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Society">Law Society</a> and by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Council">Bar Council</a>. It has shocked people across the country, and it has disturbed our friends and allies around the world. Part of the tragedy of the Government&#8217;s actions is that they never needed to do this. Instead of throwing their toys out of the pram, there was a grown-up solution there in the Northern Ireland protocol itself: the dispute resolution mechanisms agreed by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, to which the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> has referred at length and which have been utilised already on other issues. However, in recognising those, the Minister failed to explain to the House satisfactorily why the Government have chosen not to exercise that route and have instead put this proposed legislation before the House. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_16">Article 16</a> provides for either the EU or the UK to take unilateral safeguard measures:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d664.0/3" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;If the application of this Protocol leads to serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties&#8221;,</p> <p pid="d664.0/4">and annex 7, to which I think he alluded, sets out the process to which matters can be resolved through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a> set up to oversee the implementation of the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p pid="d664.0/5">Do not take my word for it. The former <a href="/glossary/?gl=138" title="The Attorney General, assisted by the Solicitor General, is the chief legal..." class="glossary">Attorney General</a>, <a href="/mp/?p=11541" title="Our page on Geoffrey Cox - 'the right hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr Cox)'">Mr Cox</a>, who I seem to recall was once celebrated in the Conservative party, made the case in <a href="/glossary/?gl=49" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/" class="glossary">The Times</a> last week when he said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d664.0/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;There are clear and lawful responses available to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty">Her Majesty</a>&#8217;s Government&#8221;,</p> <p pid="d664.0/7">which</p> <p class="indent" pid="d664.0/8" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;include triggering the agreed independent arbitration procedure set out in the withdrawal agreement and, in extremis, these might legitimately extend to taking temporary and proportionate measures, where they are urgently necessary to protect the fundamental interests of the UK&#8221;.</p> <p pid="d664.0/9">That was his conclusion. And the Prime Minister could not answer my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10669" title="Our page on Hilary Benn - 'the Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn)'">Hilary Benn</a> at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaison_Committee">Liaison Committee</a> last week when he asked the simple question why he had not been prepared to use those measures, which he negotiated, to resolve any disagreements, rather than engage in lawbreaking.</p> <p pid="d664.0/10">So let me ask the Minister a simple question, which I hope he will come back to at the end of this very long debate, on the question of state aid. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister for the <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> Office, <a href="/mp/?p=11858" title="Our page on Michael Gove - 'the right hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael  Gove)'">Michael  Gove</a>, said it was a matter for the Joint Committee. Will the Minister be able to confirm in his winding up whether the Government have actually raised their concerns there for resolution?</p> <p pid="d664.0/11">Our amendments seek to put the Bill right. They reassert our commitment to the rule of law by removing the notwithstanding clauses, which have been the subject of so much attention, but also the other references to disapplying the protocol and disregarding the law.</p>            </div>

Gentleman and, with respect for those wishing to speak, I will follow the injunction of the Chair and make progress.</p> <p pid="d665.1/2">The Government are sending a worrying message, too, about their attitude to accountability in Government amendments 64 and 65, limiting opportunities for judicial review. Our amendments 58 and 59 would put that right, protecting those rights for the scrutiny and challenge of Ministers. If the Government are, as they say, acting reasonably, they should not be afraid of scrutiny or of challenge. Overall, our amendments 52 to 60 would enable the Bill to achieve its aims, but to stick to the rule of law, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Act_1998">Human Rights Act 1998</a> and our international obligations. We hope that the Government will accept them, but if they do not, we will vote against clauses 42 to 45 standing part of the Bill.</p> <p pid="d665.1/3">Many Members on the Government Benches talk about their ambition for global Britain. We share the desire for strong trading partnerships after we leave the transition, but that will be undermined by flouting international law, and the Government know that. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> was dispatched to Washington last week to calm fears. This visit seemed to make things worse. As he left the United States, the man that the polls indicate will be the country&#8217;s next President said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d665.1/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;We can&#8217;t allow the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement">Good Friday Agreement</a> that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit. Any trade deal between the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_and_UK">US and UK</a> must be contingent upon respect for the Agreement and preventing the return of a hard border. Period.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d665.1/5">He was adding to the views expressed on both sides of the aisle in Congress that there will be no US trade deal if this Bill proceeds unamended. We should remember that the UK and the US are co-guarantors of the Good Friday agreement. It is a responsibility that the future President of the United States seems to be taking more seriously than the Government.</p> <p pid="d665.1/6">This debate is about our place in the world. It is about our values. It is about the sort of country that we want to be. If we cannot comply with our treaty obligations, how can we ever demand that others do so? We are giving a green light to oppressive Governments, from China to Belarus, who flout the rule of law. This Bill has deeply damaged trust in our country and our place on the global stage. In our votes tonight and tomorrow, we have an opportunity to rebuild our reputation to make it clear that we are a country that can keep its word, a country that can make agreements and stick to them, and a country that believes in the rule of law. Let us not fail in that responsibility.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d666.1/1">It is with some regret that I rise to speak on clauses 41 to 45. May I just say to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> that the overall intention of the Bill&#8212;of ensuring a functioning internal market within the United Kingdom&#8212;is absolutely right? I believe passionately in the integrity of the United Kingdom. It is not just a belief; I think it is good for the prosperity of all parts of the United Kingdom.</p> <p pid="d666.1/2">Today, we are focusing on the parts of the Bill that relate to the Northern Ireland protocol, part of the withdrawal agreement&#8212;the withdrawal agreement that was signed by my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> less than a year ago. I can say to the Minister that, in my view, clauses 41 to 45 have no place in this Bill. We are told that they are there because the EU either is acting in bad faith, or might act in bad faith. This is because the withdrawal agreement put a border down the Irish sea and the Government cannot accept that&#8212;but the Government did accept that when they signed the withdrawal agreement with the European Union, and I assume that, when they did so, the Government signed that in good faith. Yet here we have clauses 41 to 45 saying that the Government should have the ability to renege on parts of the withdrawal agreement to break international law.</p> <p pid="d666.1/3">There are three reasons why I believe that these clauses have no place in the Bill. The first, which has been referred to in earlier interventions, is that it is unnecessary. There is an arbitration process available. Under article 175, the ruling of the arbitration panel should be binding on the UK and the EU. The Government have acknowledged the existence of the arbitration procedure, but they are saying that they would enter into that in parallel with the operation of the elements of this Bill. The message, it seems to me, is very clear, which is, if we do not like the outcome of the arbitration panel, then we will break international law and we will not accept it. Yet, again, that is breaking the international treaty&#8212;an agreement that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> signed&#8212;because it is breaking article 175, which says that the view of the arbitration panel shall be &#8220;binding&#8221; on both parties. However, there is not just an arbitration process available. As <a href="/mp/?p=10669" title="Our page on Hilary Benn - 'the right hon. Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn)'">Hilary Benn</a> referred to, article 16 says:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d666.1/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;If the application of this Protocol leads to serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist, or to diversion of trade, the Union or the United Kingdom may unilaterally take appropriate safeguard measures.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d666.1/5">Clauses 41 to 45 are not necessary.</p> <p pid="d666.1/6">Beyond that issue, there is the question of the impact of these clauses and the Government&#8217;s decision on the operation of the Belfast/Good Friday agreement. I believe that the Government&#8217;s willingness unilaterally to abandon an international agreement or parts of an international agreement they have signed and their willingness to renege on an agreement they have signed will lead, as has already been made clear in an <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>, to some questioning the willingness of the Government to fully uphold the measures in the Belfast/Good Friday agreement. That, in turn, will lead to some communities having less willingness to trust the United Kingdom  Government, and that could have a consequence on the willingness of people in Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. So far from acting to reinforce the integrity of the United Kingdom in pursuit of trying to appear to be tough to the European Union, I think the Government are putting the integrity of the United Kingdom at risk.</p> <p pid="d666.1/7">These reasons alone should I think be sufficient for the Government to abandon these clauses, but perhaps the most compelling reason is my third, which is this Government&#8217;s wish to break international law and taking the powers to do so. As the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Society">Law Society</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Council">Bar Council</a> have said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d666.1/8" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;These provisions enable Ministers to derogate from the obligations of the United Kingdom under international law in broad and comprehensive terms and prohibit public bodies from compliance with such obligations. They represent a direct challenge to the rule of law, which include the country&#8217;s obligations under public international law.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d666.1/9">I cannot emphasise enough how concerned I am that a Conservative Government are willing to go back on their word, to break an international agreement signed in good faith and to break international law.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d667.3/1">Let me get this right. My hon. Friend seems to be saying, &#8220;If somebody else does something wrong, it&#8217;s okay for us to do something wrong.&#8221; I am sorry, I do not agree with him on that point.</p> <p pid="d667.3/2">I recognise that my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=13736" title="Our page on Bob Neill - 'the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Sir Robert Neill)'">Sir Robert Neill</a> has taken every effort to ameliorate the impact of these clauses, and the Government have accepted and put down their own <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>. But, frankly, my view is that to the outside world, it makes no difference whether a decision to break international law is taken by a <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> or by this Parliament; it is still a decision to break international law. This can only weaken the UK in the eyes of the world. One of the great strengths we have as a country is our commitment to the rule of law, and this will have been damaged. Our reputation as a country that stands by its word will have been tarnished, and the willingness of other countries to trust the United Kingdom and its values will have been reduced. So much for global Britain!</p> <p pid="d667.3/3">In 2018, when Russian agents used a chemical weapon on the streets of Salisbury to attempt to murder <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_and_Yulia_Skripal">Sergei and Yulia Skripal</a>&#8212;a nerve agent that led to the death of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_Sturgess">Dawn Sturgess</a> and affected her partner, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Rowley">Charlie Rowley</a>&#8212;I led the action. I called on our friends and allies to stand alongside the United Kingdom, and I led the action that resulted in 29 countries expelling an unprecedented 153 Russian agents from their borders.  We were able to do that because those countries had trust in the United Kingdom. Where will that trust be in the future if they see a United Kingdom willing to break its word and international law?</p> <p pid="d667.3/4">If we pass this Bill with clauses 41 to 45, and in so doing accede to the Government&#8217;s wish to break international law, I believe it will have a detrimental effect on people&#8217;s trust in the United Kingdom. As the United Kingdom negotiates trade deals around the rest of the world, why should anybody we are negotiating with believe that we will uphold what we sign up to in those agreements if we have said clearly, &#8220;If we don&#8217;t like it after we&#8217;ve signed up to it, we&#8217;ll break it&#8221;?</p> <p pid="d667.3/5">This is a country that upholds the rule of law. That is one of the things that makes us great; it is one of our characteristics. We propound and uphold the rule of law around the world. The Conservative party upholds the rule of law&#8212;it is one of our values and characteristics&#8212;yet we are being asked to tear up that principle and throw away that value. Why? I can only see, on the face of it, that it is because the Government did not really understand what they were signing up to when they signed the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p pid="d667.3/6">My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Torridge and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Devon">West Devon</a> described the Government&#8217;s action as unconscionable. As has been said, Lord Keen resigned because he said that he found it increasingly difficult to reconcile his obligations as a Law Officer with the Government&#8217;s policy intentions. Frankly, I find it difficult to understand how any Minister can go through the Lobby to support these clauses.</p> <p pid="d667.3/7">I consider that, in introducing clauses 41 to 45, the Government are acting recklessly and irresponsibly, with no thought to the long-term impact on the United Kingdom&#8217;s standing in the world. It will lead to untold damage to the United Kingdom&#8217;s reputation and puts its future at risk. As a result, with regret I have to tell the Minister that I cannot support this Bill.</p>            </div>

Despite the clear relationship between this Bill and the peace process, as well as not engaging with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Irish">Northern Irish</a> Executive, the Prime Minister failed to engage with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Government">Irish Government</a>. Despite the clear importance of doing so, he just breenged on regardless. We know why there was no engagement. It is because this shabby Bill&#8212;his shabby Bill&#8212;had to be put together out of sight of people that the Prime Minister could not control, people with respect for the rule of law and for accountability.</p> <p pid="d669.1/5"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_SNP">The SNP</a> amendments would ensure that this Parliament would receive an assessment of the impact of any future action on these matters on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a>&#8217;s obligations under international law&#8212;a proper assessment, not the usual triumph of blustering bombast over good judgment by the Prime Minister.

We have heard about Lord Keen&#8217;s letter of resignation, but it was particularly telling in respect of the matters that are before us today. He said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d670.0/3" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;I have endeavoured to identify a respectable argument for the provisions at clauses 42 to 45 of the bill, but it is now clear that this will not meet your policy intentions.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d670.0/4">That is a damning condemnation from a former chair of the Conservative party in Scotland. No Member representing a Scottish <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> can defend these clauses&#8212;or, in fact, this Bill&#8212;and expect to be taken seriously when they claim to stand up for Scotland in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>.</p> <p pid="d670.0/5">We have also heard that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Declan_Morgan">Sir Declan Morgan</a>, the Lord Chief Justice&#8212;Northern Ireland&#8217;s top judge&#8212;warned that when Governments break international law, that</p> <p class="indent" pid="d670.0/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;might undermine&#8230;the administration of justice.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d670.0/7">That should concern us all. Even <a href="/mp/?p=24920" title="Our page on Rehman Chishti - 'the hon. Member for Gillingham and Rainham (Rehman Chishti)'">Rehman Chishti</a>, who is a barrister, felt the need to resign as the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8217;s special envoy on freedom of religion. These are telling actions and words that should give the Prime Minister pause for thought and reflection. This Bill is a grubby power grab that we cannot and will not support, and this part, as it stands, hangs like a badge of dishonour around this Prime Minister&#8217;s term of office&#8212;however long or short that might be.</p> <p pid="d670.0/8">Unfortunately, the Prime Minister&#8217;s approach is being propped up by those with somewhat flexible standards. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=138" title="The Attorney General, assisted by the Solicitor General, is the chief legal..." class="glossary">Attorney General</a>&#8217;s take could most charitably be described as mince, and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=263" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Chancellor" class="glossary">Lord Chancellor</a> says he will resign only if the Government break the rule of law in a way that is &#8220;unacceptable&#8221;, which obviously, for a Law Officer, prompts the question: what is an acceptable way to break the law?</p> <p pid="d670.0/9">What of the effect of the Bill on the UK and Northern Ireland? In October last year, when he was still trying to convince us that he had negotiated a great deal, the Prime Minister said of his withdrawal agreement Bill:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d670.0/10" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;For those who share my belief in the transformative power of free trade&#8230;a new deal, enabled by this Bill, will allow us to sign free trade agreements around the world.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2020-10-22">22 October</phrase> 2019; Vol. 666, c. 830.]</p> <p pid="d670.0/11">By using this Bill to trash that deal, the Prime Minister has again exposed the ethical vacuum at the heart of his Government and undermined trust around the world&#8212;and   all the time he has singularly failed to deliver what is needed by Northern Ireland. As Professor Katy Hayward of Queen&#8217;s University Belfast put it,</p> <p class="indent" pid="d670.0/12" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;the one thing most hoped for from this bill&#8212;certainty&#8212;has become an even more distant prospect.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d670.0/13">The reaction from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">USA</a> has been clear. Presidential candidate <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden">Joe Biden</a> warned:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d670.0/14" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Any trade deal between the U.S. and U.K. must be contingent upon respect for the&#8221;</p> <p pid="d670.0/15">Good Friday agreement. Similarly, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a> said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d670.0/16" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;If the UK violates that international treaty and Brexit undermines the Good Friday accord, there will be absolutely no chance of a US-UK trade agreement passing the Congress.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d670.0/17">Even Trump&#8217;s Administration are looking concerned.</p> <p pid="d670.0/18">The architects of the Good Friday agreement, from both sides of the House, are united in their condemnation of this Bill, and of this part of it in particular. They have called out this Government&#8217;s willingness to imperil the peace process and undermine the UK&#8217;s standing in trade negotiations.</p> <p pid="d670.0/19">All these issues would have been foreseeable if the Bill had been accompanied by an impact assessment, as the SNP amendments ask for. But fundamentally, at its heart, this Bill is ill conceived, confused and very damaging&#8212;frighteningly like the UK Government. Neither of them deserve our support.</p>            </div>

There are too many&#8212;they are far too numerous&#8212;to mention in this short debate. Of course, there is also an enormous number of examples of international law breaches by foreign states&#8212;not only, in Europe, by member states but by the EU itself, egregiously.

There are many aspects of international law that are sacrosanct&#8212;those in respect of torture, genocide and the rest, for example&#8212;and it is the fact that international law comes in many shapes, sizes and degrees, as I am sure we all know.</p> <p pid="d671.2/2">Basically, the point is that where the sovereignty of a nation is involved&#8212;the Vienna convention addresses this question&#8212;and where we are at the highest end of where <a href="/glossary/?gl=247" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_interest" class="glossary">the national interest</a> lies, other considerations come into play. It is absolutely clear that in many instances, democratically elected civilisations&#8212;countries&#8212;have themselves broken these treaties.</p> <p pid="d671.2/3">This Bill does not, in my view, breach international law, but our rule of law must be based on our Parliament making our <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> for our people based on our sovereignty, not judges. Indeed, Parliament itself voted for section 38 of the European Union (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_Agreement">Withdrawal Agreement</a>) Act 2020, without a single vote or even a voice raised in <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a>, as far as I am aware, in either House on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>. That Bill passed its <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Reading">Second Reading</a> by as many as 124 votes.</p> <p pid="d671.2/4">The famous <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Bingham">Lord Bingham</a> clearly demonstrated this in chapter 12 of his book, &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rule_of_Law">The Rule of Law</a>&#8221;. He said clearly, with respect to the fact that it is our Parliament, not judges, that makes laws for our people based on sovereignty, that he had come across a number of judgments that had breached that principle. Wise judges do not want to make political decisions. His unimpeachable principles turn on their head the exaggerated claims with respect to the breaking of international law that has not taken place.</p> <p pid="d671.2/5">As I said, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Federal_Constitutional_Court">German Federal Constitutional Court</a> stated in December 2015:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d671.2/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;International law leaves it to each state&#8230;to give precedence to national law&#8221;.</p> <p pid="d671.2/7">Laying a Bill is not a breach of international law and is privileged. If a treaty is entered into on the reasonable assumption that a state of affairs would exist, but that does not transpire, the treaty is voidable. The agreement was written on the basis of the EU recognising our sovereignty, which has not happened.</p> <p pid="d671.2/8">International law is broken by democratic countries throughout the world and the EU, in their own interests. The list is long, but I will give a few examples. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara">Western Sahara</a> is one case. Another is migrants sent back to north Africa and Turkey. In 2010, when the EU broke the Lisbon treaty, Madame Lagarde said,</p> <p class="indent" pid="d671.2/9" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;We violated all the rules&#8221; about the Greek and Irish bail-outs. The EU is unilaterally changing the bilateral channel tunnel treaty without our being able to prevent it. The EU threatened to use the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a>&#8217;s most favoured nation principle against the UK contrary to state practice, core principles of world trade and requirements negotiated in good faith.</p> <p pid="d671.2/11">I have another stack of examples, which I mentioned, where UK statute has overridden international treaties. There is no argument about it; it is there in black and white in the treaties and in the sections of various enactments that have overtaken and overridden international law.</p> <p pid="d671.2/12">It is understandable that some are bothered about this to a degree, but the fact is&#8212;</p>            </div>

Within the framework of international law, it is entirely a question of whether the degree to which it is done is commensurate with what is being proposed. The case of sovereignty goes to the heart of the extent to which we are entitled to take the action that we do.</p> <p pid="d672.1/2">This is less about breaking international law than about breaking the conditions in respect of state aid and in respect of the manner in which the Northern Ireland protocol would operate in the UK with respect to breaking the issues of contract and of the manner in which people work in this country. We are faced with a critical problem, the effect of which is that if we were  not to pass these clear and unambiguous clauses, we would find that we were subjected to EU <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a>&#8212;that we were subjugated to them&#8212;in a way that would ensure that we would not be able to compete effectively throughout the world or support the workers of this country, particularly in the context of covid.</p> <p pid="d672.1/3">Section 38 was passed by every single person in this House and by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=191" title="The house of Lords is the upper chamber of the Houses of Parliament. It is..." class="glossary">House of Lords</a>. There is no doubt about that. The notwithstanding provision is inviolate; it is in an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament">Act of Parliament</a>. These enactments do the necessary job to ensure the future prosperity and competitiveness of this country, and the opportunity for its people to move forward in an enterprise society to enable future generations after Brexit to guarantee their jobs, their businesses and their future.</p>            </div>

I regret some of the comments she made about the implications for relationships in Northern Ireland and the consequences associated with the Bill. Be it her contribution or many others on Wednesday and no doubt later today, there is an awful lot being said that is not only at cross purposes across the Chamber but completely misses the point. The right hon. Lady embarked on a political strategy that was encapsulated by the phrase &#8220;Brexit means Brexit&#8221;, and for nine months there was no greater clarity than that. Here we are four years later, and we know that what was outlined as a national aspiration and what was agreed to in a referendum by the people of this country is not being delivered for the people of Northern Ireland.</p> <p pid="d673.0/3">Members will remember the week in December 2017 when there was a flurry of activity around the formulation of what became the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK-EU">UK-EU</a> joint report. They will also remember the work that had to go into getting provisions placed in that joint report at paragraph 50, which not only represented the principle that it was of no concern for the European Union to impede or impose upon the integrity of a member state, but stated:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d673.0/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;the United Kingdom will ensure that no new regulatory barriers develop between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, unless, consistent with the 1998 Agreement, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Executive">Northern Ireland Executive</a> and Assembly agree&#8230; In all circumstances, the United Kingdom will continue to ensure the same unfettered access for Northern Ireland&#8217;s businesses to the whole of the United Kingdom internal market.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d673.0/5">That was in paragraph 50 of the joint report, but it was never honoured in the withdrawal agreement.</p>            </div>

Lady may be right on that point, but here we are yet again, seeking to legislate domestically within the United Kingdom to right the wrongs of a negotiation that should never have advanced in the way that it did. Our Government fell into the trap of trying to provide an answer when they did not know what the problem was. They did not know what the future trading relationship was going to be. They did not know what the overarching trade deal was going  to be between the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Government">United Kingdom Government</a> and the European Union, and yet they set out to solve the problem of the Irish border without knowing what the overarching provisions would be. That made no sense, and it led us to the position we are in today. Here I am this evening, asking Members to consider provisions that should be part of this Bill but are not and saying that there are aspirations associated with this Bill that should equally apply to Northern Ireland&#8212;the whole of the United Kingdom internal market, as stated in the joint report&#8212;but do not. That is hugely regrettable.</p> <p pid="d674.2/2">I spoke on Wednesday about <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 46, on the provision of financial aid, and my party&#8217;s <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 22 to clause 47, to ensure that there was no restriction on such aid for Northern Ireland businesses. The response from Government was, &#8220;That&#8217;s great. Thank you very much. Let&#8217;s consider it on Monday.&#8221; Here we stand on Monday. I have enormous respect for the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, but we are hearing, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about your amendments. We&#8217;ll consider them in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Bill">Finance Bill</a>.&#8221; There remain important concerns about the European Union state aid rules that will apply in Northern Ireland. There is nothing in this Bill, there is nothing in the Government&#8217;s approach, and there is nothing in their plan that seeks to amend or fetter the rule of EU state aid rules within Northern Ireland.</p>            </div>

It is for the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> and no one else to raise issues or notify the European Union on state aid issues.&#8221; I am concerned not just about the operation of that provision, but the chilling  effect that the application of state aid rules from the European Union has, when the Government consider the potential support that they could give to businesses in Northern Ireland. Again today, we hear that it applies only to goods and electricity, but I think it applies to services of those manufactured goods as well. I think there is a financial threshold of around half a million pounds, but much more clarity is required from the Government on the application of state aid rules in Northern Ireland, because all I hear is an effort to make sure that the EU does not encroach on GB affairs without any consequential understanding or recognition of&#8212;or aspiration to solve&#8212;the problems that we will face in Northern Ireland.</p>            </div>

Arguably, if the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> and officialdom in <a href="/glossary/?gl=101" title="Whitehall is a wide road that runs through the heart of Westminster,..." class="glossary">Whitehall</a> had not offered such religious observance to EU regulations over the past 40 years, this country would not have agreed to leave the European Union. We know that of other countries in the European Union, France has, en fran&#231;ais, an &#224; la carte approach to which regulations are important and which are not. The religious observance of regulations in this country has caused that chill factor and it is why people built up frustrations and resentment on the application of those regulations over the years. There is a fear that that could happen in this case.</p> <p pid="d675.1/2">Let us consider the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addison_Lee">Addison Lee</a> case on state aid application of rules in this country. Addison Lee wanted to use bus lanes in London, but it was told it could not use them. Addison Lee took a case on the state aid implications because it thought the state was unfairly given an advantage over Addison Lee in London. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> Government&#8217;s position was &#8220;Catch yourself on! It is a UK-funded public service versus a UK private business, and EU state aid rules do not apply&#8221; but the EU resolved that, yes, the rules were engaged because Addison Lee could equally have been owned by representatives from another member state. That is how the question was resolved, and Addison Lee can now use bus lanes. I have no doubt that the far-reaching implications of state aid law would open the opportunity for claims from elsewhere.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d676.0/1">I do agree. I know that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> went through a number of the amendments we have tabled and said, &#8220;Look, there are provisions about direct and non-direct discrimination and those still apply.&#8221; However, where a business is competing in a sector for which there are state subventions and subsidies in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England,_Scotland_and_Wales">England, Scotland and Wales</a> but where those same subsidies and subventions are precluded in Northern Ireland, there will be discrimination. There will be an unfair playing field in the economy of this internal market, and that square is not circled in this Bill. There are no satisfactory answers from the Government to say, &#8220;If we run with the implication of EU state aid rules in Northern Ireland, and if we support businesses in GB but not in Northern Ireland, how is there not unfair competition? How are there not direct or indirect discriminatory outworkings of the provisions of this arrangement?&#8221;</p> <p pid="d676.0/2">I want to draw the Minister&#8217;s attention to a useful document, which I hope he will spend time considering. I refer to the Northern Ireland stakeholder response to the UK&#8217;s research and development road map consultation, which considers clearly some of the things the Government could do under clauses 46 and 47 in providing financial support for sectors in Northern Ireland. We hear an awful lot in this Chamber about doubling down on levelling up. We know that research and development support across the UK is hugely uneven, and that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of that money goes into the south-east of England, to London and to the east of England, and that Northern Ireland and other regions throughout the UK do not get their fair share.</p> <p pid="d676.0/3">The stakeholder response is a collaborative piece of work by Belfast City Council, Belfast Harbour, Queen&#8217;s University, Ulster University and Catalyst Northern Ireland. It asks that the Government ring-fence R&amp;D support, with a minimum of &#163;250 million per year for Northern Ireland; that they create bespoke arrangements that allow for flexibility of funds for the Northern Ireland economy; that they appoint regional delivery partnerships; and that they are considering an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPA">ARPA</a>&#8212;advanced research projects agency&#8212;for the cyber-security hub in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>, our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FinTech">FinTech</a> hub, the advanced and high-end engineering and manufacturing in my constituency, and the aspirations of a digital free port in Belfast. That ARPA opportunity is well worth considering and it is well worth showing that even though we may have an uneven playing field, our Government are serious about doubling down on levelling up and will extend support to Northern Ireland.</p> <p pid="d676.0/4">I would love to go through a lot of the amendments, but I am conscious that I have gone over my self-imposed timeline, so I will just discuss the importance of <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 68, which proposes a change to <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 40. It proposes that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly">Northern Ireland Assembly</a> consent would be required for any new arrangements or requirements for goods traded from GB to NI, and new requirements would not come into force unless they were agreed with the consent of the Assembly. It would also provide that:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d676.0/5" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;No additional official or administrative costs&#8221;&#8212; arising from new requirements&#8212;</p> <p class="indent" pid="d676.0/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;may be recouped from the private sector.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d676.0/8"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> referred to the trader supporter service, and we know that the Government have said that there are going to put &#163;355 million into that service at this stage. Huge questions remain unanswered for businesses in Northern Ireland, which have heard that they have unfettered access to the UK internal market. Some understand that that promise is one way; some understand that that promise is NI to GB. Some do not understand that there are huge constraints on GB to NI trade, because the Government gave that power away in the withdrawal agreement. They passed it to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a> and therefore they are only half of the equation. We know that the Joint Committee is considering what goods are at risk, but businesses are trying to access goods in the rest of GB and their suppliers are saying, &#8220;Are we able to send this to you? Will we be able to sell you these goods? Will we be required to file exit declarations? Will there be a cost for us doing business with you in Northern Ireland, one that we are not prepared to meet or you are not prepared to pay?&#8221; If that is the case, it makes a whole nonsense of this internal UK market.</p>            </div>

Gentleman reads the content of the amendment, he will see that. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly">Northern Ireland Assembly</a> has cross-community voting mechanisms not to provide vetoes but to encourage consensus. The hon. Members on the Benches to my left know exactly why those provisions were brought in, and they know the importance of them, but they tend to believe that they are worthy of use only when there is an issue for which they wish to use them. That is hugely regrettable. When I talk about the consent of the Northern Ireland Assembly, I know that there are cross-community mechanisms to ensure that we get to a place of consensus. I do not believe in stalemate or in logjams. I have spent my political life trying to resolve them. I hope that when I contribute on issues in this House, people respect the fact that, although I do not necessarily agree with everyone, I try to get to a place where we can agree.</p> <p pid="d677.1/2">Businesses in Northern Ireland that buy from GB and wish to sell to GB want to know what their trading position will be.

I hope he does that. I hope he offers some clarity and comfort for businesses in Northern Ireland, and I hope he outlines just how the Bill will assist them. I believe that it will not  do so, however, so I hope that he gives us some clarity as to what steps the Government are prepared to take in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Bill">Finance Bill</a> to resolve these overarching and burdening issues, which remain unresolved, through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a>.</p>            </div>

I say that it is not edifying because, although much of the purpose of the Bill is important and valuable, to act in contemplation of something that most of us would regard as unworthy&#8212;namely, to breach an international obligation&#8212;is not something that one should ever seek to discuss lightly. Equally, it is not something that can ever be an absolute, because there can be certain extreme and pressing circumstances where such a derogation is permissible, but the bar has to be a very high one.

That is why, having thought and hesitated for some time, I am prepared to allow the Government the opportunity to make that case. None the less, it is a high bar, and I have to say that the fact that other jurisdictions&#8212;be it the EU or others&#8212;may have derogated from international treaties is not of itself persuasive. Many of us would need to be persuaded by the evidence that was brought in relation to the specific circumstances that might trigger the bringing into force of the three clauses under the arrangements set out in Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 66.

I think that they recognise that that case would have to be a persuasive one, and that the level of breach by the EU&#8212;which would have to be a breach of its obligation of good faith, which in turn would be a breach, it seems to me, of the obligations under article 26 of the Vienna convention to operate in good faith&#8212;would have to be made out before I and many others would be prepared to vote for such a course, because of the potential consequences for our international reputation and standing. That is why I am prepared to adopt the formulation of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=263" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Chancellor" class="glossary">Lord Chancellor</a> that such a thing might be acceptable in extremis. This is not a carte blanche for the Government, and, in fairness, I do not think Ministers have ever taken it as such; I think they know that it weighs heavily to do such a thing. If the Government move <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 66 at the relevant stage tomorrow, I will be prepared not to press my amendment, but it is to give the Government the chance to make their case as to why such an exceptional step should be necessary.</p> <p pid="d680.2/3">It is not wise or constructive to conflate the positions of domestic and international law in this debate; they operate in different spheres, and much of what we are looking at would be in relation to treaty law. A test that is not dissimilar&#8212;although it can never be exactly the same&#8212;to those considered in the Vienna convention is, therefore, not out of the way.</p> <p pid="d680.2/4">I welcome, too, the fact that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> indicated that the measures that would be initiated would include the arbitral provisions under the protocol to the withdrawal agreement. To try to oust those provisions would be a material breach of the agreement on our part, and would be unconscionable. Under certain circumstances the timeframe for that might not be capable of being resolved in such a way that we might not have to take some proportionate and temporary action ourselves to safeguard a vital interest, but I am sure the Minister and the House will note that I choose my words carefully in all those regards. This is not a green light to treating our international obligations lightly or cavalierly; it is an opportunity for the Government to justify why it  might be necessary. One cannot give undertakings as to what that might be until we have seen the evidence at the appropriate time, and I am sure the Government know that, too. But I hope that in practice this also has the desirable effect of enabling the negotiations to proceed and, at the end of the day&#8212;with good faith on both sides, which I hope, underneath, is still there&#8212;we can get an agreement with the European Union and leave on the terms of a deal. That may not be as good as I would have liked, but much of what I have been doing ever since the referendum is trying to mitigate a circumstance that I did not wish for but which I believe has to be addressed head-on for the sake of the country. If we can achieve an agreement, I hope these provisions will be otiose and we will see no more of them. The rest of the Bill is necessary because we need a proper and efficient working of our internal market once we leave the European Union. Therefore, my other motive for adopting the course that I have is not to obstruct the rest of the Bill needlessly.</p> <p pid="d680.2/5">It is in that spirit&#8212;which has, in fairness, been reflected in my exchanges with the Minister&#8212;that I set out the case for why the amendment is important to debate and to consider. If the Government are able to deliver in the terms that we have discussed, I will give them the chance to make their case, if it ever be necessary, in the profound hope that we never actually get to that.</p>            </div>

Member for North Down (Stephen Farry)'">Stephen Farry</a>.</p> <p pid="d681.0/2">There has been so much invocation of the Good Friday agreement, in favour and against the measures in the Bill, that I think it bears repeating some of what is and is not contained and implied in that generation-defining agreement. Those who have read the agreement will know that it does not really talk all that much about borders, trade and internal markets, because, frankly, the EU had settled all those things, and in 1998 the prospect of either Government choosing to leave the security, opportunity and prosperity of the EU would have been considered insanity.</p> <p pid="d681.0/3">Violence was the reason for the continuing fortifications. The Good Friday agreement was the document that articulated most clearly the argument, which had been made by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hume">John Hume</a> and others for so many years, that violence was neither needed nor justified. It took the gun out of Irish politics and ensured that the purported justification of those behind the violence was addressed. The agreement was then endorsed by the people of Ireland, north and south, in overwhelming numbers, and endorsed by both Governments, as the only way to achieve your politics. It took away the excuse and put peaceful constitutional views to the fore. It meant that Unionists, nationalists and others could have their views with dignity and that we all had a decent pass forward.</p> <p pid="d681.0/4">The Good Friday agreement does not say much about borders and trade, but it does say a lot about relationships, aspirations, consensus and respect, and I think that those are the values that unfortunately have been most damaged and will be most damaged by the Bill.

Only somebody with absolutely no understanding or who is so disingenuous would ask the question of where the violence comes from as if just a hope is a good enough reason to ride over a solemn peace treaty. Only somebody who either misunderstands or misdirects people would ask such a disingenuous question, and ask it repeatedly. We know that unfortunately there are many people of different political hues who have always sought to use violence as an excuse. That is why my party and others did the heavy lifting to ensure peace, while your party stood outside, waved placards and did everything it could to thwart the Good Friday agreement. So I will take no lectures or disingenuous questions, thank you very much.</p> <p pid="d682.2/2">The Good Friday agreement did talk about democratic and agreed arrangements, the democratic process and the primacy of the rule of law. It talked about close co-operation as friendly neighbours and partners in the EU. Each strand of the agreement has been damaged by the last few years, and they will be damaged further by the Bill. Strand 1, which deals with internal relationships in Northern Ireland, is damaged by injecting these binary choices and by trespassing into the devolved field. However, I will not, for reasons of time, go over the points that I and others made last Wednesday evening, about what undermining the devolved settlement might do.</p> <p pid="d682.2/3">Strand 2, which deals with relationships on the island of Ireland, will be utterly undermined by the creeping borderism that will follow from the Bill and the disruption of the north-south frameworks. Strand 3 deals with the east-west relationships, which clearly have been strained almost to breaking point over the past few years. It is because of the primacy of relationships that barriers to trade and aspiration offend the Good Friday agreement. Those who are seeking to say, &#8220;It isn&#8217;t written down anywhere, so there is no problem here&#8221; need to understand that.</p> <p pid="d682.2/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_SDLP">The SDLP</a> profoundly regrets the development of any barrier&#8212;east-west; the border in the Irish sea&#8212;for reasons of trade and economy, but also because we understand that borders have symbolic meaning to people, and we understand that this is particularly hurtful and egregious to those of a Unionist or British identity.</p> <p pid="d682.2/5">We have enjoyed, for the last 20 years, interdependence and free movement east, west, north and south, and it is Brexit and these decisions that are forcing the choice. It is not re-fighting the last campaign to remind people  that the problem is not the protocol, it is not the EU and it is not uppity Irish nationalists, but it is this Government&#8217;s failure to choose between a higher degree of alignment with the EU, which offends the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Research_Group">European Research Group</a>, the ability to diverge, which will upset and offend people of a Unionist background, and the nuclear option of forcing a hard border on the island of Ireland. Quite clearly, the last two weeks have shown and give some reassurance that the UK will have no trading partners if that is the course it chooses.</p>            </div>

We heard a lot about them for a lot of years, but the magic sovereignty dust that was supposed to solve all of our problems has not yet been produced.</p> <p pid="d683.1/2">However, it is true that the choices, and they are very difficult choices, are being forced by that Government. We wish that the Government had picked the first of those options. We wish they had picked a higher degree of alignment with the EU, but they did not, and they cannot keep reopening the wound every time they try to deal with the contradictory promises they made. Whatever Bill the Government bring in, the choice will be the same. You cannot opt out of the biggest free trade bloc in the world and then feign shock when the trade is not completely clear, and you cannot refuse to do the first of the two things and then pretend that they are going to happen.</p> <p pid="d683.1/3">To suggest that any of this is about protecting the Good Friday agreement or the people of Northern Ireland is beyond a parody. We have worked intensively with businesses and other parties to try to address some of the barriers that we accept will exist, but we have to remind the House and others that it is this Government&#8217;s choice and the failure of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DUP">DUP</a> for the last three years to do anything about those choices that has brought us to this point, and people must own those decisions. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a> is the place to address those difficulties and those operational issues, and there are the dispute mechanisms.</p> <p pid="d683.1/4">We see and we very much acknowledge the anxiety that east-west barriers to trade create, but even with the politics and the identity issues stripped out, it is a regrettable fact that the sea border is more practical and more manageable than a border across the island of Ireland, given that there are three such points of entry into Northern Ireland and 108 border crossings between the Republic of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland_and_Northern_Ireland">Ireland and Northern Ireland</a>. I do not say that to be hurtful; I say it because it is true.</p> <p pid="d683.1/5">I bit my tongue several times during the speech from <a href="/mp/?p=25280" title="Our page on Gavin Robinson - 'the hon. Member for Belfast East (Gavin Robinson)'">Gavin Robinson</a>, whose opinion is always considered. I bit it for a number of reasons. Not only because of course your party opposed giving a consent mechanism to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly">Northern Ireland Assembly</a> on article 50 and opposed giving consent on the sequencing, but because you speak about the sequencing. We have seen what has happened with the gamification of the sequencing and the gamification and using of Northern Ireland as a pawn by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> in order to achieve outcomes and to justify no deal. The last thing I had to bite my tongue about was your saying that the petition of concern is not used as a veto. Members can look it up, but your party has used it 86 times. It used it numerous times to veto, for example, equal marriage for absolutely no reasons of offence to the United Kingdom.</p>            </div>

I am not going to rehearse the figures, but I believe that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Unionist">Democratic Unionist</a> party used the petition of concern approximately two thirds of the time. You do not have the power to use it now because the electorate took that power off you, because it was wielded inappropriately so many times. I am acknowledging very clearly the barriers and impediments that this will create and the intentions of many to try to address those, but whatever the value of trade east-west&#8212;I see and acknowledge that value, but it is often cited by people who seem to know the price of everything and the value of nothing&#8212;the reality is that there are more people and more units that move up and down the island than move between the two islands. In fact, after <phrase class="date" code="2020-01-01">1 January</phrase> next year, there will be more external crossings into the EU on the island of Ireland than there will be in the rest of the continent&#8217;s borders.</p> <p pid="d684.1/2">Those who support the Bill and the last few years of poor decision making have to acknowledge the intellectual and moral failure in a position that says that a border down the Irish sea is absolutely impossible technically and impossible to bear politically, but that somehow forcing one on the island of Ireland is dead-on, that we can deal with that with a bit of administration and that people are being overly sensitive. Imperfect though I acknowledge the protocol is, it is the baseline protection against the border, so repudiation of the protocol therefore makes a border a lot more likely, and inevitable.</p> <p pid="d684.1/3">I agree with <a href="/mp/?p=10426" title="Our page on Theresa May - 'the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)'">Mrs May</a>&#8212;we believe that the clauses we are dealing with today are irredeemable&#8212;and I appreciate her interventions very much. Over the few years that she served as <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, while I frequently did not agree with what she said, I could always acknowledge that she was trying to respect the sensitivities. I respect those who are trying to manoeuvre their party to the right place. I know that that is a very difficult thing to  do, particularly when 21 decent MPs were sacked for refusing to vote for the previous Bill, and now they will be sacked if they do vote for the withdrawal agreement&#8212;I think that is the sequencing of things.</p> <p pid="d684.1/4">The amendments that we have tabled seek to protect the protocol and put the commitment to the Good Friday agreement into the Bill. While I appreciate the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8217;s words, my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25130" title="Our page on Colum Eastwood - 'the Member for Foyle (Colum Eastwood)'">Colum Eastwood</a> has made it clear that the words do not mean anything if you refuse the opportunity to give it legislative effect. <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> 47 tries to put in place an understanding and an assurance that all of the Bill&#8217;s operation will be compatible with all the legislation that underpins the Good Friday agreement. While the UK&#8217;s intention is clear&#8212;I accept what it is trying to do, but I think it is doing it inappropriately and I do not think it will work&#8212;it is about rejecting EU jurisdiction, and the fact is that because of the international treaty that is the Good Friday agreement, international law has jurisdiction in Northern Ireland. That is welcome, and the rights and safeguards in the equality of opportunity section of the Good Friday agreement confirmed the incorporation of the convention on human rights into Northern Ireland law, with direct access to the courts and remedies for breach of the convention, including power for the courts to overrule Assembly legislation on grounds of consistency. That point is echoed again in strand 1 of the agreement, and it must be very clear that my party, certainly, could not and would not have signed up to the Good Friday agreement without those commitments, but this Bill casts them into the wind.</p> <p pid="d684.1/5">It is clear that we are not talking about narrow and specific breaches. These are going to be open-ended and unchecked powers, and there will not be any qualifications or consultations to test their basis. I sought assurances on Wednesday night from the Minister that there would be limits to the powers, and I did not receive that assurance.</p> <p pid="d684.1/6">Members may think that this is all a big game of chicken, or a negotiating strategy or whatever with the EU. I urge them to remember the words of the late <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hume">John Hume</a>, a former Member of this House, who said very clearly, &#8220;Victories are not solutions&#8221;. The agreement that he designed talked about the obligations of the British and Irish Governments to promote the harmonious and mutually beneficial relationships between the peoples of these islands. I dearly hope that that can somehow still be our future. We are all in the business of trying to deliver solutions for our constituents. I appreciate that some of you are trying to deliver a Brexit and your Brexit deal, however ill-advised I think that is. I am trying to deliver stability and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, but I believe your Bill prevents both of us from proceeding.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d686.0/1">I will bear your comments on timing in mind, Sir Graham, and try to rattle through. It is a pleasure to follow a very powerful speech from <a href="/mp/?p=25447" title="Our page on Claire Hanna - 'the hon. Member for Belfast South (Claire Hanna)'">Claire Hanna</a>. We may disagree on some quite fundamental things, but I very much welcome her input to this debate.</p> <p pid="d686.0/2">I rise to support the Bill and the Government amendments, because we need to ensure that goods and trade can flow freely across our United Kingdom without unnecessary barriers. I see regaining control of how we regulate our economy as one of the key benefits of Brexit. That is not because I want any kind of race to the bottom. I want to maintain high standards. In some areas, there is clearly a case for introducing more rigorous regulation, for example to bring an end to the live export of animals for slaughter or fattening, but regaining domestic control over regulation will enable us to produce rules that are more targeted and more effective at tackling the problem they are designed to address, and which we can update more quickly as circumstances change. All those could be crucial in improving our global competitiveness, and in supporting jobs and growth during this time of grave economic damage caused by covid-19.</p> <p pid="d686.0/3">I spent six years in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament">European Parliament</a> before coming to <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> and I was heavily involved in debates on the creation of new EU regulation. I spent nearly two years of my life on the markets in financial instruments directive. I can say, from seeing the process at first hand, that it is long and painful to produce EU legislation, and that it frequently produces outcomes that are inflexible, bureaucratic, heavy-handed and create unnecessary costs. I believe that in this House and in this nation, we can do better. We can deliver a regulatory system that is more responsive, more agile and more proportionate.</p> <p pid="d686.0/4">As we have heard from many speakers, and as we well know from the debate over the past year, the Northern Ireland protocol will inevitably have an impact on the flow of goods across the Irish sea. That was one of the most painful compromises that was made in reaching agreement on the withdrawal treaty. Certainly for me that was one of the things I found most difficult in deciding whether I could support it. However, there can be no doubt that the Government are pressing ahead with implementing the protocol. Extensive preparations have been made by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> for a new system for compliance with both customs and sanitary and phytosanitary obligations, as required by the protocol. It is simply not true to allege that the Government, with this proposed legislation, are somehow ripping up the protocol or repudiating the treaty.</p> <p pid="d686.0/5">What we cannot do is let the European Union run down the clock on securing agreement on the scope of the key concept of goods at risk of being re-exported to the EU, because that would mean a default would kick in requiring customs compliance for all goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That, of course, would lead to a full customs border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, violating article 4 of the  protocol. It would also change the status of Northern Ireland within the UK, contrary to the provisions of the Belfast agreement.</p> <p pid="d686.0/6">Concern about the potential for the EU to adopt  an unreasonable and absolutist approach to the question of goods at risk is, frankly, compounded by the Commission&#8217;s current refusal to list the UK as a country is deemed fit to export food to the EU. As Environment Secretary, I was able to secure that authorisation in the event that we had left at the end of January without an exit treaty, but I have to say that it was not an easy process. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a>&#8217;s compliance with all current EU <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a>, including on food and animals, should mean that giving us third country status is a straightforward administrative decision, so it is therefore very hard to understand why the EU is withholding consent, for example, for us to export products to the European Union, which it permits from countries with which it has far weaker links and which have, arguably, far less rigorous standards. They include, to take just a few, Russia, Serbia, Chile, Thailand, Ukraine and Cuba. Even the Republic of Iran is on the approved list for certain products.</p> <p pid="d686.0/7">In these circumstances, I can support the precautions taken in clauses 41 to 45 to allow Ministers to make decisions on how aspects of the protocol will operate in practice if these important matters cannot be resolved in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a>. I honestly think that these clauses are unlikely ever to be used, but what they can do is prevent the EU from being able to use article 5 provisions to exert leverage over the United Kingdom to try to lock us into its regulatory orbit, bound by its laws and its Court.</p> <p pid="d686.0/8"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_the_European_Union">Leaving the European Union</a> does not mean becoming a client state of the European Union. That is why I voted three times against the first version of the withdrawal treaty, and that is why I am backing this Bill in the Lobby this evening.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d687.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <a href="/mp/?p=11500" title="Our page on Theresa Villiers - 'the right hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Theresa Villiers)'">Theresa Villiers</a>. Although I fundamentally disagree with her on Brexit, I certainly recognise her work in Northern Ireland when she was <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>. I refer, in particular, to her work on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormont_House">Stormont House</a> agreement, though I think it is worth noting that that is another agreement that the Government are in the process of breaching as well.</p> <p pid="d687.0/2">I primarily want to speak to the amendments of which I am the lead sponsor&#8212;<a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 41 and new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 6&#8212;but also to make wider reference to part 5 of the Bill. In brief, amendment 41 seeks to ensure that everything in part 5 is consistent with international law obligations and also with the Good Friday agreement in all of its parts, though it would be preferable to strike clauses 42 to 45 from the Bill in their entirety, but, at this stage, amendment 41 is a catch-all to try to ensure that it is compliant insofar as that is possible. New clause 6 is about putting into law the correct approach to addressing the issue of export declarations and other exit procedures in terms of trying to get a good resolution through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a>.</p> <p pid="d687.0/3">I want to make some general comments about the threat to international law that is contained in part 5 of the Bill and to echo that the Government amendment is essentially cosmetic. It does not address the issue. I am  someone who is usually a gradualist and who will bank progress, but this is not that type of situation. This will not convince anybody of the UK&#8217;s good intentions. In essence, the threat to breach international law will still be codified in the legislation and that is not a basis on which any state can do business internationally. It will undermine the ability of the UK to manage its existing agreements, and also to conclude future agreements. The reputation of the UK internationally will fall with very serious consequences. Our ability to hold other regimes to account for breaches of democracy, human rights and the rule of law will be compromised; and the UK does have a strong record in that regard, or at least had a strong record up until this particular point in time.</p> <p pid="d687.0/4">More specifically, part 5 will undermine the ability of the UK to conclude a future relationship arrangement with the European Union. That will have severe consequences for the UK economy. To me, it seems as if a dead-end approach is being adopted by those who claim to want such a deal, and I am not quite sure how that will be a sustainable position.</p> <p pid="d687.0/5">Even beyond that, the prospects of a US-UK trade deal are very much called into question. For those who have the fantasy of an Atlanticist approach to replace the relationship with our nearest neighbour, I really struggle to understand how they believe that the approach they are taking will actually allow that dream to be realised. Of course, we should all want a deal with the United States, albeit one that we negotiate from a position of strength&#8212;people have some genuine concerns about that&#8212;but I am not sure that people fully appreciate whow difficult that will be, particularly in terms of Congress and what <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a> Pelosi and indeed some members of the Republican party have said. This is an ultimate dead end, and Members who still believe it is doable need to reflect very seriously on what has been said to them.</p> <p pid="d687.0/6">I will also comment on what I think is a major misunderstanding, or lack of understanding, in some parts of the House with respect to the Good Friday agreement. At times, I get the sense that the Government are almost twisting the understanding of the Good Friday agreement to fit their particular political objectives. It is important that Members understand that a fault line runs right through Northern Ireland. Anyone familiar with history will well appreciate why I am saying that. Northern Ireland is both a divided society and a contested space, particularly with regard to the latter in that there are different constitutional aspirations for the future of that part of the world. We have been on a journey through the Good Friday agreement, but the work of building integration and promoting reconciliation is still very much in progress. More needs to be done.</p> <p pid="d687.0/7">It is true&#8212;this is where the Government are placing all their emphasis&#8212;that the principle of consent is a core aspect of the agreement. I concur with that, and indeed it is recognised fundamentally within the withdrawal agreement, although people may have different aspirations regarding where that goes in due course. However, the agreement is also about the interlocking relationships, the internal dynamics in Northern Ireland, the north-south relationship and the east-west relationship, and the wider context of the improvement of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Irish">Anglo-Irish</a> relations, which gave rise to the agreement in the first place and which, up until now, have been working to try to ensure that the agreement stays on course.</p>            </div>

Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> associated with Northern Ireland. That has to be recognised. Do you recognise, as a Unionist, that this does not give you much comfort?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d689.4/1">I am grateful to the hon. Member for his <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a>. I think his question was aimed at me, rather than you, Sir Graham. First, just to give Members some encouragement, Members from Northern Ireland can sort out some choreography at times in terms of speaking, so all is not lost entirely, but it is important that the hon. Member appreciates a number of points.</p> <p pid="d689.4/2">As I said, the principle of consent is hard-wired into the withdrawal agreement. At the same time, however, I think it is naive not to accept that what had been a relatively stable situation in Northern Ireland around the constitutional question has become much more fluid in recent years, to a large extent because of the fallout from Brexit. Whichever way things emerge over the coming months there will be some degree of political instability in that respect, and it is incumbent on us all to try to come to terms with that, to manage that and to keep people on board, making Northern Ireland work over the months and years to come.</p> <p pid="d689.4/3">I also stress to the hon. Member that another way of looking at the agreement is that it was, in essence, a grand bargain. We are approaching the centenary of Northern Ireland next year. For most of its history, Northern Ireland was a contested state and some people did not accept its legitimacy. We had a situation, for example, where the Irish constitution had a claim on the territory of Northern Ireland through articles 2 and 3.</p> <p pid="d689.4/4">With the Good Friday agreement, arguably for the first time we had a sense that the vast <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of people on the island of Ireland accepted the legitimacy of Northern Ireland as an entity, albeit with the ability to change recognised as part of that agreement. That was a major win, particularly for Unionism. At the same time, there was a recognition of the interlocking relationships&#8212;in particular, the north-south aspect&#8212;on the island of Ireland. The problem is that Brexit has come in and destabilised that. In particular I have to say to my Unionist colleagues that their charge headlong into Brexit, given that grand bargain, was most irresponsible and short-sighted.</p> <p pid="d689.4/5">It would not have been possible for the Good Friday agreement to be concluded if the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_and_Ireland">UK and Ireland</a> were not simultaneously part of the European Union&#8212;in particular, the customs union and the single market. The protocol is a product of the UK&#8217;s decisions, choices  and red lines on Brexit, so if there are concerns, grumbles or complaints about it, it is a product of decisions taken primarily by people in this Chamber over the past number of years.</p> <p pid="d689.4/6">In essence, there is a trilemma at the heart of this: the UK set out three mutually incompatible objectives, only two of which can be realised at any one time. The first was that there would be an open border on the island of Ireland, the second was that the whole of the UK would leave the customs union and single market, and the third was that special measures for Northern Ireland were ruled out. The first has been a given for the best part of four years, and was rightly recognised at the start of the Brexit negotiations. The second was the determination of this House, which ruled out a softer version of Brexit, with the entire UK remaining part of the customs union and single market&#8212;an outcome that would still have been consistent with the referendum result. The third is something that the UK has essentially had to concede through the protocol.</p> <p pid="d689.4/7">Whatever way we look at this, when a decision was taken to leave the customs union and single market, some sort of interface was going to have to be managed with the European Union&#8217;s single market and customs union. The backstop was the first attempt&#8212;I believe it was much maligned and a missed opportunity. The protocol was the next alternative, and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> bought into it last October. It is an attempt to square an impossible circle, but we have to do our best in that regard; there will not be a neat and easy solution. The protocol is imperfect, but it represents the bare minimum of what is required to address the particular challenges and circumstances that Northern Ireland faces.</p> <p pid="d689.4/8">Like <a href="/mp/?p=25447" title="Our page on Claire Hanna - 'the hon. Member for Belfast South (Claire Hanna)'">Claire Hanna</a>, I do not want to see any borders anywhere inside these islands, but we have to face the reality that some line will have to be drawn on a map, and wherever it is, some political, emotional and psychological implications will arise from it. It is easier to manage that down the Irish sea than on a land border, as a purely pragmatic analysis of the situation. As has been said, there are seven crossings down the Irish sea, and potentially more than 200 on the land border. People talk about the value of east-west trade, and I certainly recognise that, but the counterpoint to that is to recognise the sheer number of movements on the island of Ireland. The opportunity to have some degree of regulation is more readily applied on the Irish sea interface because there is more dead time, in terms of air and sea travel, than there is on the land border, with land-based transport and much more just-in-time delivery. Those are the sad choices that we are being asked to face up to in Northern Ireland.</p> <p pid="d689.4/9">We need to make the protocol as light touch as we can to move from what is essentially a solid line on a map to a dotted line. We need to work through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a> to address the outstanding issues and agree the future relationship. That would make the application of the protocol much easier. To make progress in both respects, the UK has to build up the trust and confidence of the European Union. Essentially, the UK is asking the EU to take it on trust that certain procedures that would otherwise be rigorously required under the terms of the protocol can be disapplied, with flexibilities and modifications shown. The situation with the UK threatening to breach the very withdrawal agreement that gives rise  to the protocol will not give the European Union confidence that the UK will honour any flexibilities that it chooses to grant through the protocol.</p> <p pid="d689.4/10">New <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 6 sets out perhaps one example of the type of situation I am referring to. In essence, the protocol reflects the fact that Northern Ireland remains part of the UK&#8217;s customs territory, but the EU customs code is applied down the Irish sea. That was the compromise&#8212;I stress that&#8212;worked out last year by the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, among others.</p> <p pid="d689.4/11">The EU is entitled to police the integrity of a single market and customs union and to determine how that takes place. However, I firmly believe we can obtain the forgoing of export declarations and other export procedures through discussions in the Joint Committee, if there is that degree of confidence. It should be possible to agree a situation where those things are disapplied entirely, or some alternative statistical method to work out what is actually moving into Great Britain, or indeed some method of differentiating between Northern Ireland urgent goods and urgent goods for elsewhere on the island of Ireland or further afield. All that is eminently doable.</p> <p pid="d689.4/12">In the same way&#8212;Members have alluded to this coming back in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Bill">Finance Bill</a>&#8212;the issue of goods at risk moving from Great Britain into Northern Ireland can be addressed through the Joint Committee. The default&#8212;I stress that it is the default&#8212;is that all goods at this stage will be treated as at risk. Obviously, we have to reduce that as far as possible, and ideally to zero, and put in place different measures, but once again that has to be done through goodwill being built up.</p> <p pid="d689.4/13">My plea to Members is to not go down the line of breaching international law. That is entirely self-defeating, counterproductive and will not only undermine our position in terms of Northern Ireland, but will also do huge damage to the UK&#8217;s economy and standing in the world.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d691.0/1">I am conscious that everyone needs to get in, so I will try to be as brief as possible. Most of the things I will say have probably already been said and certainly will be said in the course of the debate. I make no claim to uniqueness.</p> <p pid="d691.0/2">I rise to support the Government&#8217;s Bill with particular reference to clauses 40 to 45, which we are considering today. After all, the free flow of goods and trade in the UK is critical and is part of the constitutional settlement&#8212;the settlements between <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland_and_GB">Ireland and GB</a> and, later, Northern Ireland and, earlier, Scotland and England. Those principles are at the core of what we believe and what we consider to be immutable, and therefore they cannot be changed. There are areas in the protocol that, if improperly used, could affect those principles, and that cannot be allowed.</p> <p pid="d691.0/3">I remind colleagues that in the European Union (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_Agreement">Withdrawal Agreement</a>) Act 2020&#8212;nobody seems to have referenced this&#8212;our potential intentions were very clear in section 38, which was part of the legislation when it was passed. As I recall, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> did not vote against that provision. If that was the case, it sent a very strong signal to the EU that there was every likelihood that we considered that constitutional settlement in the UK to be above the implementation of the  withdrawal agreement, should the agreement end up damaging the settlement. That was quite clear. In fact, it was so clear that when the 2020 Act had passed both Houses, interestingly the EU still went ahead and ratified its end of the agreement through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament">European Parliament</a>, knowing full well that that was in the Act. If the EU disagreed with that provision or disagreed with the principle, it should not have ratified the treaty at its end, but it made no bones about it and did it.</p> <p pid="d691.0/4">The effect of clauses 40 to 45 is just to protect the basic implementation of the UK&#8217;s internal market in terms of its constitution. I recognise the concerns of my colleagues in Northern Ireland about the application of state aids in Northern Ireland as well, but in this case the provisions allow state aids in Great Britain to be dispensed under the framework devised in this country, and not elsewhere. It seems intolerable to me that we should leave the EU only to find that it has hold of us in a number of ways that, as my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=11500" title="Our page on Theresa Villiers - 'the Member for Chipping Barnet (Theresa Villiers)'">Theresa Villiers</a> said, were categorically never the intention.</p> <p pid="d691.0/5">I do not believe that the Bill actually breaks international treaties, particularly not at this stage. I think article 46 in the Vienna convention on the law of treaties is clear about that. These things are always open to interpretation &#8212;I accept that&#8212;and different lawyers will take different views, but generally I think that at this stage in particular the Bill does not do that. My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=13736" title="Our page on Bob Neill - 'the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Sir Robert Neill)'">Sir Robert Neill</a> was clear that that was one of the reasons he is prepared to go along and accommodate the Government on this point, and that is quite reasonable.</p> <p pid="d691.0/6">The combined effect of article 4 of the withdrawal agreement and section 7A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 is that key parts of the withdrawal agreement and the NIP are already part of domestic law. That therefore makes it impossible for the Government, should they see that the EU is not acting in good faith at this point, to ensure that there is, in a sense, a backstop.</p> <p pid="d691.0/7">I raised a point with <a href="/mp/?p=24943" title="Our page on Paul Blomfield - 'the hon. Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield)'">Paul Blomfield</a> earlier about the EU&#8217;s behaviour in this. My point was not, &#8220;Look, the EU doesn&#8217;t always recognise international law, as applied internally, and therefore we shouldn&#8217;t.&#8221; That was not the point. The point I was making was that we talk a lot about trust, and there is a lot of debate here about trust, with people saying, &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> will lose all trust should it do this; no one will ever trust us again&#8221;&#8212;I do not believe a word of that, by the way, because so many other countries, including the UK, have previously breached international law, for lots of good reasons&#8212;but the EU binds it in that it is its right to breach international law.</p> <p pid="d691.0/8">That was very clear, as I said earlier, in Kadi v. Council and Commission in 2008. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocate_General">Advocate General</a> made it very clear that the EU does not necessarily have to bind into international treaties with direct effect if they clash with its constitutional settlement. They do so time and again, which has given us a very long list of occasions when the EU has done just that and refused to implement all or part of international treaties. I do not extol its virtues in that regard; I simply regard that as a reality.</p> <p pid="d691.0/9">What does that say? Does the rest of the world say that the EU cannot be trusted in international agreements? So far, apparently not. So far, it has done deals with a  number of different countries and not one of them has said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t trust you, because you breach international law,&#8221; which it does. But the UK has also breached international law. In fact, it was a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> that refused to implement, in about 2005, as I recall, prisoners&#8217; voting rights, which came directly from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=199" title="Also referred to as the ECHR, the European Court of Human Rights was..." class="glossary">European Court of Human Rights</a>. All that happened was that the Government said no. It took 10 years before that was resolved. It was not resolved because the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a>&#8212;I think at that stage it was a Conservative Government and my right hon. Friend  <a href="/mp/?p=10426" title="Our page on Theresa May - 'the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)'">Mrs May</a> was <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>&#8212;implemented it. No, they negotiated again over its implementation and observance, and came up with a fudge.</p> <p pid="d691.0/10">That is the point about international law: it is not always directly applicable by the letter. Ultimately, when it is not agreed that things should be brought in, they require negotiation subsequently. That is why I say that my right hon. Friends in the Government are absolutely right to use these clauses of the Bill to make it clear to the European Union that, should it wish to pursue the line that it does not agree to work hard in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a> to resolve these matters about application, which are always a problem, the UK still reserves its right not to breach its own constitutional settlement, which is a primary cause of most breaches of international law around the world.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d693.1/1">That is why I gave way to my right hon. Friend&#8212;because he was there. I think he was a very good <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> too, by the way, for what it is worth.</p> <p pid="d693.1/2">The point is that for 10 years, Labour Governments and other Governments simply refused to put prisoners&#8217; voting rights through. Finally, there was a fudge negotiation, where not all of what was asked for was agreed, but it was agreed that what had been done, I think on furlough&#8212;as I recall, prisoners on furlough had voting rights&#8212;was okay. That was not what was asked for.</p> <p pid="d693.1/3">Let us not be too pompous about this idea that international law is some God-given gospel that says, &#8220;Absolutely nobody can ever trespass away from  this.&#8221; Many of these things are fudged anyway, and implementation is very important. I come back to section 38, which my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10095" title="Our page on Bill Cash - 'the Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)'">Sir William Cash</a> initiated. That made it very clear that we would, if necessary, place our constitutional law ahead of both of those.</p> <p pid="d693.1/4">I make that point because in truth, we are now  in exactly that state. That is why I believe that I can happily vote for this tonight. I am happy that, following   the debate between my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst and the Government, they have tabled <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 66, which will give Parliament a chance to say yea or nay when the moment comes. But we are not in breach until we decide to implement this. This has been done before. It is important to show that we want to do this if necessary, but we would rather find an agreement between the parties.</p> <p pid="d693.1/5">I come back to the point that I made about good faith in principle. I see that Monsieur Barnier has threatened our negotiators that, if they do not agree with him&#8212;he has not, by the way, wanted to move anywhere near the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a> to discuss these matters&#8212;the EU will, if necessary, not give us the status of third country. That seems a bizarre threat to make. The list of third countries, which my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=11500" title="Our page on Theresa Villiers - 'the Member for Chipping Barnet (Theresa Villiers)'">Theresa Villiers</a> mentioned, is long and peculiar. Belarus, for example, which we watch almost nightly on the television, would have third country status. We would not have it, apparently. Others include the Central African Republic, China, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Republic">Islamic Republic</a> of Iran&#8212;the list goes on. I think there are now 137 countries that would have third country status, but apparently to Mr Barnier, it would be quite acceptable for a country that has been very close to the EU for years to not have third country status. I think it is a hollow threat, but it is a peculiar threat to make, and it gives an indication of bad faith.</p> <p pid="d693.1/6">The EU is meant to avoid bad faith in this, and so are we. The whole idea of the Bill is to say, &#8220;Stop. Let&#8217;s consider this again. We do not want&#8212;and you should not want&#8212;to end up in a situation where we are running around on your <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a>. This is not what the agreement was meant to be, and we are not prepared to see our constitutional settlement trashed in the pursuit of your own vainglorious idea that somehow you&#8217;re going to keep hold of us and run us afterwards.&#8221; As my right hon. Friend said, we did not vote to be a subsidiary state; we voted for independence. That is the key point.</p> <p pid="d693.1/7">I am going to vote for this Bill, and I vote for it with a clean heart. I vote for it because so many areas&#8212;from state aid, to transfer of goods and agriproducts to labelling&#8212;will be affected unnecessarily. If the EU seriously wants to help and to get this done, it needs to return to the table, go into the Joint Committee as it said it would and accept what we are saying: we will not allow our constitution to become the prisoner of an EU that wants to have all power over the UK.</p>            </div>

Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Sir Robert Neill)'">Sir Robert Neill</a>, the Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> that his efforts have secured is wholly inadequate to meet both domestic and international concerns about this Bill. I cannot do much better than repeat what the Irish Foreign <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> said this afternoon: a Government with an 80-seat <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> having a parliamentary lock is not much of a reassurance to any of us. I really do not think I need to say any more than that. Once more, we have a ruse to solve the problems of the Conservative party rather than a ruse to address our international legal obligations.</p> <p pid="d696.1/4">My amendments 43 and 44, as I said, seek to deal with <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 45. The English <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Council">Bar Council</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Society">Law Society</a> of England and Wales have said of clause 45 that it</p> <p class="indent" pid="d696.1/5" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;would exclude judicial review of any regulations made under clauses 42 and 43 on grounds of incompatibility with domestic law&#8230;as well as international law.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d696.1/6">That exclusion of judicial review would also mean excluding any human rights review under the Human Rights Act or, indeed, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_Act_2010">Equality Act 2010</a>. As my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25447" title="Our page on Claire Hanna - 'the Member for Belfast South (Claire Hanna)'">Claire Hanna</a> said in her very eloquent speech, human rights are of course integral to the Good Friday agreement. It is a travesty that regulations made under clauses 42 and 43 should not be subject to judicial review or to human rights review across Great Britain, but a particular travesty in Northern Ireland. It undermines not just the principle of the rule of law but the principle of access to justice. It also contravenes article 4 of the withdrawal agreement, which the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a> freely signed up to, in which they undertook to ensure a right for individuals to rely directly on withdrawal agreement provisions.</p> <p pid="d696.1/7">It is difficult to be certain how the courts would interpret an ouster clause such as clause 45, but precedent suggests that it would be quite hard for them to uphold it unless it is expressed in unequivocal terms. My amendments seek to clear this up. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment_43">Amendment 43</a> would exclude the Human Rights Act and the European convention on human rights from the definition of domestic and international law, and amendment 44 would ensure that</p> <p class="indent" pid="d696.1/8" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;nothing in Clause 45 ousts the jurisdiction of domestic courts in respect of judicial review of regulations made under Clauses 42 and 43.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d696.1/9">Subsequent to my tabling those amendments, the Government tabled amendments 64 and 65, which appear to acknowledge that judicial review claims could still be brought in certain limited circumstances. I am interested to hear from the Minister what those circumstances would be. Do they include the normal judicial review grounds of illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety, or will they also include review on the grounds of human rights? I look forward to hearing from him  on that.</p> <p pid="d696.1/10">My final point is the most important point from a Scottish point of view. In so far as clause 45 seeks to interfere with judicial review in Scotland, it is interfering with a rather different beast from judicial review in England: the inherent supervisory jurisdiction of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Session">Court of Session</a> in Edinburgh. In doing that, it strays into devolved territory and would therefore require a legislative consent motion, which I very much doubt would be forthcoming. Put simply, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a> is not in the business of ousting the court&#8217;s jurisdiction on judicial review or human rights grounds&#8212;nor should it be and neither should this Parliament.</p> <p pid="d696.1/11">Most importantly from a Scottish point of view, the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court of Session is an inherent jurisdiction, which is not conferred on it by legislation but has been there since its inception in 1532. It therefore predates the treaty of Union between Scotland and England in 1707. Legislation seeking to narrow the scope of that inherent jurisdiction risks falling foul of article 19 of the treaty of Union, which preserves the independence of Scotland&#8217;s legal system.</p> <p pid="d696.1/12">In Scotland, rather to our surprise, we learned from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Supreme_Court">UK Supreme Court</a> that putting the Sewel convention on a legal footing did not protect us from the Government driving a coach and horses through it. As the legal position stands in the United Kingdom, it seems that the Government can get away with passing primary legislation that interferes in devolved matters without a legislative consent motion. A breach of article 19 of the treaty of Union might be a different matter, however, because the question of whether parts of the treaty are so fundamental that they cannot be overridden by an Act of this Parliament has been considered by courts north and south of the border, but never entirely resolved.</p> <p pid="d696.1/13">I simply remind Members that the doctrine of the supremacy of Parliament is an English doctrine. Even Dicey, the great high priest of parliamentary sovereignty, was prepared to recognise that those who framed the treaty of Union between Scotland and England believed in the possibility of creating an absolute sovereign legislature that was still bound by certain unalterable <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a>. Many of us in Scotland believe that one of the unalterable laws of the treaty of Union is that this Parliament cannot interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the Court of Session.</p> <p pid="d696.1/14">Both those problems&#8212;the in-roads into the devolved competence and the undermining of article 19 of  the treaty of Union&#8212;will continue, notwithstanding Government amendments 64 and 65. I suspect that the Government have not really thought about that because, let us be honest, they do not often think about the impact on Scotland of what they want to do. Many people in Scotland, including my fellow members of the legal profession, will see that as another example of the Government&#8217;s total disregard for devolution and for Scotland&#8217;s separate and distinct institutions.</p> <p pid="d696.1/15">That is yet another reason why for Scotland the only way out of the mess that the Conservative and Unionist party has created over Europe is independence. I am glad that so many more people in Scotland are realising that daily. [Interruption.] It is a terrible dreadful bore for Conservative Members, but I remind them that we spend an awful lot of time listening to them bang on about the European Union and how it prevents them  from having their way. Well, the Scots are pretty sick  of this Parliament preventing Scotland from having  its way.</p>            </div>

Members across the Chamber. Although it is an honour to be called to speak today, I cannot pretend that it is an enjoyable experience, and that is because of the conflict that I feel. I feel desperately uncomfortable. I want to support the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the Government, and I know how the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> feels. I have sat on that <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> far too many times, knowing that people behind me did not agree with my position.</p> <p pid="d698.2/2">I want to support the Prime Minister. I want to see the whole United Kingdom leave the European Union, respecting the referendum result, but I am desperately uncomfortable about being asked to vote to break international law. My instinct tells me that what the Government are asking me to vote for tonight is not the right thing to do or, to be charitable, may not be doing things in the right way.</p> <p pid="d698.2/3">The Government have been clear&#8212;they are on the record&#8212;that paragraph (5) is a breach of the withdrawal agreement, and we are angels dancing on the head of the pin as to when the law is broken. The law will be broken, if these clauses are used. It might be at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Assent">Royal Assent</a>, or it might be at commencement of the Act. It might be when the order is laid after the parliamentary vote&#8212;I thank the Government for agreeing to respect that and for agreeing to that <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>. I would like to hear from the Minister exactly what the Government&#8217;s position is now as to when the law will be broken, because no parliamentarian wants to walk through the Lobby knowing they are about to break the law.</p> <p pid="d698.2/4">Much has been made of the role that respecting the Belfast Good Friday agreement has in this debate. Let us be clear: the Belfast Good Friday agreement was the result of great statecraft and the power of words over violence, but it was also a triumph of compromise&#8212;or, as I used to be told I had to call it, accommodation. It was a settlement that meant that people living in Northern Ireland could be comfortable in their own identities, be that British, Irish, both or neither. As <a href="/mp/?p=25447" title="Our page on Claire Hanna - 'the hon. Member for Belfast South (Claire Hanna)'">Claire Hanna</a> said earlier, it was written at a point when both the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_and_Ireland">UK and Ireland</a> were members of the EU. I want to be absolutely clear: the  Belfast Good Friday agreement was not contingent on our both being members of the European Union. It was a result of great statecraft, compromise and people being prepared to lead, and it would have happened if both countries had not been members of the same economic bloc. But the fact that both countries were EU members meant that the foundations of the Belfast Good Friday agreement&#8212;the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Act_1998">Northern Ireland Act 1998</a> that this House passed&#8212;were written without the need to deal explicitly with matters that European citizenship and membership conferred. There was no need to write about citizens&#8217; rights and how somebody who identifies as Irish and lives in Northern Ireland can exercise their right to be a member of the European Union when the country in which they reside is no longer a member of the European Union. It did not go into the points on customs and declarations. It did not talk about that because it did not need to. In fact, the reason we have the Bill&#8212;and I want to make it clear that I support the Bill as a whole; it is part 5 with which I have a problem&#8212; is because we need it, as the settlements on devolution were written at a time when we were a member of  the European Union. We did not need frameworks  on agriculture, because matters that will be settled by the devolved Administrations were governed by rules in Brussels.</p> <p pid="d698.2/5">I support our taking back control of those matters. Again, I have to make it absolutely clear that this has nothing to do with leaving the European Union. It is about how we make sure that we do so in the right way, so that I can hold my head up high and look people in the eye and say that I am proud to be a parliamentarian in this Parliament, which respects the rule of law. We have to remember that the world will judge us by the way in which we respect the Belfast/Good Friday agreement, even more than our breaking the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p pid="d698.2/6">This is where language matters. I know, more than many, how important language is in Northern Ireland. I have said things, I have misspoken, I have made throwaway comments, and I have regretted them enormously, because they hurt people. People who have been through more hurt than any of us could ever imagine were hurt by words that I said, and I regret that more than just about anything that I have done in my political career. I have much to be proud of, but I regret having hurt people. Language is important, so I urge everyone&#8212;on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Bench">Front Bench</a>, on the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Front Bench, and in all parts of the Chamber&#8212;to remember the language that we use, because our allies are listening to what we say. They are not looking at the intricacies of amendment 64 or new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 3&#8212;they do not really know or care&#8212;but what they hear is the headline. They hear us saying that we are going to break international law, and we are prepared to do it. That is really powerful.</p> <p pid="d698.2/7">I am a Conservative with a large &#8220;C&#8221; and a small &#8220;c&#8221;. I am also a Unionist, and I make no apologies for being a Unionist. As a Conservative and a Unionist, the precious thing that matters to me is our Union and the peace process in Northern Ireland. I tested myself on this over the past few days. How will I explain this to my grandchildren&#8212;my children have already told me what they think about this particular issue&#8212;when history judges us? I try to put myself in the shoes of other people, and I try to think how it feels today for someone  who identifies as Irish and lives in Northern Ireland. I want them to stay part of the United Kingdom, but they identify as Irish. They are perfectly allowed to do so&#8212;the agreement says that they can&#8212;but I want them to be part of the Union. If we as Unionists want people to remain in the Union we need to talk about the power and benefits of the Union. We need to talk about those shared institutions such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a> and, dare I even say, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC">BBC</a>, which are respected and make people proud.</p> <p pid="d698.2/8">We have to talk about our international reputation. We have a permanent seat on the Security Council. We are full members of many international bodies. We punch above our weight. What the UK is known for, and what people whom I want to stay in the United Kingdom want to see, is our respecting the rule of law. We need to be on the highest moral ground. There cannot be ambiguity. Protecting our Union is the most important thing to me, but we cannot do so in a way that alienates people and damages our reputation.</p>            </div>

I have been clear, in many interventions since I left my post last summer and while I was in post, that respecting the right of everybody who lives in Northern Ireland to identify in the way that they are comfortable with is incredibly important and we must respect it. So I say to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>: part 5 should not be in this Bill. The Government should not ask MPs to vote for an illegal law as a negotiating tactic.

All possible steps to avoid needing these clauses should be taken.</p> <p pid="d700.1/2">I say to the Minister that I am undecided as to which way I will vote this evening, because I respect the fact that Government have moved and compromised, and I understand that that is a difficult thing for Governments to do.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d700.2/1">It is a great pleasure to follow that fine speech by <a href="/mp/?p=24725" title="Our page on Karen Bradley - 'the right hon. Member for Staffordshire Moorlands (Karen Bradley)'">Karen Bradley</a>. I want to concentrate on how we get out of this mess without breaching international law and the treaty we signed up to. Four issues have caused all this: the question of exit summary declarations, the definition of &#8220;at-risk goods&#8221;, state aid and third country listing. The Bill deals with only some of those; further legislation is threatened to deal with the rest, but one has to look at them together.</p> <p pid="d700.2/2">The first thing I want to say is that it seems the Government are in a state of hopeless confusion on two questions. The first is: is the EU negotiating in good faith or not? I asked the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> that last week at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaison_Committee">Liaison Committee</a> and he told me it is not. Earlier that same day, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Secretary">Northern Ireland Secretary</a> told the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Affairs_Committee">Northern Ireland Affairs Committee</a> that  the EU is negotiating in good faith, and indeed the Government&#8217;s response to that Committee&#8217;s report confirmed that. I do not know whether that makes the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, for whom I have a great regard, the adjudicator in this matter, but perhaps he might offer his opinion in his wind-up, because the Government do not appear to be of one mind.</p> <p pid="d700.2/3">Secondly, I believe the Minister referred in his speech&#8212;I tried to write down the phrase as I recall it&#8212;to, &#8220;Harmful legal defaults that were never intended to be used&#8221; or words to that effect. If they are legal defaults that the Government object to, it really does raise the question: why did the Government sign up to those legal defaults when they negotiated the protocol and the withdrawal agreement, and signed that and extolled its virtues to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>?</p> <p pid="d700.2/4">On exit summary declarations, there is a place for this and other concerns to be resolved, which is in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a>, through the article 16 process. The House needs to ask itself why the Government have said so little thus far about their intention to use article 16 if a satisfactory agreement cannot be reached; I did not get an answer from the Prime Minister last week and, with respect, I did not get an answer from the Minister today, but it seems that the Government have so little faith in the mechanism they negotiated that they have decided that they need to take powers to breach the terms of the treaty, even though&#8212;I remind the Minister&#8212;article 168 of the withdrawal agreement says that, &#8220;For any dispute between the EU and the UK arising under this agreement, the EU and the UK shall &#8216;only&#8217; have recourse to the procedures provided for in this agreement. This Bill drives a coach and horses through that sentence, which the Government agreed. In the statement that Ministers put out last week, the Government said that they would use the provisions of article 16 &#8220;in parallel with&#8221; the powers they wish to take in this Bill. In parallel? I really do not understand that as an argument, because surely they should use the mechanism they have negotiated first, and then if they are absolutely determined to break international law, they can get to that subsequently.</p> <p pid="d700.2/5">I come back to the point about the Joint Committee. Why have the Government not shared with the House the proposals they have made to the EU side about how goods at risk can be identified? It is simply not good enough. Part of the reason why the Government have got into such a mess is that they have not shared with us how the negotiations are going and have then suddenly produced a remedy that is contrary to international law to solve a problem the contents of which we are not aware of because Government have not shared with Members how things are going.</p> <p pid="d700.2/6">This is not an academic issue: many businesses that trade into Northern Ireland have absolutely no idea, with just over three months to go, of what the arrangements are going to be&#8212;none. There is a responsibility on both parties&#8212;the EU and the UK&#8212;to give them some clarity.  Have the Government proposed using, for example, tariff lines as the way to define goods at risk? Or products and shipments, or companies as the basis? To those who have looked into the issue in great detail, it seems that those are probably the three broad approaches that might be taken. I ask the Government to please be open with the House of Commons on this matter.</p> <p pid="d700.2/7">On state aid, I find it impossible to believe that the Government did not realise what the full implications of article 10 might be. Everybody recognised that it brought into the ambit of the state aid rules what happens in Northern Ireland, but had it really not occurred to Ministers that there might be reach-back&#8212;I think that is the expression&#8212;implications for state aid in the United Kingdom? This is currently a theoretical issue, because there are not any cases. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> will be well aware that in the wake of covid, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU_Commission">EU Commission</a> has significantly relaxed the state aid rules. Other EU members are giving state aid to all sorts of companies. The question is how the matter is going to be resolved by means other than resorting to the breaking of international law.</p> <p pid="d700.2/8">There is a great puzzle in respect of the Government&#8217;s position. When the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> of the Duchy of Lancaster appeared before the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> on the Future Relationship with the European Union on <phrase class="date" code="2020-03-11">11 March</phrase> and we asked him whether businesses that trade out of England into Northern Ireland were going to be subject to the full panoply of state aid regulations, he replied:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d700.2/9" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;No, we do not believe so.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d700.2/10">That was in March, but apparently the Government do now believe so. What happened between March and now to lead them to that conclusion?</p> <p pid="d700.2/11">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Duchy_of_Lancaster">Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster</a> also said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d700.2/12" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;The subsidy regime that the UK proposes to put in place after we have left the EU&#8221;&#8212; we have now left the EU&#8212;</p> <p class="indent" pid="d700.2/14" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;will be one that the EU will recognise as a robust system.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d700.2/15">Here we are in September, and of a robust system for state aid there is no sight yet. How can that be the case? We read reports in the paper that the reason is because Ministers cannot agree on what kind of state aid policy they want.</p> <p pid="d700.2/16">The publication of such a policy is urgent for two reasons: not only for the purposes of sorting out the problem of potential reach-back, but for making a breakthrough in the trade negotiations. To be fair to the EU, it has moved from saying at the beginning, &#8220;You must follow all our rules on state aid in perpetuity,&#8221; to now saying rather plaintively to the Government, &#8220;Would you be so kind as to give us just an inkling of what your state aid regime is going to look like?&#8221; To announce that we are going to follow the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organisation">World Trade Organisation</a> rules is hardly a revelation, because as an independent member of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a> we are obliged to follow the WTO rules. As we know, though, they lack important details and do not cover services.</p> <p pid="d700.2/17">The sooner the Government publish a state aid regime to answer the EU&#8217;s question, the sooner they can help the trade negotiations to move forward. Assuming that an agreement could be reached on that regime as part of the negotiations, the Government could, as the Minister will know, use article 13(8) of the withdrawal agreement to amend article 10, which is the cause of the potential problem&#8212;namely, reach-back.</p> <p pid="d700.2/18">The Bill does not deal with third-country listing, and no Bill could, because it is a regulatory decision of the European Union about the terms on which it lets third-country food and animal product imports into its jurisdiction. I happen to think that if the EU were to deny us such listing, arguably the UK could take the EU to the European Court, on the grounds that it was a perverse decision, or indeed the UK could certainly invoke article 16, on the grounds that denying the UK third-country listing was a breach of the good faith obligation under article 5.</p> <p pid="d700.2/19">I suspect that this is a fuss about nothing, because I can conceive of no such circumstances. <a href="/mp/?p=10180" title="Our page on Iain Duncan Smith - 'The right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith)'">Sir Iain Duncan Smith</a> read out the list of all the other countries that have been given third-country status. Well, he cannot tell me that if those countries have been given it, then the EU, which knows what our rules are today&#8212;the Government, to be fair to them, have made it clear what the rules are going to be on <phrase class="date" code="2020-01-01">1 January</phrase>, unless and until they decide to change them&#8212;will in the end say, &#8220;We have no idea how you are going to operate the rules.&#8221; I do not think that will be a problem, because it is not a terribly sensible way for two very large trading entities, with big and important agricultural industries, to behave.</p> <p pid="d700.2/20">In relation to the offending clauses in the Bill, I heard what the Minister said and what <a href="/mp/?p=13736" title="Our page on Bob Neill - 'the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Sir Robert Neill)'">Sir Robert Neill</a> had to say about the Government&#8217;s proposals. In response to what <a href="/mp/?p=24725" title="Our page on Karen Bradley - 'the right hon. Member for Staffordshire Moorlands (Karen Bradley)'">Karen Bradley</a> said a moment ago, whether the illegality is the passing of the law all the way through to the laying of the regulations is not the point. As my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24943" title="Our page on Paul Blomfield - 'the Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield)'">Paul Blomfield</a> and the former Prime Minister, <a href="/mp/?p=10426" title="Our page on Theresa May - 'the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)'">Mrs May</a>, made clear in their own excellent speeches, the damage has been done. It was done the moment the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Northern Ireland got up in the House of Commons and admitted that it was contrary to international law. Normally in a legal argument, the lawyers in the House&#8212;I have great respect for them&#8212;would be saying, &#8220;It breaches the law,&#8221; &#8220;No, it doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; &#8220;Yes, it does,&#8221; &#8220;No, it doesn&#8217;t.&#8221; Well, that conversation was cut dead when the Secretary of State said that it does. That is really irrelevant, it seems to me. I think it is counter-productive.</p> <p pid="d700.2/21">I urge the Government, as have other Members, to withdraw the clauses and get back to negotiating &#8220;the great deal&#8221;&#8212;I sometimes feel nostalgic for the words that echo through the mists of time: &#8220;One of the easiest trade deals in history&#8221;; &#8220;A deal with the exact same benefits.&#8221; I would like the country to achieve such a deal, and the Government&#8217;s responsibility now is to stop messing about with this Bill and to negotiate a deal, because time is short, before we leave without one because they fail to reach an agreement.</p>            </div>

It was a real privilege and honour to  serve as the United Kingdom&#8217;s special envoy for freedom of religion or belief. We took forward 17 different recommendations of the 22 in the Truro report, but I also helped, along with the United States and the ambassador from the Netherlands, to set up the international alliance to promote freedom of religion or belief around the world. We used to say to countries, &#8220;Respect article 18 of the universal declaration of human rights&#8221;. People can have whatever faith they want or no faith, but others must respect that.</p> <p pid="d704.0/14">Hon. Members would expect the Prime Minister&#8217;s special envoy for the United Kingdom to go along to the table and say, &#8220;I think we should do this at the Security Council or we should that at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a>. We should do this at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe">Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> or we should do that at Human Rights Council.&#8221; But after what the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said at the Dispatch Box on <phrase class="date" code="2020-09-08">8 September</phrase>, how can one go and lecture others when we are in this situation?</p> <p pid="d704.0/15">The question people ask me is: why, then, are you supporting Government amendment 66? I am supporting amendment 66 for this reason. If we look at the <a href="/glossary/?gl=5" title="The order paper is issued daily and lists the business which will be dealt..." class="glossary">Order Paper</a> on Monday <phrase class="date" code="2020-09-14">14 September</phrase> and Tuesday <phrase class="date" code="2020-09-15">15 September</phrase>, we see that amendment 4 put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst had only 13 signatories. That amendment is for parliamentary sovereignty. Parliament should decide: this Parliament enacted its support of the withdrawal agreement, and if it now wants to come out of it, this Parliament should say so, not defer that to Ministers. However, only 13 Members of Parliament had signed it. I am grateful to my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10241" title="Our page on Damian Green - 'the Member for Ashford (Damian Green)'">Damian Green</a> and my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, and I am also grateful to the likes of my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25889" title="Our page on Ben Spencer - 'the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Dr Spencer)'">Dr Spencer</a>, who came in in 2019, who signed the amendment.</p> <p pid="d704.0/16">The amendment asks for parliamentary sovereignty, but on Monday the Bill passed by 77 votes in this House, so how do I know I can get 40 votes to overturn clauses 42, 43 and 45, which I could never accept. No hon. Member would accept clauses 42, 43 and 45, so when we are in that position, do we accept amendment 66, rather than the amendment put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, being pragmatic and being reasonable? I say this as someone who for three years, from 2004 to 2007, worked with the former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan">Prime Minister of Pakistan</a> who lost her life fighting for democracy, going to discussions in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a> with the Foreign Secretaries Jack Straw and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Miliband">David Miliband</a> and looking at the transition to democracy. There always has to be give and take, being pragmatic and being realistic. On that basis, to avoid having to put clauses 42, 43 and 45 in the Bill, I support the proposals in Government amendment 66 for parliamentary oversight.</p> <p pid="d704.0/17">I want to finish with a quote, Sir Graham. I know time is of the essence. Parliamentary sovereignty and parliamentary scrutiny are of the utmost importance to each and every one of us. We are all among equals. We all have a voice. We take into account the views of our constituents, and we come here and we represent them. Over summer, I read a brilliant quote from 2010 by a former <a href="/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a>, before I came to this House. I will read the quote. Some will recognise the person. He is a man of great integrity and he did the right thing. This is what he said about taking Parliament seriously:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d704.0/18" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;a word to the coming generation of politicians. I have one simple message: take Parliament seriously. If we, the elected, do not, why should anybody else? By all means&#8230;support the programme on which one&#8217;s party was elected, but we are not automatons. We are not sent here merely to be cheerleaders, or to get stiff necks looking up at the fount of power. We are here to exercise our judgment&#8212;to hold Ministers to account for the powers they hold. And that means proper scrutiny. It means insisting that Ministers engage seriously with Parliament, and that they are open to dialogue.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2020-03-25">25 March</phrase> 2010; Vol. 508, c. 486.]</p> <p pid="d704.0/19">On that basis, I am grateful to the Prime Minister  for listening, engaging and ensuring that we have amendment 66, should these matters come before the House and if the United Kingdom ever deviated from its commitment. Initially, the provisions were put forward under statutory instruments, under which the Government could have put forward a 90-minute affirmative motion, with the Minister standing at the Dispatch Box for an hour. Please, as I tried to ask him earlier, will the Minister clarify that when and if this comes back to the House, there will be a full debate, with as many Members of Parliament who need to speak being able to?</p> <p pid="d704.0/20">One of the great things I did was to represent our country at the canonisation of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John_Henry_Newman">St John Henry Newman</a>, a great British saint with global impact. I will end by quoting his &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead,_Kindly_Light">Lead, Kindly Light</a>&#8221;:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d704.0/21" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;&#8230;I do not ask to see</p> <p class="indent" pid="d704.0/22" pwmotiontext="yes">The distant scene; <br><strong>one</strong> step enough for me.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d704.0/23">When and if the Government look to bring these measures forward, please do it so that there are appropriate checks and balances at every level by this House.</p>            </div>

Member for Gillingham and Rainham (Rehman Chishti)'">Rehman Chishti</a>. I congratulate him on the moral choice of resigning from the Government, although I remind him that when it comes the law of the country, there is the law of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p> <p pid="d706.0/2">As a Scottish nationalist, I have often tried to stick to our maxim of leaving Ireland to the Irish, but in these constitutionally fraught times I feel it is necessary to remind the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Conservative">British Conservative</a> and Unionist party of the histories and stories across these islands that give us an understanding of where we find ourselves today. We can be in no doubt that this Government will seek to portray this perfidious power grab as actually strengthening the devolution settlement, which so many of us have fought so hard to secure, but we know very well from the history of Northern Ireland that rewriting devolution by decree is simply unsustainable.</p> <p pid="d706.0/3">Let us move beyond the bluff and bluster of this Government&#8217;s <a href="/glossary/?gl=122" title="The first bench on either side of the House of Commons, reserved for..." class="glossary">Front Bench</a> and the obsequious chatter of their pliant <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Benchers">Back Benchers</a>, and remind ourselves  very clearly that a Union requires Unionists at both ends. Usually, when I look over to my <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Conservative_and_Unionist">Scottish Conservative and Unionist</a> opposites&#8212;I do not see any here tonight&#8212;I see fellow Scots who are equally passionate in their convictions for our nation of Scotland as any on these Benches. They are Unionists who are looking desperately to the south to see their convictions mirrored by English colleagues, but I am afraid that the only colleague they found tonight was <a href="/mp/?p=10426" title="Our page on Theresa May - 'the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)'">Mrs May</a>.</p> <p pid="d706.0/4">As we debate the Northern Ireland protocol here, we see a foreshadow of what is about to happen to my fellow Scots who have placed their faith in this Union, because while people in Northern Ireland collectively voted to remain within the European Union, they have seen not only that express wish disregarded but the very fabric of their daily lives become part of the negotiations over the past three years. Now they see the future of that quotidian offered up as a gambling chip by this Government. One party, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Unionist">Democratic Unionist</a> party, sought to follow its Unionist convictions by backing this Government, but its Members have instead seen themselves, cajoled, seduced, rebuffed and tossed aside before being asked again to come back into the warm embrace of the Conservative party.</p> <p pid="d706.0/5">Let us look into the forgotten past, to the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972, in which this House decided unilaterally to pluck the powers of the people of Northern Ireland invested in their Parliament in Stormont and bring them here, where they could be &#8220;better administered&#8221;, quite against wishes of the Unionist leadership of the day. I am surprised not to have heard more about that Act, given that it would be almost entirely analogous to the situation in which we find ourselves today, were it not for the fact that direct rule was again discontinued only last year, thanks in part to the efforts of <a href="/mp/?p=24961" title="Our page on Julian Smith - 'the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Julian Smith)'">Julian Smith</a>. Of course, like anyone in the Conservative party with any talent or opinions of their own, he was sacked by the Government&#8212;I intimated to him and others that I intended to mention them in my speech this evening.</p> <p pid="d706.0/6">In the face of the deteriorating security situation in 1972, and to avoid the possibility of an unwelcome result in a Stormont election, Westminster unilaterally disbanded the Parliament that had sat since 1920, deciding instead to govern Northern Ireland through Orders in Council laid before this <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>. Not only was this done against the express wishes of their supposed Unionist allies&#8212;Government Members should maybe put their phones down and learn a little bit of history tonight&#8212;but the supposed temporary nature of the arrangements lasted for more than 30 years, until the Belfast agreement. That was power previously held by the peoples in these islands being taken back by a Conservative Government. So how have they managed to do it all over again?</p> <p pid="d706.0/7">At the start of my speech, I brought forward the idea that a Union must have Unionists at both ends, yet throughout the whole Brexit process this Government have not stopped to think once about their own actions and how they affect this Union, least it be for the purposes of a cheap soundbite. So, as the Governments   of all shades in Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh beseech the one across the House from us today at least to listen to their concerns, far less treat them as equals in the family of nations, we owe it to ourselves to ask whether they understand what &#8220;Union&#8221; means at all. We in Scotland remember that it is not an Act of Union but a treaty of Union, as my hon. and learned Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25404" title="Our page on Joanna Cherry - 'the Member for Edinburgh South West (Joanna Cherry)'">Joanna Cherry</a> reminded us earlier. While that framing may not be possible in other nations, it has certainly spoken to myself and to many of those who do not share my opinions on the constitution, as it demonstrates that this is at least something of a partnership of equals.</p> <p pid="d706.0/8">We on these Benches will see our colleagues from the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Benches trooping through the Lobby to support this Bill because they believe it strengthens the Union, but if they were here, I would simply ask them: do you believe the Government when they say that the Union is their first priority? As we debate the Northern Ireland protocol today and think of the past three years through the eyes of Unionists here&#8212;the fine words of flattery, followed by flummery and forgetting, the lack of understanding and the taking for granted&#8212;I ask my Unionist pals: can you trust these people? I mentioned the temporary provisions Act of 1972. I could just as easily have gone back to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Ireland_Act_1920">Government of Ireland Act 1920</a> to demonstrate how, when the Unionists on these islands set aside their own convictions and interests in pursuit of a mythical greater good, it rarely works out for them. As my pals seek to vote through this power grab to allow a Government far away from the people they represent to rewrite their unwritten constitution and to award themselves sweeping powers over the people of Scotland, please don&#8217;t kid yourselves: this Government have been willing to pick up and put down Unionist leaders for as long as the Union has existed. They did it to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Carson">Edward Carson</a>, they did it to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Faulkner">Brian Faulkner</a>, they have just done it to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlene_Foster">Arlene Foster</a> and, let us be absolutely clear, they are about to do it to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Ross">Douglas Ross</a>&#8212;gutted, washed out and tossed aside like a haddie on the pier at Buckie.</p>            </div>

I especially support <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.

We saw a graphic demonstration of our values when perhaps others fall short. In the middle of the channel&#8212;not a pleasant place generally speaking, and it certainly was not last week&#8212;there was an inflatable dinghy containing 16 Afghan refugees and asylum seekers. They were people in peril on the sea, and they were being shepherded by the French navy not to safety, but to British territorial waters where, of course, eventually they were picked up by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Force">Border Force</a> and conducted to a place of safety. I am proud of that, not only because it demonstrates our British values&#8212;something that many may be uncomfortable with&#8212;but because, in doing that, we were complying with one of the most fundamental of international treaties, the United Nations convention on the law of the sea of 1982. There is no grey in this treaty, no ambiguity, and it strikes at the very heart of what we are in this country. Indeed, it strikes at the very heart of our humanity, because we save life and we ask questions later.</p> <p pid="d708.0/4">Others have described violations of international law by the European Union and others, and I am certainly not going to rattle them off again. We heard eloquent contributions from my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10095" title="Our page on Bill Cash - 'the Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)'">Sir William Cash</a> and my right hon.

Clearly, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNCLOS">UNCLOS</a> was mutable on the part of our largest continental neighbour last week, but it was not for us and, for me, that is the message that goes to the international community, not some fine debate about this particular measure that we are discussing this evening. That message will have gone out loud and clear and, on that, I am extremely proud indeed. What is clear from the list that others have trotted out is that international law is a contested space, and sometimes it is mutable and can be overwritten.</p> <p pid="d708.0/5">I disagree with my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10426" title="Our page on Theresa May - 'the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)'">Mrs May</a> on this: she said that two wrongs do not make a right, and generally speaking she is absolutely correct, but by listing the occasions on which international law has been breached, written over, mutable or contested, we are setting the context for what we are doing on this occasion. That is something that I think has been lost in this debate. Time and time again, international law has been shown to be not absolute but, on occasion, capable of being overwritten, modified and made mutable by this country, other countries and the European Union.</p> <p pid="d708.0/6">Generally, we stand by what we sign up to and are as good as our word, so what has changed since last year? I, like many right hon. and hon. Members, have given this some considerable thought. What has changed is the appreciation of the issue of good faith, which ran like a vein through a block of granite throughout all the discussions last year. This works only if the parties act in good faith, and it has become clear over the past several weeks that the European Union side is prepared to regard the Northern Ireland protocol as a lever to get what it wants. It raises the spectre of agrifood being unable to move freely between the nations of the United Kingdom, which is clearly contrary to the Act of Union and drives a coach and horses through the Good Friday agreement. It was not on the table last year, and it calls   into question the &#8220;acting in good faith&#8221; enjoinder, which I have referred to, and which is clearly contained within the withdrawal agreement and its accompanying political declaration.</p>            </div>

I agree with my hon. Friend&#8217;s point.</p> <p pid="d710.1/2">I have already gone over my five minutes, Dame Eleanor, but it is important to note the extreme hardball attitude that the EU has recently adopted and what that says about what might be in store for us in the future. The points that <a href="/mp/?p=25280" title="Our page on Gavin Robinson - 'the hon. Member for Belfast East (Gavin Robinson)'">Gavin Robinson</a> made about state aid are extremely germane to this. I remember well, as Northern Ireland <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and Chairman of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Affairs_Committee">Northern Ireland Affairs Committee</a>, the issues relating to Bombardier. It was plain as a pikestaff that this might be used in the event that the UK decided to support Bombardier in GB, because, as things stand, the EU would claim that it is unfair and unlawful because of Bombardier&#8217;s presence in Belfast. That is a clear and present danger.</p> <p pid="d710.1/3">It is also important to get real about what we are up against. I have every respect for <a href="/mp/?p=10669" title="Our page on Hilary Benn - 'the right hon. Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn)'">Hilary Benn</a>, who quite rightly expounded at length on the fact that the negotiation has to be bounded in good will and said that this will cause difficulty for us in Brussels, but I am clear that this negotiation is no love-in. It is a bare-knuckle affair. Pique is never far away, nor is the desire to make an example of an errant UK pour encourager les autres. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stone said, international law is 40% law and 60% politics, as it is here&#8212;this is politics in the raw.</p> <p pid="d710.1/4">I am sorry that, throughout this whole torrid process, hon. and right hon. Members have shackled the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> in our negotiations in Brussels. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_British">The British</a> public know that. The hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Central">Sheffield Central</a> shakes his head, but he should know that more than anybody else, because the British public spoke loud and clear on this issue in December. They understand what we often forget in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>, and they get this business in the way that many of us do not. His party needs to learn that lesson. That is why it suffered so badly in December.</p> <p pid="d710.1/5">Without amendment 66 or perhaps amendment 4, we would have a problem internally too, because we are up against the judiciary, which has shown itself to be perfectly capable of going head to head with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a>. By bringing this matter back to the House, it will not be the British Government that the Supreme Court goes head to head with. It will be Parliament itself, and more than that&#8212;the people of this country.  Amendment 66 will give certainty on both sides of the English channel. It makes a good Bill better. It assures and insures our national interests, and I wish it well.</p>            </div>

Great Britain&#8217;s global influence, our ability to hold our head up high and even our naked self-interest will all be wrecked by this disastrous proposal to deliberately flout international law. Our post-Brexit ambition to establish our country as global Britain, so that we can be an influential player in world affairs, would be fatally undermined. How could we challenge a corrupt Government or stand up to an aggressive dictatorship? Who would listen when we support the citizens of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, challenge the Russians over the Skripal poisoning or defend the Rohingya people in Myanmar if we ourselves flout international law to suit the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8217;s short-term whim?</p> <p pid="d711.0/8">Today&#8217;s FinCEN leaks show that the UK is at the heart of global money laundering and financial crime. How can Britain lead global efforts to combat that if we are not seen as an honest broker or a country that will uphold international agreements? The farce of doing this when it threatens our relationship with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">USA</a>, as we see if we read <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden">Joe Biden</a>&#8217;s tweet or listen to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a>&#8217;s comments, beggars belief. To deliberately put this key friendship at risk and deliberately jeopardise a trade deal with the USA is utterly irresponsible and unpatriotic. I say to those on the Government Benches who were brave enough to voice their <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> last week, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be bought off by a shabby and dishonest compromise.

Every MP who votes for these clauses will be voting against the rule of law. We are being sucked in as accomplices to the Government&#8217;s reckless bid to undermine the rule of law, and that goes for our Law Officers. They should hold their heads in shame at not resigning and speaking out against this irresponsible move. Yet this move is part of a consistent pattern of behaviour: disdain for the judiciary, contempt for us here in Parliament, animosity towards civil servants and loathing of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC">BBC</a>.</p> <p pid="d711.0/10">This Government approach their work as if it were a game in which they attack the pillars of our democracy simply to gain a mendacious, populist headline. Their latest target is the rule of law, but it is Britain&#8217;s long-term future that is at stake tonight. There is nothing decent, honourable or patriotic about playing roulette with the rule of law. Breaking it will destroy our reputation, integrity, authority and influence on the world stage. I urge every hon. <a href="/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a> to vote against this outrageous proposal.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d712.0/1">It is a great pleasure to contribute to a debate with such significant implications. I will be brief; I reckon I can be the first person to break precedent and stick within five minutes, because I know an enormous number of colleagues want to speak.</p> <p pid="d712.0/2">The Bill really is crucial in maintaining the integrity and the smooth operation of the UK&#8217;s internal market, and ensuring that they are underpinned by the principle of non-discrimination across the four constituent parts of our Union. I will focus on <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 45 and its constitutional ramifications, because the question that has been engrossing the Committee, and the public, is that of the notwith- standing powers and their potential breach of international law.</p> <p pid="d712.0/3">Even a potential breach of international law is to be treated with the utmost seriousness, but to suggest, as some have, that the provisions of the Bill place us in some sort of moral equivalence with China or Russia really is risible. Degree and proportion matter. Clause 45, as I hope it will be amended by <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 66, equips democratically elected Members of this House to decide whether or not to protect the powers outlined in clauses 42 and 43 in the case of need. Should this House decide to, it would mitigate the risk of the UK&#8217;s internal market splintering, with all the potential consequences that would flow from that.</p> <p pid="d712.0/4">There is no equivalence there, and I do not believe that the Bill is symptomatic of some kind of collapse of British support for a rules-based international order. We have heard a lot of this before, but I must say that I do not remember the same level of outrage bursting forth when Germany or France violated treaty obligations on deficit and debt levels, when Canada broke international law to legalise cannabis, or in the Kadi and Barakaat case, which my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10180" title="Our page on Iain Duncan Smith - 'the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith)'">Sir Iain Duncan Smith</a> mentioned, when the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice">European Court of Justice</a> ruled that the EU should ignore the UN charter&#8212;the highest source of international law&#8212;if it conflicted with the EU&#8217;s internal constitutional order. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECJ">ECJ</a> then said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d712.0/5" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;A treaty can never enjoy primacy over provisions&#8230;that form part of the constitutional foundations of the union.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d712.0/6">That cuts to the heart of the issue. When treaty obligations threatened to damage the constitutional coherence of the EU, it felt not only free but obligated to disregard them.</p> <p pid="d712.0/7">That is not to say, of course, that anyone should contemplate the EU using such powers lightly, but if, and only if, a situation arose where the movement of goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK was hampered and access to our internal markets was fettered, not only would it be essential but surely we, too, would be obliged to have powers in place to meet such a contingency. Like the EU, the UK has a Union to protect, and it is absolutely right that it equips itself to do so through the clauses we are currently considering. That is why I cannot support <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> amendments that seek to de-fang clause 45.</p> <p pid="d712.0/8">I pay tribute to the hard work of my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=13736" title="Our page on Bob Neill - 'the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Sir Robert Neill)'">Sir Robert Neill</a> and my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10241" title="Our page on Damian Green - 'the Member for Ashford (Damian Green)'">Damian Green</a>, and I am reassured by Government amendment 66 that the exercise of these powers will require parliamentary approval. As I said, even a limited breach of international law is a serious matter and it is right that colleagues from across the House will have the opportunity to exercise their judgment in that respect. Of course, no one wants to see Ministers forced to come to this House seeking approval to use these powers, not least because that would suggest that the attempts of the EU and the UK to agree a trade deal had stalled or failed altogether.</p> <p pid="d712.0/9">Finally, it is worth restating that of course a trade deal is in the best interests of the EU and the UK, but if all efforts to secure such a deal fail and the EU then acts on its threat to damage the UK, it is essential that we have the necessary tools to protect our national coherence and the economic framework on which that depends.</p>            </div>

I fear that we may be into that territory today, but uniquely, I think we got to that point after the first contribution from a <a href="/glossary/?gl=47" title="A Backbencher is a Member who holds no official position in government or..." class="glossary">Back Bencher</a>. The contribution from <a href="/mp/?p=10426" title="Our page on Theresa May - 'the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)'">Mrs May</a> was quite one of the most remarkable and clinical deconstructions of the Government&#8217;s argument that it was possible to imagine. She spoke with total conviction and clarity, which together were absolutely irresistible. In fact, I think it is worth recording for the benefit of Hansard that no one on the Treasury Bench did resist her. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> could have intervened and sought to put her right if they thought they were able to do so, but of course they did not. They sat there and squirmed, and it was a joy for many <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members to watch. It took me back to another similar moment in March 2003, when the late <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Cook">Robin Cook</a> delivered his resignation statement from the Government Back Benches. Again, there was the same conviction and clarity delivered at a moment of existential significance and in relation to a matter that will inevitably bring this country into conflict with the rule of law.</p> <p pid="d713.0/2">It is worth recalling why we have a protocol to the withdrawal agreement in the first place. It is essentially as a result of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>&#8217;s determination to  remove us from the customs union. The right hon. Member for Maidenhead understood that, and when she sought to negotiate the withdrawal agreement, she came forward with the backstop. It was that backstop that the now Prime Minister resigned over, eventually, and then proceeded to stick pins into the right hon. Lady until she too could stand it no longer. He eventually took her place, at which point he renegotiated the withdrawal agreement with the protocol attached to it. The essence of that renegotiation, of which he has boasted so many times since, was rooted in that backstop.</p> <p pid="d713.0/3">Tonight was always going to come, because the Government and the Prime Minister have insisted all along that they could do three things when at best they could only ever do two. They told us that they could leave the customs union, that they could avoid the placing of a hard border on the mainland of Ireland, and that they could avoid a border down the Irish sea. Once we come out of the customs union, we can only do one or other; we cannot do them both. And what we have seen tonight is these chickens coming home to roost. Goodness only knows they were warned often enough.</p> <p pid="d713.0/4">I have always seen this protocol as a threat to the Belfast agreement. The withdrawal agreement with  the protocol attached to it is a political choice made by the Prime Minister to give Brexit and leaving the customs union precedence over the Belfast agreement. This is not some matter of detail; this is a question that goes right to the very heart of the deal that was negotiated by the Prime Minister himself, and we cannot in all seriousness enter into an agreement and then seek to repudiate it because the other party is doing what we have just agreed they are allowed to do.</p> <p pid="d713.0/5">I turn now to the Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> that follows on from the representations made by <a href="/mp/?p=13736" title="Our page on Bob Neill - 'the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Sir Robert Neill)'">Sir Robert Neill</a>. As a general rule, I am pragmatic&#8212;I believe that half a loaf is better than no loaf of bread&#8212;but on a matter of this importance I have to say to the House that the deal that the hon. Gentleman has secured is simply not good enough, and it is the raw politics that render it inadequate. Just imagine the conversation in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street">Downing Street</a> between the Prime Minister and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=8" title="The government chief whip, whose official title is parliamentary secretary..." class="glossary">Chief Whip</a> when it comes to that vote. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> will ask the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Whip">Chief Whip</a>, &#8220;Can you win it?&#8221; Of course, he must be canny in his answer&#8212;we both know that&#8212;but it has to start, surely, &#8220;Well, Prime Minister, with a <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of 80&#8221;. That is the political reality. We know, as <a href="/mp/?p=10358" title="Our page on Julian Lewis - 'the right hon. Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis)'">Dr Lewis</a> learned to his cost, that this Government play whipping hard ball when it matters to them, and that is what they will do in the event that this is the only protection that stands between them and getting what they want.</p> <p pid="d713.0/6">Also, as the right hon. Member for Maidenhead said, it really makes no difference whether it is Ministers in Downing Street or Members in this House who break the law; at the end of the day Britain as a whole&#8212;the United Kingdom&#8212;will be judged on that action and nobody will care who was ultimately responsible for it.</p> <p pid="d713.0/7">I remind the House that in 2003 this House had a vote on the question of whether we should go to war  in Iraq, and this House voted to go to war in Iraq,  an action which again had little or no foundation in  international law, and which was ultimately shown to be an unlawful act. Nobody cared that it was an act that had been authorised by this House and not just by Ministers in Downing Street.</p> <p pid="d713.0/8">This is not an isolated action from this Government; it is part of a course of conduct. As <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> might have said had he ever found himself in this unfortunate position, &#8220;For a Government to act unlawfully once might be regarded as misfortune; to act unlawfully twice looks like carelessness.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d713.0/9">In fact, come Wednesday, the Government are going to introduce bring a Bill that will effectively decriminalise the use of torture as part of armed conflict in certain circumstances. That is, again, almost certainly a breach of international law, so it is not a question of misfortune or mistake or carelessness; it begins to look like a habit, and it is a habit that any wise Government would be well advised to avoid. On this occasion, it is bad not just for our reputation as a player on the world stage, but it threatens the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom as a unitary state, and the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> and Unionists on the other side of the House should understand exactly what they enter into if they support it in the Lobby tonight.</p>            </div>

Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)'">Mr Carmichael</a>. I shall speak to clauses 40 to 45. Let us be clear from the start: the Bill protects and strengthens the United Kingdom, and it safeguards peace in Northern Ireland. There is nothing in it that undermines the Belfast/Good Friday agreement, nor is there any possibility of a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland under any circumstances. From the very outset, the United Kingdom has acted in good faith, and it did so when it signed the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol. Crucially, from the outset, the UK&#8217;s understanding of the provisions in the agreement and the protocol were abundantly clear to the EU and all those at the negotiating table. It is clear to the extent that some matters need clarification that we put faith&#8212;honest faith&#8212;in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a> reaching reasonable interpretations, being fully aware of our understanding of the issues that needed to be ironed out.</p> <p pid="d715.0/2">It was not just our understanding of the agreement and protocol on which we relied. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Northern_Ireland">The Northern Ireland</a> protocol is clear about some key aspects. Article 1, as well as affirming that nothing in the protocol should interfere with the provisions of the Belfast/Good Friday agreement, says:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d715.0/3" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;This Protocol respects the essential state functions and territorial integrity of the United Kingdom.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d715.0/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_4">Article 4</a> provides:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d715.0/5" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of the United Kingdom.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d715.0/6"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_6">Article 6</a> goes on to say:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d715.0/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Nothing in this Protocol shall prevent the United Kingdom from ensuring unfettered market access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to other parts of the United Kingdom's internal market.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d715.0/8">We now find, however, that the EU is suggesting interpretations of the protocol that were never envisaged, notwithstanding the fact that the provisions are clearly set out in the protocol itself, as I have read out. There have been clear suggestions from the EU that its  interpretation of the protocol would lead to the creation of a barrier within the United Kingdom, thus seriously compromising our political and economic integrity. Such action by the European Union threatens the territorial integrity of the UK. It threatens to take Northern Ireland out of the UK customs territory, and it threatens our internal market.</p> <p pid="d715.0/9">That is unacceptable, and no Government can sit back and allow an international organisation to do that to the very fabric of our country. The Bill is therefore a safeguard that ensures that the UK is not divided and there is no external interference in the running of our country today or in the decades to come. The Bill ensures that we leave the EU as a sovereign independent country, as the people of the UK voted to do.</p> <p pid="d715.0/10">It is to be hoped that an agreement can be reached with the EU. Indeed, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Tusk">Donald Tusk</a> originally offered a Canada-style agreement, but to the extent that there is  a material breach of good faith by the EU, we have the safety of the Bill, which not only provides for the preservation of our Union but ensures that measures are not followed through without first having obtained the consent of the House.</p> <p pid="d715.0/11">Finally, let us remember that all Members on these Government Benches stood as candidates at the last <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a> not only as <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a>, but as Conservative and Unionist candidates. Every single Member on these Government Benches sits here as a Conservative and Unionist <a href="/glossary/?gl=36" title="A Member of Parliament (MP) is elected by a particular area or constituency..." class="glossary">Member of Parliament</a>. To now not agree the passing of this Bill would make a complete mockery of the very platform upon which we stood to get elected to Parliament.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d716.1/1">I assume that your remarks were addressed to me, Chair, and I will do my best to respond positively. It is a great joy to follow <a href="/mp/?p=11475" title="Our page on Shailesh Vara - 'the hon. Member for North West Cambridgeshire (Mr Vara)'">Mr Vara</a>, who has been a great friend of Northern Ireland and has taken a principled stand during the previous debates on the Brexit negotiations. He is highly regarded in Northern Ireland for his principled stand, his pro-Unionist views and his willingness to make sacrifices for those pro-Unionist views, too.</p> <p pid="d716.1/2">We will be supporting the Bill this evening and these particular clauses, but I have to say we have some reservations about the extent and the distance that the Government have gone to try to reverse the damage done by the withdrawal agreement and, in particular, the Northern Ireland protocol. I am pleased that the Government now recognise that, either inadvertently or deliberately, damage is being done to not just Northern Ireland, but the United Kingdom as a whole as a result of the withdrawal agreement, and they are trying to reverse it.</p> <p pid="d716.1/3">Two arguments have been advanced as to why people should oppose the Bill. The first&#8212;it has been an obsession in the House this evening, and outside the House over the past number of days&#8212;is that it goes against the Good Friday agreement. Indeed, if one looks at the  amendments tabled by the nationalist <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic">Social Democratic</a> and Labour party and the nationalist Alliance party, it is clear that their only concern is the Good Friday agreement, or their interpretation of the Good Friday agreement. All the amendments that my party have tabled address not the alleged ineffectiveness of the protocol in dealing with the Good Friday agreement, but the real problems that will be caused for Unionists, nationalists, the young, the old, businesses and workers in Northern Ireland by the protocol going through in the form that the EU wishes and by it being imposed  in the way the EU wishes.</p> <p pid="d716.1/4">The protocol will have an effect by putting up costs&#8212;that is not my assessment, but the Government&#8217;s&#8212;reducing opportunities and variety for consumers, impacting on investment and impacting on the trade we do with our biggest market in GB. That is the effect. I will not go through all our amendments, because my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25280" title="Our page on Gavin Robinson - 'the Member for Belfast East (Gavin Robinson)'">Gavin Robinson</a> went through them very succinctly and effectively when he was speaking. All our amendments are designed to undo that economic damage.</p> <p pid="d716.1/5">Let me just address the issue of the Good Friday agreement. It is significant that when pressed about how the Good Friday agreement is damaged, all we can get from those who make that claim is, &#8220;Well, it may not actually go against what is written in the Good Friday agreement, but it goes against the spirit of it&#8221;, or to use the words of <a href="/mp/?p=25447" title="Our page on Claire Hanna - 'the hon. Member for Belfast South (Claire Hanna)'">Claire Hanna</a>, &#8220;It goes against the implications&#8221;&#8212;not the wording, and she admitted that&#8212;&#8220;of the Good Friday agreement&#8221;. She could not find a <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> in the Good Friday agreement that was breached by the legislation. Instead, it was the intention and the implication of it.</p> <p pid="d716.1/6">The truth of the matter is, of course, that the Good Friday agreement is offended by the withdrawal agreement, because the withdrawal agreement affects Northern Ireland politically. <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">Laws</a> will now be made in Brussels rather than in Westminster. Northern Ireland will be subject to rule by the EU; we will be part of its single market rules rather than part of the UK single market.</p> <p pid="d716.1/7"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Union">The Union</a>, of course, is not just about where our laws are made. The Union is about the economic benefits of being joined with the four nations. Indeed, article 6 of the Act of Union concentrates on the economic benefits. The benefit of being part of the United Kingdom is that none of the countries within it face tariffs on trade with each other or barriers to trade with each other, and each has the opportunity to share in any economic treaties that the United Kingdom enters into with third countries, yet all those things are breached as a result of the protocol. The Government, in this Bill, seek to acknowledge that those issues come from the withdrawal agreement and to remedy them.</p> <p pid="d716.1/8"><a href="/mp/?p=10669" title="Our page on Hilary Benn - 'The right hon. Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn)'">Hilary Benn</a> and others, including the former <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>, <a href="/mp/?p=10426" title="Our page on Theresa May - 'the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)'">Mrs May</a>, say, &#8220;Oh, but there are ways of dealing with this. You deal with them through the withdrawal agreement and the mechanisms in withdrawal agreement. There&#8217;s a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a> and there&#8217;s an arbitration panel and so on,  so why not go through those?&#8221; The fact of the matter is that we have three months left. There is no certainty in Northern Ireland among businesses. Are they going to have to pay taxes on every good that they bring in on which there is an EU tariff, whether it is consumed in Northern Ireland or not? Which range of goods will be covered by that? We do not know. Is it them all? Is it a very limited list? When we send goods to the other parts of the United Kingdom, will we have to fill in export declarations, with the extra costs and administration? Consumers in Northern Ireland do not know whether, when they buy goods from Amazon and eBay, they will be delivered to Northern Ireland, or whether the burden of bringing goods into Northern Ireland will be such that both those companies will simply say, &#8220;It&#8217;s not worth our while.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d716.1/9">The whole concept of the internal market has been split by the withdrawal agreement. Some people claim that the Government are trying to tear up the withdrawal agreement, but this is the irony: in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> only last week, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was instructing&#8212;I do not know how he does this under the devolved rules&#8212;civil servants in Northern Ireland to get on with putting up a border post within the United Kingdom, between different parts of the United Kingdom. We are told, &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;ll be minimal.&#8221; Well, &#163;15.5 million-worth of building is hardly about minimal checks. Forty-five thousand square feet of building, in which lorries will be emptied and searched, is hardly about minimal checks. Ministers tell us, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s only a precaution.&#8221; They must have money to throw away if they are building these buildings only as a precaution and they might never be used.</p> <p pid="d716.1/10">We need certainty. Let us not forget that these issues have not even been dealt with at the Joint Committee. All we have had are threats: &#8220;We&#8217;re going to not list the UK. You&#8217;ll not be able to bring food in from the UK.&#8221; In the absence of negotiations being conducted in good faith, the Government&#8217;s first duty is not to adhere to the letter of an agreement that the other side is clearly not honouring and is not even trying to work towards finding some agreement on. The duty of the Government is to the people in our own country&#8212;to the people who belong to the United Kingdom and who, under the Act of Union, have been guaranteed no impediments to trade and that their prosperity will not be affected by impositions of taxes and barriers to trade. That is the Government&#8217;s first obligation. For those reasons, I believe that the Government are right. I do not think that the tinkering with the withdrawal agreement in this Bill or even the promises that have been made today that other parts will be dealt with in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Bill">Finance Bill</a> are sufficient.</p> <p pid="d716.1/11">I would say to Conservative Members, with many of whom I fought the Brexit fight, that there are many other mines and hand grenades in the withdrawal agreement. The EU will still, through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice">European Court of Justice</a>, be able to tell us how much we owe in divorce payments and future payments. It will still be able to have jurisdiction and make adjudications if there is a dispute about the rights of EU citizens living in this country. There will still be disputes on its books, and for years into the future it will be able to adjudicate on where that impinges on European Union law. Many other things in the withdrawal agreement are not being addressed in this Bill. That is why the only way of  getting out of the quagmire and getting Brexit really done and delivered is for the Government not just to tinker with the withdrawal agreement: it has to be replaced.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d719.0/1">It is a pleasure, as always, to follow <a href="/mp/?p=11374" title="Our page on Sammy Wilson - 'the right hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)'">Sammy Wilson</a>. He may well have gone over his five minutes, but every word was well worth listening to. I will make sure that I stick to five minutes.</p> <p pid="d719.0/2">I had the pleasure and honour of chairing the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Affairs_Committee">Northern Ireland Affairs Committee</a> for seven years, and our first report was to encourage the Government to explore ways in which corporation tax in Northern Ireland could be reduced to the levels in the Republic so that Northern Ireland businesses could compete on a level playing field. We were told by the European Union that it would be against its rules to do that: it had to be devolved and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly">Northern Ireland Assembly</a> had to do it, and even then it would be very restricted when it tried to do it. Such taxation, which normally we would claim as our responsibility in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>, comes under the state aid rules. When we talk about bringing powers over state aid back to this Parliament, we are not necessarily talking about bailing out lame ducks. I am showing my age when I mention that phrase; I think it was first used in the early 1970s. We are not even just talking about giving boosts to certain parts of the economy. We are actually, in some cases, talking about the control of taxation. We are all familiar with the phrase, &#8220;No taxation without representation.&#8221; It is very important, therefore, that the Government stand firm on this issue.</p> <p pid="d719.0/3">When I was working to prepare the Committee&#8217;s report, I said that it was very important to cement the relative peace that had been achieved in Northern Ireland by having a sound economy. Obviously one of the best ways to achieve a sound economy is through trade. It is therefore very important that we do everything we can to protect trade in the United Kingdom, and, as far as I can make out, that is exactly what this Bill is trying to do. It not only connects the four countries of the United Kingdom and paves the way for them to continue to trade with each other very easily; it also makes sure that Northern Ireland can trade, as the right hon. Member for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Antrim">East Antrim</a> said, with its largest trading partner, and that is Great Britain. As I said on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>, north-south trade is very important, but it is not as valuable as east-west trade or west-east trade. That is something we have to be determined to protect.</p> <p pid="d719.0/4">I do not anticipate the European Union working from a position of bad faith. I am sure that it will continue to do everything it can to protect its businesses by coming to a free trade agreement with the United Kingdom. If we achieve that, none of what we are discussing tonight becomes important. In case it does not act in good faith, however, we need an insurance policy so that we can cement the relative peace in Northern Ireland through prosperity and continue to secure the Union of the United Kingdom.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d719.1/1">I intend to keep my remarks short to aid the House&#8217;s consideration of such an important topic. I am a proud child of the north-west of England and I am sure the House agrees that there are strong links between the communities of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and  those in Manchester, Liverpool, Lancashire and beyond. We travel, live and work on both sides of the short straits of the Irish sea, as my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25842" title="Our page on Antony Higginbotham - 'the Member for Burnley (Antony Higginbotham)'">Antony Higginbotham</a> said.</p> <p pid="d719.1/2">It will shock several hon. Members that I am actually really old&#8212;old enough to remember the shock of seeing my home town of Manchester shattered by an explosion and the devastation of the Warrington bomb. From the &#8217;90s onwards, I have been proud to have good friends on different sides of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Irish">Northern Irish</a> community who studied, lived and worked here and in the north-west, and who are now successful business women trading on both sides of the Irish sea. That is not to forget my next-door neighbour.</p> <p pid="d719.1/3">Those wonderful women and men told me stories of their childhoods. They were often a difficult and heart-rending listen, but they are important for today&#8217;s debate. They were of losing a parent to a car bomb, of having two different ways to say house to avoid the beating that would undoubtedly come if they identified their community by their pronunciation, and of the fear that they would not be able to go home if peace was not secured. To the many hon. Members who have proposed that the Bill poses a threat to the hard-won peace and that the Government would consciously do something to bring about such awful events and bring them back, I say an emphatic no.</p> <p pid="d719.1/4">As a young woman, I listened to teenage girls crying in a pub about what had happened to them and their families. I promised myself that if I were ever in a position to have influence, &#8220;never again&#8221; would be my mantra. To keep that promise to my teenage self, I have examined in detail the measures in the Bill and studied the text of the Good Friday agreement, specifically the section on economic, social and cultural issues, which includes:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d719.1/5" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a> will pursue broad policies for sustained economic growth and stability in Northern Ireland and for promoting social inclusion, including in particular community development and the advancement of women in public life.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d719.1/6">The Bill in no way undermines the Good Friday agreement. On the contrary, it includes provisions to protect the agreement and help to ensure that, regardless of whether further agreement is reached in negotiations with the EU, there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and Northern Ireland businesses will continue to benefit from unrestricted access to the rest of the UK market when the transition period ends.</p> <p pid="d719.1/7">We need the ability to pursue, as it says in the Good Friday agreement, broad policies for sustained economic growth. My reading of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WA">WA</a> requires us to issue specific clarifications encoded in the Bill. The Government are taking reasonable steps to create a safety net that ensures that they are always able to deliver on their commitments to the people of Northern Ireland and uphold the gains of the peace process. To be specific, we cannot have a situation where goods between <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland">Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a> face restrictions from a third party and where we cannot help to pursue community development due to EU regulations.</p> <p pid="d719.1/8">I am confident that the Government&#8217;s commitment to the Good Friday agreement is beyond question, but I appeal to EU and UK leadership to redouble their efforts in negotiations to reach an agreement and render the safety net not required.</p> <p pid="d719.1/9">I thank the Government for <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 66 and for giving the House an ability to have its say should that eventuality even come close to coming to pass.</p> <p pid="d719.1/10">I will vote with the Government on the Bill today and I will keep my word to those old friends of mine who owned the white Vectra, enjoyed a good <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ">DJ</a> set and to whom my drink will always remain a Guinness. They are all powerful businesswomen&#8212;I will support them and I will support the Bill.</p>            </div>

Like others, I look across the Chamber and I cannot see a single Scottish <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> MP in here. Perhaps they are not worried about how goods will move freely between Scotland and Northern Ireland, but I can assure the House that I and my colleagues are.</p> <p pid="d721.0/2">As we debate part 5 of the Bill, like many other  hon. and right hon. Members I focus on clauses 42, 43 and 45, which would see comprehensive powers afforded to Ministers to disapply wide-ranging elements of the protocol and the withdrawal agreement, therefore breaching established international obligations and international law. All this would essentially be applicable unilaterally and without the burden of impasse having been established beforehand between the EU and the UK, which also dismisses the obligations to unblock any such disputes through arbitration as set out in article 68 of the withdrawal agreement&#8212;another distinct breach of faith.</p> <p pid="d721.0/3">This calamity is not some unconventional wheeze, such as fantasy extra funding for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS">NHS</a> as a Brexit dividend, or describing this deal to the exhausted UK public as oven-ready just before an election. This is breaking international law: it is in a different league altogether. If <a href="/mp/?p=13736" title="Our page on Bob Neill - 'the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Sir Robert Neill)'">Sir Robert Neill</a> were still <a href="/glossary/?gl=145" title="Of a male MP, sitting on his regular seat in the House.

Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of 80 the Government will have no difficulty whatever in getting it approved by willing Tory Members.</p> <p pid="d721.0/4"><a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 42(3)(b) is binary, if not wholly myopic in its abstract assertion that there exists uniquely the need to maintain the integrity and smooth operation of the UK internal market, as though that works in one direction only. Without an agreement, the EU will, of course, have every legitimate claim to protect the completeness and integrity of its single market, so what is the takeaway from that? It is border checks.</p> <p pid="d721.0/5"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Northern_Ireland">The Northern Ireland</a> protocol agreed by this <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> in this Parliament in January this year is now to be rowed back on by this Bill. At one stage, we were told that a border in the Irish sea would be the solution to this, and now it turns out that that is as unlikely as it sounded. Brexiteers championed hollow assurances about technological solutions for the movement of goods, but could not identify a single instance around the world where that existed at scale. We were told this would be achieved with good will on all sides, but I suggest that  good will is a resource that the Government have now thoroughly exhausted. The Government stand ready to sacrifice any country in the UK, to jettison any basic measure of international responsibility and to compromise the UK&#8217;s international reputation, such as it is, to their ideological thirst for the purest of all Brexits.</p> <p pid="d721.0/6">As regards the EU establishing checks on the border, that too would appear to be in contravention of the protocol, which states that the UK and the EU made a guarantee of avoiding a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls. But make no mistake, when a customs infrastructure goes up, it will be the United Kingdom and this Government who will be found to be delinquent and not the EU. The EU is not legislating to renege on the withdrawal agreement, but the UK is. A border between Northern Ireland and the Republic&#8212;how can it have come to this, many ask. I do not know how familiar the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> is with border installations in Northern Ireland, but I recall very well what a menacing scar they were on the Irish countryside. I say that with all due deference to my <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Irish">Northern Irish</a> colleagues, whose lived experience I cannot even hope to comprehend. The irony is not lost on those of us with a closeness to that corner of these islands that the erasing of that border and the securing of peace in the 1990s was a product of real statesmen and women who possessed and deployed political courage, wisdom and foresight. Contrast that with the reckless disregard of this Prime Minister and&#8212;let us call them&#8212;his associates, who would not be fit to carry the bags of people such as Mo Mowlam, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hume">John Hume</a>, David Trimble, Senator George Mitchell and many more. What will the clauses in part 5 of the Bill, so enacted, mean for people in Northern Ireland&#8212;in not just the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Counties">Six Counties</a> but the neighbouring counties in the Republic, with cross-border economies? What hardship and anxiety awaits the people and businesses in counties such as Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal?</p> <p pid="d721.0/7">The pride of all British nationalists is the alleged strength of the Union but, as we see in the Bill, Northern Ireland is, like Scotland and Wales, important to the British state only when it can further a British ambition or generate a British receipt. The toll that takes on our peoples is merely collateral, and it was ever thus. It is hard to know which is the less competent: signing a treaty that stymies their own Brexit ambitions or trying to defend and protect their precious Union by tearing up the basis of devolution and smashing the principles of subsidiarity asunder with the Bill. The further disintegration of the UK was always going to be a consequence of Brexit and the Bill merely hastens the essential crisis that the UK now faces. Although this is in step with my own ambitions for the UK&#8217;s demise, Scottish independence is close at hand with or without the immediate impositions of the Bill, which my colleagues and I will continue to oppose.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d722.0/1">I shall speak against clauses 42 and 45 standing part of the Bill.</p> <p pid="d722.0/2">When five out of the last six leaders of the Conservative party and all five living <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Ministers">Prime Ministers</a> are on the same side of the argument, it is time to sit up and take note. It is not often that I agree with <a href="/mp/?p=10426" title="Our page on Theresa May - 'the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)'">Mrs May</a>, but her remarks earlier in the debate were absolutely right. The Bill&#8217;s attempt to enable  the UK to break an international agreement made in good faith is both reckless and damaging. There have been protestations that the measures in the Bill would be used only if an agreement cannot be reached, but their price is the trashing of Britain&#8217;s reputation as an honest broker. The Bill will forever allow those regimes that flout international law to counter any criticism and point a finger back at the UK. Is that really a price worth paying? Of course it is not.</p> <p pid="d722.0/3">How did we get here? The withdrawal agreement clearly made reference to the state aid rules in article 10 of the Northern Ireland protocol. The clue was in the title of the article&#8212;it was there in black and white: &#8220;State aid&#8221;. Did no one notice that section? Did no one read that? If not, the Government are grossly negligent. We have learned that article 10&#8217;s impact was made fully known to Ministers at the time. Even if it was not picked up in October, it was certainly referred to in those January days when Parliament debated the European Union (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_Agreement">Withdrawal Agreement</a>) Bill at length before passing it into law. If state aid was such a big deal, I am surprised that Government Members who were so ebullient in their support of the withdrawal agreement Bill are now so eager to say it was flawed and explain why we must pass this Bill instead. Why did they not kick up a fuss at the time? Where were they?</p> <p pid="d722.0/4">Many from the Conservative party will say that the measures in the Bill will be invoked only as a last resort, but even passing the Bill and allowing the Government to break international law is doing untold damage to this country&#8217;s reputation. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Kingdom">The United Kingdom</a> is a signatory to and has ratified the Vienna convention. One of the principles that underpin that convention is negotiating in good faith. Passing this Bill will fly in the face of the Vienna convention and give a green light to other countries wishing to break agreements. With the Government having taken this step, how will anyone ever trust anything that they say in negotiations ever again? Far from making trade deals easier, this legislation has made negotiations much harder, with the United States leading the outcry as it sees renegotiating the Northern Ireland protocol as a gross act of bad faith.</p> <p pid="d722.0/5">The former Conservative leader <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Howard">Lord Howard</a> was right when he asked how the UK could reproach Russia, China and Iran for their actions when the UK itself was willing to break international law, as he lamented the damage to Britain&#8217;s reputation for probity and respect for the rule of law. Perhaps the Bill&#8217;s intention is to ensure that we leave the transition period without an agreement. Perhaps it is a negotiation tactic, or perhaps it is designed to be a big distraction. Whichever one of those it may be, saying that the Bill breaks the law</p> <p class="indent" pid="d722.0/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;in a very specific and limited way&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2020-09-08">8 September</phrase> 2020; Vol. 679, c. 509.]</p> <p pid="d722.0/7">has diminished Britain&#8217;s global reputation.</p> <p pid="d722.0/8">Just as conspiracy offences carry the same maximum sentence as the original offence itself, even if the powers in the Bill were not used, the fact that the intention was there to do so is proof enough of bad faith. If the Bill passes, even if the power to disapply is not used, irrevocable damage has been done to Britain&#8217;s international reputation. Once that reputation is lost it will be very hard to get back.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d723.0/1">I wish to speak to my <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 42. I am optimistic that we can reach a deal for the benefit of both the UK and the EU. My amendment outlines a  way whereby in the event that the implementation period ends without a UK agreement we can still provide reassurance on the integrity of our internal market. The statement that EU negotiators made on <phrase class="date" code="2020-09-10">10 September</phrase>, threatening, on the record, that the EU could control the movement of food from Great Britain to Northern Ireland was a regrettable escalation. The reality is that we do not need to accept its interpretation of the protocol. The alternative in the face of unreasonable demands is to state clearly our interpretation of what we agreed to when we signed the protocol.</p> <p pid="d723.0/2">As I highlighted in the debates last year&#8212;I also had numerous meetings with the then <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the then <a href="/glossary/?gl=138" title="The Attorney General, assisted by the Solicitor General, is the chief legal..." class="glossary">Attorney General</a>, and the ideas I promoted were incorporated in the previous Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8217;s last suggestion&#8212;there is an instrument of diplomacy that can be applied to treaties of this kind and it is called an &#8220;interpretative declaration&#8221;. Any party to a treaty can use this legal instrument on its own initiative. To emphasise that, we refer to it as a unilateral interpretative declaration. I am sorry to get into detail, but this is terribly important. The law is important and we must uphold the law, which is why I have concerns about the current direction the Government are taking. If the Germans have given the world great music and the French have given it great pictures, we have given the world freedom under the law, under parliamentary democracy, so we must remain within the law.</p> <p pid="d723.0/3">The point is that there may be a way for the Government to achieve their objective without breaking international law. If the EU were to act on its threat, it would violate our sovereignty&#8212;one of the most basic principles of international law. This is what lawyers call an act of bad faith in negotiations. It can also be called a manifestly absurd interpretation of the protocol, and under international law no one is bound by an absurd interpretation of a treaty that is entered into in good faith. If we use a unilateral interpretative declaration to spell out our objections, the EU must respond by either explicitly rejecting or implicitly accepting our interpretation. If it rejects, it must formulate and justify an alternative interpretation. If the EU goes along with a unilateral interpretative declaration made by the UK, it becomes a legally binding joint interpretation. If the EU opposes our interpretation, we have at least strengthened our negotiating position, pushed the EU negotiators on to the back foot and gained a basis for appealing to EU national Governments for new instructions to be given to EU negotiators.</p> <p pid="d723.0/4">Importantly, an interpretative declaration would hand the EU a way out of the escalation, which is why I am putting this forward as a constructive idea to get us out of the impasse we are in. So much of diplomacy is about saving face, and this would help the EU to do so, while securing an agreement. We would not be reopening or unpicking the protocol; we would just be making a small explanatory statement of our interpretation of what we had signed up to in good faith. Stage three of Brexit starts in January, when we will have established a series of new relationships between the UK, the Republic of Ireland and the EU. There have been deep and bitter rifts over this, first about the backstop and then about the new protocol, but two major improvements have taken place. First, we no longer have the backstop. Secondly, the new arrangement will last only as long as it has the consent of the people of Northern Ireland.  Critics say, &#8220;Oh, but Northern Ireland is part of the UK. We will still be linked to the EU.&#8221; That is a valid point, but what clear alternatives are they offering?</p> <p pid="d723.0/5">We have a fundamental logical difficulty here. We have three important goals, and it is difficult to see how they can all be reached compatibly but in full: first, we want to support the Belfast agreement; secondly, we want to leave the customs union; and thirdly, we want a cohesive, sovereign, independent United Kingdom. We cannot reach each of those three goals in full simultaneously without a little bit of give and take, and that is all I am suggesting. We need to invoke the great British spirit of compromise. It may be called muddling through, but it is what we do best.</p> <p pid="d723.0/6">It is the same in the family of communities that is the United Kingdom and the family of nations in the world. We need to make sacrifices in order to work together. With a little bit of malleability, making some tweaks to the integrity of our internal market, we can preserve the peace in Northern Ireland that has taken so long to achieve. Equally, if we are making some adjustments and sacrifices, the European Union needs to sacrifice its rigid attitudes. That is the compromise I propose, and I hope it is helpful to the debate.</p>            </div>

After that, I will seek to address part 5 of the Bill, which is the focus of our line-by-line scrutiny tonight.</p> <p pid="d725.0/2">Like many colleagues from Scotland, I have grave concerns that the Bill is not only a slap in the face to the rule of international law but undermines the very foundations of the devolution settlements, which are so precious to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. That should not surprise the people of Scotland, who witnessed the Tories campaign vehemently against devolution in the 1997 referendum. The truth is that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> and this <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> in particular have never respected the devolution arrangements. As my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25361" title="Our page on Ian Blackford - 'the Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Ian Blackford)'">Ian Blackford</a> reminded the House last week, it was a former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a> writer who wrote a tirade against devolution, saying:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d725.0/3" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Devolution is causing all the strains that its opponents predicted, and in allowing the Scots to make their own <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed.

But let us be crystal clear about the draft legislation before us and the consequences of it receiving <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Assent">Royal Assent</a>. For a start, the Bill would undoubtedly lead to a race to the bottom on food and environmental standards. Indeed, it creates more, not less, uncertainty for businesses and makes the case that the only way to truly defend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a> is with the normal powers of independence.</p> <p pid="d725.0/6">I am long enough in the tooth to know that <a href="/glossary/?gl=96" title="The clause by clause consideration of a parliamentary bill takes place at..." class="glossary">Committee of the whole House</a> means that my remarks have to be focused on the specific clauses at hand, so I will not test your patience much longer, Dame Rosie, and will seek to focus on part 5 of the Bill. Indeed, I will make specific and limited references to clauses 40 to 45, but in doing so, I wish to indicate my support for amendments 27, 31 to 40, 44, 80, 88 and 89, in the name of my hon.

Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">Division</a>.</p> <p pid="d725.0/7">I want to first deal with the issue of breaching international law, which has been the source of much debate this evening and in recent weeks. Since this is the first time that I have participated in proceedings on the Bill, I have had the opportunity to watch all of this play out, particularly on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> last week, and I am still not quite sure what to make of it, if I am truly honest.</p> <p pid="d725.0/8">Part of me still finds it jaw-dropping and astonishing that the Conservative party&#8212;once the party of law and order&#8212;is now openly flouting international law. But then I realise that we have been here before, because this is a Government and a Prime Minister who do not respect or uphold the law. It is a timely reminder of the events this time last year, when my hon. and learned Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25404" title="Our page on Joanna Cherry - 'the Member for Edinburgh South West (Joanna Cherry)'">Joanna Cherry</a> forced the Government into the Supreme Court, which found their actions to prorogue Parliament &#8220;unlawful&#8221;, so should we be surprised at this Government putting two fingers up to the judiciary? Ministers need to think again, not just because it is morally wrong to break the law, but because it is also a clear breach of the ministerial code. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Anderson">David Anderson</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=139" title="A barrister appointed to senior rank by the Lord Chancellor. When the..." class="glossary">QC</a> was bang on the money when he said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d725.0/9" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministerial_Code">Ministerial Code</a> still mandates compliance with international law, despite a change to its wording, as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Appeal">Court of Appeal</a> confirmed in 2018&#8221;.</p> <p pid="d725.0/10">However, the controversy surrounding the clauses before us tonight is not just about upholding the rule of law, which is surely the most basic thing we would expect from a permanent member of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a>. Pushing ahead with this madness will have an impact for post-Brexit Britain on the world stage. What does it say about a post-Brexit global Britain that its first act as an independent state is to tear up the rules-based order? I would argue that it sends a clear signal that Britain under Boris is giving two fingers up to not just international law but peace on the island of Ireland, and that is what worries me most about all this. Tory Ministers and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Benchers">Back Benchers</a> appear, once again, to be playing fast and loose with Northern Ireland, with little understanding of the consequences for the fragile communities over there, or indeed for the knock-on effect on trade.</p> <p pid="d725.0/11">We know that pressing ahead with this reckless act is a sure-fire way of torpedoing any chance of a trade deal with the United States. How do we know that? Because the Americans have said so already. Take <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a>, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a> of Congress, who said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d725.0/12" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;The U.K. must respect the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Protocol">Northern Ireland Protocol</a> as signed with the EU to ensure the free flow of goods across the border. If the U.K. violates that international treaty and Brexit undermines the Good Friday accord, there will be absolutely no chance of a U.S.-U.K. trade agreement passing the Congress.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d725.0/13">Most of us know that playing fast and loose with the Northern Ireland protocol, as the Bill proposes, will  not end well, but imagine my surprise when I saw some tweets from <a href="/mp/?p=10499" title="Our page on John Redwood - 'the right hon. Member for Wokingham (John Redwood)'">John Redwood</a> suggesting:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d725.0/14" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Trade deals are nice to have but not essential. We didn&#8217;t have a trade deal with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">USA</a> when in the EU. Getting back full control of our laws, our money and our borders is essential.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d725.0/15">I am a bit confused, because one caucus of the Tory party, headed up by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Trade_Secretary">International Trade Secretary</a>, says that Brexit is all about new opportunities for trade, and Brextremists such as the right hon. Gentleman say that trade deals are nice but not essential&#8212;all the while the Government are playing fast and loose with peace on the island of Ireland.</p> <p pid="d725.0/16">The fact is that the Bill, and specifically the three clauses before us, are a clear advert for what Brexit Britain looks like: playing peace with Northern Ireland; riding roughshod over devolution; a race to the bottom on food and environmental standards; and two fingers up to upholding the rule of law. People in Scotland can see that it is an advert for post-Brexit Britain, and do not be surprised if they trade it in for independence  and take back control the next time Scotland has the opportunity.</p>            </div>

It is a sign of how fast moving these debates are that when I put into speak this evening I intended to support <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 4 in the name of my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=13736" title="Our page on Bob Neill - 'the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Sir Robert Neill)'">Sir Robert Neill</a>, but before I got the chance to speak he had already indicated his intention of withdrawing it. He is doing so for the best of reasons. It was an excellent amendment, and I am glad that the Government have said that they agree with the thrust of it, so we can discuss a different set of points.</p> <p pid="d727.0/2">I know that many of my friends and colleagues abstained or voted against the Bill on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> because of their doubts about part 5. I voted in favour because I think that the other 50 clauses are excellent and essential. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> internal market is key to the future prosperity of people in all four countries of the United Kingdom, and the principles of market recognition and non-discrimination are at the heart of the future prosperity of our citizens in all parts of the UK.</p> <p pid="d727.0/3">However, I shared the doubts that many had about clauses 42, 43 and 45&#8212;the essential parts of part 5 of the Bill&#8212;and I was quite shocked to hear a <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> say that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> were planning to break the law, even in a specific and limited way. I had not ever expected to hear any Secretary of State say that, particularly not a Conservative one, so I am genuinely delighted that the Government have taken over my hon. Friend&#8217;s amendment. I think that is a wise and pragmatic thing for the Government to have done, and I am glad to have played my part in the talks that led to it.</p> <p pid="d727.0/4">It is important that the House recognise that this is more than just kicking the can down the road, if I can revive one of the great clich&#233;s of 2018 political debate. The Government amendment needs to be put in context with the public statement that the Government have made on gov.uk and, indeed, some of the words that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> uttered in opening this debate, when he made it clear that Parliament will be asked to support the use of the provisions in the clauses, and any similar subsequent provisions, only in the case of the EU being engaged in a material breach of its duties of good faith and, in the Government&#8217;s view, thereby undermining the fundamental purpose of the Northern Ireland protocol, and giving examples of what that would involve.</p> <p pid="d727.0/5">It seems to me that, despite the various attacks on the Bill that we have heard, the case is now straightforward. If the Government can convince the House that those on the other side in the negotiations have broken the rules, they can proceed. At that point, the Government have said, the dispute resolution procedures in the withdrawal agreement will come into force, which I think is another sign of legal action. But the key point is that the Government will have to make the case to this House that the EU has broken the agreement, not the UK. I am absolutely sure that that proposition will provoke a lively debate in this House, and indeed across the channel, but in the light of that debate we will then decide and we will make the law. If the Government cannot make the case that they are behaving properly, proportionately and legally, they will not convince the House. It seems to me that that is how law making should happen in this parliamentary democracy.</p> <p pid="d727.0/6">This is where I part company with my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10426" title="Our page on Theresa May - 'the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)'">Mrs May</a>, who made a passionate and powerful speech. She said that there was no difference between the Executive acting and Parliament acting, but I do not think that is true. I think that there is much greater force in action taken knowingly by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a>, particularly in this context, when it is considering whether the Government are acting lawfully. Putting that power in the hands of the House of Commons is democratically proper and therefore legally proper.</p> <p pid="d727.0/7"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Northern_Ireland">The Northern Ireland</a> clauses of the Bill have not had an easy passage, for good and serious reasons, but we are now in a much better place with them than we were a week ago, and I am now happy to support the Government on this and on the Bill more generally.</p>            </div>

That is why there has been so much criticism of the Government&#8217;s work, including by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amal_Clooney">Amal Clooney</a>&#8212;until recently the UK Government&#8217;s special envoy on global media freedom and a distinguished human rights barrister at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughty_Street_Chambers">Doughty Street Chambers</a>&#8212;who said that</p> <p class="indent" pid="d728.0/22" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;I have always been proud of the UK&#8217;s reputation as a champion of the international legal order, and of the culture of fair play&#8230;However&#8230;it has now become untenable for me&#8230;to urge other states to respect and enforce international obligations while the UK declares that it does not intend to do so itself&#8230;It threatens to embolden autocratic regimes that violate international law with devastating consequences all over the world.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d728.0/23">When we make arguments about the Sino-British treaty over <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> or the territorial integrity of Ukraine, when we say that those who have committed crimes against humanity and genocide should be brought to justice, when we make arguments for a world trade system&#8212;a legally binding international financial and trading system&#8212;about the Paris climate change agreement, or, in our own specific national interests, on Gibraltar, the Falklands and maritime claims, we are undermining our place on the world stage. That is what the Government have done and are continuing to do. I urge all those across the House of principle and conscience who believe in global Britain&#8212;we might have disagreements over other things&#8212;and believe that this is a country of fair play and decency, which keeps its word and can be respected and influential, not to support these clauses and to speak out against this Bill.</p>            </div>

I am going to be very brief.</p> <p pid="d731.2/2">The important perspective is to ask ourselves how this debate is going to be regarded in 10, 20 or 30 years&#8217; time. These controversies will be seen as the growing pains of the re-establishment of our national sovereign independence as a national democracy. I dare say that none of us has studied the debates on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Reform_Act_of_1832">Great Reform Act of 1832</a>, but I bet they went through exactly the same kind of painful introspection that we have seen in the Chamber this evening. Today we look upon the 1832 Reform Act as a great stride towards the democratisation of our constitution, and history will look back at these debates in the same way and see this moment in our history as the time that we decided to take back control of our own constitutional arrangements and our own national democracy.</p> <p pid="d731.2/3">I would go further than that. There is no doubt that this Bill will get through this House intact, but some people are suggesting that there will be more of a problem in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>. There will be those who continue to resist the consequences of leaving the European Union and the consequences of having signed a highly unsatisfactory agreement that attempts to sustain the influence of the European Union far beyond any legitimate role it has in making the <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> of our country. That is what we are talking about, in relieving ourselves of these clauses. However, I can assure the House that, in the long run, nothing is going to stand in the way of  the British people re-establishing and reclaiming our independence, and if the other place chooses to stand in our way in that respect, I suspect that in the longer term this House, as the democratic House, will prevail.</p>            </div>

Those are the clauses that allow this Government to break international law and renege on the legally binding agreement that they themselves negotiated and signed up to less than a year ago&#8212;a fact that, try as they might, they can never escape from. I will also speak to <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 41, which deals with preserving the integrity of the Good Friday agreement, on the basis of which peace has been secured in the north of Ireland for more than two decades and which seeks to defend international law from a Government who believe that somehow, uniquely and exceptionally, it does not apply to them.</p> <p pid="d731.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2020-06-16">16 June</phrase>, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> of the Duchy of Lancaster stood at the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> and said that the Government were &#8220;faithfully implementing&#8221; the withdrawal agreement, including the Northern Ireland protocol. Just 83 days later, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Northern Ireland stood at the same Dispatch Box and said that, yes, the Bill did break international law. This unprecedented political handbrake turn left everyone from a former <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress">United States Congress</a> scarcely able to comprehend what they were hearing&#8212;namely, that the United Kingdom was prepared to go rogue if it did not get its own way, and to ditch its own Northern Ireland protocol. It is a remarkable, not to say ludicrous, position for a Government to find themselves in and one that suggests that this is a Government who have scant regard for the law and a particularly cavalier attitude to the Northern Ireland peace process, displaying as they do very little knowledge, understanding or care as to the consequences of their actions.</p> <p pid="d731.3/3">I know that we live in strange times, but who would ever have thought that we would be debating whether a UK Conservative Government could knowingly break international law and that this House, led by the self-styled champions of law and order on the Conservative Benches, would be about to say that, yes, it could? Let them be in no doubt that, in doing so, they are signalling to the international community that the United Kingdom is a bad faith actor, an untrustworthy partner whose adherence to international law is based solely on expediency. They might want to ask themselves why&#8212;why would any Government find the UK an attractive partner with which to enter a legally binding trade deal in the future?</p> <p pid="d731.3/4">This is a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Internal_Market_Bill">United Kingdom Internal Market Bill</a>, but it has already attracted international attention, and none of it has been good. Even the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">USA</a>, on which much of the bright post-Brexit future has been predicated, has said that anything that undermines the Good Friday agreement will have dire consequences for the UK, and that there will be no trade deal forthcoming. Did any Conservative Member think that that would not be the case? Is anyone in this House unaware of the political investment that the United States has in brokering peace in Northern Ireland? Did anyone think that, having worked so hard to secure a peace deal, the United States would just watch it crumble into dust when it proved to be an inconvenience to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a>? I tell you what, Madam <a href="/glossary/?gl=6" title="The Deputy speaker is in charge of proceedings of the House of Commons in..." class="glossary">Deputy Speaker</a>, if they did think that then, they certainly do not think it now, because the <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a> of the House of Representatives, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a>, declared that this UK Government must respect the Northern Ireland protocol and that, if they violate it, there will be no chance of a US-UK trade deal. That position was backed up by presidential favourite <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden">Joe Biden</a>, who said that any deal between the UK and the United States is contingent upon respect for the Good Friday agreement. The world is telling the UK: do not breach international law, do not become that rogue state, because there will be consequences if you do.</p> <p pid="d731.3/5">This Bill confirms what many of us have suspected for a long time: there is no long-term or strategic thinking at the heart of this Government. Everything they do is based on expediency and is designed simply to get them off whatever immediate and inconvenient hoop they happen to be caught on. That such behaviour inevitably leads to far bigger and more complex problems  further down the line seems to matter little. They are like an errant child trying to avoid facing up to their responsibilities and are prepared to say or do anything to kick that further down the road and avoid the reckoning. They have run out of road and been reduced to using the Good Friday agreement as a bargaining chip, and are on the brink of becoming an international law breaker. This Bill in its current form will see the United Kingdom cross the Rubicon. It has embarked on a course from which it cannot come back. The mask has slipped and any remaining shred of moral authority that the United Kingdom may have thought it had will have slipped with it. The consequence of this Government&#8217;s action is coming to a head, and it is a disaster entirely of their own making.</p>            </div>

Member for Argyll and Bute (Brendan O&#8217;Hara)'">Brendan O&#8217;Hara</a>. My reservations about clauses 42, 43 and 45 of the Bill were expressed, I hope clearly, on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>, so I do not need to repeat them. Those of us who have reservations and understandable concerns about the effect on the rule of law of what the Government are proposing need, I think, to answer one question, which is whether there are any conceivable circumstances in which international law could properly be broken by this country. I cannot come to the conclusion that there are no conceivable circumstances in which that might be the right course of action. If there were to be a fundamental threat to the social or economic fabric of this country and breaking the international law was the lesser evil, I can accept that that might be the right thing for this country to do it, but if we were to contemplate such a course of action three things would need to be true.</p> <p pid="d733.0/2">The first thing would be that there was specific authority to break international law, not general latitude. It seems to me that we have made progress on that. I congratulate my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=13736" title="Our page on Bob Neill - 'the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Sir Robert Neill)'">Sir Robert Neill</a> and others on negotiating with the Government in the way that they have. I am delighted to see <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> 66 brought forward in the Government&#8217;s name as a consequence; and as my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10241" title="Our page on Damian Green - 'the Member for Ashford (Damian Green)'">Damian Green</a> said a moment or so ago, it is perfectly right that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> should have the opportunity to give its specific view on the specific circumstances that may obtain at that point.</p> <p pid="d733.0/3">The second thing that I think would be required is that the circumstances were wholly exceptional. On that, again, we have made some progress. The statement the Government produced on <phrase class="date" code="2020-09-17">17 September</phrase>, which has been referred to already in this debate, sets out some examples of the type of behaviour on the part of the European Union that would trigger those wholly exceptional circumstances in the Government&#8217;s view. They almost all relate to a breach of faith by the European Union, and I would concede that they are, in that list, indeed wholly exceptional. It is therefore helpful to see that list.</p> <p pid="d733.0/4">There is in my view, however, a third requirement on top of the requirement for a specific sanction and in addition to exceptional circumstances, and that is that there is no alternative to breaking international law. On this, we do need absolute clarity. Again, the Government&#8217;s  statement on <phrase class="date" code="2020-09-17">17 September</phrase> is helpful up to a point, but it does in my view present a problem. Where one of the unacceptable scenarios the Government have described occurs, that statement says that the Government would activate the appropriate formal dispute settlement mechanisms</p> <p class="indent" pid="d733.0/5" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;in parallel with the use of the provisions&#8221; in these clauses.</p> <p pid="d733.0/7">I am afraid it is the use of the phrase &#8220;in parallel with&#8221; that causes me concern.</p> <p pid="d733.0/8">I am not convinced that the world &#8220;in parallel with&#8221; are consistent with the last resort that breaking international law surely must be. It must be the case, must it not, that the United Kingdom will do all within its power within the provisions of the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol before stepping outside  it. Given the reputational damage that a breach of international law would undoubtedly do, that would only be right. To be fair to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, I thought I heard him say at the beginning of this debate that in that scenario the Government would use measures within the agreement before using measures in the Bill. Again, that must be the right approach. But that needs to be reconciled, I am afraid, with the phrase &#8220;in parallel with&#8221; in the Government&#8217;s statement on <phrase class="date" code="2020-09-17">17 September</phrase>.</p> <p pid="d733.0/9">This matters, not because I believe that the Government should be obliged to follow through on an arbitration procedure beyond the last moment at which the Government would be able to take unilateral action in the face of one of these very severe threats that we are discussing, but because there needs to be absolutely clarity that a breach of international law would be a matter of necessity, not a matter of preference, and that everything possible would be done to keep within international law, within the agreements we have negotiated, before we feel the need, if we ever do, to step outside it. I am afraid that the Government still need to provide me, and I am sure other Members of this House, with greater clarity on that very important point.</p>            </div>

I hope his hon. Friends will listen very carefully to what he says, which is incredibly important.</p> <p pid="d734.0/2">There are things I did not expect to be doing today. The first is to be quoting <a href="/mp/?p=10426" title="Our page on Theresa May - 'the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)'">Mrs May</a>, who spoke of the untold damage to the UK&#8217;s reputation of implementing these clauses which will break international law as soon as they hit the statute book. Something else I did not expect to be doing today, or ever, is quoting <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>. In 1975&#8212;before your time, Dame Eleanor&#8212;she said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d734.0/3" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Britain does not renounce Treaties. Indeed, to do so would damage our own integrity as well as international relations.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d734.0/4">In 1982, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs_Thatcher">Mrs Thatcher</a> said of Britain&#8217;s role:</p> <p class="indent" pid="d734.0/5" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;It is in upholding international law and teaching the nations of the world how to live&#8221;.</p> <p pid="d734.0/6">That last bit did not always go down so well, but, Dame Eleanor, you take the point. Mrs Thatcher believed, as the right hon. Member for Maidenhead believes, in the rule of law and in the importance of upholding international law at all cost.</p> <p pid="d734.0/7">That is without citing <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Howard">Lord Howard</a>, Lord Hague or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Lamont">Lord Lamont</a>, and I mention them along with <a href="/mp/?p=11541" title="Our page on Geoffrey Cox - 'the right hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr Cox)'">Mr Cox</a>, as former Members of this House, in three cases, who are held in high regard, or used to be held in high regard, by members of Conservative party. Then we move on to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation_of_British_Industry">Confederation of British Industry</a>: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolyn_Fairbairn">Carolyn Fairbairn</a> spoke of the damage to our reputation and integrity. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federation">The Federation</a> of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Businesses">Small Businesses</a> in Northern Ireland made a plea to the Government for sensible implementation of the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol, but its pleas have fallen, so far, on deaf ears.</p> <p pid="d734.0/8">As we heard earlier, the damage was done when the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Secretary">Northern Ireland Secretary</a> told the House, as he did last week or the week before now&#8212;time passes so fast&#8212;that the Government intended to break international law, albeit in a &#8220;specific and limited way&#8221;. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vienna">The Vienna</a> convention is clear: it is not possible to use domestic law as an excuse for breaking international law. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_5">Article 5</a> of the withdrawal agreement makes it clear that it is not possible to do so, and Conservative Members all signed up to it at a <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a> and in here when they voted for it.

We would love to know in the wind-up. What of the dispute resolution system and the binding arbitration they have agreed to? Why is it no longer enough? Is this really about state aid, and the Damascene conversion of a Conservative party that last year only spent 0.38% of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a> on subsidies, while in Germany the figure was 1.38% and in Portugal as much as 1.69%?

We found that out on the Trade Bill, and we continue to do so. They deny any opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny, and it is the same here with these customs clearances and state aid. When it comes to state aid, we are now being told, although we cannot see the detail, that the Japanese deal will have a different state aid regime from the one they are proposing.

Part 5 proved controversial, even before we began proceedings this afternoon. I have no doubt that my hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> arrived in the Chamber fully expecting that he would have to defend the Government against accusations of being in breach of their obligations under the withdrawal agreement, and he has not been disappointed.</p> <p pid="d736.0/2">What has been frequently overlooked in today&#8217;s debate is the fact that obligations under the withdrawal agreement move in two directions. There are obligations on both sides. Specifically, the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration impose obligations on both the European Union and the United Kingdom to use their best endeavours in good faith to negotiate expeditiously the free trade agreement that will constitute their future relationship.</p> <p pid="d736.0/3">The political declaration provides that that relationship must ensure the sovereignty of the United Kingdom and the protection of its internal market. The sad fact is that negotiations have not proceeded expeditiously, and it is more than arguable that the European Union has not used its best endeavours nor acted in good faith. The EU, in fact, has refused to talk about anything other than its so-called red lines of fisheries, the level playing field and state aid. Time is rapidly passing, yet the EU refuses to talk about anything else. If, as a consequence of its intransigence and refusal to discuss things other than its red lines, we arrive at the point where the negotiations fail and there is no free trade agreement, there will be potentially severe, adverse consequences for the integrity of the United Kingdom&#8217;s internal market. Hardest hit will be Northern Ireland. To take one example, although the protocol says in terms that Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of the United Kingdom, the protocol says that it is part of the EU&#8217;s customs territory, and potentially the consequences are that goods passing from Northern Ireland to Great Britain will be subject to what <a href="/mp/?p=25280" title="Our page on Gavin Robinson - 'the hon. Member for Belfast East (Gavin Robinson)'">Gavin Robinson</a> described as bureaucratic and administrative borders.</p> <p pid="d736.0/4">That is despite the fact that article 6 of the protocol provides that nothing should prevent the United Kingdom from ensuring unfettered market access for goods  moving from Northern Ireland to other parts of the  UK&#8217;s internal market. Part 5 of the Bill therefore sets up a safeguard against such consequences, should there be no satisfactory conclusion to the negotiations on the future relationship.</p> <p pid="d736.0/5">The impact on the Belfast/Good Friday agreement is deeply worrying. The right for the people of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_and_Ireland">Great Britain and Ireland</a> to trade freely was enshrined in article 6 of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1800">Acts of Union 1800</a>. Those provisions still apply to Northern Ireland&#8212;they are rights set up under a constitutional statute. If the right of the people of Northern Ireland to trade freely with the rest of the UK were to be changed without their consent, it would amount to a major breach of the core principle of the Belfast agreement.</p> <p pid="d736.0/6">None of the provisions of the Bill will take effect until such time as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> makes regulations that they should. Government amendment 66 provides that no such regulations may be made until such time as they have been authorised by a vote of this House, and the Government have made it clear that they will not call a vote unless the EU is seen to be in material breach of its duty of good faith or other obligations. That, I believe, should give additional comfort to hon. Members who have been concerned about the impact of such regulations, but, to repeat, these provisions simply amount to a safeguard against the potential consequences of there being no concluded agreement on the future relationship, and they are legitimised by section 38 of the European Union (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_Agreement">Withdrawal Agreement</a>) Act 2020. The best way to avoid their use is for the EU to perform its obligations under the withdrawal agreement and negotiate with the UK to secure a free trade agreement.</p> <p pid="d736.0/7">I believe that the Government are acting prudently in <a href="/glossary/?gl=247" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_interest" class="glossary">the national interest</a> in creating this safeguard against the continued breach by the European Union of its obligations under the withdrawal agreement, and I therefore support part 5 of the Bill.</p>            </div>

It is about the continuity of trade and the integrity of the United Kingdom, the principle of mutual recognition and the principle of non-discrimination of goods within the UK, and there is much practical stuff that, in the absence of an early agreement with the EU, we need to do. However, I have serious reservations about the inclusion of clauses 41 to 45 because of the implications well beyond this Bill, or indeed, well beyond our withdrawal process from the EU. They raise serious question marks about the intent and good name of the United Kingdom in being party to other international agreements.</p> <p pid="d738.0/3">When a Government <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> at the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> states that the UK will be able to break the law, albeit in a &#8220;specific and limited way&#8221;, parliamentarians should prick up their ears and ask why and how, and demand proper justification from the Government and the Ministers to whom this part of the Bill gives considerable and ongoing powers. When the Government published this Bill in a hurry, that justification, I feel, was just not forthcoming from the Government, and on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a>, I therefore could not support the Bill. I would like to support the Government. I would like to support the Bill, but I need more assurances.</p> <p pid="d738.0/4"><a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> 4, which was put forward by my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=13736" title="Our page on Bob Neill - 'the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Sir Robert Neill)'">Sir Robert Neill</a> and which forced the hand of the Government with Government amendment 66, certainly helps, although it just gives an additional check without removing the powers reserved to the Government fundamentally. I say this as a concerned Brexiteer, but this is not a question of leave or remain. It has no impact on the UK leaving the EU fully after the end of the transition period on <phrase class="date" code="2020-12-31">31 December</phrase>, but it does have an impact, potentially, on how we carry on our business in the world beyond the EU after <phrase class="date" code="2020-12-31">31 December</phrase>.</p> <p pid="d738.0/5">I think the EU has behaved disgracefully throughout the negotiation period. It has exploited shamelessly the unique position of Northern Ireland as our land border with the EU but subordinate to the very important status conferred on it by the Good Friday agreement. It has used all sorts of underhand tactics to promote its pet causes, to keep the UK under the control of EU <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> and regulations, be that British fisheries or state aid considerations and preventing us from being able to compete fairly, which is all we ask. &#8220;Unless you give us what we want, we will impose checks and tariffs between <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland">Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a>, and there is nothing you can do to stop it&#8221;&#8212;runs the subtext of the negotiations.</p> <p pid="d738.0/6">It has now become clear that the EU is trying to reinterpret the terms of the withdrawal agreement to impose control over internal markets within the UK that no other country would tolerate and none has been required to agree to as part of any other EU trade deal. Of course, as we heard from many hon. Members, the EU is no stranger to breaking international agreements when that suits it, especially as regards the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO">WTO</a>. Has the EU really been negotiating an agreement in good faith, especially when a precedent has already been set of what was possible with a Canada-type deal?</p> <p pid="d738.0/7">Despite all this, it does not, and should not, mean that we, the United Kingdom, have to follow suit and act badly as well. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Kingdom">The United Kingdom</a> has a reputation for upholding the rule of law. The Conservative party has always had as one of its most cherished doctrines the importance of upholding the rule of law, so I share, for once, the concern of many lawyers who are worried that these clauses represent a significant risk of violation of the UK&#8217;s international law obligations, including the principle of good faith and sincere co-operation; that the Northern Ireland protocol and associated case law would have a subordinate role dependent on ministerial interpretation; and that this would have potentially a serious impact on the reputation of the UK as a centre for international legal practice and dispute resolution. This would not go down well, given the professed ambition of UK, quite rightly, to be a leader in global  trade and a trailblazer for free trade in particular. As the former <a href="/glossary/?gl=138" title="The Attorney General, assisted by the Solicitor General, is the chief legal..." class="glossary">Attorney General</a> put it, assenting to these proposals</p> <p class="indent" pid="d738.0/8" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;would amount to nothing more or less than the unilateral abrogation of the treaty obligations to which we pledged our word less than 12 months ago, and which this parliament ratified in February.&#8221;</p> <p pid="d738.0/9">If we do not like what we signed, there is an arbitration process, so finally, I am genuinely bemused about why these clauses have been brought forward now and what they were intended to achieve. There is nothing in the Bill or in the Government amendments about them only being used in extremis, after all those other routes have been exhausted, and that includes the formal arbitration process. If we are going to pre-empt that arbitration process by saying that we will not go to arbitration, why include an arbitration process, and if we do believe in an arbitration process but we will not follow the result if it goes against us, that arbitration process is worthless and pointless.</p> <p pid="d738.0/10">Why now? Why not when negotiations have not come to a conclusion, if that is the case, despite the severe strain that this move has put on them? Why not nearer <phrase class="date" code="2020-12-31">31 December</phrase>, if it has become clear that a deal has not been reached and the EU is determined to enact our worst-feared scenario? If this is a bargaining tactic, it does not seem to have gone down very well. It has not made negotiations any easier. It has not made a US trade deal any easier. It has not made any other trade deals any easier.</p> <p pid="d738.0/11">If this really is a bargaining tactic, it is necessary to be able to deliver on it, and there are doubts about whether the Bill can get through the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>. I am afraid that I just do not understand it. I hope that before we vote, Ministers will make everything magically clearer. I may give the Government the benefit of the doubt, but if it comes back for the vote of the Commons&#8212;not the Lords, notably&#8212;and those questions remain unanswered, I will not be able to support a Bill that retains these clauses unqualified. I hope that the Minister will prove me wrong.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d740.0/1">It is a pleasure to speak on this issue. This is an intricate matter that is not helped by those with little or poor understanding of the Belfast agreement, or indeed of the truth of the troubles and our painful journey, using it as a political soundbite. Seeing <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a>, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_House_of_Representatives">US House of Representatives</a>, being led by a reporter to outline the consequences of this Bill for US-UK trade relations would have been laughable had it not highlighted the severe misunderstanding that many people are under.</p> <p pid="d740.0/2">This Bill is not designed to tear up the Belfast agreement; in fact, it is there to recognise that until the will of the people is to be Irish, we are to be considered British, and we are to remain so until a border poll is carried out. That border poll has not been carried out yet. The Belfast agreement underlines the notion of consent; for us to have an absolutely separate rule for state aid and other trade and transport damages the very principle of consent in the Belfast agreement. That is the reason that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Unionist">Democratic Unionist</a> party have tabled amendments on state aid&#8212;yet, for some, the message is not getting through just yet. Clauses 45 to 50 are very clear in  their purpose.</p> <p pid="d740.0/3">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Farmers_Union">Ulster Farmers Union</a> has also been very clear in relation to the levels of state aid in <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 43. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republic_of_Ireland">The Republic of Ireland</a> has a responsibility to its constituents to secure the best deals and the best advantages, but let us be clear: it is not our friend. It is at best a friendly rival, and at worst simply a rival with a voice to implement and effect change in Europe, against our voiceless efforts post Brexit. History has shown that when it comes to doing the right thing by refusing to allow criminals to take harbour over the border, it has no desire to help us as a nation. When I have listened to debates in the D&#225;il, I have never once come to the conclusion that it has our best interests at heart.</p> <p pid="d740.0/4">That is why my colleagues and I tabled our amendments to ensure that the fears of the Ulster Farmers Union and others are not realised. How, for example, do we allow fair trade for any of our dairy products when the mainland has state aid in place in the form of grants for dairy farmers? The answer is that we simply cannot. That is why we need to change state aid through these clauses tonight. Trade is at the core of our amendments.</p> <p pid="d740.0/5">Clause 41, which supports the delivery of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a>&#8217;s commitment to unfettered access for Northern Ireland goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, does so by precluding new checks, controls or administrative processes on qualifying goods as they move from Northern Ireland to GB. It similarly precludes the use of existing checks, controls or processes being used for the first time, or for a new purpose or to a new extent. That does not show the destruction of the Belfast agreement, but it is necessary for the stability of food supply and state aid. Without it, we will certainly see the destruction of our country.</p> <p pid="d740.0/6">As the EU sees it, the UK has committed to comply with applicable notification and standstill obligations. That means that the ceiling put on state aid by the EU still applies in Northern Ireland in relation to trade. We will be constrained under the Northern Ireland protocol to a certain level of support for agriculture, only a certain proportion of which can be spent, for instance, on coupled payments. With that in mind, I believe that Northern Ireland could be constrained by these very rules. That is why tonight we wish to support our amendments and the clauses that the Government have put forward. We urge Members to do the same.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d741.0/1">I am delighted to follow my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10371" title="Our page on Tim Loughton - 'the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)'">Tim Loughton</a> and my right hon. and learned Friend <a href="/mp/?p=11791" title="Our page on Jeremy Wright - 'the Member for Kenilworth and Southam (Jeremy Wright)'">Jeremy Wright</a>, who I very much agreed with.</p> <p pid="d741.0/2">Today we are talking about the answer that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> gave to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Acheson">Dean Acheson</a>&#8217;s famous question, &#8220;What is Britain&#8217;s role in the world?&#8221; She was right: our national mission is upholding the rule of law. That lesson served her and our nation exceptionally well. It gave moral legitimacy to the courageous defence of British nationals in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands">Falkland Islands</a> and strength  to the treaty that she signed two years later with China to protect British nationals in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>. Trust in the treaties allowed Margaret Thatcher to start down the road of peace in our own nation and conclude the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Irish">Anglo-Irish</a> agreement with the then Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald.</p> <p pid="d741.0/3">It is recognition of our legal principles that holds our Union together. Whether we celebrate the Boyne or the rising, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_I">Robert I</a> or Edward I, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd or the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Prince">Black Prince</a>, we all know that this is a civic Union based on rules, not regiments, and we live together because together we consent. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Ministers">Prime Ministers</a> and Taoisigh have known for decades that consent matters because one day our Union may change. The Belfast agreement envisions that possibility, and the treaty that gives Dublin a voice today could, one day, be used in reverse by Westminster. As a proud Unionist, I defend international law and the treaties that we have signed, because one day we may need it to protect us.</p> <p pid="d741.0/4">The treaty that the Government are negotiating today protects us as well. For 40 years, Brits have moved around and lived in EU states, and many businesses continue to rely on continental connections to prosper. They need to know that what comes next will enable them to plan their lives and futures. They need the law to protect them. But the law must not just be predictable: it must be fair. This is where I have sympathy for the Government. Some in Brussels have treated these negotiations as a legal game, forgetting that their intention is to build a common future, not simply to decide the rules of membership. The simple fact that the Government have felt the need to make such a blunt response to the EU&#8217;s offers shows how much Ministers must feel that they have failed to exert leverage at the table. The talks are fundamentally political, so could not a political signal have been sent that did not allow Communist dictators in China to use our own words to mock us, or see US leaders on both sides warn us of the risks that we are running? Perhaps it was; I am sure that the Government would be delighted to make that clear.</p> <p pid="d741.0/5">Of course, no agreements can ever be cast in stone. They are fundamentally made to enable the freedoms of peoples in countries around the world to co-operate. Most famously, President de Gaulle commented on the end of treaties when he took France out of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> command structure after only 20 years. &#8220;Treaties are like roses&#8221;, he said, &#8220;they last as long as they last.&#8221; But to threaten this one so soon after signing must have been a last resort. That, at least, is what the Government are now telling us. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM">PM</a> said that he had not consulted the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a>. Surely the Government must have considered the cost before taking this drastic step.</p> <p pid="d741.0/6">Now that so much of the damage is done, as has been set out today, the onus is on our Government to push hard for an agreement, because, sadly, the EU will now be able to point at us if the talks fail. Whatever we say, too many will now believe that it was we who broke the deal first, and this has put us at a disadvantage. We all know that the impact of a rupture will be felt very keenly in Kent, just as much as it will in Ulster, and we now know, clearly, that many of our allies are deeply concerned about what a failure of statecraft could mean.</p> <p pid="d741.0/7">With a parliamentary lock on these powers splitting the Bill into two parts and giving us the time to see if the EU really has broken faith with the deal before allowing the Government to act, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has at least moved towards the point of reason, and he could go one step further. The Government should restate what they have already agreed in public and in print&#8212;that Britain will abide by the arbitration proceedings  set out in the withdrawal agreement. That would turn the Bill into what it has been described as today by Ministers&#8212;an interim measure in case of emergency. Although it would still set out a way for Britain to be free of unfair treaties, it would at least make it clear that this was to be used only in extremis. Perhaps that would go some way towards restoring Britain&#8217;s reputation, as a regrettable second best to the removal of these clauses altogether. I recognise why the Government want this in parallel, but without accepting that the arbitration is binding, it is simply a reversal of the treaty. We need our word to count; global Britain depends on it.</p>            </div>

The clauses we are talking about today do exactly what we said in the manifesto. <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 40 deals  with Northern Ireland&#8217;s place in the UK internal market. Clause 41 deals with unfettered access. Those should be uncontroversial clauses and they should be uncontroversial because they are explicitly referenced in the protocol itself, which states that</p> <p class="indent" pid="d743.3/2" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;nothing in this Protocol prevents the United Kingdom from ensuring unfettered market access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the United Kingdom&#8217;s internal market&#8221;.</p> <p pid="d743.3/3">As we have heard today, the protocol goes on to set out in high-level terms how we avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, something that I am as committed to today as I was the day I voted for Brexit. We heard eloquently from my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25830" title="Our page on Katherine Fletcher - 'the Member for South Ribble (Katherine Fletcher)'">Katherine Fletcher</a> why that is so important. The protocol also sets out that it is for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a> to reach agreement on some of the specifics. It delegates decision making to that committee to finesse the detail and act in a way that is consistent with the protocol. The protocol requires both sides to negotiate in good faith, protect the Good Friday agreement and reach a free trade deal, because ultimately that free trade deal is what will prevent a hard border. That is what we are striving for, and that is what the clauses help to do.</p> <p pid="d743.3/4">However, given the short time before the end of the transition and that no free trade agreement has yet been agreed, we have to give thought to what happens if the EU takes an approach that is not in good faith. What if it takes a maximalist approach to what goods are considered high risk or a maximalist approach to what would constitute state aid that impacts the European Union? The outcome of that decision would not only be a major impediment to Great Britain and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Irish">Northern Irish</a> trade, but would threaten our own integrity and the Good Friday agreement. Are some seriously suggesting that in that scenario there should not be a means for the UK to respond? Are they suggesting we should look at such a situation, shrug our shoulders and say international law means we must surrender parts of our country?</p> <p pid="d743.3/5">I heard the concerns from Members on both sides of the Committee about international law, but let us be clear on what we are not doing. I do not think that the language has been helpful. We have heard references to rogue states, to the Novichok poisoning on UK streets and to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> citizens, but we are not breaking international criminal law. We are not breaking an international treaty on global security. We are not breaking a free trade agreement. We are saying that, having signed up to an agreement to fulfil a democratic mandate to the people of this country, which one side appears to be using to undermine our constitutional integrity, we will stand resolutely as one country in pushing back.</p> <p pid="d743.3/6">We have values as a country, and yes, those include standing up for an international rules-based system, the rule of law and democratic sovereignty, but when conflict arises, which it can do from time to time, Parliament remains sovereign, and this Parliament will act in the interests of our Union. That position was reaffirmed in our own EU withdrawal Act, which recognised the sovereignty of Parliament. If this Parliament is sovereign, we must act for the constitutional integrity of our country, and for that reason, I will be supporting this Bill.</p>            </div>

I will not be able to take interventions because of the short time available.</p> <p pid="d744.0/2">In response to the specific question from <a href="/mp/?p=24943" title="Our page on Paul Blomfield - 'the hon. Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield)'">Paul Blomfield</a>, although I will not go into the detail of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee">Joint Committee</a> discussions, I can confirm that we certainly have raised the issue of state aid. We, of course, want to see that resolved through the Joint Committee, as we have repeatedly set out.</p> <p pid="d744.0/3">I recognise the significant concerns raised by my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24725" title="Our page on Karen Bradley - 'the Member for Staffordshire Moorlands (Karen Bradley)'">Karen Bradley</a> and others across the Committee, which is why we have agreed that the break-glass provision should be included in the Bill, requiring the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> to give its approval before these measures are commenced. My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=24920" title="Our page on Rehman Chishti - 'the Member for Gillingham and Rainham (Rehman Chishti)'">Rehman Chishti</a> asked an important question, and we will, of course, ensure that the House has the opportunity to debate matters in full before voting on commencement of these provisions.</p> <p pid="d744.0/4">As my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=13736" title="Our page on Bob Neill - 'the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Sir Robert Neill)'">Sir Robert Neill</a> has made clear, if we reach that point, the Government will have to make a persuasive case to the House. We published a statement last week saying that we will ask Parliament to support the use of provisions in the Bill only in the case of the EU being engaged in a material breach of its duties of good faith and thereby undermining the fundamental purpose of the Northern Ireland protocol.</p> <p pid="d744.0/5">As I set out earlier, let me reassure Members that the Government are absolutely committed to implementing the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol, meeting our obligations to secure the peace process. We continue to work with the EU in the Joint Committee to resolve outstanding issues with the Northern Ireland protocol, as the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has set out. However, as a responsible Government, we cannot allow the economic integrity of the UK&#8217;s internal market to be inadvertently compromised by unintended consequences of the protocol. The protocol was designed as a way of implementing the needs of our exit from the EU in a way that worked for Northern Ireland, and in particular for maintaining the Belfast/Good Friday agreement, the gains of the peace process and the delicate balance that that reflects between both communities&#8217; interests. It explicitly depends on the consent of the people of Northern Ireland for its continued existence.</p> <p pid="d744.0/6">We are taking limited and reasonable steps to create a legal safety net by taking powers in reserve, whereby Ministers can guarantee the integrity of our United Kingdom and ensure that the Government are always able to deliver on their commitments to the people of Northern Ireland. As my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25830" title="Our page on Katherine Fletcher - 'the Member for South Ribble (Katherine Fletcher)'">Katherine Fletcher</a> said in an excellent speech, one of those commitments is to the sustained economic growth of Northern Ireland.</p> <p pid="d744.0/7">These limited steps deliver on the commitments that the Government made in their <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a> manifesto&#8212;the manifesto on which every Government Member was returned. They deliver on the commitments made in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_Paper">Command Paper</a> published in May, and they deliver on the promises made by this Government and our predecessor to provide unfettered access between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. I therefore urge Members to vote against all amendments, other than  those brought forward by the Government, to ensure the peace and prosperity of Northern Ireland and our whole United Kingdom.</p> <p pid="d744.0/8">Question put and agreed to.</p> <p pid="d744.0/9"><a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.
