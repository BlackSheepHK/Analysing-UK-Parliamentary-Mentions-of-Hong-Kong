Let me start by sending my condolences to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_Vera_Lynn">Dame Vera Lynn</a>&#8217;s family and friends. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Hear, hear.&#8221;] <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen">The Queen</a> mentioned some of the songs that we all know: we will all meet again someday.</p> <p pid="c960.3/2">I thank the Leader of the House for allotting another <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> day. Obviously, we will be dealing with highly topical subjects. I do not know what we have done to deserve another day, but we may yet force another U-turn, as we did through our &#8220;Holidays Without Hunger&#8221; campaign. He has not announced the recess dates and it is important for us to know them, as well as details of the business, as we are keen to get on with the legislative programme that he says he wants to get on with. Mention has also been made of a mini-Budget in September, and it will be useful to know when the Session will end&#8212;whether it is to be in November or in May.</p> <p pid="c960.3/3">Can the Leader of the House say when the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a> will be set up?

It seems that we are already into the reign of error, because shop workers,  who have worked their socks off, keeping us all in food, and who have been so polite and helpful, may be asked to work extra hours on Sunday&#8212;that is cruel. We are opposed to that, and I hope the Leader of the House will do a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford">Marcus Rashford</a> and work with the Opposition to make sure the Government do a U-turn on that. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Shop,_Distributive_and_Allied_Workers">Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers</a> has just done a survey, finding that 92% of shop workers oppose the move and two thirds of them feel they are under pressure when they are asked to work on a Sunday.</p> <p pid="c960.3/8">What about the reign of error on school meals?

It goes to organisations on the ground. It is about education and health, and economic development. It provides support to people in their own countries so that they do not feel that they have to leave their countries to search for a better life somewhere else. Most importantly, it gives people hope and it was the right thing to do. I know that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> said that we are following Australia and Canada, but we in Britain lead, we do not follow. I want to say thank you to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Thompson">Jan Thompson</a>, the acting high commissioner in India, for bringing back all my stranded constituents. She is a diplomat; she is not dealing with international development. It is diplomats who are involved in freeing Nazanin, freeing Anoosheh and freeing Kylie, who, if reports are correct, has been beaten because she has started a choir. I wonder whether the Leader of the House could find out about that. May we have a statement, not just an urgent question granted by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Speaker">Mr Speaker</a>, from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office on exactly how the Department will be set up? This is chaos and incompetence, without any idea for the infrastructure of the machinery of government.</p> <p pid="c960.3/13">Another machinery of government change was slipped out in a written statement last week. Apparently, border controls are now in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> Office. It seems that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> of the Duchy of Lancaster wants to wear a uniform and a cap so that he can count people in and count people out.

We need an urgent statement on what that is going to look like.</p> <p pid="c960.3/14">We see the reign of error again in the chaotic and incompetent policy announcement on racism and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter">Black Lives Matter</a> movement. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> obviously does not trust any of his Ministers to do the work, but for those who cannot remember, it was a  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> in 1976 who put through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_Relations_Act">Race Relations Act</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_for_Racial_Equality">Commission for Racial Equality</a>, which said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c960.3/15" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;We work for a just and integrated society, where diversity is valued.

There is no criticism in that; it is part of making a democracy work.</p> <p pid="c962.0/3">Recess dates are always subject to the progress of parliamentary business and that remains the case. As soon as I can bring an update to the House, I will do so. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Bill">Environment Bill</a> is an important Bill. Obviously, because there were no Public Bill Committees during the period when we were entirely hybrid, there have been delays. It would be very unlikely for it to be out of Committee at the date currently proposed.</p> <p pid="c962.0/4">I am very glad the right hon. Lady welcomes the Government policy on free school meals. The Government are a Government who listen, and that is quite right. It is very odd that the Labour party should come late to a party asking for something, and then when the Government  give it, complain that the Government have given it. I do not really see the logic in that. I think the Government have done absolutely the right thing.</p> <p pid="c962.0/5">As regards the merger of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFID">DFID</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a>, this is an absolutely brilliant policy. It is one that commands support across the country, because it is putting British interests first. It was not from this <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a>, but from a Dispatch Box in a very similar place&#8212;it had to be replaced after the damage caused by the bomb&#8212;that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a> pointed out that we have eternal interests. Our nation&#8217;s interests must be served by the structures of government, and that is what is being done. We must ensure that taxpayers&#8217; money is well spent, and taxpayers have a right to demand that their money is used carefully.</p> <p pid="c962.0/6">The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has been here to make a statement to the House. You, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, rightly keep <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty">Her Majesty</a>&#8217;s Government on their toes when announcements are not made to this House, and sometimes they creep out at press briefings, which is something you deprecate, but when the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> comes and makes the statement to this House, does he get the laurels that he deserves&#8212;the paeans of praise that should come to him? No, not at all; we get grumbling, moaning and complaining that it is not enough. It has to be said that some people can never be satisfied.</p> <p pid="c962.0/7">The right hon. Lady called for a uniform for the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> of the Duchy of Lancaster; I can tell her that as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_President">Lord President</a> of the Council, I am entitled to a uniform but, as I understand it, the uniform has not been worn by any Lord President since the coronation of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_V">George V</a>. I therefore do not intend to resurrect that ancient tradition. [Interruption.] I do not have the uniform and nor will I be seeking to get the uniform. I do believe that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Duchy_of_Lancaster">Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster</a> is entitled to have a flag on his official car, but I understand that that practice has also fallen into disuse.</p> <p pid="c962.0/8">The right hon. Lady referred to the Government&#8217;s commitment to racial equality, which is a very important subject. It was clear in our manifesto that we will ensure that Britain is a fairer society and tackle racial and ethnic inequalities where they exist. The new commission has been set up to have a fresh and positive approach to try to ensure that we have as fair a society as we possibly can. The seriousness with which the Government take the issue is shown by the seniority of the person put in charge of the commission, working from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street">Downing Street</a>.</p> <p pid="c962.0/9">Finally, the right hon. Lady questioned whether the BBC was being brought into politics. It is noticeable that it is the left that likes to see much higher funding for the BBC; I wonder why that is.</p>            </div>

Most of it will be funded through Barnett consequentials, but several hundred million has had to be diverted from other priority spending. For the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a>, that would not be a problem, as they can overspend if necessary and borrow unlimited amounts to cover the cost. Neither of those options are available to the Scottish Government under the fiscal framework. I hope the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a> will agree that when the framework was devised, no one had in mind the need to cope with a crisis on this scale. On Tuesday, four out of the five parties in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a> united behind a call for additional fiscal responsibilities. Their motivation was practical, not ideological. When can we discuss this Parliament&#8217;s response to that call?</p> <p pid="c964.1/3">Sticking with responses to coronavirus, we have discussed previously how the crisis sadly brings out the worst in some people, and we now hear that companies such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BA">BA</a> are intending, under cover of the pandemic, to execute mass redundancies and then hire back fewer people on worse pay and conditions. My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25291" title="Our page on Gavin Newlands - 'the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire North (Gavin Newlands)'">Gavin Newlands</a> has launched a Bill, with cross-party support, to outlaw such Dickensian employment practices. It would be an easy matter&#8212;would it not?&#8212;for the Government either to make time to discuss that Bill or to bring forward proposals of their own.</p> <p pid="c964.1/4">Finally, I return to the matter of voting during the current emergency. It seems the Government are determined to do just about anything to stop Members voting remotely, including introducing new technology, as we have seen this week. Why do they not stop messing about and do the common sense thing by switching the e-voting system back on: a tried and tested system that not only allows Members who cannot attend to vote but makes it much safer for those who are on the premises?</p>            </div>

Will the Leader let us know when the anticipated estimates days debates are due to take place, and how many days of such debates the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbench_Business_Committee">Backbench Business Committee</a> will have to allocate? We probably need to do that work next week.</p> <p pid="c965.3/2">Also, this afternoon the House will debate the effect of covid-19 on black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. Although I welcome the measure of protected time, it would be a great shame if contributions to such an important and well-subscribed debate had to be limited to only two or three minutes.</p> <p pid="c965.3/3">Lastly, could the Leader of the House crave the indulgence of some of his colleagues in the Business team to look at what <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United">Newcastle United</a> are doing in  terms of being an outlier within the premier league by completely and unnecessarily withholding refunds for tickets for games that they know will not be played in front of fans? It is withholding those refunds from fans: paying customers, many of whom, frankly, in the current climate could do with the money.</p>            </div>

This is an issue across the economy, with many businesses very stretched for cash but consumers expecting to get their money back. It is a problem that the Government are aware of, and there are a variety of routes for people to get their money back. If the company directly is not able to do it, sometimes the credit card company may be able to help.</p>            </div>

It is thanks to the commitment of Members on both sides of the House, in their role as lawmakers, that we have returned physically and are making progress with key legislation that will allow us to take back control of policy making, whether it be agriculture, immigration or trade.

We had some of the worst flooding in the country earlier this year&#8212;hundreds of homes lost everything, many of them without any insurance at all&#8212;and last night, we had another bout of flooding, which has affected about 200 homes. I spoke to one woman last night who was in floods of tears because she had only just managed to get builders to sort her home out. She was about to move back in and now it is all ruined all over again. On top of that, we have a tip, half of which has fallen down into the river. Sixty thousand tonnes have to be moved and the whole thing has to be made safe, because we do not want another Aberfan. The council is completely strapped for cash. We know that we need &#163;60 million to mend the culverts, to make sure that this does not happen all over again in three months&#8217; time, in six months&#8217; time or in a year. We need &#163;2 million to move the 60,000 tonnes of earth. Please&#8212;I do not want a debate, if I am honest; I really just want the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a> to make sure that we get the support we need in the Rhondda.</p>            </div>

I have been talking to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_Vera_Lynn">Dame Vera Lynn</a>&#8217;s daughter, Virginia, and I very much feel that we should make this a very special celebration. We owe her mother a great debt of gratitude for the way her wonderful voice lifted spirits during our darkest hours. To quote Dame Vera, she very much felt that our boys in the far east had been forgotten.</p>            </div>

The Government fully recognise the importance of VJ-day, <phrase class="date" code="2020-08-15">15 August</phrase>. That is also the feast of the Assumption, so it is a day that many celebrate every year for other reasons too, but we will be celebrating particularly on this 75th anniversary of VJ-day. I do not actually know what anniversary it is of the Assumption; I am not sure what year that happened in.</p> <p pid="c970.1/2">This important anniversary is an occasion for us to acknowledge once again the sacrifices made on our behalf by the veterans of the campaign, and to remember all those who lost their lives and the many military prisoners of war and civilian internees who suffered in captivity. The Government and our partners will take into careful consideration the changing national situation as we continue to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. We will always put the health and wellbeing of our veterans at the forefront of our plans. We are committed to creating a programme that will allow members of the public to remember and give thanks to the second world war generation in appropriate and fitting ways, but my hon. Friend is right that we must not allow those troops who were in the far east to be forgotten.</p>            </div>

The general context is of a Government that have taken enormous steps to help a wide range of businesses. It is worth bearing in mind that 8.9 million people are currently using the job  retention or furlough scheme, which cost taxpayers &#163;19.6 billion. That is in addition to the &#163;7.5 billion that has gone to the 2.6 million self-employed, which is perhaps particularly relevant as so many people in the theatre and the arts are self-employed. In addition to that, there are business bounce-back loans. There are many schemes in place to help businesses survive, but the hon. Lady is none the less right to highlight the particular problems of theatre and the arts.</p>            </div>

We have put in place clear and strict guidance on social distancing, and I believe that our elected officials have a responsibility to see it upheld. We strongly support the right to protest peacefully, but it is vital that people stick to the rules to protect themselves and their families. These are not normal times, and to protect us  all and stop the spread of coronavirus, any gatherings of more than six people are unlawful. The actions we have seen over the previous weeks were not the right way to be proceeding, with dozens of police officers injured. The police have our full support in tackling any violence, vandalism or disorderly behaviour, and I would like to echo my colleague&#8212;my colleague? I mean my right hon.

Lady, interesting though it is to observe the guitar that is behind her, given the fascination that we have in being nosey about where people are calling in from. We have ensured that the proper Parliament can continue. When scrutiny was impossible without hybridity, we had hybridity. Now that it is possible for reasonable numbers to come back, we are coming back as far as possible while continuing to make arrangements for people such as the hon. Lady to vote by proxy if they so wish and to appear remotely in interrogative sessions. That is the right way to proceed. People who can go back to work because they need to be back at work should go back to work, and we are leading by example.</p>            </div>
