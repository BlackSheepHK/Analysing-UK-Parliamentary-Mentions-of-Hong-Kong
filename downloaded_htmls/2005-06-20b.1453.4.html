                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.1442.1/1">My Lords, with the leave of the House, I should like to repeat a Statement made in <a href="/glossary/?gl=112" title="During a debate members of the House of Commons traditionally refer to the..." class="glossary">another place</a> by my <a href="/glossary/?gl=172" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to another MP of..." class="glossary">right honourable friend</a> the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Statement">The Statement</a> is as follows:</p> <p pid="b.1442.1/2">"With permission, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, I shall make a Statement about the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council">European Council</a> held in Brussels on 16 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-17">17 June</phrase>.</p> <p pid="b.1442.1/3">"This European Council was essentially about two subjects: the consequences of the 'No' votes in the referendums in France and the Netherlands; and the financial perspectives, the budget ceilings for the EU for the period 2007&#8211;13.</p> <p pid="b.1442.1/4">"In respect of the constitutional treaty, the 10 member states that had ratified were anxious that ratification continue. But realistically, given the 'No' votes in France and the Netherlands, the ratification cannot succeed unless and until those votes change. Moreover, the Dutch Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, rightly and inevitably, said frankly that there was no prospect of his bringing back the treaty for any sort of new decision in this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Parliament">Dutch Parliament</a>. As a result, whatever words are used in Council conclusions, standing the results of the French and Dutch referendums, the treaty cannot proceed. It is therefore sensible, instead, to have a period of reflection, in which the critical questions as to Europe's future direction are debated.</p> <p pid="b.1442.1/5">"On the future financing package, the UK approached the negotiations with three objectives. First, we wanted an overall budget which demonstrated a responsible and prudent approach to spending, at a time when national budgets across Europe are under strain. Secondly, we wanted a commitment to a comprehensive reassessment of the structure of the EU budget.</p> <p pid="b.1442.1/6">"Europe faces an immense global competitive challenge. Quite apart from the established economies of America and Japan, the rise of China, India and the other Asian economies is creating a wholly new economic environment.</p> <p pid="b.1442.1/7">"It simply does not make sense in this new world for Europe to spend over 40 per cent of its budget on the common agricultural policy, representing 5 per cent of the EU population producing less than 2 per cent of Europe's output. We are spending seven times as much on agriculture as on R&amp;D, science, technology, education and support for innovation combined. This is not a budget fit for purpose in the 21st century. Even at the end of the next financial period&#8212;that is, by the beginning of 2014&#8212;we would be spending 40 per cent of the budget on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP">CAP</a>. Europe just cannot wait 10 years or more for the change necessary.</p> <p pid="b.1442.1/8">"It is in this context that the issue of the British rebate must be examined. The rebate arises because of the distortion of the budget. Over the past 10 years to 2003, France's net contribution to the European Union was 18.8 billion euros. In the next financial period&#8212;that is, 2007&#8211;13&#8212;even with the rebate, Britain would be paying around 13 billion euros more. Without it, Britain would pay nearly two and a half times as much as France, and slightly more even in money terms than Germany.</p> <p pid="b.1442.1/9">"However, it is also true that the rebate is merely a correction mechanism, designed to address an underlying imbalance in the budget. As the European Union has expanded and Britain has become more wealthy than countries like France, it is right that it changes.</p> <p pid="b.1442.1/10">"Our position, therefore, was not to refuse any change to the rebate, to rule out a discussion, or to disown our responsibility to pay for the enlargement of Europe we passionately support.</p> <p pid="b.1442.1/11">"On the contrary, I made it clear that we should deal with both anomalies&#8212;the rebate and the CAP. I proposed that we have a fundamental review of the EU budget, reporting in time for us to be able&#8212;midway through the next financial period&#8212;to alter fundamentally the structure of the budget, dealing with both the rebate and the CAP. In the mean time, of course, we would ensure we paid our fair share of enlargement.</p> <p pid="b.1442.1/12">"The presidency proposal from Luxembourg fell way short of such a solution. The terms of the review were expressed in language so vague as to be meaningless. In addition, the words meant, effectively, endorsing the 2002 CAP package up to 2013. It has been frequently said in the past week that this 2002 agreement ruled out further CAP changes, and therefore it was unfair of the United Kingdom to try to reopen it. But in October 2002, it was expressly stated that this agreement was without prejudice to the future financing arrangements and at that time the UK made it clear that on the basis of such a package there could be no change to the rebate.</p> <p pid="b.1442.1/13">"So the review offered was inadequate. What is more, the cost to the UK of the Luxembourg proposal would be over 25 billion euros, meaning that over the next financial period instead of parity with similar-sized countries, we would have been back to, for example, a 23 billion euro deficit with France. This money, incidentally, would not have gone to the poorest countries, but been redistributed among the wealthy ones.</p> <p pid="b.1442.1/14">"This is a deal that I simply could not have recommended to this House. It was not the right deal for Britain. It was not the right deal for Europe. Four other countries rejected it and several more made clear their dissatisfaction.</p> <p pid="b.1442.1/15">"I fully understand the concerns of the new European countries. They want an agreement. We will do our best to secure such an agreement and to make sure that it is one that meets their needs. Britain championed enlargement. Britain will continue to do so. But let us not forget that, on any basis, around 80 per cent of CAP funds and almost 50 per cent of structural and cohesion funds will continue to go, not to the new accession countries, but to the original 15.</p> <p pid="b.1442.1/16">"It is said that the failure to reach a deal has deepened Europe's crisis; that Europe's credibility demanded a deal. No, Europe's credibility demands the right deal&#8212;not the usual cobbled together compromise in the early hours of the morning, but a deal which recognises the nature of the crisis. This crisis is not about the failure of Europe's leaders to reach agreement with each other. The crisis is about the failure of Europe's leaders to reach agreement with the people of Europe about the issues that concern them.</p> <p pid="b.1442.1/17">"People in Europe see the world changing around them, economically and socially, and want answers to the challenges that they face. They worry about globalisation and organised crime&#8212;not the re-weighting of votes in the European Council. If we answer these concerns, Europe will strengthen. And we need a strong Europe to bolster the strength of individual nations. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_European">The European</a> budget should not be separate from that debate, but part of it. It is that debate that we will look forward to in our presidency".</p> <p pid="b.1442.1/18">My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.1444.0/1">My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for repeating this Statement today&#8212;an important Statement about the future direction of the European Union. For once, she can be assured that I will not raise the latest atrocities in Zimbabwe or the closure of EU markets to produce from the third world because those critical issues were not even discussed.</p> <p pid="b.1444.0/2">Free trade was not mentioned in pages of communiqu&#233;s about ways to help Africa, and in the case of Zimbabwe, Mugabe's crimes did not even figure in the presidency conclusions. Tragically, while millions in the world face real crises, the EU leaders indulged in a kitchen-sink spat wholly irrelevant to the future of Europe and a gross distraction from the real issues. That collective failure of political leadership shames Europe.</p> <p pid="b.1444.0/3">Out of this confusion must come some creative thinking. This is the first opportunity for such thinking and we expect tomorrow in the debate that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a> has kindly provided for the House a detailed statement from the Government. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_House">This House</a>, with its deep knowledge of EU issues, will want more than waffle and rhetoric from an incoming presidency, for which the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has had years to prepare.</p> <p pid="b.1444.0/4">I, too, will confine myself to the two issues that the leaders did manage to discuss and the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> mentioned in his Statement&#8212;the constitution and the rebate.</p> <p pid="b.1444.0/5">In Her Majesty's Government's view, is the EU constitution dead? Yes or no? It is important to know, for much of the current presidency's conclusions seem about giving the process a kiss of life. In the Statement the Prime Minister said that,</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.1444.0/6">"whatever words are used in Council conclusions . . . the Treaty cannot proceed".</p> <p pid="b.1444.0/7">It is worth seeing what those conclusions were. The conclusions state:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.1444.0/8">"We consider the outcome of the referendums in France and the Netherlands do not call into question citizens' attachment to the construction of Europe"</p> <p pid="b.1444.0/9">That is what the Prime Minister agreed to on Saturday. But what do the Government mean by that? Is it the Government's view that the people of Holland and France were bonkers to reject the treaty that the Prime Minister believes is good for the new Europe? If not, then what does that phrase actually mean?</p> <p pid="b.1444.0/10">We now hear talk of a "constitution-lite" being the buzz phrase in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a>. What does that mean? Does it mean that the Government's policy is to cherry-pick the draft constitution and try to push through some of it without a referendum? Can the noble Baroness assure the House that, if the Government believe, in the phrase of the Council conclusions, that British citizens are so attached to the construction of Europe that ratification must go forward then the British people will first have the referendum they were promised on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-05">5 May</phrase>?</p> <p pid="b.1444.0/11">In the promised period of reflection&#8212;only until next spring, please note&#8212;the conclusions call for,</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.1444.0/12">"a broad debate to take place in each of our countries".</p> <p pid="b.1444.0/13">Does the noble Baroness agree that a referendum might provide that broad debate? Only six weeks ago, the Labour Manifesto said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.1444.0/14">"It is a good treaty for Britain and for the new Europe. We will put it to the British people in a referendum and campaign wholeheartedly for a 'Yes' vote to keep Britain a leading nation in Europe".</p> <p pid="b.1444.0/15">But how quickly our words come back to haunt us.</p> <p pid="b.1444.0/16">How absurd it seems now for the Prime Minister to have written so recently that Britain could be a leading nation in Europe only by ratifying this drowning treaty.</p> <p pid="b.1444.0/17">The presidency conclusions end with a classic European statement:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.1444.0/18">"The recent developments&#8212; that means an inconvenient expression of popular will&#8212;</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.1444.0/20">"do not call into question the validity of continuing with the ratification processes".</p> <p pid="b.1444.0/21">It is glaringly obvious that they do call those processes into question, and, if there are those who do not recognise that, they will end tragically by inflicting even more damage on the European Union than has already been inflicted.</p> <p pid="b.1444.0/22">If the Prime Minister at this late hour seeks to impose that restraining and realistic hand he can count on our support. But how sad it is that the man&#8212;the Prime Minister&#8212;who rightly tells us that Europe needs a new direction was the same man who gave away our opt-out from the social chapter that is destroying European competitiveness, and did so for nothing in return. And how sad it is that the man who belatedly and rightly takes up the cudgel for reform of the absurd and indefensible <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP">CAP</a> was the same man&#8212;the Prime Minister&#8212;who agreed to that being set in concrete for a decade as recently as 2002? If the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a> are so much against it now, why were they so enthusiastic then?</p> <p pid="b.1444.0/23">Is not the truth that it was not until <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Mandelson">Peter Mandelson</a> rang up and told him that it might be a good piece of spin that the Prime Minister thought of linking the UK rebate to reform of the CAP? Why was our position so ill prepared? How was the president of France, President Chirac, able to get away with the political daylight robbery of pushing aside democratic votes condemning a flawed treaty and putting Britain in the dock? How was it that we ended up having our natural friends and allies in eastern Europe ranged against us? Was that not a spectacular own goal, after Mr Mandelson floated the fact that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> were planning to help them?</p> <p pid="b.1444.0/24">For our part, we support the Prime Minister in insisting that the British rebate can be considered only when the just cause and reason for it&#8212;the distortions of the CAP&#8212;are addressed and dealt with. Given where we now are, this should be an opportunity, but the Prime Minister begins his presidency dug in, condemned by the current presidency as,</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.1444.0/25">"seeking the failure of Europe".</p> <p pid="b.1444.0/26">We deplore such language. We deplore the claim of <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> Schr&#246;der that history will judge harshly the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. What we on this side would judge harshly is not the faltering, late-coming sense of the Prime Minister, but the ostrich-like view of other European leaders that nothing has changed, nothing needs to be changed, and nothing can be changed.</p> <p pid="b.1444.0/27">But, as we know, the world has changed. Europe has changed and the EU needs to change, and tomorrow, my noble friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Howell_of_Guildford">Lord Howell of Guildford</a> will set out in detail how Britain must lead the way to a better European future and recover from the mistakes and self-deception that have so far marked the Prime Minister's approach to Europe.</p> <p pid="b.1444.0/28"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> is in an unrivalled position to set out that future, but it cannot be on the basis of a defunct treaty that only six weeks ago he was telling the country was in Britain and Europe's united interest.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.1447.0/1">My Lords, it is probably only human nature, but we expected a little dancing on the grave from the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde. In my view, he had his tap-dancing shoes on, but I see that a number of clog-dancers are in their places, so we shall probably hear from them later.</p> <p pid="b.1447.0/2">This is certainly an opportunity for creative thinking. We should start by answering the question, "Do you think that a Europe of 25 or 27 needs a rule book or framework in which to operate?" If you think that it does&#8212;and it seems pretty obvious that that is the case&#8212;we may perhaps hear tomorrow from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> how they think that that framework should be created. Of course, Europe also needs a budget agreement, though not today or tomorrow; we do not need to rush for deadlines. In fact, Europe might be all the better for a more considered approach.</p> <p pid="b.1447.0/3">Of course, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, and the whole country, that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has total support in drawing attention to the anomalies that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP">CAP</a> has produced and will continue to produce in the budget. It is right that he takes that argument firmly and clearly to Europe. Indeed, I hope that he will take the argument for reform not only in this country but to a wider European audience, where if it is properly presented&#8212;as the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> did in his press conference, comparing it into the investments into R&amp;D, education and so on&#8212;the case for reform becomes almost unanswerable. Since his presidency coincides with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8">G8</a> presidency, he can also take the case to the United States and Japan, which are also agricultural protectionists that distort world trade.</p> <p pid="b.1447.0/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> can rely on support when he says that it is those of us who believe in Europe who now must be most ardent advocates of changing it. But we must put that in the right context; Britain has an almost 100 per cent unblemished record, over 60 years, of underestimating and misjudging the attitude of our fellow Europeans in the kind of Europe that they want to build. Whatever the French and Dutch people may or may not have voted for, they certainly did not vote for an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFTA">EFTA</a> mark 2, which seems to be on offer from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party">Conservative Party</a>. It has been the constant delusion of certain elements of British politics that somehow we can persuade our European colleagues that a European free trade confederation is all that is needed.</p> <p pid="b.1447.0/5">Perhaps for the first time, I agree with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> on Europe. He said very wisely that,</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.1447.0/6">"our position as a leading power in Europe makes the UK stronger and more influential in the world".&#8212;[<a href="/search/?pop=1&s=date:20050615+column:286+section:lords"><i>Hansard</i>, Commons, 15/6/05; col. 286</a>.]</p> <p pid="b.1447.0/7">That is the heart of the matter&#8212;and that is what the Prime Minister should be about in moving forward and making the most of this unique opportunity. Trade issues are certainly important, but apart from trade there is hardly a major issue facing us as a country&#8212;from globalisation to the environment to the war on world poverty and the debate that we have intervened in today&#8212;in which our role in Europe is not part of the answer.</p> <p pid="b.1447.0/8">We wish the Prime Minister well in starting this presidency. We hope that he will give the kick start that the Lisbon process certainly needs, that he will start leading by example, by improving parliamentary scrutiny here in Britain, and that he will bring forward such elements that are in our power to make Europe more transparent and accountable. But for the rest, I believe that my <a href="/glossary/?gl=172" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to another MP of..." class="glossary">right honourable friend</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Kennedy">Charles Kennedy</a> had it right in <a href="/glossary/?gl=112" title="During a debate members of the House of Commons traditionally refer to the..." class="glossary">another place</a>, when he said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="b.1447.0/9">"As Britain takes on the presidency, the responsibility is ours to try and build a new consensus and to build a new sense of optimism about Europe".</p> <p pid="b.1447.0/10">If the Prime Minister does that, he will certainly have the support of these Benches.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.1448.0/1">My Lords, perhaps I can begin, as did the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, who said that he was not going to talk about Zimbabwe and then proceeded to do so, to remind the noble Lord that at the last <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Affairs_Council">General Affairs Council</a> it was agreed to increase the numbers of those from Zimbabwe on the travel ban list.</p> <p pid="b.1448.0/2">In relation to the specific two issues that were covered by the Statement, the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, in talking about those Council discussions as being irrelevant to the future of Europe, got it completely wrong. There is nothing more important than having a Europe which is fit for purpose. In looking at those budget discussions, and in particular at the UK position in relation to those future financing discussions, we are looking ahead to the nature of the kind of world that we&#8212;as a European Union&#8212;will need to intercede in and have influence in. The discussions that were held last weekend, and the continuing discussions on those issues, will be very important for the future of Europe.</p> <p pid="b.1448.0/3">The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, asked me whether it was our view that the EU constitution was dead. The treaty was agreed by 25 nation states; it is not for any one nation to declare it dead. Yes, it is in serious difficulties&#8212;there is absolutely no doubt about that. I believe that we would all agree that the people of Holland and France voted "No" for a range of reasons. I watched with great interest the interviews with individuals after those "No" votes, and the issues that they talked about ranged from concerns about the domestic economy, immigration, asylum, and the possibility of EU enlargement. Few people actually mentioned the treaty itself.</p> <p pid="b.1448.0/4">With respect to a referendum here in the United Kingdom, the ratification process is not abandoned, but we see no point in proceeding with an EU Bill at present. That was made absolutely clear in the Statement made by my <a href="/glossary/?gl=172" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to another MP of..." class="glossary">right honourable friend</a> the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>. We need a period of time to reflect&#8212;and that was made clear in the Statement that I have just repeated. But I can confirm that the constitutional treaty will be ratified in the United Kingdom only after a referendum&#8212;but we do of course need a constitution on which to vote.</p> <p pid="b.1448.0/5">I must say that I was not surprised at the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Chapter">Social Chapter</a>. However, they are not comments that I would make to the millions of workers who have benefited from the signing of the Social Chapter. As a Government, we believe in the opening up of markets and in greater flexibility, but we also believe in a degree of social protection. That is our position, and will remain our position.</p> <p pid="b.1448.0/6">We have begun the process of addressing the distortions in the common agricultural policy. The noble Lord may remember that my <a href="/glossary/?gl=214" title="Right Honourable is a form of address used within the House of Commons, for..." class="glossary">right honourable</a> friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Beckett">Margaret Beckett</a> was involved most recently, in 2003, in the reform of the common agricultural policy. The biggest part of that reform was to break the link between subsidies and protection. We are well aware of the need for further reform, because we want to see a European Union budget that helps those in the poorest countries and also better reflects the different ways in which individuals contribute to the European Union economy. Our approach is to push for a reform agenda from a pro-European standpoint, which we think will have much greater influence with our European Union partners.</p> <p pid="b.1448.0/7">I agree with the noble Lord, Lord McNally, that this is an opportunity; and that is precisely the view being expressed by my right honourable friends the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the Foreign Secretary. We want to see an opening-up of markets, but we also want to see transitional mechanisms that will help the poorest countries. That is part of our wider <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8">G8</a> agenda. It is thought that opening up those markets, giving greater access and reducing subsidies would lift some 300 million people out of poverty.</p> <p pid="b.1448.0/8">I am also delighted that the noble Lord, Lord McNally, has found common cause on Europe for the first time with my right <a href="/glossary/?gl=173" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to an MP of the..." class="glossary">honourable friend</a> the Foreign Secretary. However, I hope that the noble Lord will not mind if I do not draw that to the attention of the Foreign Secretary, just in case he does not see it as a career-enhancing move. I have addressed all the questions that have been raised.</p>            </div>

Indeed, I was one of four people, including the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, whose opinion was asked for in the last few minutes of an extremely long negotiation before we finally achieved that rebate.</p> <p pid="b.1449.0/2">First, does the noble Baroness agree that we must continue to stress that this rebate is an intrinsic part of the system with no time limit and that it was freely agreed by the member states? That is the situation. It is not a gift that was donated to be taken away; it is part of the system.</p> <p pid="b.1449.0/3">Secondly, we should stress, as the noble Baroness did, that it is a self-correcting mechanism, because it is based on the difference between our contribution and our revenue from EU funds. Any favourable change in the balance automatically decreases the rebate, which is not so much required. That system is built-in. It would be a great advantage to our position in presenting our case in Europe if we keep emphasising those points.</p>            </div>

Why have the Government taken so long to understand what has been glaringly plain to most of us? I receive a large wadge of money from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP">CAP</a>; I love it, but I still see that it is wrong. It has been obvious that the CAP has been useless for a long time. The annual accounts of the European Union have still not been settled, and then there is the fisheries policy. Why did the Government not foresee this row before it appeared to be forced on them? All the other issues have to be sorted out to make Europe function in a proper and sensible way.</p>            </div>

If he goes back and thinks about the timing, he will find that the treaty contains a political declaration that envisages discussion at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council">European Council</a> if, for example, 20 countries have ratified it by October 2006 and one or more states are having problems. We cannot make assumptions about all the different areas of work in June 2005, when the most recent decision is that there needs to be a period of reflection. He will know that Luxembourg has gone away to think about whether it will continue with its referendum. Two other countries have indicated that they will not continue, pending further discussion in the Union as a whole. There is an ongoing process at the moment, and we have not come to its end.</p>            </div>

In fact, our model is not closest to the United States, it is much closer to that of the Finns and the Irish, who are among the successes of the euro-zone, and the Danes and the Swedes who are among the successes to be found outside the euro-zone. It would be a great pity that trumpeting our triumphs might suggest that we think that we are on our own.
