These reports add to our concern about the human rights situation in Xinjiang and of course we will be considering the report carefully.</p> <p pid="c37.2/2">The broader human rights situation in Xinjiang is of ongoing and serious concern to the Government. This includes the extrajudicial detention of over a million Uyghur Muslims and other minorities in political re-education camps, systematic restrictions on Uyghur culture and the practice of Islam, and extensive and invasive surveillance targeting minorities. Further reports indicating that forced labour is being used and that children are being forcibly separated from their parents add to the growing body of evidence about the disturbing situation that Uyghurs and other minorities are facing in Xinjiang.</p> <p pid="c37.2/3">We have expressed our serious concerns about these issues on many occasions. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> raised them directly with his Chinese counterpart, Foreign <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and State Councillor Wang Yi in March. I also raised the situation in Xinjiang with the Chinese ambassador to London in March. Since 2018, we have played a leading role in raising these concerns at the UN. For example, at the UN Third Committee in October, the UK read out a statement on behalf of 22 other countries drawing attention to the human rights violations and abuses in Xinjiang and calling on China to uphold its obligations to respect human rights. We have consistently raised the issue at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Human_Rights_Council">UN Human Rights Council</a>, including at the most recent session in March, when <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Ahmad">Lord Ahmad</a>, the Minister for human rights, raised the issue in the UK&#8217;s opening address. In addition, we advise all businesses involved in investing in Xinjiang or with parts of their supply chains in Xinjiang to consider conducting appropriate due diligence to satisfy themselves that their activities do not support, or risk being seen to support, any human rights violations or abuses. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> will continue to exercise leadership on this important issue, raising it directly with the Chinese Government and working with partners to do so at the UN.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c37.3/1">The Inter-parliamentary Alliance on China&#8212;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPAC">IPAC</a>&#8212;which is made up of 30 other lawmakers from 16 global legislatures, has today published research by Professor Adrian Zenz, the world&#8217;s leading expert on the treatment of minorities in Xinjiang province. The report shows that birth rates in the two mostly Uyghur regions plummeted by more than 60% from 2015 to 2018. Across the Xinjiang region, birth rates fell nearly 24% in a single year, compared with just 4.2% nationwide. Worse, it is now clear that this is a direct result of Government actions. Unearthed Government documents mandate that birth control violations that come about</p> <p class="indent" pid="c37.3/2" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;due to the influence of extreme religious thinking&#8221; should be &#8220;dealt with severely&#8221;, and that those unable to pay fines should be</p> <p class="indent" pid="c37.3/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;dealt with through coercive measures&#8221;,</p> <p pid="c37.3/5">including internment. Mr Zenz&#8217;s paper concludes that these measures are part of a state-wide crackdown that includes the mass sterilisation of women. This report corroborates the many horrific personal testimonies that many of us have heard. The genocide convention maintains that birth prevention targeted at minority groups is indicative of genocide, and the convention binds individual states to act, not just to rely on the international judicial system. Does my hon. Friend therefore agree that the Uyghur people have been, and are, the victims of mass atrocity crimes?</p> <p pid="c37.3/6">I ask the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> to go to the UN and call for an independent inquiry, but, sadly, I also recognise that the ways to deal with this through the UN will almost certainly be blocked by China. Given that likelihood, will my hon. Friend at least get the UK to make its own legal determination after weighing up this new evidence? Of course the world wants to deal with China, but we cannot continue with business as usual while this sort of blatant activity continues. Furthermore, given the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>&#8217;s appalling record on human rights, their attack on freedoms in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, their bullying behaviour in border disputes from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China">South China</a> seas to India, their blatant breaching of the rules-based order governing the free market and their delayed declaration on covid-19, will the Government now initiate an internal review of the UK&#8217;s dependence on China, with a view to significantly reducing that dependence, and call on the free world to come together to ensure that this growing threat from China is dealt with together before, as history teaches us, it is too late?</p>            </div>

This is not a new problem&#8212;it has been going on for a number of years&#8212;and the UK is becoming increasingly involved in strategic developments with, in effect, emanations of the Chinese state. Huawei is one example, but there are others.

It has to be part of the solution to many major global problems, whether that is global health, as we have seen in the past few months, or climate change. It has always been the case that where we have concerns, we raise them, and where the United Kingdom needs to intervene, we will.</p>            </div>

I can confirm that, as I have said previously, we want to secure growth and investment for the UK, but upholding human rights and our values is not a zero-sum choice.

By having a strong relationship with China, we are able to have open discussions on a range of very difficult issues, including human rights.</p>            </div>
