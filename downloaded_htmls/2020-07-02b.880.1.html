This is a grave and deeply disturbing step.</p><p pid="b873.1/3">We have carefully assessed the legislation. In particular, we have considered its impact on the rights, freedoms and, critically, the high degree of autonomy bestowed on Hong Kong under China&#8217;s Basic Law for Hong Kong and under the joint declaration, which, as the House will know, is the treaty agreed between China and the UK in 1984.</p><p pid="b873.1/4">Today I have the depressing but necessary duty to report to the House that the enactment of this legislation, imposed by the authorities in Beijing on the people of Hong Kong, constitutes a clear and serious breach of the joint declaration. Let me explain to the House the grounds for this sobering conclusion.</p><p pid="b873.1/5">First, the legislation violates the high degree of autonomy over executive and legislative powers and the independent judicial authority provided for in paragraph 3 of the joint declaration. The imposition of this legislation by the Government in Beijing, rather than it being left to Hong Kong&#8217;s own institutions to adopt it, is also, it should be noted, in direct conflict with article 34 of China&#8217;s own Basic Law for Hong Kong, which affirms that Hong Kong should bring forward its own national security legislation. In fact, the Basic Law elaborates on that, and allows Beijing to impose laws directly only in a very limited number of cases, such as for the purposes of defence and foreign affairs, or in the exceptional event of the National People&#8217;s Congress declaring a state of war or a state of emergency. None of those exceptions applies here, nor has the National People&#8217;s Congress sought to justify the law on any such ground.</p><p pid="b873.1/6">Secondly, the national security legislation contains a slew of measures that directly threaten the freedoms and rights protected by the joint declaration. The House will be particularly concerned by the potentially wide-ranging ability of the mainland authorities  to take jurisdiction over certain cases without any independent oversight, and to try those cases in the Chinese courts. That measure violates paragraphs 3(3)  and 3(5) of the joint declaration, and directly threatens the rights set out in the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which, under the joint declaration, are to be protected in Hong Kong. That in particular represents a flagrant assault on freedom of speech and the right to peaceful protest for the people of Hong Kong.</p><p pid="b873.1/7">Thirdly, the legislation provides that Hong Kong&#8217;s Chief Executive, rather than its Chief Justice, will appoint judges to hear national security cases&#8212;a move that clearly risks undermining the independence of Hong Kong&#8217;s judiciary, which is, again, protected by the joint declaration in paragraph 3(3).</p><p pid="b873.1/8">Fourthly, the legislation provides for the establishment in Hong Kong by the Chinese Government of a new office for safeguarding national security, run by and reporting to the mainland authorities. That is particularly worrying, because that office is given wide-ranging powers, directly intruding on the responsibility of the Hong Kong authorities to maintain public order. Again, that is directly in breach of the joint declaration&#8212;this time, paragraph 3(11). The authorities in Hong Kong have already started to enforce the legislation; there are reports of arrests by the police, and official notices warning the people of Hong Kong against waving flags or chanting.</p><p pid="b873.1/9">In sum, this legislation has been enacted in clear and serious breach of the joint declaration. China has broken its promise to the people of Hong Kong under its own laws, and has breached its international obligations to the United Kingdom under the joint declaration. Having committed to applying the UN&#8217;s International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to the people of Hong Kong, China has now written into law wide-ranging exemptions that cannot credibly be reconciled with its international obligations, or its responsibilities as a leading member of the international community.</p><p pid="b873.1/10">We want a positive relationship with China. We recognise its growth, its stature, and the powerful role it can play in the world. It is precisely because we respect China as a leading member of the international community that we expect the Chinese Government to meet their international obligations and live up to their international responsibilities. They have failed to do so with respect to Hong Kong by enacting legislation that violates its autonomy and threatens the strangulation of its freedoms. It is a sad day for the people of Hong Kong&#8212;one that can only undermine international trust in the Chinese Government&#8217;s willingness to keep their word and live up to their promises.</p><p pid="b873.1/11">For our part, the Prime Minister and the Government are crystal clear: the United Kingdom will keep its word and live up to our responsibilities to the people of Hong Kong. After further detailed discussions with my right honourable friend the Home Secretary, I can now confirm that we will proceed to honour our commitment to change the arrangements for those holding British national (overseas) status. We have also worked with Ministers across Whitehall and have now developed proposals for a bespoke immigration route for BNOs and their dependants. We will grant BNOs five years&#8217; limited leave to remain, with a right to work or study. After these five years, they will be able to apply for settled status, and after a further  12 months with settled status, they will be able to apply for citizenship. This is a special, bespoke set of arrangements developed for the unique circumstances we face and in the light of our historic commitment to the people of Hong Kong.</p><p pid="b873.1/12">All those with BNO status will be eligible, as will their family dependants who are usually resident in Hong Kong, and the Home Office will put in place a simple, streamlined application process. I can reassure honourable Members that there will be no quotas on numbers. I pay tribute to the Home Secretary and her excellent team at the Home Office for their work in helping to prepare for a moment that, let us face it, we all dearly hoped would not arrive. She will set out further details of our approach in due course.</p><p pid="b873.1/13">In addition to changing the arrangements for BNOs, the UK will continue to work with our international partners to consider what further action we should responsibly take next. I can tell the House that yesterday in the UN Human Rights Council, the UK made a formal joint statement expressing our deep concern about the human rights situation in both Hong Kong and Xinjiang. Twenty-six other nations joined that statement. It is the first time a formal statement has been made at the Human Rights Council on this issue, and it was delivered through our diplomatic leadership. We will continue to work with our partners in the G7 and the EU and across the region.</p><p pid="b873.1/14">I say again: we want a positive relationship with China, but we will not look the other way when it comes to Hong Kong and we will not duck our historic responsibilities to its people. We will continue to bring together our international partners, to stand up for the people of Hong Kong, to call out the violations of their freedoms, and to hold China to its international obligations, freely assumed under international law. I commend this Statement to the House.&#8221;</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b875.0/1">My Lords, we support the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>&#8217;s view that a constructive relationship with China remains essential. From climate change to post-pandemic economic recovery, not a single global challenge can be tackled without such engagement.</p> <p pid="b875.0/2">However, we also need a hard-headed realism and to use targeted measures, in close partnership with our allies, to deter further aggression. If China is able to act with impunity in Hong Kong or the South China Sea, Taiwan could be next. The commitments made by Beijing in the joint declaration in 1984 have been ripped apart by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>, and the international community must now step up to hold them to account.</p> <p pid="b875.0/3">I welcome the Statement. The Government have taken a step forward with the announcement of new rights for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> passport holders and a statement at the United Nations, but this is no substitute for ongoing and sustained international leadership.</p> <p pid="b875.0/4">The Government must ensure that the offer to BNO passport holders does not discriminate and is not limited to the wealthiest residents. Will salary thresholds apply as part of the scheme for BNO passport holders? Has the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCO">FCO</a> made any formal assessment of the numbers involved?</p> <p pid="b875.0/5">The oppressive crackdown on Hong Kong protesters expressing their human rights and freedoms requires an immediate response. Unfortunately, with the Magnitsky legislation still waiting in the wings, the Government are unable to target individuals most culpable for the situation we are witnessing. I ask the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> again: do we have a date before Recess when the regulations will be laid? Will any of the initial designations relate to the situation in Hong Kong?</p> <p pid="b875.0/6"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> must work with our allies at the UN and elsewhere to pressure China and the Hong Kong Administration to end their encroachment on Hong Kong&#8217;s freedoms. The Foreign Secretary told the Commons yesterday that he is</p> <p class="indent" pid="b875.0/7">&#8220;open to the idea of a UN &#8230; envoy&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id=", Commons, 1/7/20; col. 345]"><i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 1/7/20; col. 345]</phrase> on Hong Kong. We have enormous influence at the UN and a historical allegiance to the people of Hong Kong. We cannot simply wait for another member state to step up to the plate, so can the Minister confirm whether the Foreign Secretary has given any further consideration to spearheading a campaign for a UN envoy?</p> <p pid="b875.0/9">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a> must also stand together as an unequivocal voice for democracy and universal suffrage. Australia and others in the group have made their voices heard but some members have remained almost silent. Can the Minister confirm whether there are any plans for further joint action by the G7 following the statement published in June?</p> <p pid="b875.0/10">The application of the national security law was expected. The brutal response to objecting protesters was, sadly, predictable too. The situation may escalate, and it is crucial that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a> is fully equipped to respond. To this end, what assessment has the Minister made of the suggestion by seven former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretaries">Foreign Secretaries</a> for the UK to lead the formation of an international contact group to monitor the situation on the ground and co-ordinate action?</p> <p pid="b875.0/11">Finally, in recognition of the large number of UK citizens in Hong Kong, I hope that the Minister will offer a few reassurances about their safety; for example, will the FCO update its travel advice following the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Government">Canadian Government</a>&#8217;s new warning? What channels of communication in the pandemic situation&#8212;we  have raised this before&#8212;will the FCO utilise with UK citizens in Hong Kong and should that advice be updated? Are the Government in communication with any UK journalists on the ground in relation to their safety, considering the use of force against members of the press that we have seen. For too long we have no strategy in relation to China at home or abroad. I hope the Minister will give us a commitment today that this marks the start of a very different era.</p>            </div>

Hong Kong is in a terrible situation. The Government are right that the new security law constitutes a clear and serious breach of the joint declaration. We have obligations to assist, as a cosignatory to the joint declaration&#8212;a treaty lodged at the UN. Already, there have been arrests in Hong Kong, and we see peaceful activists withdrawing from political comment, in fear.</p> <p pid="b876.0/2">In 1997, Hong Kong represented about one-third of China&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP">GDP</a>. Now that is only 3%. We may see a thriving territory&#8212;the gateway to China&#8212;but China&#8217;s rise, and therefore the relative decline in Hong Kong&#8217;s significance, shows loss of leverage. I therefore commend the Government for their actions, given China&#8217;s economic and political dominance. But that makes it even more essential that international law is respected.</p> <p pid="b876.0/3">I welcome the proposals to grant BNOs and their dependants the right to live here, and to work or study, with a path to citizenship. However, this still leaves behind many young people who have been at the heart of protests and are therefore particularly at risk. Will the Government extend their offer to all <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kongers">Hong Kongers</a>? What steps will the Government take to ensure that BNOs can leave Hong Kong to take up the Government&#8217;s offer if they feel the need to do so? Will the UK provide them consular protection? What liaison has there been with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Lam">Carrie Lam</a>&#8217;s office to ensure that those arrested will be immediately released, given that she emphasises that the new law does not crack down on freedom of expression? What steps are the Government taking to ensure that Hong Kongers in the UK or British citizens and British-based businesses will not be targeted? What is happening in relation to the proposed UN special envoy for Hong Kong to monitor human rights there? Are we looking at the Magnitsky sanctions in relation to human rights abuses there?</p> <p pid="b876.0/4">Does the Minister know if British judges on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Court_of_Final_Appeal">Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal</a> feel that they can continue, and what might be the future for Taiwan? I am very glad to hear in the Statement of the report of the UN Council on Human Rights about the situation both in Hong Kong and Zhenjiang. Reports of the treatment of the Uighurs are horrifying. Can he say whether full consideration has yet been given to the China tribunal&#8217;s conclusions about forced organ harvesting? I note that the countries which supported us in that statement to the Human Rights Council are largely European, but notably not all EU countries, together with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia,_New_Zealand">Australia, New Zealand</a> and Canada. There are no Asian, African or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_American">Latin American</a> countries, unless you count Belize in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America">Central America</a> and one Micronesian island. There is no widespread support from the Commonwealth, which clearly is not going to replace the EU as a supportive bloc for us and the rules-based order. Does he worry about those omissions, bearing in mind the heavy Chinese engagement in many regions of the world?</p> <p pid="b876.0/5">This is a dangerous time for Hong Kong and I am very glad that we are offering the refuge that we are, although that loss to the territory further damages Hong Kong itself. But wider than that, China&#8217;s actions are immensely worrying for future global relations and the rules-based order. There are indeed so many issues that must be faced together, including, of course, climate change.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b877.0/1">My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Collins, and the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, for their support for my <a href="/glossary/?gl=172" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to another MP of..." class="glossary">right honourable friend</a> the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>&#8217;s Statement.

As both the noble Lord and the noble Baroness acknowledged, this is a breach, and my right <a href="/glossary/?gl=173" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to an MP of the..." class="glossary">honourable friend</a> the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the Foreign Secretary have both been clear, during Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8217;s Questions and the Statement yesterday in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>, that this does represent a breach of the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; agreement, which has been signed. As the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, reminded us, it has status because it has been deposited within the context and the confines of the United Nations. Moreover, it is also a breach of China&#8217;s own <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law">Basic Law</a> for Hong Kong, as it contravenes the scope of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_23">Article 23</a>.</p> <p pid="b877.0/2">I turn now to some of the specific questions, points and observations made by the noble Lord and the noble Baroness. I say first to the noble Lord, Lord Collins &#8212;I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, agrees with this, as do we all&#8212;that China has an important role to play in our current international system and in the context of the United Nations. Further, as I have acknowledged from this <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a>, it is also playing an important role in meeting the challenge of the Covid-19 pandemic. It has assisted many countries in procuring, for example, ventilators and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPE">PPE</a> equipment. We acknowledge that, and I know that that view is shared by the noble Lord and the noble Baroness.</p> <p pid="b877.0/3">The noble Lord, Lord Collins, alluded to the importance of addressing climate change. China will be hosting an important conference next year, as will we at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COP_26">COP 26</a>. It is important that we work together, because while the focus of the world has rightly been on the Covid-19 pandemic, one should not forget for a moment the challenges posed by climate change. Addressing these issues without China&#8217;s direct engagement will not result in the success from a global perspective that we all seek. However, I repeat what I have said previously: we are clear-eyed in our Statement, and regarding our relationship with China. China is a key partner for us in many areas. However, as this issue, on which we disagree very strongly, has illustrated, we carry a special responsibility when it comes to Hong Kong, as yesterday&#8217;s announcement again confirmed.</p> <p pid="b877.0/4">The noble Lord, Lord Collins, asked who will be eligible under the announcement that has been made. As I mentioned in your Lordships&#8217; House a few days ago, we estimate that some 2.9 million people will be eligible. That includes those who currently have <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> status, those who would qualify for BNO status if they applied for it and, of course, their dependants. That will be applied universally.</p> <p pid="b877.0/5">The noble Baroness, Lady Northover, asked about other young people. Looking at the media reports and current reporting, it was deeply concerning that only yesterday, as soon as the law came into effect, a number of individuals were detained under its provisions. We have already relayed these concerns: yesterday the Chinese ambassador to the UK was summoned to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Office">Foreign Office</a> and met the PUS, and we asked specifically about China&#8217;s intent in terms of the implementation of the new law, particularly under certain key sections. We will continue to keep that very closely monitored  and under review. Of course, if people seek to apply for asylum in the United Kingdom, their applications will continue to be looked at on their merits.</p> <p pid="b877.0/6">I speak as a Minister but also in a role which both noble Lords know that I take very seriously&#8212;that of a human rights Minister. In our country&#8217;s history we have long been supportive of those who have spoken out against oppression around the world. That should be the case today&#8212;and I am proud to say that it is&#8212;and it should be the case in the future as well.</p> <p pid="b877.0/7">The noble Lord, Lord Collins, and the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, both touched on the important issue of the Magnitsky global human rights regime and sanctions regime. I wish I could provide a specific answer to the noble Lord, Lord Collins, but I reassure him once again that we are looking to introduce the new regime very shortly. There are procedures and timings to go through but, as I have said to the House, it will certainly be before the Summer Recess and, as a sanctions Minister, I have been closely involved in progress in this respect. I pay tribute to my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary, who I know has taken a very personal interest in this particular issue and is seeking to bring it forward at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p pid="b877.0/8">The noble Baroness and the noble Lord asked about work within the UN. As a human rights Minister, I was directly involved in working with the 27 countries, including the United Kingdom, which signed and supported the statement that our ambassador delivered at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Human_Rights_Council">UN Human Rights Council</a>. It covered&#8212;as the noble Baroness rightly acknowledged&#8212;not only the situation in Hong Kong but the appalling situation suffered in particular by the Uighurs in Xinjiang. We will continue to raise that issue with partners.</p> <p pid="b877.0/9">The noble Baroness asked about key partners. I have just come from a virtual meeting of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a>, which looked specifically at the importance of peace and securing peace in the context of the Covid crisis. The meeting was chaired by our German partners, and I was pleased to attend on behalf of the United Kingdom. We continue to work with our European partners, as well as others, in support of human rights, the rule of law, standing up for obligations and media freedom&#8212;again, a point mentioned by noble Lords.</p> <p pid="b877.0/10">The noble Baroness rightly mentioned her concerns about working through the context of the Commonwealth and other alliances. We continue to do so and need to do more; I fully acknowledge that. We need to make a very strong case on the premise of human rights and continue to make the case for upholding and strengthening the international rules-based system.</p> <p pid="b877.0/11">Coming back to my original point about the relationship with China today, China has, and is playing, an important role on the world stage. It also has international obligations on the world stage. We will continue to remind China of those obligations and to work together where our interests are aligned positively, in areas such as Covid-19 and climate change. However, this will not prevent us raising our deep concerns about the human rights situation in mainland China and, of course, the recent announcement made by the Chinese authorities on the new law for Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="b877.0/12">We therefore again appeal to the Chinese authorities to reconsider their approach, but in the interim we have now embarked on a particular route, and my right honourable friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a> will be coming forward with further details of the announcements and operation of the new scheme. I am sure both noble Lords have seen the details of what we have announced thus far, and that will ultimately lead to a pathway to citizenship.</p> <p pid="b877.0/13">The noble Baroness, Lady Northover, also asked about British judges. That is an important point because, under this law, the appointment of those judges has switched. It has gone from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice">Chief Justice</a> to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive">Chief Executive</a>. We believe that that upholds neither the principles of China&#8217;s basic Hong Kong law nor the spirit and details of the agreements that we have signed, including the joint declaration. That is therefore a worrying development; we will look at it closely because other announcements have been made as part of it, including on setting up local committees to look at the enforcement of the law. Again, we believe that that goes directly against both elements of the joint agreement and China&#8217;s basic law for Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="b877.0/14">I assure the noble Baroness and the noble Lord that we will continue to work actively on the world stage. They asked about the UN rapporteur. In that regard, let me assure them that my right honourable friend has very much led from the front on this issue. I pay tribute to his efforts, particularly at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a>. As I said, we have worked closely on securing support with 26 other countries that, like us, are on the Human Rights Council. As my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary said, if we need to explore further diplomatic routes, we will continue to do so.</p>            </div>

Within that, special provisions were granted that would allow them to visit the UK without visa access, but the joint declaration has been breached. We have always retained that we have an obligation to those with BNO status and those who are eligible for that status. We are now carrying out measures and have made announcements to that effect to support them. For those who wish to come to the UK, there is a pathway to citizenship. They must go through due process, meaning that, after their arrival, they will be given leave to remain. Importantly, they will have the right to remain and work in the United Kingdom. After the five-year period, they will be allowed to embark on a route to citizenship. That is the right thing to do; it is within our obligations to the people of Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="b881.0/3">As to what the Chinese reaction will be to that, we implore them to recognise that Hong Kong has a special status. It has served the Chinese and the global community well. We should seek to retain the freedoms and liberties that it has enjoyed since the signing of that agreement.</p>            </div>

There have been two deeply disturbing and related developments in Hong Kong in the past few days. One has been the police brutality against pro-democracy protesters. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Kingdom">The United Kingdom</a> must lead an international inquiry into that police brutality, as the pepper spray and the arrests have a chilling effect on democracy. The second adverse development is the adoption of the so-called national security legislation under which the arrests were made. This is a breach of the joint declaration. It is an assault on peaceful protest and human rights. There is to be a sinister national security office, run from the mainland; the independence of the judiciary is undermined; and the chief executive is not the chief justice but will select the judges for the cases alleged to concern national security. This is deeply worrying.</p>            </div>

The noble Lord, Lord Collins, talked about a strategy.

There is no doubt that events have seriously damaged the current economy of Hong Kong and its future prospects. China is building up and strengthening other financial centres to outshine Hong Kong and, although the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRC">PRC</a> had hoped that making the Hong Kong system a success would attract Taiwan, it now does not seem to care about that. China needs to be confronted by a united and cohesive group of nations if there is to be any hope of persuading her to be a respectable member of the world community and possibly even to listen on matters concerning civil rights.</p> <p pid="b884.2/2">China&#8217;s recent behaviour on the international stage is a cause for concern; indeed, Australia is so concerned that it has just increased defence spending dramatically.

On the noble Lord&#8217;s wider issues, we recognise, as I said at the start, that China has an important role to play on the world stage.
