It was put in for at short notice; we wanted to do it as quickly as we could, so we thank the Committee for agreeing to it. It is important that we have the opportunity to discuss the last 10 years under China&#8217;s leader, Xi Jinping, and how his time in office has seen a drastic rise in nefarious activities inside and outside China, many of which have been used to attack human rights, freedom of speech and media, and freedom of religion and belief. I declare an interest as chair of the all-party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief. That topic is very close to my heart. It is one of the reasons why I am here and it is ultimately and initially the reason why I asked for this debate.</p> <p pid="a375.2/4">We speak up for those with a Christian faith across the world, for those with other faiths and, indeed, for those with no faith, so I am pleased to see right hon. and hon. Members here today, to see the <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> spokespersons and to see the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> <a href="/glossary/?gl=145" title="Of a male MP, sitting on his regular seat in the House.

When it comes to speaking up for freedom of religion and belief in China, we could write a book on the number of occasions when China has disregarded it, has discriminated, has persecuted and has used actions that are illegal in any democratic society against those of Christian faith and, indeed, other faith. I am speaking here of the genocide of Uyghurs in Xinjiang., which <a href="/mp/?p=10180" title="Our page on Iain Duncan Smith - 'the right hon.

The forced sterilisation of women, the abuse of women, the imprisonment of millions of Uyghurs in camps and the taking away of their religious liberty and their right to express themselves concern us greatly, so the hon.

The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> have obviously stepped in and offered some passage for many <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kongers">Hong Kongers</a> to come here to live. That is good news, but would it not be better if they were able to stay in their own country and exercise the freedom they once had?</p> <p pid="a376.3/2">We also have the continuing repression in Tibet. It was a salient reminder, when I did my research before this debate, when I found out that the suppression in Tibet has been going on since 1950. That is five years before I was born, so Tibetans&#8217; freedoms have been denied and restricted for a long, long time. I understand that the inauguration of a new Dalai Lama will be at the behest of the Chinese Communist party. A religious  group cannot appoint its own leader in Tibet, but only because the Chinese Communist party will not let them. Again, that is another example of what is going on inside China, and of China&#8217;s influence and control.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a377.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The information I have suggested that the Chinese Communist party was going to try to use its influence to ensure that any choice would be the choice of the Chinese Communist party, but if, as the hon. Gentleman said, there is some control over that, that would be one of the good things that could come out of this.</p> <p pid="a377.1/2">The issue of forced organ transplantation from members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong">Falun Gong</a> has been in my heart in this House for some 10 years now. It is being done on a commercial scale, and people have lost their lives. We must never forget the impact of that on the Falun Gong.</p> <p pid="a377.1/3">There is also the persecution of Christians. Churches have been destroyed, with secret police sitting in church services, taking notes of those who are there, and recording car numbers and which houses people return to. We have also had the rise of cyber-surveillance in China, which is another indication of those being imprisoned, beaten and injured all because they happen to have a different religious opinion. Today, we had some good news: the Government indicated that they would suspend their agreement with TikTok. That is good news when it comes to security issues, and we must welcome it.</p> <p pid="a377.1/4">In my time as an MP, I have seen the UK move from the &#8220;golden era&#8221; espoused by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron">David Cameron</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Osborne">George Osborne</a> to the confusion and lack of cohesion on China under this Government. In each case, the policies were driven by economics. Economics is of course relevant, but our policies must encompass other important factors such as our human rights obligations, and take into account our moral compass and what we believe. There is a real fear that focusing solely on money would mean that the UK&#8217;s fundamental beliefs in human rights and the rule of law are subjugated for the purpose of trade deals. <a href="/mp/?p=10785" title="Our page on Alistair Carmichael - 'The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)'">Mr Carmichael</a> referred to that; it is one of the key issues, and I seek clarification and encouragement from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> on it. That would be great for China and other authoritarian states, but terrible for the UK&#8217;s standing in the world. I urge extreme caution and recommend change.</p> <p pid="a377.1/5">We are watching in real time the reduction of democratic states and the rise of authoritarian regimes. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, 23 countries out of 167 monitored in 2020 could be called democracies. Fifty were considered authoritarian, and the others attained some form of flawed democracy or hybrid system, more likely than not under the control of one person.</p> <p pid="a377.1/6"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_Russia">China and Russia</a> are leading the global rise in authoritarian states. They are seeking to build their own alliances, disrupt democratic processes in other countries, interfere in elections, and create their own channels for communication and cyber-control away from the norms and standards expected by international treaties. They support each other at institutions such as the United Nations, where the evil axis gathers together to defend each other&#8217;s interests and provide financial and political support for one another. The unfortunate thing for us is that democracies seem incapable of working together to fight back against that in a single-minded, focused manner, so I have great concerns.</p> <p pid="a377.1/7">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> have committed a series of ongoing human rights abuses against the Uyghurs since 2014. I and others, including <a href="/mp/?p=10180" title="Our page on Iain Duncan Smith - 'the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith)'">Sir Iain Duncan Smith</a>, who is in the Chamber, have raised that issue. Abuse is also perpetrated against other ethnic and religious minorities in Xinjiang province. This is the largest scale detention of ethnic and religious minorities since world war two. It is of that size; it is almost impossible to take in the number.</p> <p pid="a377.1/8"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_States">The United States</a> has declared China&#8217;s human rights abuses a genocide, as have legislators in several other countries, including Canada, the Netherlands, Lithuania and France. We have even done so in this <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> in a debate led by the right hon. Member for Chingford and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodford_Green">Woodford Green</a>. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Parliaments">The Parliaments</a> of New Zealand, Belgium and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic">Czech Republic</a> condemned the Chinese Government&#8217;s treatment of the Uyghurs as severe human rights abuses or crimes against humanity, which they truly are.</p> <p pid="a377.1/9">China continues to deny any wrongdoing and threatens politicians and even entire countries with retaliation simply for daring to raise and debate these issues. Diplomats are deployed to berate senior Government officials and speak at news stations to explain that everyone is wrong and at this is all just Sinophobia and anti-China rhetoric. No, it is not; it is much more than that.</p> <p pid="a377.1/10">Atrocities in Tibet have been going on since 1950&#8212;so much so that we barely react any more. <a href="/mp/?p=10371" title="Our page on Tim Loughton - 'The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)'">Tim Loughton</a> has spoken about Tibet for as long as I have been in this House, and long before that, I believe. He has highlighted it on many occasions. We cannot forget about it. We need to focus on what is happening there, which is hard to take in, with regularity and ferocity. Children are forced into re-education boarding schools as a way of eradicating their language and religion, with the hope that they will reject their own families and culture. Such policies have left a trail of family destruction and have cut cultural and historical memory.</p> <p pid="a377.1/11">China plans to choose the next Dalai Lama, but I am very pleased that the hon. Gentleman said that those of the Dalai Lama&#8217;s religion will make that choice. I hope that will be the case and that China does not influence it in any way. We wait to see what happens.</p> <p pid="a377.1/12">Hong Kong wants to be a peaceful and prosperous city, a thriving economic and social hub in Asia, and truly global in its influence, but it has been brought to its knees in just three years since the introduction of the national security law.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a379.2/1">It is certainly not balanced. The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. He has highlighted this point in the Chamber on numerous occasions. He consistently and regularly points directly out to the Government that this matter must be addressed. If we are going to do things right, and it is our job in this House to do so, that has to be addressed. If the United States can sanction more people than we could even consider&#8212;I understand the number is maybe two in our country&#8212;we have to and we must do more. I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on all he does; we recognise his contribution.</p> <p pid="a379.2/2">The national security law is an arbitrary piece of legislation, the details of which were kept secret until after it was passed. It criminalises any act of disobedience or dissent, and any challenge to the Government can be swept up in the catch-all categories of secession, subversion, terrorism and, crucially, collusion with foreign or external forces. Rather than being used to protect people, the national security law is being used to silence&#8212;the very opposite. Newspaper and internet news outlets have been shut, journalists arrested and protesters detained&#8212;all accused of one or more of the four national security law charges.</p> <p pid="a379.2/3">The most infamous case of the law being used to crush media freedom in Hong Kong as that of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Daily">Apple Daily</a>, the most popular newspaper in Hong Kong, which is pro-democracy and openly called out Chinese Communist party activities. It was founded by a British citizen, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Lai">Jimmy Lai</a>, whose spent his 800th day in a Hong Kong prison last <phrase class="date" code="">Friday 10 March</phrase>. His national security law trial is repeatedly delayed, as the Hong Kong authorities scramble to find a new set of legal machinations just to keep him in prison. He is a British citizen. We should be doing more for him. I do not see that, and it disappoints me.</p> <p pid="a379.2/4">China has broken its promises to Britain and to the people of Hong Kong that the city would enjoy its way of life under the one country, two systems formula, which promised a high degree of autonomy for 50 years following the 1997 handover. Hong Kong is now a puppet state of China. The recent multimillion dollar campaign, &#8220;Hello Hong Kong&#8221;, called on the world to come to the reopened city. It fell flat, given that 47 democracy campaigners were put on trial the very next day. Welcome to Hong Kong&#8212;&#8220;If you come to Hong Kong, here is what happens to you.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a379.2/5">Across the world, China seems to be at the centre of multiple political and economic scandals, whether that is spy balloons over America or interference in Canada&#8217;s election. There seems to be an increasing sense that  China has never been bolder in asserting itself around the world. The belt and road initiative, adopted by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> in 2013, to invest in more than 150 countries and international organisations, is considered a centrepiece of Chinese leader Xi Jinping&#8217;s foreign policy.</p> <p pid="a379.2/6">We can see China&#8217;s tentacles across Africa and in countries around the world. The policy has been used to extend Chinese economic and political influence around the world. It has been used to secure votes at multinational organisations such as the United Nations, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and in many regional groupings across the world. It forces countries into debt economics. Even <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU">EU</a> states now have ports, docks and infrastructure projects funded by the belt and road initiative, at a time when the EU should be shoring up its own defence, cyber and technological strategies. The initiative is causing splits inside the EU and creating <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">division</a> among Governments. That is great news for China and for other authoritarian states.</p> <p pid="a379.2/7">Here in the UK, we have seen the rise of China&#8217;s economic and political engagement. In 2022, more students came to the UK from China than anywhere else. Nearly one in four international students is from China&#8212;approximately 152,000 students. Of the 2,600 international students studying at Queen&#8217;s University in Belfast, we have a vibrant Chinese community of more than 1,200 students.</p> <p pid="a379.2/8">Along with that, we have seen the explosion of Confucius Institutes across the UK. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Kingdom">The United Kingdom</a> is host to 30 Confucius Institutes, more than any other country. Their ostensible purpose is to teach Mandarin and to promote Chinese culture, but in reality they are part of the above-ground arm of the Chinese Communist party&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Front_Work_Department">United Front Work Department</a>.</p> <p pid="a379.2/9">According to a 2022 report by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Jackson_Society">Henry Jackson Society</a> and the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, those 30 institutes have been funded to the tune of as much as &#163;46 million, mostly from the Chinese Government. Unlike the British Council, Confucius Institutes are formally part of the propaganda system of the Chinese Communist party, dependent on Chinese Government funding and, in general, subject to People&#8217;s Republic of China speech restrictions. Although Confucius Institutes are described as language and culture centres, the report confirms that only four of the 30 institutes stick solely to language and culture. Quite clearly, they do their own thing and ignore much of what is going on.</p> <p pid="a379.2/10">Operating from prestigious universities such as the University of Edinburgh and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_School_of_Economics">London School of Economics</a>, Confucius Institutes have been informing Government policy and politicians, offering consultancy services to business, promoting trade and co-operating with UK organisations that work with the United Front Work Department, the interference activities of which were recently highlighted by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI5">MI5</a> and reported prominently in the papers and media. That is not innocent language and cultural exchange.</p> <p pid="a379.2/11">In spite of the political attention paid to Confucius Institutes, and the press and academic attention during the last six years, the pattern has gone unnoticed, and its ramifications have been ignored&#8212;an issue that the right hon. Member for Chingford and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodford_Green">Woodford Green</a> brings to this House on many occasions. To combat those negative practices, the Government should consider the introduction of legislation to remove Confucius  Institutes completely from UK universities. Will the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> confirm whether the British Government will do just that? Further, it has been suggested that the Government should provide funding for UK universities to allocate to China studies and bolster knowledge regarding China&#8217;s presence in the UK. I believe that that merits consideration. It is not the direct responsibility of the Minister, but it is certainly one for Education Ministers.</p> <p pid="a379.2/12">Time is passing, but I should mention the fact that many believe that there is a notable level of political interference&#8212;from funding from Chinese nationals to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament">Members of Parliament</a>, to the beating of Bob Chan in Manchester last October. I am sure we all vividly remember this man, who was beaten by the Chinese consul general and other diplomats in full view of the public and cameras. The consul general then went on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV">TV</a> to admit to and justify his actions; he did not even feel ashamed or regretful. The appropriate action should have been taken, yet it appears that it was left to fade into the background. Eventually, two months later, China recalled the diplomats, and it appears that no steps whatever were taken by the British to send the message that that behaviour is not tolerated. Again, that is disappointing and regrettable. I always say things respectfully to the Ministers, but I want my Government and my Ministers to be strong when it comes to standing up for human rights and against things that are wrong across the world.</p> <p pid="a379.2/13">As a nation, we should be seeking constructive relationships with countries around the world. I understand that not all will be savoury, but we should be making human rights and good conduct cornerstones of our foreign relations&#8212;even, or especially, as the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland said, when it comes to trade and development. That is what sets our country apart from authoritarian ones such as China. There is no reason for the UK not to have a constructive relationship with China, but we should not be afraid on any occasion to say no and to show strength, and we need to do that more regularly and more courageously.</p>            </div>

We want to have a working relationship, but we have to recognise that China quite clearly does not.</p> <p pid="a381.1/2">Surely, if any lessons are to be learned from the relationship with Russia over the last 10 years, for example, it is that kowtowing, appeasing or ignoring will lead to only more egregious actions by the aggressor state&#8212;from Russia in the past, but from China in the future. China has been watching the war that Russia has inflicted on Ukraine, and it will have noted that while Russian troops are killing, raping and bombing Ukrainian citizens, Western states in some cases have been prevaricating and debating what to do in response. China is watching, and so is Taiwan. Sending weapons is good, but it could all have been avoided if the warning signs about Russia were heeded several years ago.</p>            </div>

He wants the world to know that he is a British passport holder and British citizen; he is proud of that and wants representation.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a383.0/1">I pay tribute to <a href="/mp/?p=13864" title="Our page on Jim Shannon - 'the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)'">Jim Shannon</a>, who said most of what I was going to say but I will give it a go anyway. Let me start with my declaration of interests&#8212;they are not at all financial, otherwise there would be a problem&#8212;as somebody who has been sanctioned by China. That is something I am very proud to shout about at every opportunity. I also declare an interest as chair of the all-party parliamentary group for Tibet, an association I have had for many years, and before <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>, as the hon. Gentleman said.</p> <p pid="a383.0/2">Another day, yet another debate on China&#8217;s abuses of human rights. Earlier in the Chamber, there was another announcement relating to China, on TikTok, which I will come on to in a minute. This debate is about relations with China under the dictatorship of President Xi over the last 10 years, so it is worth starting by looking at some of the words he has said on the record and then putting some meat on the bones of how that has actually worked out in practice.</p> <p pid="a383.0/3">In March 2013, Xi Jinping started his first five-year term as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_China">President of China</a>. More consequentially, in November 2012 he first assumed the two most powerful positions in China: general secretary of the Chinese Communist party and the chairman of the party&#8217;s central military commission. Changes in leadership positions in China&#8217;s one-party state are made every five years and normally follow a two-step process: the first occurring in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCP">CCP</a> and the second involving the Government. At the CCP&#8217;s 20th party congress in October 2022, Xi was appointed general secretary for a third five-year term and once again as chair of the party&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMC">CMC</a>, confirming his dominance over the party and the country at large. That third term appointment broke the recent precedent of the country&#8217;s leadership serving only two terms.</p> <p pid="a383.0/4">More recently, on <phrase class="date" code="">11 March</phrase>, he secured a precedent-breaking third term as President of China, as well as chairman of the CMC, with nearly 3,000 members of the National People&#8217;s Congress voting unanimously in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall_of_the_People">Great Hall of the People</a>. Funnily enough, no other candidates ran. Effectively, he is becoming a dictator for life, the likes of which we have not really seen since the fall of the iron curtain and some of those potentates under the control of the Soviet empire in eastern European states before they were able to win their liberty and return to Europe, freedom and democracy.</p> <p pid="a383.0/5">In his speech in March to the National People&#8217;s Congress, Xi Jinping said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a383.0/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Since its founding, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China">Communist Party of China</a> has closely united and led the Chinese people of all ethnic groups in working hard for a century to put an end to China&#8217;s national humiliation.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a383.0/7">Note that he mentioned working with &#8220;all ethnic groups&#8221; across China; I think there are 57 different ethnic groups. That does not really apply if someone is a Uyghur, Tibetan, a Hongkonger or of Mongolian ancestry. It has not really worked out well for them. He said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a383.0/8" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;the Chinese nation has achieved the great transformation from standing up and growing prosperous to becoming strong, and China&#8217;s national rejuvenation has become a historical inevitability.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a383.0/9">On military and defence, he went on to say:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a383.0/10" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;We need to better&#8221;&#8212; a split infinitive, I apologise&#8212;</p> <p class="indent" pid="a383.0/12" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;co-ordinate development and security. We should comprehensively promote the modernisation of our national defence and our armed forces, and build the people&#8217;s military into a great wall of steel that can effectively safeguard our nation&#8217;s sovereignty, security and the interests of our development.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a383.0/13">On Taiwan, he said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a383.0/14" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Realising China&#8217;s complete reunification is a shared aspiration of all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, as well as the essence of national rejuvenation&#8230;resolutely oppose foreign interference and separatist activities aimed at &#8216;Taiwan independence&#8217; and unswervingly promote progress towards national reunification.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a383.0/15">Those words should not come as a surprise. Two years earlier, in a speech&#8212;I am quoting selectively, but I  think you will get the gist, Sir Edward&#8212;marking the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist party, he said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a383.0/16" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;We will never allow anyone to bully, oppress or subjugate China&#8230;Anyone who dares try to do that will have their heads bashed bloody against the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall">Great Wall</a> of Steel forged by over 1.4 billion Chinese people&#8230;Only socialism can save China, and only socialism with Chinese characteristics can develop China&#8230;No one should underestimate the Chinese people&#8217;s staunch determination, firm will, and strong ability to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity&#8230;The historical task of the complete reunification of the motherland must be fulfilled, and will definitely be fulfilled.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a383.0/17">I watched a programme last night about the Nazis in the 1930s, and so much of President Xi&#8217;s language there was redolent of what was heard in the 1930s under Hitler. It is a shame that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker">Gary Lineker</a> did not refer to that as well, because that is where the real dangers lie. It is chilling when one listens to the very words that the people running China put into the public domain. We should take them exceedingly seriously. For previous Governments to refer to &#8220;golden ages&#8221; of relationships between the United Kingdom, the west and China, under the same dictator who expressed those words, is a complete fantasy&#8212;and a dangerous fantasy at that. We need to wake up to that.</p> <p pid="a383.0/18">I worry greatly about the threat that China poses. It is a threat, whatever language the Government might like to use. Let us touch on the China 2049 policy, which President Xi has been following. China 2049 in an overarching plan, set out by the President in October 2017, when he used a speech to describe a broad plan to achieve national rejuvenation by 2049. The date would mark the centenary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China by the CCP. It largely refers to the CCP&#8217;s plan to transform the Chinese army&#8212;the People&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_Army">Liberation Army</a>&#8212;into a world-class military by 2049. A mid-term goal is to have completed the modernisation of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLA">PLA</a> by 2035.</p> <p pid="a383.0/19">According to an annual report from the Pentagon to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Congress">US Congress</a> in November 2021:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a383.0/20" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_PRC">The PRC</a> is increasingly clear in its ambitions and intentions. Beijing seeks to reshape the international order to better align with its authoritarian system and national interests, as a vital component of its strategy to achieve the &#8216;great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.&#8217;&#8221;</p> <p pid="a383.0/21">China seeks to achieve that by merging foreign policy, economic power, defence and military strategies, and its Government and political systems into one master plan. Everything is traduced to that. Everything China does has that long-term, great goal in mind.</p> <p pid="a383.0/22">China now has the world&#8217;s largest navy, with roughly 355 ships and submarines. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People">The People</a>&#8217;s Liberation Army has 975,000 active duty personnel in combat units, and has accelerated its training and fielding of equipment at a pace exceeding that of recent years. It is also expanding its nuclear weapon capabilities faster than previously predicted. The rapid acceleration of Beijing&#8217;s nuclear stockpile, which could top 1,000 deliverable warheads by 2030, is designed to match and even surpass the US global military might, according to the Pentagon. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_US">The US</a> has 3,750 nuclear weapons in its stockpiles, and has no plans to increase that figure. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese">The Chinese</a> air force is the world&#8217;s third largest, with more than 2,800 aircraft in total, 2,250 of which consist of fighters, strategic bombers and attack aircraft. That expansion is part of the great Chinese plan to dominate the world economically and militarily, as well as in other areas that I will come to.</p> <p pid="a383.0/23">That is the context in which we have to judge the threat posed by the actions of President Xi and his Communist party cronies. We know how that has panned out in Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong and elsewhere. Some of us have often been lone voices in the wilderness on the plight of the Tibetans. Since the early 1950s, and particularly since the invasion and takeover of Tibet in 1959, what has been playing out in Tibet&#8212;with the 1 million Tibetans who have lost their lives at the hands of the Chinese Communist party dictators&#8212;is a forerunner of what the CCP is capable of doing, and is doing, within the borders of China; and what it would like to do beyond the borders of what we recognise as China.</p> <p pid="a383.0/24">The hon. Member for Strangford fleshed out many of the horrors going on against the Uyghurs. It is estimated that several million Uyghurs are being held captive in concentration camps, where activities include mass surveillance, torture and repression of religion. They are interned for reasons that include communal religious activities, behaviour indicating &#8220;wrong thinking&#8221;&#8212;whatever that is&#8212;or for just no reason at all. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Uyghur_Congress">World Uyghur Congress</a> observes that the camps operate as prisons, with no communication with family outside. The CCP regime is pursuing a campaign of forced sterilisation and forced abortion, along with the destruction of the Uyghur language. China is trying to erase the Uyghur people.</p> <p pid="a383.0/25">In 2021, Uyghur regions set an unprecedented near zero population growth, given the effects of sterilisation. According to Dr Joanne Smith Finley, a reader in Chinese studies at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_University">Newcastle University</a> and a fellow sanctionee, when she interviewed a Uyghur man from &#220;r&#252;mqi, he said that some people were given medicine in those camps to change their thinking, only to become  mentally ill. The CCP is aiming to wipe out three specific categories: intellectual Uyghurs, rich Uyghurs and religious Uyghurs.</p> <p pid="a383.0/26">A sub-committee in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Parliament">Canadian Parliament</a> has concluded that the acts carried out by China on the Uyghurs amount to genocide by the general accepted definition. That was the conclusion of the Uyghur tribunals, so well presided over by Sir Geoffrey Nice at the end of last year. That was the conclusion of a unanimous vote in Parliament at a debate we held last year on the subject. It is about time the British Government acknowledged that the Chinese are guilty of genocide and continue to wage that ghastly oppression against the Uyghur people. Many other Parliaments have acknowledged it. We must catch up.</p> <p pid="a383.0/27">This is not just about the Uyghurs within the borders of China. Uyghurs abroad have also been intimidated and spied on through apps such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat">WeChat</a> by the Communist party, according to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_Human_Rights_Project">Uyghur Human Rights Project</a>. The late former Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks said,</p> <p class="indent" pid="a383.0/28" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;As a Jew, knowing our history, the sight of people being shaven headed, lined up, boarded onto trains, and sent to concentration camps is particularly harrowing.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a383.0/29">We all saw those grim images and have heard so much that the Communist party has developed multiple levels of surveillance in the forms of Skynet and the &#8220;Safe City&#8221; and &#8220;Sharp Eyes&#8221; projects to keep track of every movement of its citizens. Of course, it is also spying on us through devices made in China and deployed across the west, including in the United Kingdom. Virtually weekly, we find a new case of the Chinese being able to survey what is going on in sensitive institutions in the UK.</p> <p pid="a383.0/30">Xi Jinping&#8217;s Tibet policy has been the systematic eradication of any and all distinctive features of Tibetan identity, carried out unchecked despite blatant human rights abuses.

Too often in this country, we seem to be playing catch up with some of the much more proactive and obvious measures taken by the US Administration, usually with unanimous support across all parties in Congress. Many of those <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> are now having an impact on China and beginning to make it wake up to the fact that its actions have consequences. I fear that, too often, it is because people in this Chamber today and like-minded colleagues put pressure on the Government that, eventually, they might just catch up with some of the measures that should have been passed into our law at the same time as they were passed in the United States.</p>            </div>

Member for Strangford mentioned him. He also mentioned at length the Confucius Institutes, an example of how the tentacles of the Chinese Communist party extend everywhere&#8212;globally and within the UK in our boardrooms, businesses, schools, campuses, local authorities and in the bogus police stations, effectively, that China has set up. There was the disgraceful episode at the Manchester consulate, where the consul thought it was his job to beat up demonstrators. There was no pretence to try to get out of it. Is that not what he was there for? Is that not what the Chinese Communist party pays him to do? Never has a greater or more honest admission come from an official of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>.</p> <p pid="a388.7/3">Internationally, what is China doing as part of the China 2049 plan? It controls something like 104 ports and has its teeth in infrastructure projects around the world. It effectively holds Governments to ransom,  with huge loans imposed on them. We know what has happened with the port in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, the airport in Uganda and some of the schemes that have fallen to pieces. It places huge debts on many east African countries in particular, which is the real characteristic of the belt and road project. China has a stranglehold on rare earth mining, controlling 58% of critical minerals mining and 73% of the global production capacity for lithium, which goes into lithium-ion batteries and is crucial for anti-climate change measures relating to renewable and environmentally friendly sources of energy.

I do not have you down as a TikTok devotee, Sir Edward&#8212;I may be doing you a disservice&#8212;but did you know that in China, western TikTok is banned and the addictive algorithms used over here are illegal? Last year, the internet watchdog made it mandatory for domestic companies to give users the choice to opt out of their data being used for personalised content in China. Over here, we know the situation: TikTok and its parent company ByteDance have close ties with the Chinese Communist party and are required to comply with the People&#8217;s Republic of China surveillance demand under the cyber-security law. Under standard contractual clauses, data can be transferred to ByteDance or other entities in the PRC from users in the UK and the rest of the west.</p> <p pid="a389.1/3">We should be nowhere near that system, frankly. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office should initiate an audit under section 146 of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Act_2018">Data Protection Act 2018</a> to investigate whether TikTok can protect the data being transferred under the legal regime in the PRC. If not, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICO">ICO</a> should consider intervening and prohibiting the data transfer as it cannot be respected in the PRC.</p> <p pid="a389.1/4">Whatever the Government want to call it and whatever phraseology they use, China is the greatest threat to the peace and security of the globe, and we need to plan accordingly. If people do not believe me, I urge them to read the words of the lifetime dictator who is in control of that country.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a389.2/1">It is a pleasure to follow <a href="/mp/?p=10371" title="Our page on Tim Loughton - 'the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)'">Tim Loughton</a> and <a href="/mp/?p=13864" title="Our page on Jim Shannon - 'the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)'">Jim Shannon</a>, who secured the debate. I am reminded of the days when I used to have to read case reports. I would read the lengthy and definitive judgments and then I would come to one that just said, &#8220;I concur&#8221;, and I would fall on it like manna from heaven. To the two hon. Gentlemen who have already spoken in the debate, I say, &#8220;I concur&#8221;.</p> <p pid="a389.2/2">I will make two points. My first is about the position of people coming here from Hong Kong under the British national overseas sponsorship scheme. Last night, I had the enormous pleasure of spending time at a  symposium at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_School_of_Economics">London School of Economics</a>, run by the Hong Kong Public Affairs and Social Services Society. It highlighted the importance of understanding that for all those Hongkongers who have settled here, their arrival is not the end of the story; it is just the beginning. The trauma of leaving their home in the way they had to will have caused many other issues, and our obligation to support them did not stop when they cleared passport control at Heathrow airport.</p> <p pid="a389.2/3">My more significant point is about not so much the position that has been outlined at some length, but the approach of Ministers and Government officials in response to it. Today in the main Chamber, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Lancaster">Duchy of Lancaster</a> managed to make a whole statement about TikTok without using the words &#8220;China&#8221; or &#8220;Chinese&#8221; once.</p> <p pid="a389.2/4">Last Wednesday, in this very Chamber, I initiated a debate on genomics and national security. In his reply, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> responding said something quite remarkable:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a389.2/5" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;I had been prepared to pay tribute to the work of BGI&#8221;</p> <p pid="a389.2/6">&#8212;that is the Chinese genomics giant&#8212;</p> <p class="indent" pid="a389.2/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;when my officials pointed out that at that point <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics_England">Genomics England</a> was suffering several hack attacks from BGI each week.&#8221;&#8212;<big>[This section has been corrected on <phrase class="date" code="">8 March 2023</phrase>, column 2MC &mdash; <br><strong>read</strong> correction]</big></p> <p pid="a389.2/10">Stalin at the height of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a> could not have improved on that. I have no doubt that the correction was initiated by officials as a consequence of the representations that they then had. Clearly, they were not of a mind to stand up to those representations and the pressure that was being put on them. Genomics needs to be part of our critical national infrastructure; the Government need to move on that. From what we see, the time has now surely come for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGI_Group">BGI Group</a> itself to be the subject of a security review by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Government">United Kingdom Government</a>.</p> <p pid="a389.2/11">If we are to be serious about the way in which we rebalance our relationship with China, we need to get the balance between trade and human rights right. <a href="/mp/?p=10180" title="Our page on Iain Duncan Smith - 'The right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith)'">Sir Iain Duncan Smith</a> and I were both members of <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> in the golden age, so we have seen how it used to work. We understand that that has to change. That would be a good point at which the Government could start. If the Minster could express a view on that, I think we would all consider our time today to have been very well spent.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a390.0/1">I thank <a href="/mp/?p=13864" title="Our page on Jim Shannon - 'the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)'">Jim Shannon</a> for securing this debate. We do not take enough time to consider relations with China in the round. When we talk about it, it tends to be very specific, so I welcome this opportunity. There has been little said today that I would disagree with, if anything, so there is a broad consensus in the Chamber.</p> <p pid="a390.0/2">We have all watched, with concern and alarm, developments in China over the past decade: the strengthening of the state&#8217;s grip over civil society, the well-documented civil and human rights abuses, and  the growth of mass surveillance of the population to an extent we have never seen before. Those are causes for great concern. There is something almost unique about China. Throughout history, the UK has had to work with other countries and Governments with whom it has profound philosophical and political disagreements, but never has a country penetrated our economy and society to such an extent as China has over the last generation.</p> <p pid="a390.0/3">It strikes me that the interface between us and China does not happen out there, in a place beyond these shores; it happens in the towns and cities within these islands. There is considerable Chinese investment and ownership in our economy. There is a degree of <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> in academia and our universities that is without precedent. In my city of Edinburgh, there are thousands of Chinese students, and the same is true in most of our universities. Our universities have grown wealthy by charging these students from middle-class Chinese families considerable fees to come here; it has been a very big growth industry for them. When it comes to communications, among other things, the Chinese influence is quite certain, but we seem to have little capacity to understand, analyse and be aware of this interface. I hope that the Government will look at how that could be improved, and how we could develop that capacity.</p> <p pid="a390.0/4">We have heard the Government&#8217;s strategy described as &#8220;robust pragmatism&#8221;. If I knew what that was, I might agree, but until we get more definition, it is difficult to do so. As <a href="/mp/?p=10785" title="Our page on Alistair Carmichael - 'the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)'">Mr Carmichael</a> said, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Lancaster">Duchy of Lancaster</a> implied today in the main Chamber that &#8220;robust pragmatism&#8221; means being aware of China&#8217;s economic influence and our economic relations when we formulate our attitudes towards it, and when we take action. That much is self-evident, I suppose. Let us hope that &#8220;robust pragmatism&#8221; does not mean setting aside our concerns or our criticisms about human and civil rights abuses because of that economic relationship; it cannot mean that. We need a strategy from the Government that shows how we can press our case on international human rights while navigating the economic relationship, and how, on occasion, we can use that economic relationship as leverage to achieve other social and political goals.</p> <p pid="a390.0/5">To conclude, I have three questions to put to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, which I hope he will answer in his summing up. First, we have had a lot of discussion about Hong Kong. An international agreement has clearly been broken. Is it not bizarre that there are national sanctions on individuals in Myanmar, Russia and Belarus, but not Hong Kong? The breaking of that agreement, the way in which it was traduced and the movement in a different direction has not happened by accident; there are people making it happen. Those people ought to be identified and sanctioned by this country, as they have been by other countries. When will we see Magnitsky-style sanctions against people in Hong Kong, to hold them responsible for what they have done?</p> <p pid="a390.0/6">Secondly, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNP">SNP</a> has long pressed for the establishment of a commissioner to look at foreign investment in this country, with a view to examining illicit foreign investment.  We see such investment particularly from Russia, but there is a case for looking at Chinese investment as well. It would be a step forward to have a commissioner who was charged with examining incoming finance and determining whether any of it was illicit.</p> <p pid="a390.0/7">Finally, my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25370" title="Our page on Brendan O'Hara - 'the Member for Argyll and Bute (Brendan O'Hara)'">Brendan O'Hara</a> brought forward a ten-minute rule Bill last year that sought to outlaw imports from Xinjiang unless it could be proven that the products were made without the benefit of forced labour. We ought to be able to do that. Given what we know about the human rights situation in that region of China, there should be an onus on those involved to give that proof.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a392.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Sir Edward. I declare an interest as a founding member of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Watch">Hong Kong Watch</a>. I am unsure how many Members of this House have lived in China, but I am in a somewhat unique position, having spent an academic year in Nanjing in the 1990s. At the time, China was emerging on the world stage and growing economically, and there was an anticipation and excitement that the relatively new economic opening that had been embraced at home and abroad might be followed by political reforms, even if dreams of a democratic China were far-fetched. In the years since, particularly since the introduction of the core leadership concept of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Xi_Jinping">President Xi Jinping</a>, we have seen the emergence of a China with a sense of closing and an increasing domestic authoritarianism. That contrasts with what was experienced by foreign teachers in the mid-90s in Nanjing.</p> <p pid="a392.2/2">China prides itself on its economic growth, which has undeniably lifted millions out of grinding poverty since 1990. It has a rich and proud history, and is keen to be taken seriously on the global stage. Sadly, the trend is increasingly towards authoritarianism at home, and a more assertive and at times aggressive approach to defence and foreign diplomacy. In recent years, China has unlawfully occupied islands and islets in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China">South China</a> sea, which has caused tension with neighbours in the region. There have been increasing numbers of menacing military manoeuvres in the Taiwan strait and hand-to-hand combat with neighbours in India, as <a href="/mp/?p=10180" title="Our page on Iain Duncan Smith - 'the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith)'">Sir Iain Duncan Smith</a> mentioned.</p> <p pid="a392.2/3">At the same time, through its development policies, China is courting influence in the global south through the belt and road initiative. That has changed the balance of voting power in international for a, and challenged  the notions of international law that have governed diplomacy since the end of the second world war. We have also seen a brutal and unprecedented crackdown on domestic dissent; the well documented appalling treatment of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang has been described by many, and by a vote of this House, as a genocide. The freedoms and liberties promised to Hongkongers in the legally binding Sino-British joint declaration have long since been undermined.</p> <p pid="a392.2/4">As <a href="/mp/?p=10371" title="Our page on Tim Loughton - 'the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)'">Tim Loughton</a> said, freedom of religion or belief has been compromised in Tibet, and there have been attacks on Buddhist temples and faith leaders. Unfortunately, the regularity of reporting by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign,_Commonwealth_and_Development_Office">Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office</a> on the hotspots of Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet has decreased. I hope that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> will recommit his Department to more regular reporting, so that parliamentarians can be kept up to date on the human rights picture.</p> <p pid="a392.2/5">Naturally, the approach under Xi Jinping has heralded a step change in our approach to China; the heady, and arguably naive, days of the so-called golden era have been replaced by a growing understanding that a more coherent, robust and level-headed approach to UK-China relations is needed. Unfortunately, the Government have been dragging their heels when it comes to changing the way that we approach China to take into account the change in China under Xi Jinping. Ministers were slow to withdraw British judges from the Hong Kong court of final appeal, despite Labour&#8217;s and other parliamentarians&#8217; consistent demands for action. There is a litany of examples in which their action has simply not matched the severity of the situation, including in the case of the appalling and brutal attack of protesters outside the Chinese consulate in Manchester, the reports of Chinese police stations in the UK, and the malign use of technology such Hikvision and TikTok. It took three <a href="/glossary/?gl=19" title="An Urgent Question, formerly a Private Notice Question (PNQ), is a question..." class="glossary">urgent questions</a> to drag Ministers to the House to take action on the first of those. On TikTok, only today have the Government confirmed that they will take action. We are lagging behind our allies&#8212;we are behind the curve again.</p> <p pid="a392.2/6">There are other cyber threats that need to be taken seriously. I am on record as having tabled many questions on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Genomics_Institute">Beijing Genomics Institute</a>. The Government lack a comprehensive strategy on cyber threats to the UK from malign actors. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> will point to this week&#8217;s publication of the refreshed integrated review; I accept that the review goes far further than the 2021 iteration in acknowledging that China poses an &#8220;epoch-defining challenge&#8221; for the UK. I particularly welcome the Government&#8217;s commitment to doubling the funding available for increasing <a href="/glossary/?gl=101" title="Whitehall is a wide road that runs through the heart of Westminster,..." class="glossary">Whitehall</a>&#8217;s China capabilities and Mandarin training. Both are vital steps that we in the Labour party have called for.</p> <p pid="a392.2/7">I also note Monday&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUKUS">AUKUS</a> announcement and the significant commitment to regional security through that partnership, which has the Labour party&#8217;s full support, but we must still do more to live up to the challenge that the integrated review lays out in detail, so that our actions and posture match the at times bellicose approach taken by Xi Jinping in Beijing. That is particularly the case with Hong Kong, where young democracy activists and British citizens&#8212;including <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Lai">Jimmy Lai</a>, whose crime was to defend freedom of expression&#8212;are on trial, and  where the national security law continues to undermine the freedoms promised to the people of Hong Kong. Will the Minister say whether the UK will come into line with the US on sanctions to the leadership of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Government">Hong Kong Government</a>? It is good that <a href="/mp/?p=25287" title="Our page on Margaret Ferrier - 'the hon. Member for Rutherglen and Hamilton West (Margaret Ferrier)'">Margaret Ferrier</a> voiced those concerns.</p> <p pid="a392.2/8">Regretfully, the integrated review refresh makes little mention of Hong Kong and the challenges faced by the city and its people, or of how the British Government will support those facing arbitrary trial and detention simply for standing up for their legally promised rights. Members have made a powerful case about how China has changed under Xi Jinping&#8217;s creeping authoritarianism, and about China&#8217;s strengthening military and ever-increasing defence budget&#8212;a 7% increase was announced just this week.</p> <p pid="a392.2/9">I will press the Minister on several points related to how the UK should respond to Xi Jinping&#8217;s China and follow up from the integrated review. First, what steps will the Government take to support British nationals detained in Hong Kong, as China continues to apply its draconian national security legislation and erode the essential freedoms enshrined in the joint declaration of 1984, which came into effect in July 1997? For example, how good is the day-to-day consular access to Jimmy Lai?</p> <p pid="a392.2/10">Secondly, what support will the Government as a whole provide to newly arrived Hong Kong nationals in the UK? <a href="/mp/?p=10785" title="Our page on Alistair Carmichael - 'The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)'">Mr Carmichael</a> mentioned his work in his <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> and around the UK in that regard, and other Members mentioned work in their constituency. I attended a useful group in Haringey borough that was organised for newly arrived Hongkongers, but are they safe from surveillance by individuals from the Chinese Communist party who are based in the UK? Will the Minister join the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> in looking at that on behalf of parliamentarians who are concerned about the safety of those newly arrived communities?</p> <p pid="a392.2/11">Thirdly, will the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCDO">FCDO</a> support human rights defenders in Xinjiang and Tibet? Will developments be monitored, so that they can inform the FCDO&#8217;s reporting cycle? It is vital that parliamentarians have relevant, up-to-date information about the human rights infringements of such an important trading partner.</p> <p pid="a392.2/12">Finally, what steps are the Government taking to increase UK support and influence in countries of the global south, particularly in the wider <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pacific">Indo-Pacific</a> region? That is essential if we are to support our allies and partners while China continues to increase its global influence.</p>            </div>

Member for Strangford, which were wide-ranging, interesting and pertinent. I deeply appreciated the way he set out the barbaric treatment of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang. He also addressed the concerns we all have about the situation in Hong Kong, particularly with regard to the constraints on freedom of expression. He also mentioned Tibet, the persecution of Christians and the ominous race towards cyber-surveillance in China. I am grateful for the comprehensive nature of his remarks, and I will try to address his points.</p> <p pid="a394.0/4">I will first address the points raised by the hon. Member for Hornsey and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_Green">Wood Green</a>. We continue to support Hongkongers in Hong Kong, but also those newly arrived here, and we continue to monitor their safety. We are all clearly moved by the scale of arrival, but the warm nature of the welcome is also impressive. We will continue to support human rights defenders in China and Hong Kong, and we continue to work in the global south&#8212;that is a core part of our diplomacy&#8212;to ensure that Chinese disinformation, among other issues, are countered.</p> <p pid="a394.0/5">This is clearly a timely debate, given the very much expected news last week that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Xi_Jinping">President Xi Jinping</a> will serve an unprecedented third term&#160;as President, but also because of our release of the integrated review refresh and, of course, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUKUS">AUKUS</a> announcement on a remarkable alliance with two of our most valued security allies.</p> <p pid="a394.0/6">Let me dwell briefly on the integrated review refresh. In 2021, we assessed that China&#8217;s increasing assertiveness, and its growing impact on many aspects of our lives, will be one of the defining factors of the 21st century. That remains our assessment, but the review foreshadowed the intense global turbulence of the last two years. The refresh, which the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> presented on Monday, sets out how we are meeting the challenge of this more volatile world head on. Clearly, it is about much more than China&#8212;it is also about Russia&#8217;s threat to European security&#8212;but it also recognises the very significant challenge that China presents, in terms of military, diplomatic and economic activity. The review is clear in stating that China has becoming more authoritarian at home and more assertive overseas, and that it presents us with an &#8220;epoch-defining challenge&#8221;.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a395.1/1">China remains, as identified in the original integrated review, the biggest long-term state threat to the UK&#8217;s economic security. No one is disputing that. What the refresh seeks to do is build a strategy around that. Page 30 of the refresh says:</p> <p class="indent" pid="a395.1/2" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;China under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party">Chinese Communist Party</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCP">CCP</a>) poses an epoch-defining and systemic challenge with implications for almost every area of government policy and the everyday lives of British people.&#8221;</p> <p pid="a395.1/3">That is comprehensive, and it is very clear that the refresh is seeking to build a strategy around that analysis.</p> <p pid="a395.1/4">Furthermore, we know that the challenge includes China using its economic power to coerce countries with which it disagrees. Its aggressive stance in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China">South China</a> sea and the Taiwan strait threatens to bring danger, disorder and <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">division</a>. In other words, it threatens to create an international order favourable to authoritarianism. We will work closely with others to push back against any attempts by the Chinese Communist party to coerce or threaten other countries. That is a great deal of what <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUKUS">AUKUS</a> is seeking to do, as we all saw earlier this week.</p> <p pid="a395.1/5">We have already taken robust action to protect UK interests and values since the last integrated review. That includes new powers to protect our critical industries under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_and_Investment_Act_2021">National Security and Investment Act 2021</a>; bolstering the security of our 5G network through the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022; and training more than 170 civil servants in Mandarin. Hon. Members have mentioned Confucius Institutes; clearly, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> and the Security <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> are looking at them in great detail.</p> <p pid="a395.1/6">The integrated review refresh takes this approach further. We will double funding for Chinese expertise and capacities in Government so that we have more Mandarin speakers and China experts. That will boost skills and knowledge for Government staff on China, including on economic and military policy, as well as Mandarin language skills. We would all welcome that.</p> <p pid="a395.1/7">Let me dwell on Xinjiang. The hon. Member for Strangford made a very good case and laid out the horrors we have seen there, and I am thankful to him for that. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> has led international efforts to hold China to account for that through the United Nations and our sanctions regime. We were the first country to step up to lead a joint statement on China&#8217;s human rights record in Xinjiang at the United Nations. Since that first statement in 2019, we have worked tirelessly to broaden the network of countries speaking out. Most recently, on <phrase class="date" code="">31 October</phrase>, the UK played a leading role in securing the support of a record 50 countries for a joint statement on China&#8217;s human rights violations in Xinjiang. We have also implemented measures to ensure that UK organisations are not complicit in these violations through their supply chains. We will continue to call out China and put pressure on it to change.</p>            </div>

Of course, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> acted quickly and decisively to introduce a bespoke immigration route for British national overseas status holders and their immediate family members.

May I just elide the two, because they are relevant, and press my hon. Friend to be a little clearer? There are BNO passport holders who have fled over here, to the UK, who are now deeply worried about their status. They think of Jimmy Lai and see that the British Government seem quite incapable at this stage of making it publicly and absolutely clear that he is a passport holder and citizen and of publicly demanding access rights to that man, who is incarcerated. If they will not do that for a British passport holder, what do the BNO passport holders feel about their status? Does the Minister realise that that will be very damaging?</p>            </div>

Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> set out how we will protect our national security, align with partners and engage with China where it is in our national interests to do so. First, we have already taken robust action to protect UK interests and values since the last integrated review. That includes new powers to protect our critical industries under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_and_Investment_Act_2021">National Security and Investment Act 2021</a>; and in relation to Hong Kong, we have acted quickly and decisively to introduce a bespoke immigration route for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> status holders and family members.</p> <p pid="a397.1/3">Secondly, we will align and deepen our co-operation with core allies to influence China. That includes being the first country to lead a joint statement on human rights violations in Xinjiang, and sustaining pressure on China by broadening the range of countries speaking out. Thirdly, we will engage with Beijing on key global issues such as climate change and the war in Ukraine. We will continue to press China to join the UK in pushing Putin to cease all hostilities and withdraw his forces from Ukraine.</p> <p pid="a397.1/4">Under the integrated review refresh, my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> has set the direction across Government for a consistent, coherent and robust approach to China that is rooted in the UK&#8217;s national interest and aligned with our allies. I commend this strategy to the Chamber today.</p>            </div>

He made a comparison with the Nazis of the 1930s and discussed China&#8217;s attempt to change the world order by strengthening its navy, air force and army.
