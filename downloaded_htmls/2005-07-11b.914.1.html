These subjects were chosen because they represent huge problems for the world which require concerted action by the international community. Africa is the only continent which, without change, will not meet any of the millennium development goals. Although there are success stories in Africa, 4 million children under five die in Africa every year; 3,000 children die a day from malaria; 50 million African children do not go to primary school. Life expectancy is plummeting. By 2010, it will be down to just 27 years in some countries, so Africa is an immediate moral cause which commands our attention.</p> <p pid="b.907.5/4">"Climate change is perhaps the most long-term serious threat to our environment. Already, sea ice in the Arctic has shrunk by 1 million square kilometres. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_10">The 10</a> hottest years on record have all occurred since 1991. Sea levels are rising. Until now, however, the international community has been divided, with no agreement on the nature or urgency of the problem, what to do about it, or how to start a discussion which would involve both the United States and the key emerging economies such as India and China.</p> <p pid="b.907.5/5">"On Africa, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_for_Africa">Commission for Africa</a>, which I established last year, set out a comprehensive plan for dealing with the continent's problems.</p> <p pid="b.907.5/6">"At Gleneagles, we agreed a doubling of aid for Africa&#8212;that is an extra $25 billion a year by 2010&#8212;as part of an overall increase of $50 billion for all developing countries, which will start to flow immediately. This was made possible by a series of new pledges by G8 partners in the weeks before the summit, notably the European Union's aid increase of an extra $38 billion, the American and Canadian decisions to double aid to Africa, and Japan's pledge of an additional $10 billion over the next five years.</p> <p pid="b.907.5/7">"This is a mighty achievement, not just for the summit but for the millions of decent people worldwide who have campaigned so long and hard. I would like to thank not only fellow leaders but my <a href="/glossary/?gl=172" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to another MP of..." class="glossary">right honourable friend</a> the development secretary and, most particularly, my <a href="/glossary/?gl=214" title="Right Honourable is a form of address used within the House of Commons, for..." class="glossary">right honourable</a> friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> for their work in securing this.</p> <p pid="b.907.5/8">"In addition, again thanks to the work of my right <a href="/glossary/?gl=173" title="When speaking in the House of Commons, an MP will refer to an MP of the..." class="glossary">honourable friend</a> the <a href="/glossary/?gl=99" title="The chancellor of the exchequer is the government's chief financial..." class="glossary">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, we agreed to cancel 100 per cent of the multilateral debts of the highly indebted poor countries. This could amount to a total of $55 billion of relief. We also agreed a special package of debt cancellation for Nigeria, worth around $17 billion.</p> <p pid="b.907.5/9">"The G8 put particular emphasis on health and education in Africa. We agreed free primary education and basic healthcare for all. We agreed specific measures: on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV">HIV</a>/Aids, to provide as close as possible to universal access to treatment by 2010; on malaria, to reach 85 per cent of the vulnerable with bed nets and drugs in order to save 600,000 children's lives a year by 2015; on polio, the UK has agreed the funding to eradicate polio this year, and the G8 has agreed to ensure that the programme is fully funded in the years ahead.</p> <p pid="b.907.5/10">"But this help will not make a difference unless we also take action to end conflict and create conditions of stability. That means, above all, supporting the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union">African Union</a>'s ability to deploy its forces to prevent and resolve conflicts. We confirmed our commitment to train and equip 75,000 troops by 2010, mainly for Africa, including for the 20,000-strong <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AU">AU</a> standby force.</p> <p pid="b.907.5/11">"On trade, we agreed that we should establish a credible end date for agricultural export subsidies. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_British_Government">The British Government</a> want the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> world trade ministerial meeting to agree an end date of 2010&#8212;and I believe, on the basis of my discussions last week, that this is possible. We also agreed at Gleneagles concrete measures to build Africa's capacity to trade, and recognised poor countries' need to determine their own economic and trade policies.</p> <p pid="b.907.5/12">"This was the most detailed and ambitious package for Africa ever agreed by the G8. However, none of it can be implemented or improve the lives of African citizens without significant improvements in standards of governance, transparency and accountability. This is a partnership, not an act of charity. In the end, only Africans can lead and shape Africa. We can help, but every government in Africa that betrays the principles of good governance betrays Africa. The G8 unanimously deplored recent events in Zimbabwe. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Secretary-General">UN Secretary-General</a> told us that his envoy will report back to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</a>, and will do so within days.</p> <p pid="b.907.5/13">"This summit, of itself, cannot end poverty in Africa; but it should mark a turning point. I pay tribute to the organisations around the world that care passionately about Africa, and made their voice heard to the G8 leaders in the run-up to Gleneagles. It was a remarkable and brilliantly led campaign by people who have long demonstrated their commitment, and I particularly praise the contribution of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_Poverty_History">Make Poverty History</a> and the organisers of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live8">Live8</a>. Faith groups, schools, businesses and many millions of concerned people attached to no formal organisation made their demands, protested for them reasonably and gave political leaders the support they needed to turn a campaign into victory.</p> <p pid="b.907.5/14">"In respect of climate change, our discussion included the leaders of China, India, Brazil, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a> and Mexico. We were able here to do four things.</p> <p pid="b.907.5/15">"First, we agreed that climate change was indeed a problem, with human activity contributing to it. Secondly, that we had to tackle it with urgency. Thirdly, that in order to do that, we have to slow down, stop and in time reverse greenhouse gas emissions. Gleneagles adopted an action plan to exploit cleaner technologies which meet our energy needs and safeguard the climate, including measures to develop technologies such as bio-energy and cleaner coal, to promote energy efficiency, and measures to finance investment in clean technologies in emerging economies.</p> <p pid="b.907.5/16">"Fourthly, we put in place a new dialogue involving the G8, the emerging economies and the key international institutions. The purpose of this is to create a pathway to a post-Kyoto agreement, so that, when Kyoto expires after 2012, the world can act with unity. The new dialogue between the G8, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G5">G5</a> and others will have its first meeting in the United Kingdom in November.</p> <p pid="b.907.5/17">"The G8 also gave its strong support to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East">Middle East</a> peace process, and pledged its support to a package of assistance worth up to $3 billion a year to Palestine. We gave warm backing to the mission of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Wolfensohn">Jim Wolfensohn</a>, the quartet's envoy for disengagement, who reported to us at the summit. I continue to think that progress in the Middle East between Israelis and Palestinians is an enormous part of creating a fairer and more secure world.</p> <p pid="b.907.5/18">"Inevitably, some will be disappointed with aspects of the G8 Summit. But, on any realistic basis, on the two hardest issues on the international agenda there was progress&#8212;in the case of Africa, immense progress. We now have to build on this, using our presidency at the UN Summit in September and the Hong Kong ministerial meeting on trade in December.</p> <p pid="b.907.5/19">"Of course, the task is now to implement what has been agreed, but assume we can. If so, millions of children will not die when otherwise they would have. Africa will change its destiny from one of decline to advance. The values of democracy, freedom and the rule of law will be strengthened further still. And on the environment, if we can implement what has been agreed, today's largest economy can achieve agreement with the largest economies of tomorrow to get the framework, technology and policy in place to reverse the threat of global warming. Such progress, if achieved, would be the most poignant and powerful riposte to the forces of terrorism."</p> <p pid="b.907.5/20">My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.910.0/1">My Lords, the whole House will be grateful to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for repeating the Statement.</p> <p pid="b.910.0/2">A few weeks ago we were told that this was to be a summit of historic dimensions. The fact that it was relegated to the inner pages may have been the result of an appalling tragedy, but it may also prove to be a more realistic assessment of the outcome. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> is to be congratulated on his energy, and we welcome some of the modest conclusions, but the summit fell far short of addressing the real issues that need to be addressed.</p> <p pid="b.910.0/3">I increasingly sense that there is a tendency to think in tramlines on this issue, when there is a growing cause for an urgent reappraisal of our approaches, from renewed investment in nuclear power to the advancement of carbon-free technologies and, as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Government">US Government</a> have rightly argued, growing investment in cleaner use of existing technologies.</p> <p pid="b.910.0/4">On climate change, there is perhaps more room for debate than the zealots on both sides admit. The noble Lord, Lord May, said the summit was a "disappointing failure". With respect, I do not agree with him, but, on the other hand, I cannot agree with the over-hyped response of some of the government briefing, that the conference was a triumph.</p> <p pid="b.910.0/5">Has the Minister had an opportunity to see the outstanding report by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Affairs_Committee">Economic Affairs Committee</a> on the economics of climate change? Its conclusions are blunt, original and compelling. I hope she can find time to schedule a full government response and a debate on this report before the next discussion on climate change by the G8 and its associate forums.</p> <p pid="b.910.0/6">What is the Government's policy on nuclear power? Is it true that even the Prime Minister's strategy adviser, the noble Lord, Lord Birt, is urging renewed commitment to this technology? While on nuclear power, what was the G8's latest assessment of the nuclear programmes of Iran and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea">North Korea</a>, and what new action was agreed?</p> <p pid="b.910.0/7">On parts of the summit concerning Africa, I warmly welcome the commitment to action on malaria and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV">HIV</a>/<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS">AIDS</a>. Is there any question of renewing the use of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT">DDT</a> in the fight against malaria?</p> <p pid="b.910.0/8">I note the further pledges on aid and debt relief. They answered a widespread call, are well-intentioned and may well assist many. But how can we ensure that debt relief and aid will benefit the African people and not corrupt regimes? What monitoring will be done, and by whom? Will this and other initiatives be limited to Africa? Do the Government consider that there is a comparable problem of poverty in parts of Asia and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America">Latin America</a>?</p> <p pid="b.910.0/9">I was less pleased with those aspects of the communiqu&#233; that covered free trade. That is surely a major part of the solution to the difficulties of Africa and indeed parts of Latin America. Subsidies and protectionism by the developed world to protect the developed world have no place in any rational programme to help Africa, as the Prime Minister appeared to be recognising. Yet the commitments in the conclusions are thin gruel indeed. What is the so-called "credible end date" by which trade and agricultural goods will be opened, as pledged in the communiqu&#233;? Did the Prime Minister take his campaign against the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP">CAP</a> into that wider forum, and was <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Chirac">President Chirac</a> isolated in those talks?</p> <p pid="b.910.0/10">I welcome the common reaffirmation by the African leaders to strengthen democratic institutions and to pursue a policy of zero tolerance of corruption. I wonder whether that includes the corrupt dictatorship of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Mugabe">Mr Mugabe</a>. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Mbeki">President Mbeki</a> was there. What specific actions did he pledge against Mugabe? Did they include the freezing of the movement of assets by Mugabe's henchmen? The noble Baroness will no doubt have shared my astonishment that the communiqu&#233; even mentioned Zimbabwe. This is nearly the twentieth Statement that I have taken following an EU or G8 Summit and called for action on the Zimbabwe tyranny. Finally, we have a few words calling on the Zimbabwean authorities, as the communiqu&#233; puts it, to address the situation that they have created. We are long past the days when any faith can be put in the Zimbabwean authorities to address any misery. This is an African disaster and Africa must assist in finding the solution.</p> <p pid="b.910.0/11">The recent tragic history of parts of Africa has all too much to do with bad government, wickedness and the exploitation of African by African. In the last generations, the giant populations of the Indian subcontinent and of China have been steadily lifted from poverty by their own exertions, by stable government, and by peace. Africa needs able leadership in politics, public service, the professions and health, whereas far too many people are being drawn away to careers in other continents. We must sustain that leadership wherever it is given and challenge it wherever it is wanting. That will want clear-headedness as well as idealism inside Africa and outside. We must not fail in that task.</p>            </div>

While she was speaking I tried to obtain a copy from the Printed Paper Office, but I was told that it was not available. I suspect that the discussions are continuing in <a href="/glossary/?gl=112" title="During a debate members of the House of Commons traditionally refer to the..." class="glossary">another place</a>, but it would have been helpful to understand some of the figures that she mentioned in the Statement she repeated.</p> <p pid="b.912.0/2">I offer our thanks to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> for focusing the G8 Summit on two issues&#8212;Africa and climate change. The contrast between what the world leaders were trying to achieve at Gleneagles and the events in London on Thursday could not have been more sharply drawn. Does the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> agree that the agreements made by the G8 countries at Gleneagles will be judged not by the promises made but by the outcome of the promises kept? It would be helpful to know what mechanism exists to ensure that all G8 members fulfil the pledges that they have made. Are there adequate systems of monitoring on the basis of which some conclusions can be reached?</p> <p pid="b.912.0/3">Does the Minister agree that the success of the initiatives relies to a great extent on the willingness of African leaders to take this opportunity to improve the lives of their citizens, root out corruption and improve governance? How much of the &#163;50 billion increase by 2010 is new money? Will our share be drawn from DfID's existing budget or is it supplementary to it?</p> <p pid="b.912.0/4">We welcome the $3 billion aid to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority">Palestinian Authority</a>. The two-state solution will require the authority to tackle the problems of its people and terrorism and to root out corruption.</p> <p pid="b.912.0/5">On trade and the elimination of subsidies, there is clearly a long way to go. There is a lot of disappointment on environmental issues. There is an impression that a potential deal has been watered down to get the US onboard. What we need is a country-based, target-based successor to Kyoto. Were any specific steps agreed to reduce emissions? Overall, this is a move forward, but there is still a long way to go.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b.912.1/1">My Lords, I should like first to apologise to the House and to the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, if the Statement was not available. I understand that the policy is that the Statement is not made available until the person giving it has actually sat down. It may be that we started slightly too early. My apologies for that.</p> <p pid="b.912.1/2">The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, called the conclusions of this G8 Summit "modest". I really cannot agree. The conclusions of this G8 Summit on Africa are unprecedented. Only a few weeks ago, with the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> having set the bar so high, some said that we would fail to achieve the doubling of aid for which we were looking. We have achieved a doubling of aid to Africa. Until now, the debt relief initiative has been focused on the debts owed to other countries. This goes much further than that, dealing with the debt owed to multilateral institutions such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank">World Bank</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa_Development_Bank">Africa Development Bank</a>. It is a major step forward and it is important that the House recognise that.</p> <p pid="b.912.1/3">I watched the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>'s statement at the press conference post the summit. He made it clear that, on climate change and on trade, he would have liked the summit to go further. He was absolutely clear about that. But he was also realistic about what could be achieved with the eight leaders around the table.</p> <p pid="b.912.1/4">I say to the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, that there is a plan of action on climate change that covers measures to transform the way in which we use energy, including driving down transport emissions, cutting emissions in energy-intensive sectors, and cleaner appliances; measures to promote cleaner power generation, including cleaner fossil fuels and a new bio-energy partnership; measures to promote cooperation in research and development between the G8 and major emerging economies, including research networks; and measures to finance the transition to cleaner energy as well as measures to manage the impact of climate change and measures on illegal logging. It is a comprehensive action plan. This was never intended to be a summit where targets were renegotiated or new targets put in place.</p> <p pid="b.912.1/5">On trade, noble Lords will know from all the discussions we have had in this House that the UK would like to see much faster progress on ending subsidies not only within the European Union but in the world's other rich countries. In fact, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party">Labour Party</a> made a commitment in its manifesto to working for an end date of 2010. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a>, as a result of the discussions at Gleneagles, hopes that that will be the credible end date agreed at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> ministerial meeting in December.</p> <p pid="b.912.1/6">On Zimbabwe, we are of course waiting for the report from the UN envoy which will be made to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council">UN Security Council</a>. The one thing on which I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, regarding Zimbabwe was his comment that Africa must assist in finding the solution. That has always been my position across this <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a>; it has clearly taken him a long time to agree, but I am delighted that he has finally agreed.</p> <p pid="b.912.1/7">I also agree with the noble Lord that African countries need able leadership. Although I recognise the major challenges and difficulties facing the continent, I for one have been pleased to see the progress in many countries over the past few years. Recent examples of the fight against corruption include Nigeria and Rwanda. There has been a shift to increasing stability and democracy in many countries.</p> <p pid="b.912.1/8">The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, is right that the agreements made at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8_Summit_in_Gleneagles">G8 Summit in Gleneagles</a> will be judged by the outcomes and implementation. That is why there was so much stress on implementation.</p> <p pid="b.912.1/9">I was asked about the proportion of new money. We set out to seek a doubling in the aid to developing countries, with half of that going to Africa. We have achieved a doubling of that aid, with a commitment to half of it going to Africa. The proportion of that that will be new will depend on the starting point of each country that has made the commitment.</p> <p pid="b.912.1/10">I entirely agree with the noble Lord that we have a long way to go on trade, but it is also important that we remember that the European Union, in terms of market access, has the "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_But_Arms">Everything But Arms</a>" initiative. It means that the least developed countries have access to the European Union market on everything but arms.</p>            </div>

She quoted what was decided at the G8. Since the country is now in a state of near collapse, what degree of urgency was given in the G8 to the need for an immediate report? As far as I remember, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan">Kofi Annan</a>'s envoy has been there for over two weeks. The noble Baroness has spoken about a UN summit in September. I doubt whether the country can wait until September.</p> <p pid="b.915.4/2">I should also like to ask whether the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AU">AU</a> said anything about its envoy from its own <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Commission">Human Rights Commission</a> who was supposed to have gone to Zimbabwe and report. I do not know whether he has done so and, if he did, whether that was discussed at the G8. I would like to be assured that there was a real sense of the desperate urgency of action. We cannot wait until some meeting in September.</p>            </div>

The perception, not only in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a> and Zimbabwe but in many other African countries, is that on the question of land reform very little was said to support black Zimbabweans when their land was taken away.
