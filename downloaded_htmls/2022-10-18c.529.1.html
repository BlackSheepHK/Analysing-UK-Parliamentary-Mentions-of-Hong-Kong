I understand that Greater Manchester police have launched an investigation to establish the facts of the incident.</p> <p pid="c529.2/3">The Foreign Secretary has issued a summons to the Chinese charg&#233; d&#8217;affaires at the Chinese embassy in London to express His Majesty&#8217;s Government&#8217;s deep concern at the incident and to demand an explanation for the actions of the consulate staff. It would be inappropriate to go into further detail until the investigation has concluded, but let me be clear that, as this House has always recognised, peaceful protest is a fundamental part of British society and our way of life. All those on our soil have the right to express their views peacefully without fear of violence. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCDO">FCDO</a> officials expressed that clearly to the Chinese embassy yesterday. We will continue to work with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> and Greater Manchester police colleagues to decide on appropriate next steps.</p>            </div>

What we saw was the Chinese consul-general then ripping down posters during a peaceful protest. There soon followed grievous bodily harm against <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kongers">Hong Kongers</a>, one of whom was hospitalised for taking part in that peaceful protest. Some were then dragged on to consulate territory for a further beating by officials who have been recognised to be members of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist">Chinese Communist</a> party. We cannot allow the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCP">CCP</a> to import its beating of protesters and silencing of free speech, and its utter failure time and again to allow protest on British soil.</p> <p pid="c529.3/3">This is a chilling escalation. We have seen continued persecution of the Uyghur, Tibetans, Hong Kongers and all those who come to our country to seek refuge. What took place on Sunday suggests they cannot seek refuge here and have their voices heard, and our job is to make sure their voices are not silenced.</p> <p pid="c529.3/4">I am grateful to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for confirming that the ambassador has been summoned. I am surprised the meeting has not taken place so far. Will he please confirm when it will be taking place and that he will update the House thereafter? Will he also confirm that any Chinese official involved in the beatings will be prosecuted and that, if they cannot be prosecuted, they will be expelled from this country within the week, and what the Government are doing to protect protests? That is a fundamental right and we must uphold it at home if we are to have any chance of upholding it abroad.</p>            </div>

The sight of suspected Chinese consular officials destroying posters, using violence and intimidation, and dragging a protester into the grounds of the consulate and assaulting him is deeply shocking. We all want to be clear that that behaviour is not and never will be acceptable and deserves condemnation in the strongest possible terms. We simply cannot tolerate the type of action we have seen. The principle of free expression is so important, as is the protection of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kongers">Hong Kongers</a> and others who have fled Beijing&#8217;s repression, although I note with irony that later today we will be debating a Government Bill that discusses some of the same themes.</p> <p pid="c530.2/3">Labour has been consistently warning about the need to protect newly arrived Hong Kong people. May I press the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> on what exactly will happen to consular officials who have been properly identified as involved in this incident? Can this House expect that they will be expelled from the UK?</p> <p pid="c530.2/4">What discussions has the Minister had with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> and Levelling Up Secretaries on a proper plan for robust and extensive support for Hong Kong people across the country to ensure that they are protected and supported in the face of ongoing surveillance and oppression? What steps will he take to ensure that the sanctity of our freedoms&#8212;specifically, the freedom of expression&#8212;is protected outside all foreign embassies and consulate grounds in the UK to avoid a repeat of  this shocking behaviour? Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, as you said yesterday, the Hong Kong community in the UK is watching, and actions must match words.</p>            </div>

I also congratulate you, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, on pursuing it, quite rightly.

He confirms categorically that the guards at the gate hauled him in, tore his hands and his hair, and beat him. He said that at least four people were kicking him and, for one minute at least, tearing his hair. He said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c531.1/3" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;My head, face, arm, body and back are hurt&#8212;especially my back. It is very painful.&#8221;</p> <p pid="c531.1/4">He said that he struggles at the moment even to sit down. That is happening on British soil.

Friend: has the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> not just called on the charg&#233; d&#8217;affaires but hauled in the ambassador directly to see him?

The point of constructive engagement is to do what we can to retain China&#8217;s respect for the international rules-based order, while also noting and concerting with allies to exercise influence where we can on any breaches in that area. He is absolutely right to point that out. Let me say one other quick thing. The many overlapping areas in which we and our allies interact with China require a nuanced and constructive approach, but the point about doubling down is absolutely right. Let me remind him that although the integrated review is not about any specific country or region, it is going through a refresh at the moment, and it will take account of emerging, current and expected future threats.</p>            </div>

We have extended that, in part in response to concerns in this House, via an <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> to be tabled today, to the adult children of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a>-eligible people, so that they, too, can feel that warm welcome we should be extending to those people.</p>            </div>

Gentleman asks whether action will follow &#8220;if&#8221; what he sets out is found to be the case. I am not going to comment on a hypothetical, but he is right to recognise that there has to be a process of determination before any action can follow. Let me say one other thing that relates to the point raised earlier about the rule of law, human rights, freedom and democracy. There is an ideological clash here and we should be aware of it. We should not be shy in recognising it and we should do what we can to insist on the importance of the rules-based order that we have always stood for as a nation. We should encourage allies to be talking in those terms, rather than to be ceding ideological ground, whoever may be on the other side of the argument&#8212;there are various parts of the world in which different arguments are being made against this. That is ultimately the core of what this institution of Parliament is about.</p>            </div>

But even before these incredibly worrying scenes that we have all seen, concerns were being raised in both the British and Irish press about an informal network of Chinese overseas police service stations. Constituents of mine who are deeply worried about that have contacted me and asked me to seek ministerial action on it. Will the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> confirm that there is no legal standing for such organisations?

So when we express anger as individuals, as parliamentarians and as concerned citizens about this, that is, in part, what we have a concern about. I do not think, however things may appear in the short term, that this is a question in this country. We will pursue this situation and these people according to the rule of law, and we will follow up on that basis.</p>            </div>

That process is continuing and when we have the answer to that, we will take action. That is entirely appropriate.

Gentleman will know that there are plenty of ways in which this country has economic relationships with Chinese companies. In the normal course of trade, that has been to mutual benefit, but he is right that there is a need for concern about where there may be infiltration, coercion and the rest of it.
