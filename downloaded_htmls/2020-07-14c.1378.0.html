During this period of global crisis, it has brought home the profound importance of a reliable connection. The 4G technology has enabled rapid internet connection over mobile phones: alongside superfast broadband at home, it has allowed people to do everything from Zoom calls to downloading movies. But the Government need to look to the future. That means developing world-class, next-generation digital technology through 5G for mobile and gigabit-capable for fibre. It is only by doing this that we will remain at the forefront of the technology revolution.</p> <p pid="c1375.1/2">In order to realise the full benefits of those technologies though, we have to have confidence in the security and resilience of the infrastructure on which they are built. Keeping the country secure is the primary duty of Government to their people. This consideration precedes all others. There is, of course, no such thing as a perfectly secure network, but the responsibility of the Government is to ensure that it is as secure as it possibly can be. That is why we conducted the telecoms supply chain review to look at the long-term security of our 5G and full-fibre networks.</p> <p pid="c1375.1/3">The review set out plans to implement one of the toughest regimes in the world for telecoms security: one that would shift from a model where the telecoms industry merely follows guidance to a model where standards would be enforced by legislation; one that would require all operators to raise security standards and combat a range of threats, whether from cybercriminals or state-sponsored attacks; and one that gave the Government the necessary powers to keep our approach up to date as the technology develops.</p> <p pid="c1375.1/4">A critical aspect of that was how we address so-called high-risk vendors&#8212;those which pose greater security and resilience risks to the UK&#8217;s networks&#8212;so in January we set out to the House our conclusions on how we would define and restrict high-risk vendors, keeping them outside the network&#8217;s core and away from critical infrastructure and sites. We have been clear-eyed from the start that Chinese-owned vendors Huawei and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZTE">ZTE</a> were deemed high risk, and we made clear that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cyber_Security_Centre">National Cyber Security Centre</a> would review and update its advice as necessary.</p> <p pid="c1375.1/5">Clearly, since January, the situation has changed. On <phrase class="date" code="2020-05-15">15 May</phrase>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Department_of_Commerce">US Department of Commerce</a> announced that new sanctions had been imposed against Huawei through changes to the foreign direct product rules. This was a significant material change, and one that we had to take into consideration. The sanctions are not the first attempt by the US to restrict Huawei&#8217;s ability to supply equipment to 5G networks. They are, however, the first to have potentially severe impacts on Huawei&#8217;s ability to supply new equipment in the United Kingdom. The new US measures restrict Huawei&#8217;s ability to produce important products using US technology or software.</p> <p pid="c1375.1/6">The National Cyber Security Centre has reviewed the consequences of the US actions and has now reported to Ministers that it has significantly changed its security assessment of Huawei&#8217;s presence in the UK&#8217;s 5G network. Given the uncertainty that this creates around Huawei&#8217;s  supply chain, the UK can no longer be confident of being able to guarantee the security of future 5G equipment affected by the change in US foreign direct product rules. To manage the risk, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSC">NCSC</a> has issued new advice on the use of Huawei in UK telecoms networks.</p> <p pid="c1375.1/7">This morning, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> chaired a meeting of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Council">National Security Council</a>. Attendees at that meeting took full account of the National Cyber Security Centre&#8217;s advice, together with the implications for UK industry and wider geostrategic considerations. The Government agree with the National Cyber Security Centre&#8217;s advice: the best way to secure our networks is for operators to stop using new affected Huawei equipment to build the UK&#8217;s future 5G networks. To be clear: from the end of this year, telecoms operators must not buy any 5G equipment from Huawei. Once the telecoms security Bill is passed, it will be illegal for them to do so.</p> <p pid="c1375.1/8">However, we also recognise the range of concerns voiced in the House regarding Huawei&#8217;s role in our 5G network. I have listened carefully to those concerns, and I agree that we need clarity on our position and to take decisive action. I have previously set out our plans to safely manage the presence of high-risk vendors in our 5G network, and of course our ambition right from the beginning was that no one should need to use a high-risk vendor for 5G at all, but I know that hon. Members sought a commitment from the Government to remove Huawei equipment from our 5G network altogether. That is why we have concluded that it is necessary, and indeed prudent, to commit to a timetable for the removal of Huawei equipment from our 5G network by 2027. Let me be clear: this requirement will be set out in law by the telecoms security Bill. By the time of the next election, we will have implemented in law an irreversible path for the complete removal of Huawei equipment from our 5G networks.</p> <p pid="c1375.1/9">We have not taken this decision lightly, and I must be frank about the decision&#8217;s consequences for every <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a> in this country. This will delay our roll-out of 5G. Our decisions in January had already set back that roll-out by a year and cost up to &#163;1 billion. Today&#8217;s decision to ban the procurement of new Huawei 5G equipment from the end of this year will delay that roll-out by a further year and will add up to &#163;500 million to costs. In addition, requiring operators to remove Huawei equipment from their 5G networks by 2027 will add further hundreds of millions of pounds to the cost and will further delay the roll-out. That means a cumulative delay to 5G roll-out of two to three years, and costs of up to &#163;2 billion. That will have real consequences for the connections on which all our constituents rely.</p> <p pid="c1375.1/10">I have to say that to go faster and further beyond the 2027 target would add considerable, and indeed unnecessary, further costs and delays.</p> <p pid="c1375.1/11">The shorter we make the timetable for removal, the greater the risk of actual disruption to mobile telephone networks.</p> <p pid="c1375.1/12">The world-leading expertise of NCSC and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCHQ">GCHQ</a> has enabled us to publish one of the most detailed analyses of the risks to the 5G network. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> is now acting quickly, decisively and ahead of our international partners. Our approach reflects the UK&#8217;s specific national circumstances and how the risks from the sanctions are manifested here in the UK. It has not been an easy decision, but it is the right one for the UK&#8217;s telecoms networks, for our national security and for our economy, both now and in the long run.</p> <p pid="c1375.1/13">We also need to look at other networks. Although they are fundamentally different from 5G, they need to be as secure and resilient as our new mobile technology, as many Members of this House have pointed out in the past. Reflecting again the advice of the National Cyber Security Centre, we will need to take a different approach to full-fibre and older networks&#8212;one that recognises they are different from 5G in their technology, security and the vendors supporting them. Given that there is only one other appropriate scale vendor for full-fibre equipment, we will embark on a short technical consultation with operators to understand their supply chain alternatives so that we can avoid unnecessary delays to our gigabit ambitions and prevent significant resilience risks. That technical consultation will determine the nature of our rigorous approach to Huawei outside of the 5G networks.</p> <p pid="c1375.1/14">All of those things have implications for the telecoms security Bill. I am fully aware of the commitment I made in this House in March to introduce it before the summer recess. As I am sure Members will appreciate, today&#8217;s decision will substantially change what is in the Bill. We will introduce the Bill to the House in the autumn. It is in all our interests for the legislation to be introduced and passed as soon as possible, because&#8212;this is the key point&#8212;we have to ensure that our telecoms security advice is on a secure statutory footing.</p> <p pid="c1375.1/15">As the House knows, one reason we are in this situation is a global market failure. Put simply, countries around the world&#8212;not just the United Kingdom&#8212;have become dangerously reliant on too few vendors. We have already set out a clear and ambitious diversification strategy. That strategy will include wide-ranging action in the short, medium and long term, with the aim of driving competition and innovation to grow the market and deliver greater resilience across all our networks.</p> <p pid="c1375.1/16">The strategy will focus on three core elements. First, we need to secure the supply chains of our incumbent non-high-risk vendors by putting in place measures and mitigations that will protect supply chains and ensure there is no disruption to our networks. Secondly, we need to bring new scale vendors into the UK market by removing barriers to entry, providing commercial incentives and creating large-scale opportunities for new vendors to enter the UK markets. Thirdly, we need to address the existing structure of the supply market by investing in research and development and building partnerships between operators and vendors that will mean operators using multiple vendors in a single network will become the standard across the industry.</p> <p pid="c1375.1/17">Success will require a shared commitment between Government and industry to take the necessary steps to address this issue. We are already engaging extensively with operators, vendors and Governments around the world to support and accelerate the process of diversification. We recognise that this is a global issue that requires international collaboration to deliver a lasting solution, so we are working with our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a> partners and our friends around the world to bring together a coalition to deliver our shared goals.</p> <p pid="c1375.1/18">In addition, I know that many Members of this House have considered the Government&#8217;s policy on high-risk vendors in the context of the United Kingdom&#8217;s wider relationship with China. Let me assure Members that this Government are clear-eyed about China. We have  been robust in our response to the imposition of new security <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, including through our generous offer to British national overseas passport holders. We want a modern and mature relationship with China based on mutual respect where we can speak frankly when we disagree, but also work side-by-side on the issues where our interests converge. Today&#8217;s decision, however, is about ensuring the long-term security of our telecoms network, specifically in the light of those new US sanctions.</p> <p pid="c1375.1/19">The security and resilience of our telecoms networks is of paramount importance. We have never compromised, and will never compromise, that security in pursuit of economic prosperity. It is a fact that the US has introduced additional sanctions on Huawei, and as the facts have changed, so has our approach. That is why we have taken the decision that there can be no new Huawei equipment from the end of this year, and set out a clear timetable to exclude Huawei completely by 2027, with an irreversible path implemented by the time of the next election. Telecoms providers will be legally required to implement this by the telecoms security Bill, which we will bring before the House shortly. This important decision secures our networks now and lays the foundations for a world-class telecoms security framework in the future. I commend this statement to the House.</p>            </div>

All sides of the House agree that the first duty of any Government is to protect their citizens, and we have confidence in our national security services, which go to such lengths to keep us safe. It has been clear for some time that there are serious questions over whether Huawei should be allowed to control large sections of our country&#8217;s telecoms networks, yet the Government refused to face reality. Their approach to our 5G capability, Huawei and our national security has been incomprehensibly negligent. The current <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Secretary">Education Secretary</a> was sacked as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Secretary">Defence Secretary</a> for leaking parts of the security services&#8217; advice on Huawei, yet the Government went on to ignore large parts of it. In January, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> said in a statement to the House that the Government would legislate at &#8220;the earliest opportunity&#8221; on high-risk vendors. They then refused to work with us and their own <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Benchers">Back Benchers</a> to enable that to happen. Will the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> tell us when he will bring forward the legislation on high-risk vendors, including the robust regulatory and enforcement powers required to limit or eliminate their part in our network? &#8220;As soon as possible&#8221; and &#8220;shortly&#8221; will not wash any more.</p> <p pid="c1378.0/2">Will the Government publish the security advice on which today&#8217;s decision has been taken? What new information have they been given that was not available to them when the initial decisions were made? I would also like to ask the Secretary of State what discussions he has had with the Foreign Secretary and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Secretary">Trade Secretary</a> on likely retaliation. Where else are we dependent on Chinese suppliers&#8212;for example, in our nuclear sector&#8212;and how are we working with our democratic allies, including but not limited to the United States, to develop alternatives in these areas? <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State says that this change is being made in response to US sanctions, but in the past he has emphasised how closely  he was working with the United States, so were the sanctions a surprise? Is our security policy being led by the US? Did the very visible human rights violations by the Chinese in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> and against the Uyghurs play no part in the decision?</p> <p pid="c1378.0/3">The reality is that the original decision on Huawei was made because, over the past decade, this Government have failed to deliver a sustainable plan for our digital economy. Almost exactly a year ago, the &#8220;UK Telecoms Supply Chain Review Report&#8221; was published. It stated:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c1378.0/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;We will develop and pursue a diversification strategy&#8212;including by working with our international partners&#8212;to ensure a competitive, sustainable and diverse supply chain.&#8221;</p> <p pid="c1378.0/5">Now the Secretary of State claims to have set out a &#8220;clear and ambitious diversification strategy&#8221;. This will come as a surprise to anyone who has looked at the Government&#8217;s statements. I would like to ask the Secretary of State: what are the actions to implement the strategy&#8212;which has effectively been set out somewhere and which I have not seen&#8212;and can he tell me where it is set out?</p> <p pid="c1378.0/6">This is a car crash for our digital economy, but one that could have been visible from outer space. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT">BT</a> and other vendors have put the cost of this decision in the billions. The Secretary of State says &#163;2 billion. What is the basis for that estimate, and how will he ensure that the cost is not passed on to consumers? Today&#8217;s announcement refers to 5G, but what are the implications for our emergency services network&#8212;a saga even longer than this one, in which BT was planning to use Huawei?</p> <p pid="c1378.0/7">Open standards such as open RAN limit dependence on any one supplier; what is the Secretary of State doing to mandate such standards and open our networks to UK companies such as Cambridge company ip.access and the north-east company Filtronic? Crucially, what proportion of the additional money that is spent will go to UK companies and how many jobs will be created here? The Government recently announced a &#163;500 million investment in bankrupt American satellite broadband provider <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneWeb">OneWeb</a>; are similar investments planned for 5G or 6G companies?</p> <p pid="c1378.0/8">Labour has repeatedly offered constructive ideas to get the UK out of the Huawei hole; we have consistently argued to end our national dependence on all high-risk vendors and improve corporate responsibility for global supply chains. This entire saga has shown that the Government cannot sort this mess out on their own. We need a taskforce of industry representatives, academics, start-ups, regional governments and regulators to develop a plan that delivers a UK network capability and secure mobile network in the shortest possible timeframe. Will the Secretary of State commit to that and return to the House regularly to update on progress?</p> <p pid="c1378.0/9">Will the Secretary of State get a grip, get a plan and secure our critical communications infrastructure, our digital economy and our national security?</p>            </div>

Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25395" title="Our page on Matt Warman - 'the Member for Boston and Skegness (Matt Warman)'">Matt Warman</a>, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> with responsibility for digital infrastructure, who is sitting next to me, has had constructive discussions with them, and we are now at the stage of having engagement at a technical level with their officials.</p> <p pid="c1379.0/4">Of course the hon. Lady is entirely right to point to the future, which is an open RAN network. There is currently only one open RAN network in the world, and that is in Japan, and that was in a situation where it started the network from scratch. There are big barriers to doing this, but of course that is the objective we are working towards. That means working with our partners through international institutions to set the right common standards on which we can have an open RAN network, and it means working with the telecoms providers to provide the right incentives for them to switch from a single vendor to the open RAN network. But in the end an open RAN network is going to provide the opportunity for UK providers, alongside providers from other allies and other countries around the world, to start providing that telecoms infrastructure.</p> <p pid="c1379.0/5">I must say however that I find it extraordinary that the hon. Lady spoke for several minutes but still has not said whether she supports the decision; will she be backing it, yes or no? She says that we were negligent, but I would gently remind the hon. Lady that it was the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Government">Labour Government</a> that opened the door to Huawei in the first place; it is this Government who are closing it. It was the Labour party that left us reliant on a small number of suppliers; we are diversifying it. And indeed it was the Labour party, as late as 2018, which was advocating for high-risk vendors to be in the network; we have stopped that.</p>            </div>

When we debated this in January, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNP">SNP</a> Members warned the Government that Huawei could not be trusted with our 5G mobile network. Security experts were clear: we should not open up the central nervous system of our modern society to a company owned by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist">Chinese Communist</a> party. With that characteristic combination of error and overconfidence, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> opined that I had got my analysis wrong &#8220;on all counts&#8221;, but it seems not: less than six months later, we are witnessing yet another of the volte-faces that are fast becoming a hallmark of this Government. Small wonder, then, that Ministers and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Benchers">Back Benchers</a> are reluctant to be wheeled out in defence of a Government policy on Monday, knowing that they could be required to argue the polar opposite on Tuesday.</p> <p pid="c1381.0/2">Of course it is right that Huawei should be banned from the UK&#8217;s mobile networks, but that is a decision that should have been taken long ago. As I said to the Foreign Secretary in January, had the Government acted in 2018 as the Australians did, our mobile operators&#8217; 5G roll-out plans would have been in an infinitely healthier place. As it is, we will now pay the price for the Government&#8217;s ineptitude. We know it, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> knows it and increasingly restive <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> Back Benchers know it, so how was it that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> thought that China and Huawei could be trusted, or at least managed, in January, but not now in July? Was it that a Brexit Britain was too weak and isolated to upset the world&#8217;s second largest economic powerhouse, but that the Government have now been forced to acknowledge that they cannot sacrifice our national security even for Brexit?</p> <p pid="c1381.0/3">Countering the intelligence threat posed by China will require more than just the phase-out of Huawei. It will involve a rethink of our investment in native companies. We must now also work to protect our 999 emergency services network from the fall-out of this decision. Will the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> outline how exactly he will do so?</p> <p pid="c1381.0/4">We welcome this climbdown.

With all respect to the hon. Gentleman, I think that those organisations are probably a better source to rely on than he is. As a result of that advice, we were absolutely clear-eyed about the threat from Chinese vendors; that is why we deemed Huawei  and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZTE">ZTE</a> high-risk vendors, why we banned them from the core of the network, and why we imposed a cap and banned them from the most sensitive elements.</p> <p pid="c1381.1/2">It is, though, a fact that the United States has imposed sanctions on Huawei. The consequence of these sanctions, as we have been advised by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSC">NCSC</a>, is that we can no longer rely upon Huawei equipment. It is therefore in the security interests of the United Kingdom to ban any further use of that equipment by ruling out further purchases of it. That is the right thing to do in <a href="/glossary/?gl=247" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_interest" class="glossary">the national interest</a>. If the facts change, we change our policy, and that is exactly what we have done. We will then enshrine it in law through the telecoms security Bill.</p> <p pid="c1381.1/3">The hon. Gentleman talked about investment in other companies, and those are important points. We are addressing that through the national security and investment Bill, which will also come before the House. Throughout all this, we have been completely clear-eyed about the threat posed by Chinese companies and taken appropriate steps in relation to it.</p>            </div>

Along with the delay to 5G that he talked about, this reflects a long-term failure of UK telecoms strategy to anticipate what the country will need and to prepare for it. Is it still his view that, as he said in March, the UK can develop new supply chain capacity &#8220;in this Parliament&#8221;?

Friend for his support, but I think there are slightly separate questions about the timings and the issue of human rights abuses. He is absolutely right to raise the issue of human rights abuses, and that is something we are addressing through the modern slavery Bill. We should not be having any companies operating in the United Kingdom relying on slavery, so we have introduced the modern slavery Bill. Indeed, there is an <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> that will be considered in the Lords very shortly which deals precisely with that issue, and we are working with peers to address that.</p>            </div>

Member is absolutely right to raise the point about a digital divide, and that is something that my Department is working on extensively &#8212;for example, in ensuring that there is more handheld equipment and all those sorts of things for people who do not currently have mobile phone technology. We have invested a lot of money in relation to that.</p> <p pid="c1385.0/2">On his point about local authorities, our manifesto commitment set a highly ambitious target of full fibre roll-out by 2025, which is creating huge investment across the country. Indeed, a telecoms provider recently announced 10,000 new jobs. There is lots of potential for new jobs in this area.</p>            </div>

Friend is right to raise the point, which is the opportunity created by open RAN technology. It will take a very long time, were the UK minded to do so, to create a new mobile vendor like Ericsson, Nokia or indeed Huawei, but with open RAN we can get UK technologies into the provision of telecoms infrastructure, and that can sit alongside contributions  from other like-minded countries around the world. That is how we will create jobs and provide a long-lasting solution.</p>            </div>

He is absolutely right to distinguish between the people of China and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a>. China is a wonderful country; I have very much enjoyed visiting it on occasions in the past, and there are some very warm people there. The difference is the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China">Government of China</a> and some of the abuses, particularly of the rule of law and human rights, that we have seen there. In the context of telecommunications security, we have an opportunity to work with our allies. If we can develop this open RAN technology of the future, it will provide an opportunity not just to benefit us but to benefit them, and indeed to further secure our infrastructure and make it more resilient.</p>            </div>

What has changed here are the US sanctions, and, as a result of those sanctions, we can no longer rely on Huawei equipment.

I was listening to the &#8220;Today&#8221; programme the other day, and the head of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT">BT</a> said seven years, yes, but it could be done in five. Let us bring it forward to five, and make sure that it happens quickly. There is no reason why that cannot be done. The key point I want to make is that there are two contradictions in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a>&#8217;s statement. Having said that he is getting rid of Huawei in 5G, it is apparently fine for it to continue in 4G and 3G; it can go on for as long as anyone. It will be upgraded in software upgrades for the next decade. If it is a risk in 5G, why is it not a risk to us generally? Secondly, on human rights, we know that Huawei has lied in its declaration under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Slavery_Act_2015">Modern Slavery Act 2015</a> that it has had no involvement in slavery. We know that now from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_Province">Xinjiang Province</a>. If we can prove that and are able to demonstrate it to this Government, will this Government ban Huawei altogether?</p>            </div>

As I have said repeatedly, both previously and today, we would be   exceptionally naive to think that just by removing Huawei, we remove that risk. Sophisticated hostile state actors can of course infiltrate our networks. That is why we are toughening up considerably the security of our networks through the telecoms security Bill, and I think that is the correct approach.</p>            </div>

I genuinely understand the concerns about speed expressed by him and other Members. That point was considered extensively by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Council">National Security Council</a>, and in the end we made a balanced judgment. We believe that by having 2027 as the target, by the end of this Parliament we will have put in law an irreversible process for removal. The risk of going faster relates to the integrity of the network and the challenges in that respect. I would rather we got to a point where we had got it out completely by 2027, and I think that is a realistic timetable for doing so.</p>            </div>
