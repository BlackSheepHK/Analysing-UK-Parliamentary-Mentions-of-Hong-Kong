A full statement will be provided to the House in due course, once the facts have been fully established and the necessary investigative work completed.</p> <p pid="c1115.1/3">I know that everyone in this House and across the country will join me in expressing our profound sadness and deepest sympathies for everyone affected by this terrible event. I know they will also join me in offering our profound gratitude to those working on the search and rescue operation. That very much includes those who are responding to the incident. Commander Dan O&#8217;Mahoney and his team work tirelessly, with military colleagues and other partners, day in, day out, to try to prevent this type of tragedy. They are undertaking immensely difficult work and we should all be extremely grateful to them.</p> <p pid="c1115.1/4">These are the days we dread. Crossing the channel in unseaworthy vessels is a lethally dangerous endeavour, and it is for this reason, above all, that we are working so hard to destroy the business model of the people smugglers&#8212;the evil, organised criminals who treat human beings as cargo.</p> <p pid="c1115.1/5">As the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> told the House only yesterday:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c1115.1/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;It is not cruel or unkind to want to break the stranglehold of criminal gangs who trade in human misery and who exploit our system and <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a>.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2022-12-13">13 December</phrase> 2022; Vol. 724, c. 885.]</p> <p pid="c1115.1/7">He was right. This morning&#8217;s tragedy, like the loss of 27 people on one November day last year, is the most sobering reminder possible of why we have to end these crossings.</p> <p pid="c1115.1/8">We recently agreed the largest ever small boats deal with France, with more boots on the ground patrolling France&#8217;s beaches and with UK and French officers working together in both countries. The Calais group of northern European nations works to disrupt trafficking and smuggling all along the migration route and has set an ambition for a UK and EU-wide agreement on migration.</p> <p pid="c1115.1/9">Since 2015, we have welcomed 450,000 people here from across the world via safe and legal routes, making these dangerous crossings totally unnecessary, but it is evident that we have to go much further, which is why the Prime Minister announced a new package yesterday. The package includes a new, permanent, unified small boats operational command, bringing together the military,  civilian capabilities and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Crime_Agency">National Crime Agency</a>. It will co-ordinate intelligence, interception, processing and enforcement using advanced technology, including drones. We are adding more than 700 new staff and doubling the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCA">NCA</a>&#8217;s funding for tackling organised immigration crime in Europe.</p> <p pid="c1115.1/10"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> announced a new agreement with Albania yesterday. For the first time, Border Force officers will be embedded in Tirana airport, helping to disrupt organised crime groups and people smugglers who risk people&#8217;s lives unnecessarily. Early next year, we will introduce new legislation to make it unambiguously clear that someone who comes to the UK illegally should not be able to remain here. Instead, they can expect to be detained and swiftly returned either to their home country or to a safe country, where their claim for asylum will be considered. Late or spurious claims and appeals will not be possible, and once someone has been removed, they will have no right to re-entry, settlement or citizenship. This will act as a deterrent, and it will save lives.</p> <p pid="c1115.1/11">As we grip illegal migration, we will create more safe and legal routes, working with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> to identify those most in need, and we will introduce an annual quota set by Parliament. We will work closely with local authorities to determine capacity.</p> <p pid="c1115.1/12">It is not true that our capacity is limitless. We are already spending millions on hotels every day. People do not need to seek asylum if they are already in a safe country. It is vital&#8212;literally vital&#8212;that we end the illegal crossings of the channel. I commend this statement to the House.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="c1116.1/1">I thank the Home Secretary for advance sight of her statement.</p> <p pid="c1116.1/2">This is truly tragic, deeply distressing news. All our thoughts and prayers are with those who lost their lives, and with the families and friends who lost loved ones in the icy waters of the channel. We are also thinking of those who are receiving support and medical assistance, and who may have been rescued, too.</p> <p pid="c1116.1/3">We all give our thanks to the brave responders and rescuers from Border Force, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNLI">RNLI</a>, the coastguard, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOD">MOD</a>, our emergency services and the French authorities. Not only did they respond to today&#8217;s awful, awful tragedy, but they do such heroic work every single day. It is only because of their brave work that more lives have not been lost.</p> <p pid="c1116.1/4">It was barely more than a year ago that 27 lives were lost when a boat went down, and all of us have warned and all of us have feared that it was just a matter of time before more lives were lost. It is, of course, why the UK and France both need to act to stop these dangerous boat crossings. The brutal truth as well is that criminal gangs have made money from those lives that were lost today; they have profited as people have drowned. Day after day, week after week, criminal gangs are putting lives at risk for money. The other brutal truth is that, far from our stopping those criminal gangs, those gangs have grown and grown. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> and French Governments and authorities have failed to stop the criminal smuggler and trafficking gangs proliferating around the channel.  Those gangs have created a multimillion-pound criminal industry, with lives at stake, and the action against those gangs has been too weak. There have been barely any prosecutions or convictions, and barely any inroads into the smuggler gangs. We have seen just three convictions a month for people smuggling, at a time when tens of thousands of lives are being put at risk each month.</p> <p pid="c1116.1/5">That is why we have long called for a major boost to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Crime_Agency">National Crime Agency</a>, because we do need major action. Yesterday, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> announced an increase for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCA">NCA</a>. I am glad that he has made some progress on this, but will the Home Secretary clarify what it means in practice? How much additional funding will there be in practice for the NCA and specifically for the action on the smuggler gangs? How many additional full-time staff will there be? What is the sense of scale on this? I fear, still, that this is too low and too little, given the scale of the problem we face. Yesterday, the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> announced a small boats operational command? How different is that from the previous clandestine channel threat command, led by Commander Dan O&#8217;Mahoney, which has been operation for some time? Will it still be led by him or will it be led by somebody else? Will the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> or the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence">Ministry of Defence</a> be in charge? Is it correct to say that the Navy has been told that it will be standing down on <phrase class="date" code="2022-01-31">31 January</phrase>? Will the Home Secretary also update us on the French patrols and surveillance? Has the 40% promised increase in patrols started yet? When will it? Was this boat picked up as a result of increased surveillance? If it was not, what was the reason for that?</p> <p pid="c1116.1/6"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> has also referred to safe legal routes. She was pressed at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> on a lack of safe legal routes for children trying to unite with family in the UK. When will she be taking action to address that, to prevent children who are seeking to rejoin family in the UK from making desperate journeys? She referred also to the Prime Minister&#8217;s statement yesterday, so will she clarify something? We have also called for the fast track for safe countries and for the backlog to be cleared. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> said that he had set a personal target of 117,000 cases to be cleared by the end of next year. No. 10 later said that that target was 92,000. Will she again confirm which of those it is?</p> <p pid="c1116.1/7">The responsibility for the lives that have been lost in the channel lies with the criminal gangs. They need to be caught, prosecuted and jailed for the loss of life in the cold sea, and we need comprehensive action. We gathered in this House just over a year ago to lament the loss of 27 lives. None of us wants to do so again&#8212;none of us wants to be here again. That is why we need action, before more lives are lost in peril on the sea.</p>            </div>

It is a day to express gratitude to our hard-working emergency services, Border Force, search and rescue and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOD">MOD</a> colleagues who at this moment are conducting an operation in the channel, in very difficult and challenging circumstances.</p> <p pid="c1117.0/2">The right hon. Lady mentions a few points and I want to respond to some of them in detail. The small boats operational command is going to be a new operational command, which the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> announced yesterday,  as part of our plan to go further on our action to stop the boats crossing the channel. This means we are setting up a new headquarters, the small boats operational command, in Border Force, with military support for specialist planning and operational advice. As part of that, we will bring in new air and maritime capabilities, including new drones, land-based radar and fixed-wing aircraft, and we will more than double our current permanent staffing levels, with 100 new staff at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HQ">HQ</a> and more than 600 new operational staff based at Dover. This is a sign that we are strengthening our resolve, strengthening our will and strengthening our efforts to do whatever it takes&#8212;as the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> has pledged&#8212;to stop the boats crossing the channel. It will improve our intelligence and information sharing with the French, and will improve and build on the co-operation that we have with our partners in France.</p> <p pid="c1117.0/3">The deal that we signed last month with colleagues in France is a big step forward in our cross-channel co-operation, for we share a common challenge. That new arrangement will see more dangerous and unnecessary crossings being prevented. Last year our joint efforts prevented more than 23,000 unnecessary journeys, and this year, to date, the number is 31,000. That in itself is insufficient, but it is a step in the right direction, and the agreement that we have struck afresh with the French will go further to enhance our joint working.</p> <p pid="c1117.0/4">The right hon. Lady mentioned safe and legal routes. Since 2015 we have made it possible for 450,000 people to come here via safe and legal routes, and that is a record of which I am immensely proud. These are people who have come from countries such as Ukraine, Syria and Afghanistan. They are people who have come from all over the world, directly from places of danger&#8212;for instance via the UK resettlement scheme, under which people have been selected by the UN Refugee Agency from countries including Ethiopia, Iraq, Sudan, Eritrea, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen. We will extend safe and legal routes once we have dealt with the appalling people-smuggling gangs who are risking people&#8217;s lives, as we have seen this morning.</p> <p pid="c1117.0/5">The right hon. Lady talked about our track record on this issue. The Government will not stop until we have seen progress&#8212;until people understand that taking this lethal journey is not safe, is not lawful, and will not lead them to a better life in the United Kingdom. Millions of people around the world are fleeing conflict and poverty and seek a better life elsewhere, and our capacity in this country is not infinite. We cannot accept everyone who wishes to come here. That is a reality of the world and a reality of life, although the Labour party would suggest otherwise. I hope the right hon. Lady will join us in our strength and resolve to stop this problem by supporting our measures and supporting our legislation next year.</p>            </div>

Can the Home Secretary update the House on any progress that may be taking  place in discussions with her French counterparts that would persuade them either to intercept the boats if they get into the water and bring the passengers back to French land, from where they started, or, when they intercept people on the beaches who are about to get into the boats, ensure that they are arrested and detained rather than being set free and allowed to try again the following night?

The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality_and_Borders_Act_2022">Nationality and Borders Act 2022</a>, despite the rhetoric, has not proven to be the deterrent that the Home Secretary expected. Will she finally recognise that safe and legal routes are essential to allow people to get here safely, and that they should be expanded now, beyond the limited Afghan, Syrian, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> and Ukraine routes, not at some vague point in the future?</p> <p pid="c1119.1/4">If the Home Secretary truly wants to break the lucrative model of organised crime behind this, she should bring in Dubs and Dublin-style routes and allow people to apply from abroad and get on a plane rather than forcing them to get in a flimsy dinghy in the depths of winter. It is cruel to ignore the reality, and dangerous to keep repeating the same mistakes. People are paying not only with money, but with their lives. Will she listen to the evidence, and, instead of just talking tough, act to bring in safe and legal routes for everybody now, because sympathy is one thing, effective action another.</p>            </div>

That boat should not have been in the water in the first place, let alone in those kinds of conditions at this time of year.</p> <p pid="c1121.0/2">Could my right hon. and learned Friend consider having urgent discussions with the French and arranging that summit with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Macron">President Macron</a>? The bottom line is that, in this case, the boat, I understand, was around the median line in the channel, and this is the second time we have seen such a situation. It is time for joint patrols on the French beaches to stop the boats getting in the water in the first place, and a joint security zone across the channel to make sure that incidents like these cannot happen and that we bring the small boat crossings to an end.</p>            </div>

It is because they know that, until they are in the country, they cannot claim asylum. I know the Home Secretary is absolutely committed to ending this illegal trade, but let us start with family reunion: one of the reasons that people may want to not stay in France but come to the UK is that they have a family member here, as we would if our families were separated in that way.

Their cruel and callous sales pitch is that Britain is a soft touch and that, when people get here, they will never leave.

I am incredibly convinced that deterrence must be an element of our plan to fix this problem. If we look at other countries around the world, such as Australia, which has made huge progress in dealing with a very similar challenge, it is a deterrent element of removal that was integral to reducing the number of illegal arrivals. That is why I am a big supporter of the Rwanda scheme, which is an important element of our plan to fix the problem. I gently urge her to support our legislation, which, as I said, will make it clear that those who arrive here illegally will be detained and removed.</p>            </div>

Let us talk plainly in this House. This boat did not magically appear on the median line; it was launched from a beach in France&#8212;a safe country.

Following that, the then Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> made a broad and expansive office to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_President">French President</a> for UK boots to be allowed to go on the sand and on the ground to stop these launchings.

My constituent, Soheila Nowlan, a successful academic of international standing, came to the UK as a refugee from Iran a couple of years ago. For her family in Iran, there is no safe and legal route by which they can come to join her in the UK, but should they travel overland and come in a small boat, they stand around a 98% chance under our <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> of being granted asylum in the United Kingdom. Does my right hon. Friend acknowledge that the success of our ambition to break the model of the people smugglers, by ensuring that those who come to the UK by irregular means are not successful, depends entirely on the existence of a safe and legal route, which, if it has not been used, can in our law count against those who come here by irregular means?</p>            </div>

The reality is that the UK will continue to provide safe and legal routes to those refugees in most need, but the practical truth is that there are 100 million people around the globe who would like to leave their country of residence and potentially come to the United Kingdom. That is simply not possible. Therefore, we need an element of control&#8212;combined with compassion and generosity but, yes, control, fairness and legitimacy&#8212;that underpins any kind of humanitarian arrangement that we have.

I must also say that we have time this afternoon, but we could go a little faster.

Friend is absolutely right to highlight the need for greater action to disrupt the criminal gangs, particularly upstream and in respect of how they advertise to and communicate with the people they exploit. They make considerable use of social media to propagate a lie and fuel this illegal trade. They are shameless and, indeed, reckless in their behaviour, selling a journey in life-threatening conditions, putting people&#8217;s lives at risk and causing nothing but misery. They must be stopped.</p>            </div>

How desperate does she think the people making the journey must have been to attempt it? The weasel words she has been using about dealing with safe and legal routes after dealing with the people smugglers are shameful. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a>&#8217;s approach to this issue is dehumanising and wholly inadequate.

Obviously, it matters for us to have accurate information. In response to the question from my hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10610" title="Our page on Derek Twigg - 'the Member for Halton (Derek Twigg)'">Derek Twigg</a>, the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> said that his target was to eliminate the &#8220;initial asylum backlog&#8221; of &#8220;117,000&#8221;. An hour later, No. 10 said that the target was 92,000. The Home Secretary will probably be aware that we assume the 117,000 is the figure that applies to the backlog of initial main applications&#8212;including dependants, the figure for the backlog is in fact 143,000. So we do need some clarity on whether this is the 117,000 that the Prime Minister told the House, the 92,000 or some other figure. Obviously, if the Prime Minister has not given accurate information to the House, we would expect that to be clarified and corrected swiftly by No. 10.</p>            </div>

Lady knows, the accuracy, or otherwise, of what is said by any Member of this House is not a matter for the Chair. But it is a matter for  the Chair to ensure that if there has been a discrepancy in the presentation of statistics, it should be corrected at the earliest opportunity. I have every confidence that, the right hon. Lady having pointed out this alleged discrepancy in the presentation of statistics, the matter will be taken seriously by the Ministers on the Treasury Bench. If there is a discrepancy to be corrected, I have every confidence that that will be done in a timely fashion. [Interruption.] No, I do not need any further advice, thank you; I think I have put it quite clearly.</p>            </div>
