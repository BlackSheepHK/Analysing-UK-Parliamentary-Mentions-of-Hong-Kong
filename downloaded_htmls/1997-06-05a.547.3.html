                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I thank the right hon. Lady for the business as far as it goes. She seems again to have forgotten her promise to do her best to give us the business for two weeks. I wonder whether she can give us any idea of the business for the remainder of the week commencing 16 June.</p> <p>
Can the right hon. Lady tell us when the motions to set up the departmental <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committees">Select Committees</a> will be tabled and when the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee_on_Standards_and_Privileges">Select Committee on Standards and Privileges</a> will be set up? There is a desire on both sides of the House to proceed with that as a matter of urgency, not least in the light of the position of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sarwar).</p> <p>
Does the right hon. Lady agree that, given the range of subjects that will be covered at the forthcoming intergovernmental conference in Amsterdam, the Government's determination to take this country into the social chapter, their intention to concede further qualified <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> voting and the need for them to set out their position in respect of a single currency in the light of developments in France and Germany this week, it would be appropriate for the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> to speak in the debate on Europe on Monday rather than the departmental <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>? Can she confirm that the Prime Minister will make a statement to the House after the conference?</p> <p>
Will the right hon. Lady arrange for an early statement to clarify how the Government intend to resist pressure from our European partners for all companies with more than 50 staff to set up works councils or face sanctions?</p> <p>
Will the right hon. Lady arrange for an early statement about the announcement on union recognition made yesterday by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Education and Employment to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMB">GMB</a> annual conference, about which

the Queen's Speech was noticeably reticent? Could such a statement include an interpretation of the remarks of Mr. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edmonds">John Edmonds</a> of the GMB, who expressed the view that every Labour Member should continue to remember the help that they received from the GMB and so many other trade unions?</p> <p>
Will the right hon. Lady confirm that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=91" title="The office of Deputy Prime Minister is one that has only existed..." class="glossary">Deputy Prime Minister</a>'s secret discussions with the public sector unions yesterday included the possibility of abandoning compulsory competitive tendering, and will she arrange for her right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister">Deputy Prime Minister</a> to make an early statement on that matter?</p> <p>
Can the right hon. Lady tell us whether we might expect a statement on the Government's defence review, which was announced outside the House during the Whitsun recess?</p> <p>
Will the right hon. Lady make an early statement on whether the Prime Minister plans to attend the transfer of sovereignty ceremonies in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>? Will an early statement be made on the Government's attitude to the Prime Minister's attending the proposed swearing-in of the provisional legislature?</p> <p>
Is it not clear that concern has increased in the House and among the public at the politicisation of the civil service? Last week, Sir <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bett">Michael Bett</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Civil_Service_Commissioner">First Civil Service Commissioner</a>, publicly expressed his misgivings about the Government's behaviour. Will the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a> confirm that she will arrange for an early debate in Government time on the matter, which has constitutional implications, and publish in advance the names and salaries of all political appointees?</p> <p>
Yesterday, a point of order was raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Sir A. Hamilton) on allegations that political appointees who have not been positively vetted have sought or gained access to classified material, which can be handled only by those who have been positively vetted. Will the right hon. Lady tell us when we can expect a statement in the House on that matter, which has serious security implications?</p> <p>
Will the right hon. Lady confirm that any announcement by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a> about changes to the primary purpose rule will be made first in a statement to the House?</p>            </div>

I, too, regret that it is not possible at this stage in the Parliament, because our business is only starting, to give more advance warning of what will happen. We shall, however, start to do so in future weeks, as the pattern of business becomes clearer.</p> <p>
I share the concern expressed by the shadow Leader of the House that departmental <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committees">Select Committees</a> should be established as soon as possible. Some discussions have already taken place, and we can build on those. This week, we have been able to establish a couple of Committees that are dealing with more urgent matters. I agree that establishing the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee_on_Standards_and_Privileges">Select Committee on Standards and Privileges</a> is a priority, and I hope that we shall be able to do so before long.</p> <p>
As for the Government's agenda at Amsterdam, a range of documents will have to be considered on Monday, partly because the previous Government were reluctant to discuss some of the issues in the House. Monday's debate


will be opened by my right hon.

I can confirm that that is the situation, and that a statement will be made to the House.</p> <p>
The proposals on works councils that are currently being discussed are ones that have not found favour. My right hon. Friends have made it clear that they will want to consider very carefully any proposals on that matter.</p> <p>

In his comments at this week's conference, my right hon.

There will be wide consultation, which I hope will be generally welcomed.</p> <p>
The <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a> suggested that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=91" title="The office of Deputy Prime Minister is one that has only existed..." class="glossary">Deputy Prime Minister</a> had had secret discussions. If the discussions were so secret, I am not sure how he knows so much about them. It is not a matter of abandoning any system of value for money within local authorities. Questions have already been answered in the House about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCT">CCT</a>, and the Government have made it clear that we want local authorities, and everyone else, to ensure that best value for money on all contracts is obtained.</p> <p>
My right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a> for Defence has said that he will conduct a defence review, which is what the Government said they would do before and during the <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a>.</p> <p>
Statements have already been made on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>, making it clear that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Affairs">Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs</a> will attend the changeover. I think that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales">Prince of Wales</a> will also attend. The question of anyone else attending remains open, and final decisions have not yet been made.</p> <p>
The shadow Leader of the House was not correct in his interpretation of Sir <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bett">Michael Bett</a>'s opinion on political advisers. Sir Michael Bett said that, at this stage, he was not concerned about what has happened, and I think that hon. Members have tried to take his comments out of context. There is no reason to have any debate on that issue. We shall, of course, follow normal practice on publication of names and salaries.</p> <p>
My right hon. Friend the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a> is answering a parliamentary question on the primary purpose rule. That is in general the procedure that has been adopted with other changes in the immigration rules.</p> <p>
On the question about positive vetting, my understanding is that very few special or political advisers have any need to be positively vetted, as they do not see material that comes into that category. The only person who does come into that category is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Powell">Jonathan Powell</a>, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>'s chief of staff.

Whereas there used to be three Ministers responsible for school matters, there now appear to be only two. That is causing problems. Already, colleagues have received a letter discouraging too many delegations to Ministers. The situation has resulted in a delay in the decision on the age of transfer in my local education authority in Buckinghamshire, causing great anxiety to parents, pupils, teachers and the local education authority. I believe that the explanation for the delay is inadequate ministerial manpower.</p>            </div>

The motion refers to the over-medication of the elderly in residential homes and, following the evidence given last week by the Alzheimer's Disease Society and the Royal College of Physicians, it is important to discuss that. The evidence shows that there is vast over-prescribing of neuroleptic anti-psychotic drugs in residential homes. In one study, 88 per cent. of the elderly residents were receiving those drugs when they did not need them. People who might well be frail physically, but alert mentally, are turned into a zombie-like state by those drugs. Do we not need to consider the matter urgently in the House?</p>            </div>

Friend find time to discuss the collapse of beef prices following the previous Government's mishandling of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSE">BSE</a> crisis? In Cowbridge market last week, finished cattle prices were lower than they were 14 years ago. That is a threat not just to the industry but to our rural environment. Just last week again, for the first time in recent memory, prime agricultural land could not be sold at auction. There will be no one to manage the countryside unless the problem is looked at.</p>            </div>

The former Government set a starting


date for the Manchester airport eastern link road and committed themselves to building it. That link road is now in question because of the roads review, which is causing great anxiety in the whole Cheadle area. I hope that the right hon.

It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> as recently as Monday of this week, but to the fact that similar treatment is being given to the Firearms (<a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a>) Bill. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Reading">Second Reading</a> debate on that Bill will be on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wednesday">Wednesday</a> next week, one sitting day, and the Committee stage will be on Monday 16 June, which gives precious little time for important amendments to be tabled to what is, as my hon.

If the right hon.
