The Resolution further required each State to determine which commodities exported from its territories fall within the embargo, and to co-operate with other States in the application of the embargo.</p> <p>
As a result of the review to which I have referred, the Government have now decided to impose export licence control on all goods to be sent from the United Kingdom to China and Hong Kong, and an Order has been published to-day giving effect to that decision. The effect

of the Order, which will come into operation on 25th June, is that we shall be in a position to keep a close watch on all exports to China and, in the case of exports to Hong Kong, to satisfy ourselves where this seems necessary, by inquiring from the Hong Kong authorities whether or not the goods in question are required for use in Hong Kong or whether the intention of the importer is to re-export them to China.</p> <p>
As I stated previously, it is not our intention to impose a total embargo on trade with China, and export licences for goods which are not considered to be of military or strategic importance to China will be granted freely, subject to avail-abilities and the prior claims on our resources. On the other hand, licences will not be granted for export to China of goods which in present circumstances could be of strategic and military importance. Licences to export these goods to Hong Kong will only be issued when the Hong Kong authorities have given an assurance by the issue of import licences or otherwise that the goods will not find their way to China.</p> <p>
I am arranging for the list of goods for which no export licences will be granted for export to China to be included in the OFFICIAL REPORT. The goods on this list will also be embargoed for China by all <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Dependent_Territories">British Dependent Territories</a>, including Hong Kong. In addition, we have recommended to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Hong_Kong">Governor of Hong Kong</a> that he should consider subjecting all these goods to import licence control. This should ensure that other countries can export such goods to Hong Kong in the confident knowledge that the goods are required for use in the Colony or for export to permisible destinations.</p> <p>
I should like to make it clear that the prohibited list does not involve a major intensification of the measures which we in the United Kingdom have progressively adopted since the Korean hostilities began. We are satisfied that the measures which we have been operating have been effective in preventing any supplies of substantial military or strategic importance reaching China from the United Kingdom, but we decided that it was desirable to introduce statutory controls to replace certain informal arrangements with industries on which we have hitherto relied to prevent the


export to China of many types of goods of strategic importance in connection with her military operations in Korea.</p> <p>
Our representative in the United Nations has already reported to the Additional Measures Committee that the United Kingdom and Dependent Territories will embargo to China and North Korea any exports of goods on the list to which I have referred. I think that it will be generally agreed that the measures we are taking represent a comprehensive interpretation of the intentions of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Resolution">United Nations Resolution</a>.</p>            </div>
