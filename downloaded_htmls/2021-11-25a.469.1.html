                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="a464.3/1">First, it would be churlish of me not to thank the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a> for letting staff, in particular, know that they can now book their holidays with their families; a lot of them have been waiting a long time to try to get those booked in. I thank the Leader of the House both for the forthcoming business and for the recess dates.</p> <p pid="a464.3/2">Yesterday, we heard the tragic news that at least 27 people died crossing the English channel, including one young girl and five women, when an inflatable  dinghy capsized near Calais. This tragedy reminds us of the risk to life in those perilous waters. My thoughts and I am sure those of all Members are with those who died and with their loved ones. Some of us are already wondering if they are relatives of our constituents who have been trying to be reunited with them, and that is quite hard to take. This is the most poignant of wake-up calls to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a>, and I really urge them to act&#8212;to take this matter seriously to prevent people from dying in those dangerous waters. Safe and legal routes, tackling the traffickers, reversing the cut on overseas aid and working constructively with our overseas partners are four things the Government could and should be doing today, and I very much hope they will be part of what the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a> speaks about in her remarks later this morning.</p> <p pid="a464.3/3">On the theme of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> failures, yesterday the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs_Committee">Home Affairs Committee</a> published yet another report on the Windrush generation compensation scheme. It was a damning indictment, again, of the Home Office&#8217;s inability to right a grievous wrong. Four years after the Windrush scandal emerged, just 5% of the people concerned have received their compensation, while 23 individuals, including a constituent of mine, died before they received a penny, still haunted by being wrongly deemed immigration offenders. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee">The Committee</a> recommends that the scheme is passed to an independent organisation and, frankly, we can see why. This is a Government departmental failure, and the Home Secretary should acknowledge that victims of the scandal will understandably have no confidence whatsoever in her Department. Will the Leader of the House urge his colleague to tell us what she will do to rebuild shattered trust in the Home Office?</p> <p pid="a464.3/4">This week, we learned in a written statement that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways">British Airways</a> was not told of the known danger that the passengers on the 1991 flight <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BA149">BA149</a> to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a> via Kuwait, who were taken hostage by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>&#8217;s forces, were flying into. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> embassy in Kuwait was aware of that, but as a result of not being notified the passengers on the flight were held hostage by Saddam Hussein&#8217;s forces for months. A Government&#8217;s first duty is the safety and security of its citizens and a written apology is not good enough. I urge the Leader of the House to ask the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> to do the decent thing and come to this House to apologise and explain to the people of this country how she will ensure that this sort of failure can never happen to British people again.</p> <p pid="a464.3/5">This Government&#8217;s waste of public money is a theme of business questions and this week is no different: I have two examples that the Leader of the House can perhaps help with. Will he ask the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Work and Pensions to explain why her Department has, according to a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> report, only attempted to recover 10% of the &#163;8.4 billion lost to fraud and error over the past year? Will he also ask the relevant <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> to come to this House to explain the loss of just shy of half a billion pounds on Randox contracts? That was briefly discussed this morning but this is still a <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> motion not yet complied with. Do the minutes even exist? I cannot imagine spending half a billion pounds and not keeping the receipt. Labour will not let this waste of taxpayers&#8217; money go, because that sum would pay for hospitals, perhaps some of the mythical 40 hospitals, or schools, or help for people struggling with fuel <a href="/glossary/?gl=249" title="A proposal for new legislation that is debated by Parliament." class="glossary">bills</a> this winter.</p> <p pid="a464.3/6">On Monday, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standards_Committee">Standards Committee</a> will report on its proposed changes to MPs&#8217; code of conduct. That will be a significant step in untangling the mess that the Tories have forced this House into. I see from the business that the Leader of the House has not yet allocated Government time for a debate on this report; will he do so before the end of the year so that we can properly scrutinise it?</p> <p pid="a464.3/7">My final request is not to the right hon. Gentleman but to all the men in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> and beyond, because today is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon_Day">White Ribbon Day</a>, the international day to end violence against women and girls, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon_Campaign">White Ribbon Campaign</a> is a challenge for men to take on male violence. I urge all men listening to take this challenge seriously and do everything they can to end violence against women and girls. It is wonderful to imagine a world where that is eliminated, and I urge all men to help us go out and create it.</p>            </div>

Lady said at the end of her remarks and will highlight some of the things that the Government are doing to tackle violence against women and girls, which is obviously a top priority for the whole Government. The tackling violence against women and girls strategy is being refreshed, building on the &#163;100 million already spent on tackling this issue since 2016. It includes establishing new police leads for violence against women and girls reporting to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, spending &#163;30 million through the safer streets and women at night funds, a multimillion-pound communications campaign targeting perpetrators and misogynistic attitudes, and plans to commission a new 24/7 rape and sexual assault helpline and online support. The hon. Lady is right to raise the issue and I think the whole House agrees that everything possible should be done to stop violence against women and girls, and men must recognise that they have an important responsibility within that.</p> <p pid="a466.0/2">I am delighted that the hon. Lady will now be able to find bargain holidays for herself for next year and that this pressing issue has now been answered. It has to be said that our dutiful staff so enjoy being in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=192" title="The House of Commons is one of the houses of parliament. Here, elected MPs..." class="glossary">House of Commons</a> that they never come up to me and ask for the recess dates, but hon. Members do from time to time as they wait to book their flights on easyJet or their private jets, depending on their predilection. But I am delighted to have cheered up the hon. Lady.</p> <p pid="a466.0/3">The hon. Lady rightly mentioned the terrible situation in the channel yesterday, and my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will be at the <a href="/glossary/?gl=171" title="If you've ever seen inside the Commons, you'll notice a large table in the..." class="glossary">Dispatch Box</a> later. The hon. Lady is absolutely right to say that the Government&#8217;s priority must be to take every step possible to prevent deaths. The main way of achieving that is to stop the boats setting off; that must be the priority and it is why the Government have offered to help the French in any way that we can to try to stop those boats launching. Under the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality_and_Borders_Bill">Nationality and Borders Bill</a>, which the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> opposed, we are trying to make it easier for people to make legal claims for asylum, and harder for people who come into the country illegally to make claims. That must be right, because the evil of what happens is the people traffickers and smugglers who are entirely unconcerned about human life and take large amounts of money to put people on unsafe boats and push them out to sea at the risk of their lives. We must deal with them and make their business model fail, and  that way we will save lives. I announced that the borders Bill will be coming back, and I hope that the Opposition will seriously consider supporting those many measures and supporting the Bill&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Reading">Third Reading</a>, which will help us to ensure safer borders.</p> <p pid="a466.0/4">On Windrush, the Government are committed to ensuring that those compensation payments are paid. Everyone recognises that that was a great injustice and that the hostile environment policy did not succeed. Ensuring that those who are now quite elderly of the Windrush generation are properly compensated is the priority of the Government. I think changing the structure now would probably delay things more rather than speeding them up, but they have been sped up in the last few months and over the course of the last year, and that will continue.</p> <p pid="a466.0/5">As regards <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BA149">BA149</a>, that happened some time before I was <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a>. Of course, Governments over many decades learn from the failings of previous Governments, but I do not think what happened in 1991 is immediately topical today.</p> <p pid="a466.0/6">On the issue of Government expenditure, I have warned the hon. Lady before about people in glass houses throwing stones, and I remind her about the &#163;13 billion spent by the last socialist Government on the NHS supercomputer and the incredible failures with working tax credits, which led to masses of waste of taxpayers&#8217; money. The whole approach to money when the socialists are in power is to be irresponsible and loose with other people&#8217;s money. As somebody once said, the problem with being socialist is that eventually you run out of other people&#8217;s money. The Government are committed to tackling fraud&#8212;to dealing with it and reducing it. That is a major priority, as it is for all sensible Governments.</p> <p pid="a466.0/7">As regards the purchase of personal protective equipment, this was an emergency. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Opposition">The Opposition</a> cannot have it both ways. The vaccine programme, which was an absolute triumph, was based on shortening purchase arrangements, getting things done quickly, moving ahead swiftly, and spending the money that was necessary then, rather than waiting three to six months and finding that we were as behind as some other places have ended up being. The same was true with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPE">PPE</a>, but of course the Humble Address, an important constitutional process, will be dealt with properly.</p> <p pid="a466.0/8">Finally, the hon. Lady mentioned the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standards_Committee">Standards Committee</a> report. I think she is being a little previous in asking for something to be debated before it has been published.</p>            </div>

A couple of weeks ago, I wrote to them to investigate the recent cash-for-honours scandal, after it was revealed that all recent <a href="/glossary/?gl=135" title="The political party system in the English-speaking world evolved in the..." class="glossary">Tory</a> treasurers had been given places in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=191" title="The house of Lords is the upper chamber of the Houses of Parliament.

Along with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Law_Project">Good Law Project</a>, I have written to the Met requesting that they give the reasons why they refused to investigate, or we will ask for that decision to be judicially reviewed. Surely the Leader of the House will agree that every whiff of corruption must be properly investigated? If the Met will not do it, maybe the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> could get his good friend <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_Gadget">Inspector Gadget</a> to do it for us?</p>            </div>

I seem to remember that that did not lead to a prosecution&#8212;I may be wrong. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should take that to a judicial review to consider more serious sanctions. I am glad to say that the Government are toughening up on <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> on animal cruelty, which may be of interest to the Good Law Project leaders.</p> <p pid="a469.0/2">On the very serious issue the hon. Gentleman raises about the channel crossing disaster, we are having a day and a half of debate on that on Report, which will cover legal routes of entry and toughening up on illegal routes of entry. It is a United Kingdom-wide policy, so I hope we will have the support of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNP">SNP</a> in doing that.</p> <p pid="a469.0/3">On the mainstay of the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s question, this time he got so furious that he started giggling at his own fury. I have found out why he is so upset this week. It is not because he is waiting in eager anticipation for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrew">St Andrew</a>&#8217;s Day next year, which will of course be a proper celebration for him and his right hon. and hon. Friends. The reason he is so grumpy today is a new opinion poll that shows that the proportion of voters who ranked the constitution in their preference for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government">Scottish Government</a>&#8217;s top three priorities fell by eight points to 13%; and fewer than one third of SNP voters, 28%, ranked independence on their hierarchy of priorities. It is a sad day for him today. I will not tease him for being grumpy. He is justifiably being grumpy, because his sandcastles are gently being washed away by a tide of Unionism.</p>            </div>

Just a few years ago, I loved my time in the beavers and the cubs and cannot for the life of me remember why I did not graduate through to the scouts&#8212;perhaps I was too much of a tearaway.

This builds on work that was done last year. However, I do not think that anyone is underestimating the seriousness of the problem.</p>            </div>

Figures from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics">Office for National Statistics</a> show that the number of firms in Kettering is now 4,475, up from 4,120 last year, and in the past three years there has been an explosion of independent shops opening in the town centre.</p> <p pid="a473.1/2">Is it not clear that as Britain bounces back from the pandemic, Kettering is leading the way?

As well as denying the existence of structural racism, it proposed that the answer to bias in algorithms should be to define fairness mathematically. Having some familiarity with statistical and mathematical methods, I can say that I find that absolutely laughable, but despite having asked numerous questions, I have yet to find out the Government&#8217;s view.

Every week, hon. Members from across this House talk about the wonderful work done in their constituencies by people who support charities. We should be so proud of the charitable sector. The state is not there to do absolutely everything; there is always a role for charity. The people who get involved are worthy of praise and not of censure. We should be proud of what goes on, as MPs always are individually about the work in their constituencies. Obviously, I do not know about the individual case she raises, but I would happily take it up with the relevant Department if she were to send me more details.</p>            </div>

The numbers of people the universal credit system was dealing with on a daily basis were multiples of what was ever expected. It was so important to make sure that people in potentially desperate situations got money. Of course, that increased the risk of fraud&#8212;everybody knew that at the time and they knew it was a risk with the furlough scheme as well&#8212;but what were we supposed to do? Were we supposed to sit idly by and let people have no money? Were we supposed to sit idly by and let people worry that their jobs were not going to exist? It was a fundamental urgency.</p> <p pid="a479.3/2">Everybody knows that with any accounting mechanism speed and detail do not go hand in hand, but the urgency was fundamental. I therefore defend what was done by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Work_and_Pensions">Department for Work and Pensions</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty">Her Majesty</a>&#8217;s Treasury in dealing with a very urgent  situation.
