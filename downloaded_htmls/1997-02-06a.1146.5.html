<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wednesday">Wednesday</a>. Will he make sure that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary">Home Secretary</a> makes it clear as soon as possible what he intends to do to resolve the problem that was created by the passage in <a href="/glossary/?gl=112" title="During a debate members of the House of Commons traditionally refer to the..." class="glossary">another place</a> of two important but contradictory amendments? I am sure that he agrees that hon. Members should have as much notice as possible of what is to happen on that matter.</p> <p>
Will the right hon. Gentleman confirm when the important Firearms (<a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a>) Bill will return to the House? He will be aware that, despite the support of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a>, the Government were defeated on several occasions in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=191" title="The house of Lords is the upper chamber of the Houses of Parliament. It is..." class="glossary">House of Lords</a>, mainly by the votes of hereditary peers. Therefore, the Bill is in an unsatisfactory state at present. Will the right hon. Gentleman reassure hon. Members that that very important legislation&#8212;there is much agreement about the need for change&#8212;will be passed as quickly as possible, and that those defeats will not be allowed to delay its passage?</p> <p>
Will the right hon. Gentleman find Government time for a debate on the current crisis in further education? Hon. Members on both sides of the House have received representations from colleges throughout the country because of the confusion and chaos created by the Government's decision&#8212;taken midway through the funding year&#8212;to shift the goalposts. Will the right hon. Gentleman confirm that an interim decision about future Government policy has been taken within the past 24 hours, although the House has not been told about its possible implications? There has clearly been a significant breach of faith with colleges and students. Neither can plan their future properly until the matter is resolved, and the House is entitled to know exactly what is happening.</p> <p>
Can the right hon. Gentleman shed any light on the Government's intentions in respect of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground">London Underground</a>? Why did the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Transport draft a statement&#8212;which I happen to have with me&#8212;announcing the privatisation of London Underground, only to back down?

The hon.

However, my right hon. and learned Friend the Home Secretary has signified that he expects to invite the House to modify&#8212;I deliberately choose an understated word&#8212;some of the amendments passed in another place.</p> <p>
I note the hon.

I make it clear that there is no question of our altering our position regarding <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground">London Underground</a>. We shall make our intentions clear at the appropriate time. We shall not be bounced into making premature announcements by leaks to newspapers&#8212;or even to the hon. Lady.

[<i>That this House notes that, as a consequence of industrial action in Greece, British lorry drivers were detained at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patras,_Greece">Patras, Greece</a>; observes that a number of horses were held for eight days in lorries where their condition was pitiful; commends the work of the Horse Reserve Fund in offering prompt assistance and in ascertaining whether the horses had been watered; and deplores the fact that the horses then had to undergo further journeys of up to 1,500 miles prior to their slaughter.</i>]</p> <p>
The motion is signed by hon. Members on both sides of the House and draws attention to the terrible treatment of horses in Greece. They were kept without food and water for eight days during the recent strike and then taken a further 1,500 miles before slaughter. We must protest against such practices in the European Union. May we have a debate through which to do that?</p>            </div>

Many of my constituents have contacted me, who are absolutely outraged at the invasion of their privacy, having received a letter from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>. I should like the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_House">Leader of the House</a> to comment on the letter from his colleague, the right hon. Member for Peterborough (Dr. Mawhinney), the chairman of the Conservative party, to my good friend and old colleague <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Lees">Harry Lees</a>, who died 18 months ago. The letter, sent to the former Labour councillor and lifelong Labour party member, said that he could be an essential part of the Conservative election machine. Is not the law on data protection simply not working, given that people can receive such unsolicited letters from leading lights in the Conservative party?</p>            </div>

Does my right hon.
