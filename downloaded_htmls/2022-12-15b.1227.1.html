                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="b1225.2/1">As <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_the_House">Members of the House</a> will be aware, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> laid a written ministerial statement yesterday to update the House on actions taken following the incident that occurred outside the Chinese consulate in Manchester on <phrase class="date" code="2022-10-16">16 October</phrase>. I was as shocked as all Members of the House to see the disturbing social media footage of violence there that day. The right of free expression&#8212;the right to protest peacefully, the right to speaks one&#8217;s mind free from the fear or threat of violence&#8212;is an absolutely fundamental part of our democratic life in the UK.</p> <p pid="b1225.2/2">In our immediate response, the Foreign Secretary summoned China&#8217;s acting ambassador&#8212;the most senior Chinese diplomat who was in the UK that day&#8212;to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign,_Commonwealth_and_Development_Office">Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office</a> to demand an explanation for the incident. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Majesty">His Majesty</a>&#8217;s ambassador in Beijing also sought a further explanation from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs">Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>.</p> <p pid="b1225.2/3">Following the incident, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester">Greater Manchester</a> police initiated an investigation. As part of that investigation, the police requested that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCDO">FCDO</a> approach the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> to ask them to waive immunity of the Chinese consul general and five of his staff to enable interviews to take place. We informed the Chinese embassy of that request and set yesterday as the deadline, making it clear that we expected it to take action.</p> <p pid="b1225.2/4">Indeed, we have been clear with China from the outset that we would take firm action should the police determine that there was a need to interview officials regarding their involvement in the incident. We rightly expect the highest standard of behaviour from all foreign diplomats and consular staff in the UK regardless of their privileges and immunities.</p> <p pid="b1225.2/5">In response to our request, the Chinese embassy, acting on instruction from Beijing, notified His Majesty&#8217;s Government earlier this week that it had removed the consul general from the UK. The embassy also notified us that five other staff identified for interview from the incident by Greater Manchester police have either now left or are about to leave the UK. I wish to put on record my thanks for the professionalism shown by Greater Manchester police, particularly given the complexities of dealing with this case.</p> <p pid="b1225.2/6">As the Foreign Secretary said yesterday, we are disappointed that these individuals will not be interviewed. It is therefore right that those identified by the police as involved in the disgraceful scenes in Manchester are no longer, or will shortly cease to be, consular staff accredited to the UK. Throughout this process, we have been clear that, in the UK, we adhere to the rule of law, follow due process and respect the operational independence of our police.</p> <p pid="b1225.2/7">Our firm diplomacy and our actions demonstrate the seriousness with which we took this incident, and the correct outcome has now been reached. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> will always use our diplomacy to demonstrate the importance of abiding by the rule of law, and we expect others to do the same.</p>            </div>

By giving them a week&#8217;s notice, which goes far beyond the Vienna convention on consular relations, we have essentially denied Bob Chan any sense of justice. I am afraid that, at this point, the Government are being opaque, and I cannot identify any meaningful action that they have taken beyond giving the diplomats notice to flee the country, and essentially allowing the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist">Chinese Communist</a> party to claim now that it was simply the end of their term in Britain: they were not removed, they were not expelled, it was just time for him to leave our country.</p> <p pid="b1226.0/3">I am not asking the Government to be tough for toughness&#8217; sake.

This is the third urgent question with the third <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> and the third slightly different version of events, and the impression is of dither and delay.</p> <p pid="b1226.3/2">Of course Labour Members believe that the right of free expression, including the right to protest and to speak one&#8217;s mind, is essential to our democratic way of  life, and we thank <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester">Greater Manchester</a> police for their intense efforts in this regard. However, I have three brief questions to ask the Minister. First, will the officials removed by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> be declared personae non gratae, to send a clear message about our dissatisfaction with their unwillingness to engage with the investigation? Secondly, has there has been concerted engagement with international partners about the episode to prevent similar occurrences in New York, Canberra, Amsterdam or Ottawa? Finally, will there be fresh and concerted cross-<a href="/glossary/?gl=101" title="Whitehall is a wide road that runs through the heart of Westminster,..." class="glossary">Whitehall</a> engagement to ensure that pro-democracy activists and Hongkongers are given the protection that they deserve here in the UK?

We are disappointed that these individuals will therefore not be interviewed, but it is absolutely right that those responsible will shortly be getting on to a plane and leaving the UK.</p> <p pid="b1227.0/2">As the hon.

As I have said, I know all of us in the House agree that we value that freedom of expression&#8212;that freedom to protest peacefully&#8212;and, indeed, ask others around the world to demonstrate it as well. We will continue to ensure that our police forces are able to do what they need to do, independent of Government direction.

I was able to sit and have a short conversation with the ambassador, during which I raised these issues, which at the time were ongoing. We will continue to meet, and I note the request for less of a welcome than perhaps one might otherwise give. It is really important to maintain those conversations and, as my hon. Friend says, ensure that every embassy accredited to the UK understands our values and our rights. All those who wish to demonstrate peacefully to raise concerns on any matter should be free to do so. We will continue to stand up to ensure that everyone across the UK understands that, and we will continue to support our police to allow that to happen.</p>            </div>
