This is a grave and deeply disturbing step.</p> <p pid="d329.1/3">We have carefully assessed the legislation. In particular, we have considered its impact on the rights, freedoms and, critically, the high degree of autonomy bestowed on Hong Kong under China&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law">Basic Law</a> for Hong Kong and under the joint declaration, which, as the House will know, is the treaty agreed between China and the UK in 1984.</p> <p pid="d329.1/4">Today I have the depressing but necessary duty to report to the House that the enactment of this legislation, imposed by the authorities in Beijing on the people of Hong Kong, constitutes a clear and serious breach of the joint declaration. Let me explain to the House the grounds for this sobering conclusion.</p> <p pid="d329.1/5">First, the legislation violates the high degree of autonomy over executive and legislative powers and the independent judicial authority provided for in paragraph 3 of the joint declaration. The imposition of this legislation by the Government in Beijing, rather than it being left to Hong Kong&#8217;s own institutions to adopt it, is also, it should be noted, in direct conflict with article 23 of China&#8217;s own Basic Law for Hong Kong, which affirms that Hong Kong should bring forward its own national security legislation. In fact, the Basic Law elaborates on that, and allows Beijing to impose <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> directly only in a very limited number of cases, such as for the purposes of defence and foreign affairs, or in the exceptional event of the National People&#8217;s Congress declaring a state of war or a state of emergency. None of those exceptions applies here, nor has the National People&#8217;s Congress sought to justify the law on any such ground.</p> <p pid="d329.1/6">Secondly, the national security legislation contains a slew of measures that directly threaten the freedoms and rights protected by the joint declaration. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> will be particularly concerned by the potentially wide-ranging ability of the mainland authorities to take jurisdiction over certain cases without any independent oversight, and to try those cases in the Chinese courts. That measure violates paragraphs 3(3) and 3(5) of the joint declaration, and directly threatens the rights set out in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a> international covenant on civil and political rights, which, under the joint declaration, are to be protected in Hong Kong. That in particular represents a flagrant assault on freedom of speech  and the right to peaceful protest for the people of Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="d329.1/7">Thirdly, the legislation provides that Hong Kong&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive">Chief Executive</a>, rather than its <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice">Chief Justice</a>, will appoint judges to hear national security cases&#8212;a move that clearly risks undermining the independence of Hong Kong&#8217;s judiciary, which is, again, protected by the joint declaration in paragraph 3(3). Fourthly, the legislation provides for the establishment in Hong Kong by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> of a new office for safeguarding  national security, run by and reporting to the mainland authorities. That is particularly worrying, because that office is given wide-ranging powers, directly intruding on the responsibility of the Hong Kong authorities to maintain public order. Again, that is directly in breach of the joint declaration&#8212;this time, paragraph 3(11). The authorities in Hong Kong have already started to enforce the legislation; there are reports of arrests by the police, and official notices warning the people of Hong Kong against waving flags or chanting.</p> <p pid="d329.1/8">In sum, this legislation has been enacted in clear and serious breach of the joint declaration. China has broken its promise to the people of Hong Kong under its own laws, and has breached its international obligations to the United Kingdom under the joint declaration. Having committed to applying the UN&#8217;s international covenant on civil and political rights to the people of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong,_China">Hong Kong, China</a> has now written into law wide-ranging exemptions that cannot credibly be reconciled with its international obligations, or its responsibilities as a leading member of the international community.</p> <p pid="d329.1/9">We want a positive relationship with China. We recognise its growth, its stature, and the powerful role it can play in the world. It is precisely because we respect China as a leading member of the international community that we expect the Chinese Government to meet their international obligations and live up to their international responsibilities. They have failed to do so with respect to Hong Kong by enacting legislation that violates its autonomy and threatens the strangulation of its freedoms. It is a sad day for the people of Hong Kong&#8212;one that can only undermine international trust in the Chinese Government&#8217;s willingness to keep its word and live up to its promises.</p> <p pid="d329.1/10">For our part, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> and the Government are crystal clear: the United Kingdom will keep its word and live up to our responsibilities to the people of Hong Kong. After further detailed discussions with my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, I can now confirm that we will proceed to honour our commitment to change the arrangements for those holding British national (overseas) status. We have also worked with Ministers across <a href="/glossary/?gl=101" title="Whitehall is a wide road that runs through the heart of Westminster,..." class="glossary">Whitehall</a> and have now developed proposals for a bespoke immigration route for BNOs and their dependents. We will grant BNOs five years&#8217; limited leave to remain, with a right to work or study. After these five years, they will be able to apply for settled status, and after a further 12 months with settled status, they will be able to apply for citizenship. This is a special, bespoke set of arrangements developed for the unique circumstances we face and in the light of our historic commitment to the people of Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="d329.1/11">All those with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> status will be eligible, as will their family dependents who are usually resident in Hong Kong, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> will put in place a simple, streamlined application process. I can reassure hon. Members that there will be no quotas on numbers. I pay tribute to the Home Secretary and her excellent team at the Home Office for their work in helping to prepare for a moment that, let&#8217;s face it, we all dearly hoped would not arrive. She will set out further details of our approach in due course.</p> <p pid="d329.1/12">In addition to changing the arrangements for BNOs, the UK will continue to work with our international partners to consider what further action we should responsibly take next. I can tell the House that yesterday  in the UN Nations Human Rights Council, the UK made a formal joint statement expressing our deep concern about the human rights situation in both Hong Kong and Xinjiang. Twenty-six other nations joined that statement. It is the first time a formal statement has been made at the Human Rights Council on this issue, and it was delivered through our diplomatic leadership. We will continue to work with our partners in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a> and the EU and across the region.</p> <p pid="d329.1/13">I say again: we want a positive relationship with China, but we will not look the other way when it comes to Hong Kong and we will not duck our historic responsibilities to its people. We will continue to bring together our international partners, to stand up for the people of Hong Kong, to call out the violations of their freedoms, and to hold China to its international obligations, freely assumed under international law. I commend this statement to the House.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p pid="d331.0/1">The new security law is deeply shocking, and the arrests overnight have stunned the world. This will have a chilling effect on democracy. It fundamentally undermines the commitments made by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> to the United Kingdom and those we made in turn to the people of Hong Kong when we signed the joint declaration. I pressed the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> yesterday not to waver in his commitment to the people of Hong Kong, and I am grateful to him for coming to the House today to make this statement, for advance sight of it, and most of all for honouring the promise he made on <phrase class="date" code="2020-06-02">2 June</phrase>. He is right to do so and has our support.</p> <p pid="d331.0/2">When will the Home Secretary provide details of the scheme for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> passport holders and dependents, and has the Foreign Secretary made an assessment of likely take-up? Will salary thresholds apply? We are concerned that this does not become a scheme simply for wealthy Hongkongers to abandon the city and leave others behind. Under the national security law, the Government can extract money from those they believe to be involved in criminality or guilty of offences. In some cases, the people of Hong Kong will not be able to take sums of money out of the city and could have their bank accounts frozen, so what recourse to public funds will apply and will he ensure that dependents will be treated as home students for the purpose of tuition fees?</p> <p pid="d331.0/3">The Foreign Secretary&#8217;s commitment to BNO passport holders is welcome, but it does not resolve the problem. I was deeply moved to see the young activists who bravely took to the streets to protest against this law, at considerable personal risk. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> will not be covered by this scheme and must not abandoned. The loss of many highly skilled workers will be a blow to Hong Kong and to China. That is why we need additional measures. We in this House have been waiting for Magnitsky legislation for two years now. He must give us a date for when that will be introduced before the summer recess, so that targeted sanctions can be applied to those who breach human rights in Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="d331.0/4">Overnight, pepper spray and water cannon were used against the pro-democracy protesters. It is now time for Britain to lead on an inquiry into police brutality. I welcome the cross-regional statement that our ambassador co-ordinated and place on record my thanks to him for  his efforts, but will the Foreign Secretary now lead the charge for the appointment of a UN special rapporteur on Hong Kong? The provisions in the national security law that encourage people to confess and disclose others&#8217; so-called &#8220;criminal behaviour&#8221; have raised serious concerns about the prospect of torture. We must not turn away.</p> <p pid="d331.0/5">What conversations has the Foreign Secretary had with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Lam">Carrie Lam</a> about the provision for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive">Chief Executive</a> to hand-pick judges? Given the comments by the former Hong Kong <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice">Chief Justice</a> Andrew Li that this would fundamentally undermine the independence of the judiciary, what assessment has he made of the continuing role of British judges in the court system? I wrote to the Foreign Secretary some time ago to ask him to address the direct challenge made by British companies such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSBC">HSBC</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chartered">Standard Chartered</a> to the UK&#8217;s stance by supporting this law. We cannot allow British businesses to become complicit in undermining the international rules-based order that they themselves rely on. Yesterday the Foreign Secretary spoke up in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a> in defence of press freedom. What discussions is he having with UK news agencies to defend their ability to continue to report freely on the situation on the ground, and with non-governmental organisations, which will be deeply concerned that the law applies anywhere in the world?</p> <p pid="d331.0/6">The Government have taken a step forward today with the announcement of new rights for BNO passport holders and a statement at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a>, but this is no substitute for ongoing and sustained international leadership. I urge the Foreign Secretary to bring forward a comprehensive, detailed and serious package of measures with international partners, as I have outlined.</p> <p pid="d331.0/7">Finally, the Government must now develop a much more strategic approach to their engagement with the Chinese Government. We support the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s view that a constructive relationship remains essential, but it is also clear that the UK needs far greater strategic independence in order to speak from, and act from, a position of values. Will he provide an updated assessment of the implications for national security of the involvement of Huawei in the 5G network? Will he make a similar assessment in relation to the planned nuclear projects involving <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGN">CGN</a>, in particular at Bradwell? Although this announcement is to be welcomed, I remain deeply concerned that his counterparts at the Treasury see Chinese investment as a central plank of the UK&#8217;s recovery and that the Government&#8217;s approach remains deeply confused. For too long in relation to China, we have had no strategy at home and no strategy abroad. I hope he can give us a commitment today that this marks the start of a very different era.</p>            </div>

Lady for her support for the action that we are taking on Hong Kong and the measures that we are introducing in relation to BNOs. She made a number of points and lamented the lack of a comprehensive strategy. I would always welcome any particular suggestions she has. I did not hear any specific suggestions that were not covered in my statement, but I am happy to keep engaging with her.</p> <p pid="d332.0/2">The hon. Lady asked about the details of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> offer. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Secretary">The Home Secretary</a> will come forward in due course, as appropriate, and set out all those details to the House. Obviously, there will be all sorts of regulatory arrangements that we need to put in place, but the  contours of the offer are very clear. We welcome BNOs to come to this country. We have a specific historical responsibility to them and there will not be any quota.</p> <p pid="d332.0/3">In answer to the hon. Lady&#8217;s question about numbers, we constantly assess the likely take-up. I think that, in reality, a large number of those who might be eligible will want to stay in Hong Kong. Others may go to countries in the region, but we have a historical responsibility and therefore we are making our position clear. I have also had a number of conversations with our international partners, particularly those with specific and close relationships with Hong Kong and who have large numbers of that community in their countries. I would expect others to be looking very carefully at what they do.</p> <p pid="d332.0/4">The hon. Lady asked about the Magnitsky legislation and said that it was promised two years ago. It was in the 2019 election manifesto. I have been clear that we will come to the House before recess, not just with the legislation but with the first designations. She also asked about <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Lam">Carrie Lam</a> and the representations that have been made to her. Andy Heyn, our consul general in Hong Kong, spoke to her in the last 24 hours to express our objections to the new legislation.</p> <p pid="d332.0/5"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Foreign_Office">The Foreign Office</a>&#8217;s <a href="/glossary/?gl=179" title="A Permanent Secretary is a top civil servant- there is a permanent..." class="glossary">permanent secretary</a> will also summon the Chinese ambassador, to reiterate the points that I have made before the House. I spoke to Foreign <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi">Wang Yi</a> for a considerable period on <phrase class="date" code="2020-06-08">8 June</phrase>, to make clear in advance our strong objections to the nature of the legislation, in order to try to avert this outcome.</p> <p pid="d332.0/6">The hon. Lady was right to note that extraterritoriality is a feature of this legislation. It is not entirely clear how that will be applied in practice, but it is another sobering cause for concern, and I join her in expressing that. Finally, she asked about Huawei. She will know that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cyber_Security_Centre">National Cyber Security Centre</a> is reviewing the situation in relation to Huawei and 5G, in the light of US sanctions, and will report in due course. I am sure that the House will be updated as soon as that review is concluded.</p> <p pid="d332.0/7">Above all, this is an important moment when we agree across the House on the strategic point that we all wish to make, which is that there has been a clear and serious violation of the joint declaration, that we must honour our obligations to BNOs and that we must work with our international partners to build the widest caucus and coalition of like-minded countries who say&#8212;not just on the issue of Hong Kong but on the wider question of trust&#8212;that China must live up to its international responsibilities.</p>            </div>

As the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> will know, that is supported by about two thirds of UK people, according to a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Research_Group">China Research Group</a> poll published this morning.</p> <p pid="d333.0/2">The extraterritorial nature of the legislation has direct implications for our own university sector and freedom of speech in our academic institutions, as Chinese students have already been influenced to silence debate and change outcomes here in the UK. The legislation also raises questions about our legal system because, as the  <a href="/glossary/?gl=137" title="The shadow cabinet is the name given to the group of senior members from..." class="glossary">shadow</a> Foreign Secretary said, British judges sit in judgment in Hong Kong. How can they defend civil and commercial rights if those rights are being violated by the very law they are sent to uphold?</p> <p pid="d333.0/3">We are watching this spread to other areas.

Friend <a href="/mp/?p=11859" title="Our page on Jeremy Hunt - 'the Member for South West Surrey (Jeremy Hunt)'">Jeremy Hunt</a>, has pointed out. The removal of the word &#8220;peaceful&#8221; in reference to the bringing together of China by the time the Communist party is 100 years old is a big change.

That is a testament to the leadership of the Foreign Office and our diplomatic network.

A couple of years before that, the then Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington, resigned after the unilateral invasion of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands">Falkland Islands</a> by Argentina, describing the action as a &#8220;humiliating affront&#8221;. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> is not just a party to this agreement but a guarantor&#8212;a guarantor of the rights of Hongkongers and of one country, two systems. Beijing has ripped up this treaty in the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s face, in full view of the international community. No amount of shiny new planes can disguise the fact that this is a humiliating affront both for global Britain and for the Foreign Secretary personally.</p> <p pid="d334.1/3">On the substance of the statement, I agree with and support the one point of note about accelerating <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a> passport holders&#8217; status. I would point out, though, that when the people of west Berlin were threatened by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USSR">USSR</a>, the international community did not offer them  safe passage out; the international community worked a bit harder. It is good that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament">European Parliament</a>, at least, has been active in its defence of international law, passing only last Friday a very strong motion urging that the EU should lodge an action against China in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice">International Court of Justice</a> to hold it to account for its breach of international law. It is remarkable that the European Parliament and the European Union are rather more active on this than the UK has been. Will the Foreign Secretary commit to join that action in the International Court of Justice?</p> <p pid="d334.1/4">I welcome the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s words on the Magnitsky legislation, but it has been a long time coming. Will he now, finally, open active consideration of targeted sanctions against China and Chinese companies active within the UK, because it is quite obvious that only internationally concerted action will bring China to account, and quite clear that it pays global Britain no heed whatsoever?</p>            </div>

It is always a pleasure to be lectured by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNP">SNP</a> on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>. Amidst all the differences that we may have, I think we agree on the fundamental points of principle at stake in relation to our commitment to BNOs and the people of Hong Kong.</p> <p pid="d335.0/2">The hon. Gentleman said that the EU had been more active than the United Kingdom, which is nonsense. However, we do welcome the fact that the EU, which has different views among member states in relation to China and the specific issue of Hong Kong, is being more active. I was in Berlin recently to meet my French and German opposite numbers. One of the issues that we work together on, including within the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</a>, is taking as clear a position on Hong Kong as possible. We will continue to work on that. It is incredibly important that it is not just a small minority of western states making this point, because China will seek to ignore that. That is why we have tried to expand it as broadly as we can, as we did in the Human Rights Council only yesterday.</p> <p pid="d335.0/3">I was not entirely clear what the hon. Gentleman was suggesting beyond proposals that the Government have already indicated they will make, but if he does, in due course, want to come back with something specific, I would be very happy to consider it.</p> <p pid="d335.0/4">In relation to Magnitsky, these were proposals of the Conservative party in our manifesto back in December.

That is exactly what we have had today on the key issue at stake, and I welcome his contribution to that. I also agree that it is heartbreaking to see the scenes in Hong Kong, just hours after the enactment of this national security legislation. We are counselling the Hong Kong authorities and Beijing to step back, but it is clear that, having enacted this legislation, they wish to proceed. We will need to wait to see the precise application and enforcement of this action before deciding some of the measures that we might take next, but these are under active consideration, including with our international partners.</p> <p pid="d336.1/2">I took the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point about BNOs. The full details will be set before the House by the Home Secretary, but we are very clear with our commitment to provide a path to citizenship for all eligible <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO">BNO</a>-status holders and we will do the right thing by all of them. I have been very clear in relation to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSBC">HSBC</a> and I will say the same thing in relation to all of the banks.

She has performed exceptionally well. He asked, in particular, about media freedoms. He will know, because it was established under his tenure rather than mine, that we have a media freedom campaign, which we, along with the Canadians, lead. We are swelling the ranks of that. It provides support for countries that want to protect media freedoms, and it also provides support for journalists. We also have a campaign to protect freedom of religious belief and the  third element of this will be the Magnitsky sanctions regime, which I will bring before the House with the first designations before the summer recess.</p>            </div>

The great thing about Hong Kong is that it has one foot in China and another in the west. When we look at financial services, we can see that that is a huge advantage to the people of Hong Kong. This law could now see many people considering withdrawing their money out of Hong Kong&#8217;s money markets and financial services, possibly moving it to Tokyo, Singapore, or perhaps Shanghai. I wonder whether this is a little gambit by the Chinese authorities to reduce the money-making influence of Hong Kong in the world.</p>            </div>

Friend is right: Hong Kong has long been regarded as the jewel in the financial crown. Of course, its relative economic importance has ebbed overtime as China has developed economically, but the reality is that the steps that have been taken are clearly counterproductive to China&#8217;s own self-interest in economic terms. What we are seeing clearly is China putting the political imperative to control Hong Kong and other so-called restive provinces of China over its economic interests. In any event, regardless of the financial circumstances, there is a point of principle at stake here based on their freedoms, their autonomy and the commitments under international law that China has signed up to. If it wants to be a leading member of the international community, it must live up to the international responsibilities and the international obligations that it undertakes.</p>            </div>

It is China&#8217;s failure to live up to its responsibilities that is at fault and at stake here, and it is important that we have unanimity across the House on this critical point&#8212;otherwise, the truth is that we just weaken our message in Beijing.</p>            </div>

Of course, as well as the people of Hong Kong, investors and other people who might wish to visit Hong Kong, and who ordinarily would have done so, will be looking very carefully, not least given the extraterritorial elements of this law, at what it will mean. At the very least, above all the points that have been made in the Chamber today, it will risk a further range of uncertainty for businesses and for finance into Hong Kong and, as I said, that must be counterproductive not just for the people of Hong Kong and those investors, but for China.</p>            </div>

Of course, given its size and the economic asymmetry, we need to think very carefully with all our international partners about how we proceed. We do not want to have a poor relationship with China; we want a positive relationship with China. However, one thing is clear: we will not duck issues such as human rights, our values or issues that touch on a vital national interests.</p>            </div>

It is right that the public support this, and the scale of that public support, given the issue, is I think remarkable. It is a tribute to the open-heartedness of the British people and to their sense of history and responsibility. He raised a range of other issues that are clearly trying to tempt me to give him a foresight of what may be in the Magnitsky legislation, which is coming. He will have to wait a little longer, but it will come before the summer recess.</p>            </div>

Of course, the legislation has only been in place for a day.

It is double -edged: there are opportunities as well as risks&#8212;not just on trade, but on climate change, as he will know given the strong development angle. I think that he is absolutely right to say that we want a positive relationship. We do not want it to deteriorate or to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Friend for his statement and clear leadership here and in the UN and for the Magnitsky arrangements he intends to bring forward. I remind him and others that China thinks that Hong Kong is collateral damage, which it can happily sweep to one side. The truth is that China sees itself as engaged in an ideological battle about how Governments should be formed, and it dismisses the rules-based order of the west. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese">The Chinese</a> have made that very clear, and they have a strategic view on it. So does my right hon. Friend agree that it is time for us to bring the free world together, not just to complain or to get rapporteurs, but to hit China in the one place it worries about&#8212;its economy? We have run to China to buy goods and to invest; it is time we reviewed every single programme here in the UK and around the free world. We learned a lesson 80 years ago about the appeasement of dictators. Maybe it should be applied today.</p>            </div>

Friend makes on China, which he follows very closely. He is right that we have special responsibilities to the BNOs. We look at the relationship right across the board&#8212;every aspect of it&#8212;through the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Council">National Security Council</a>, in the Foreign Office and more broadly across <a href="/glossary/?gl=101" title="Whitehall is a wide road that runs through the heart of Westminster,..." class="glossary">Whitehall</a>. I personally do not agree with the cold war analogy he has provided. I think that not only the opportunities, but the challenges that China presents in the 21st century are different, partly as a result of technology and such things as cyber and partly just because of the unique nature of China as a country. We want a positive relationship. I and the Government do not want a bad relationship to become a self-fulfilling prophecy, but what is equally clear&#8212;I can reassure my hon. Friend of this&#8212;is that we will not  do anything that imperils our vital interests, and we will not lie down and sacrifice our values for the purposes of trade, commerce or anything like that.</p>            </div>
