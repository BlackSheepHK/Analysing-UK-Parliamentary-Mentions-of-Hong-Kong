My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=25691" title="Our page on Matt Rodda - 'the Member for Reading East (Matt Rodda)'">Matt Rodda</a> has worked tirelessly to support his constituents. It is a terrible shock to the whole community.</p> <p pid="b1467.3/3">It is unlike the Leader of the House not to answer some of my questions, but answers were wholly absent last week, so let me ask again. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> names are in for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a>, but it seems that the Government names were in and then they were out. It is quite careless to lose two experienced members of the Committee&#8212;the right hon. Members for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemel_Hempstead">Hemel Hempstead</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Mike_Penning">Sir Mike Penning</a>) and for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipping_Barnet">Chipping Barnet</a> (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_Villiers">Theresa Villiers</a>). The delay seems to be on the Government side, so could the Leader of the House update the House? Will the Committee members all have a letter of comfort from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> that they will not be sacked if they vote against the Government? When will the Committee be set up? The list of ministerial responsibilities that I have is dated October 2019. Could the Leader of the House ensure that there is an updated document?</p> <p pid="b1467.3/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leader">The Leader</a> of the House is usually very courteous, but there was no mention in the Houser of the merger of the Select Committee on International Development into the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> Committee, other than the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> coming to the House. It was extremely chaotic, as the Chair of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Development_Committee">International Development Committee</a> was only told an hour before the announcement. It is not very female friendly, is it&#8212;losing a female <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> Minister, and then losing a female Chair of a Select Committee? And it is one of our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committees">Select Committees</a>, too. When will the Leader of the House come here with an appropriate mechanism whereby that Committee can hold the Government to account over their work and in relation to money?</p> <p pid="b1467.3/5">It is the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Education&#8217;s birthday today; we wish him a very happy birthday. The Government have allocated &#163;1 billion for pupils to catch up, including &#163;650 million for primary and secondary schools&#8212;but that is for the academic year 2020-21&#8212;and &#163;350 million for primary tutors with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Tutoring_Programme">National Tutoring Programme</a>. That seems incredibly bureaucratic. Why can the money not go straight to the heads, given that they know exactly what is needed for their schools? Worse still,  16 to 19-year-olds and pre-schoolers have been excluded. Will the Leader of the House ask the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Secretary">Education Secretary</a> to come to the House to clarify that? I think the Prime Minister allocated &#163;120 million following our Opposition day debate last week, but there is also &#163;9 million that has been allocated to schools for summer food and activities. My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=11647" title="Our page on Diana R. Johnson - 'the Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Dame Diana Johnson)'">Dame Diana Johnson</a> has asked whether that is still available and whether communities still have to bid for that money. We definitely need a statement clarifying that.</p> <p pid="b1467.3/6">Will the Leader of the House find time for us to debate the report from the Childhood Trust that says that children are suffering post-traumatic stress because of the coronavirus? Why on earth, then, are the Government introducing the reception baseline assessment for four-year-olds? They have been through lockdown, some have been through bereavement and some of their parents are key workers. Will he please ask the Education Secretary to reverse that decision?</p> <p pid="b1467.3/7">The Government response to covid has led us a merry dance&#8212;slow, slow, quick quick. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prime_Minister">The Prime Minister</a> said on Friday that the country was moving from a &#8220;huge one-size-fits-all&#8221; to a &#8220;more localised&#8221; response, leaving public health officials baffled as to why the Government will not share the data. How can local communities and authorities respond when they do not have the information? Will the Leader of the House ensure that this information is disseminated to local authorities? And how do we get our information now that the press conferences have been cancelled? Do we table more written parliamentary questions? The scientists are saying that the crisis is not over, so could we have a weekly oral statement on what is happening with the coronavirus pandemic?</p> <p pid="b1467.3/8">The Leader of the House will say to me that there are <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCO">FCO</a> questions next week, but may I ask for the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a> to make a statement on Nazanin, Anousheh and Kylie? They must be released soon.</p> <p pid="b1467.3/9">Finally, on behalf of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty">Her Majesty</a>&#8217;s Opposition&#8212;and probably the whole House&#8212;may I ask the Leader of the House to convey our thoughts and prayers to <a href="/mp/?p=10473" title="Our page on Owen Paterson - 'the right hon.

I will certainly convey the condolences of the whole House to my right hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10473" title="Our page on Owen Paterson - 'the Member for North Shropshire (Mr Paterson)'">Mr Paterson</a> at this saddest of all possible times. He is in all our thoughts and prayers.</p> <p pid="b1468.0/2">I will also answer with regard to Nazanin, Kylie and Anousheh because the right hon. Lady is quite right to keep on raising this issue. Kylie is being dealt with by the Australian authorities, in agreement with them, and not by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a> at the moment. Nazanin  continues to have representations made on her behalf by the British authorities, and that will continue. As the right hon. Lady knows, she is currently out of prison on temporary release. We hope that that will lead to permanent release, and that she will be able to be fully reunited with her family. We say the same in relation to all the arbitrarily detained <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> persons in Iran. The right hon. Lady&#8217;s efforts to secure their release are entirely admirable.</p> <p pid="b1468.0/3">The right hon. Lady, as usual, asks a long list of questions, which I will come to. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC">ISC</a> is going through the normal processes and we look forward to its being set up in due course. I hope that a motion will be brought before this House in due course. I had better not go into the discussions as to who is going in and out, whose lists are going where and which Members of which parties and what parties may or may not be putting their names forward, having their names taken off or putting their names back on again. I am not entirely sure that it is a one-way street in this regard, but let me leave it at that.</p> <p pid="b1468.0/4">The right hon Lady asks about the list of ministerial responsibilities. They were last issued in October and they are updated periodically. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> Office is in charge of that and will I am sure come forward in the fullness of time with an up-to-date list to help and assist and to ensure smooth communication with Members, so they know exactly who they ought to be writing to.</p> <p pid="b1468.0/5">On the merger of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Development_Committee">International Development Committee</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Committee">Foreign Affairs Committee</a>, discussions are going on within the House. My hon. Friend <a href="/mp/?p=10312" title="Our page on Bernard Jenkin - 'the Member for Harwich and North Essex (Sir Bernard Jenkin)'">Sir Bernard Jenkin</a>, the Chairman of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaison_Committee">Liaison Committee</a>, is, I know, involved in discussions with the various interested parties. I note the point the right hon. Lady makes about its being a Labour chairmanship that has been lost, and there are standard procedures in accordance with that, of which the Government are aware. However, I would stress that it is right that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committees">Select Committees</a> follow Departments, otherwise we would end up with Select Committees that related to Departments that might have been removed years and years ago. For the House to ensure proper scrutiny, I think that principle is an important one.</p> <p pid="b1468.0/6">I am delighted that the right hon. Lady wants to wish my right hon. Friend the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a> for Education a happy birthday. Can I remind the House that, apparently, if you sing &#8220;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Birthday">Happy Birthday</a>&#8221; twice while washing your hands, that helps defeat the coronavirus? I prefer to stick to the national anthem, rather than &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; twice, but it has the same effect. I am sure many <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_the_House">Members of the House</a> will be singing &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; many times today, and will be thinking of my right hon. Friend and the marvellous job he has done in giving &#163;650 million to headmasters and headmistresses up and down the country to spend on getting pupils back up to speed.

I asked when that request, backed by four out of five parties in Scotland, would be considered by this Parliament, and I did not get an answer. This week, we saw the publication of the report by the independent economic recovery group in Scotland, a mainly private sector perspective. Guess what its first recommendation was? It was also to loosen the financial straitjacket that  constrains the Scottish Parliament. We do need to discuss this. The financial set-up of devolution was not designed to deal with the type of problems the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government">Scottish Government</a> now face, and platitudes about how wonderful the Union is will not address this serious problem.</p> <p pid="b1470.2/3">May I ask about hospitality and entertainment, and I refer to my entry in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests?

I know we have difficulty in getting the <a href="/glossary/?gl=170" title="The Chancellor - also known as &quot;Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; is responsible..." class="glossary">Chancellor</a> to write a letter, but will the Leader of the House persuade him to come to this House and say what he intends to do beyond October?</p> <p pid="b1470.2/4">We have six days left in which to seek an extension of the Brexit transition period.

Why will the Leader of the House not allow the House time to consider extending the time available? Does he not realise that the Government&#8217;s Canute-like stance on this matter is looking increasingly foolhardy and cavalier, even to those who support leaving the European Union?</p>            </div>

We are very lucky in the staff we have in <a href="/glossary/?gl=239" title="The House of Commons." class="glossary">this place</a>, who have a wonderful pride in the Parliament in which they work. They know that this is one of the greatest, most ancient, most historic forums of democratic debate in the world, and most of them are proud to be here. However, those who are not well enough to come or who have to shield are being looked after, which is absolutely right and proper. We have gone away from a fully hybrid system and come back to physical working to ensure that business takes place, but we have ensured that people who cannot be here for a range of reasons can vote by proxy and that they can participate in interrogative proceedings.

People have been locked in for quite long enough and they want to go and have a drink, which is a jolly good thing and should be encouraged and welcomed. They will do it safely and properly. I am disappointed by the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s slightly curmudgeonly attitude  towards the pubs being reopened. As regards other things, they must be opened in a phased way. There is a degree of risk that can be taken, but that risk must be managed and measured. Of course the Government want things to open up more, and that is being implemented as far as it is safe to do, but it has to be in an orderly way.</p>            </div>

However, a wide range of factors have affected death rates in different countries.

I hope I can assure the hon. Lady that tackling knife crime  is one of the Government&#8217;s absolute priorities. The Government are supporting the police to tackle these crimes: the amount of funding available to the policing system for 2020-21 will increase by more than &#163;1.1 billion, totalling &#163;15.2 billion, and we have committed to recruit 20,000 new police officers over the next three years. Furthermore, we are introducing a new court order to give the police new stop-and-search powers in respect of anybody serving all or part of their sentence for a knife-possession offence in the community. That will increase the likelihood of such offenders being stopped and send a strong message that if they persist in carrying a knife, they will be punished and will face a custodial sentence.</p> <p pid="b1477.1/3">I fear that what we say about what we will do in future is of remarkably little comfort to the families who are bereaved, but perhaps there is some comfort in how seriously the issue is taken and in the fact that what they have suffered will be a spur for action, not just from the Government but from the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> and from all across the House, to try to tackle this terrible scourge.</p>            </div>

May we have a debate on how we hold trusts accountable? I have tried several times with Adjournment debates and have asked the Leader of the House about this issue. Many Members of this House have said to me that they feel frustrated that they cannot hold their own local health trusts to account when things like this are going on. This is nothing to do with the frontline&#8212;it is nothing to do with the brilliant work that has been going on over years and in respect of covid; it is to do with the management of trusts and how we can hold them to account.</p>            </div>

I will reiterate what the Government have said so far. Our approach to China remains clear-eyed and rooted in our values and our interests. That particularly means upholding the joint declaration, which China signed with us in good faith to protect the liberties of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> for 50 years from 1997. If the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> do not honour that commitment, there is a route map to support British nationals (overseas). Of course, more details will be brought forward depending on whether China implements its law, but the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government">British Government</a> strongly urge the Chinese Government to respect in good faith the joint declaration.</p>            </div>

The restoration of our ancient freedoms that have never previously been so restricted is clearly the proper approach for the Government to be taking.

[Interruption.] Yes, in my case, it is imaginary&#8212;they always unfairly turn me down.

Unfortunately, the situation across the country has not been great for potential cancer sufferers: I believe that 290,000 urgent referrals for suspected cancer were not sent out during this period; 1.2 million screening invites for bowel cancer, breast cancer and cervical cancer have not been sent out; chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery has often been cancelled or delayed for a long time; and lots of clinical trials have been put on hold. So may we have a specific debate on cancer and coronavirus? We really need to get back on track on this. Otherwise, there will be more excess deaths from cancer than from coronavirus.</p>            </div>

It is good to see questions being raised about the leasehold mis-selling scandal and to see other Members, on both sides, raise concerns about all sorts of issues that leaseholders face, particularly in major apartment blocks. May we therefore urgently have a comprehensive and full debate about the responsibilities of building developers and their liability for building defects, including in my <a href="/glossary/?gl=169" title="In a general election, each Constituency chooses an MP to represent them...." class="glossary">constituency</a>? Leaseholders are having to deal with a shabby situation. These issues often relate not just to fire safety, but to the actual construction of buildings, to water and to all sorts of other things. The situation is completely unacceptable.</p>            </div>

It is perfectly practical with interrogative proceedings, but debates and interventions are different. I believe that this is being looked into, but we have a system that is working. It is delivering the legislation that is needed. I can reassure the hon. Lady that the Government have said that shielded people will be free to return to their full activities after the end of July, so after the summer recess, people will be able to come back into this House.</p>            </div>
