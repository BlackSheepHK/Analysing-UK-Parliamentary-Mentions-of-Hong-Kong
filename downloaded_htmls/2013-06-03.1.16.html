We visited Beijing last week at the invitation of Vice-Premier Madam Liu Yandong.&#160; This followed her successful visit to Belfast last April.&#160; Since her visit, Madam Liu Yandong has been promoted to vice-premier of the People's Republic of China, with overall responsibility for education, health, culture, science and technology.&#160; We were delighted to be able to secure a meeting with her, and, in fact, we were the first Ministers from this part of the world whom Madam Liu Yandong has agreed to meet since her promotion.</p> <p>I also want to take the opportunity to thank president Li and her colleagues from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_People">Chinese People</a>'s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries for their hospitality and for helping to manage the diplomatic protocols involved in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government-to-Government">Government-to-Government</a> visits.&#160; The association is also responsible for identifying and inviting foreign Governments and Ministers to China as part of a long-term relationship.</p> <p>During our meeting, president Li issued an invitation to our <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Agriculture, Michelle O&#8217;Neill, to lead a delegation to an invitation-only Sino-European conference in China later this year.&#160; Members will be aware that there is enormous potential for our agrifood sector and agricultural sciences in China, and we see this as an important step in the process of getting our goods and services into China.</p> <p>The visit also enabled us to build on our successful visit to Shanghai and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a> last November and has left the Chinese authorities in no doubt as to our commitment to building and maintaining a strong relationship with their country.&#160; It was also a pleasure to renew our friendship with Madam Liu Yandong and to open up discussions in her new role as vice-premier.&#160; At our meeting, the vice-premier confirmed that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> welcomed our visit last November and viewed this as a strong commitment by us to developing a mutually beneficial relationship with China.&#160; It was also confirmed that China would respond positively and practically to this commitment.&#160; A number of areas were discussed, including trade and investment, education exchanges, health, science and sustainable development partnership work.&#160; We will discuss the opportunities in these sectors with the Ministers responsible and agree on how they can best be developed.</p> <p>Our talks confirmed that China wants to see a strong relationship developing with us and that we should be more active in promoting trade, agrifood, tourism, education and technology partnerships.&#160; China is such a vast country, and its new Government are pursuing a policy of expanding the country&#8217;s economic growth and urbanisation to other regions.&#160; We have been asked to consider how we might get involved with some of those regions.</p> <p>We had discussions about a focused regional partnership with a number of specific regions, and we will continue those conversations with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>.&#160; We also discussed the potential for opening a bureau representing our Executive in Beijing, and we will explore that with Executive colleagues in the near future. </p> <p>We met the deputy foreign affairs Minister, Song Tao, who also confirmed that our visit in November was seen as a demonstration of our desire to build a mutually beneficial relationship with China.&#160; He confirmed that China, in turn, values that relationship and wants to make progress towards a number of pragmatic exchanges.&#160; Minister Song was aware of the peace and political process that we have been through here.&#160; He outlined one of the Chinese Government&#8217;s foreign relations commitments to building a peaceful world, encouraged us to continue to share our experience with other countries and regions and said that China wanted to hear more about that work in the future.&#160; Our talks also considered a range of other issues, including political development, the economy, culture and security.&#160; That, again, highlighted the many regions in China with different characteristics and opportunities for future work.&#160; </p> <p>A key focus of our future work with China will be to promote economic benefits, and we met the director general of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Commerce">Ministry of Commerce</a>, Sun Yongfu.&#160; We discussed a number of issues, including removing barriers and bureaucracy in trade, which would lead to economic benefits and jobs that, in turn, would help to improve relations between countries and regions.</p> <p>China is an important and growing export market for our local companies.&#160; This market is currently worth in excess of &#163;110 million to us in exports by companies to China, and it sustains valuable employment.&#160; China spends trillions of dollars on importing goods and services, and we are, therefore, determined to increase our levels of trade, increase our share of the market and raise our profile there generally.</p> <p>At our meeting with director general Sun, a number of sectors were identified as being of particular interest, including agrifoods, animal husbandry, food safety, software, engineering and services.&#160; We are also looking at investment, and we have invited the Ministry to consider bringing potential investors to Belfast later this year or early next year.&#160; There are also now over 80 million Chinese tourists each year, and we need to get more of them to visit us here.&#160; That means that we have to be more proactive in creating awareness and in promoting our brand in China in the future.</p> <p>Education is important in developing links with countries and has the potential to contribute to our economy, technology and health objectives.&#160; We met the Minister of Education, Yuan Guiren, and we know that there are around seven million Chinese university students keen to study abroad.&#160; We discussed how we could attract more of them to come and study here.&#160; We have two internationally renowned universities, and we want to help them to get more access to Chinese overseas scholarships.&#160; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minister">The Minister</a> also stressed China&#8217;s desire to get more people to acquire vocational skills and said that they were very interested in the work of our colleges here.&#160; Our education system is something that China has started to examine and wants to learn more about.&#160; I believe that we can facilitate that with an expansion in education exchanges.</p> <p>Throughout our discussions with Ministers, it was made clear to us that China needs to know more about what we can offer.&#160; We need to do more to get our message out in China.&#160; That requires Ministers and other stakeholders to visit China about specific issues and to try to get some of the 80 million Chinese tourists who travel the world to visit us, to get more of the $50 trillion the Chinese spend on imports and to attract some of its $9 billion in overseas investment.&#160; We are determined to continue working with the Chinese Government and their officials to ensure that we can capture a significant slice of those markets.&#160; Following our visit, we are encouraged by the growing relationship that we have with China.&#160; We hope to further that relationship, and we will discuss with our Executive colleagues the possibility of opening a bureau in Beijing and developing regional links for future trade opportunities.</p>            </div>
