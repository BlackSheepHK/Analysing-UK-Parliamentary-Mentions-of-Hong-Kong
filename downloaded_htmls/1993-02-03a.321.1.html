My right hon. Friend the Member for Bridgwater (Mr. King) set out our plans for Britain's Army for the 1990s in June and July 1991. Those reflected the United Kingdom's leadership of, and substantial contribution to, the new <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_Command_Europe_Rapid_Reaction_Corps">Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps</a>, as well as the need to provide for the direct defence of the United Kingdom, our responsibilities in our dependent territories and elsewhere and our continued support of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Ulster_Constabulary">Royal Ulster Constabulary</a> in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. He envisaged at that time that there would be some 116,000 regular personnel in <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a> by the mid-1990s. That figure included some 12,000 personnel under training, giving a total trained strength of around 104,000.</p> <p>
Both he and I have repeatedly emphasised the importance we attach to ensuring that the armed forces are able to respond to the demands we place upon them. The requirement to allow sufficient leeway to deal with the unexpected was one of the major considerations underpinning the original work on ?<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Options_for_Change">Options for Change</a>?. My predecessor and I have also made it clear that we shall keep the position under review and that, should we judge it necessary to look again at planned force levels and the balance between capabilities, we shall do so.</p> <p>
The judgments made in ?Options for Change? remain valid. The threat to our national security is much less than it was. Since 1991, however, there have been a number of developments which have added significantly to the commitments that the Army is required to meet at the same time as it is in the process of reorganising. Additional battalions have been deployed to Northern Ireland, and our overall contribution to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a> peacekeeping tasks&#8212;in Cyprus, Cambodia, the former republic of Yugoslavia and elsewhere&#8212;has almost trebled.</p> <p>
The effect of these additional commitments, combined with the disruption caused by the restructuring and drawdown, is placing increasing pressure on individual soldiers and their families. This is something about which many hon. Members have understandably expressed concern. As planning for the Rapid Reaction Corps and other elements of the force structure has been taken forward, a number of requirements for additional manpower have also been identified.</p> <p>
Against that background, I have been considering for a number of months, with my military advisers, the need to adjust the force levels set out by my right hon. Friend. I have concluded that there is a case for an adjustment in the planned strength of the Army. I am therefore announcing today measures which, together with initiatives already in train, will make available 5,000 additional men and women for the front line units of the field Army.</p> <p>
First, I am announcing that the planned strength of the Army in the mid-1990s should be increased by 3,000 to 119,000. In determining how to use that additional manpower, I have been influenced by two considerations. The first is that it is desirable to bring up to strength a number of units which would otherwise have to be reinforced in order to undertake their peacetime operational commitments; a significant proportion of the additional manpower will be used for that purpose.</p> <p>
The second consideration is that the Government attach importance to increasing the emergency tour interval towards the target of 24 months, to which we remain committed. That can best be achieved by revising the number of battalions that will be available in future. I have decided therefore to permit the retention of two further infantry battalions. There will therefore now be a total of 40 battalions&#8212;including two Gurkha&#8212;in 1998, compared with the 38 previously planned. That will have the effect of increasing the average interval between emergency tours from 15 to 17 months this year and providing an additional margin above 24 months once restructuring is complete, which would make it easier to accommodate any further commitments.</p> <p>
I come now to how the two additional battalions which I have consulted the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_General_Staff">Chief of the General Staff</a> and my other colleagues on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Board">Army Board</a> of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Council">Defence Council</a>. After considering all the reductions currently under way or planned, it is our unanimous view that the amalgamations of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire_Regiment">Cheshire Regiment</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staffordshire_Regiment">Staffordshire Regiment</a> and of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Scots">Royal Scots</a> and the King's Own Scottish Borderers should not now proceed.</p> <p>
The funding for that additional manpower will be met from within the financial provision announced for defence in the November 1992 autumn statement. We are at present considering the consequences for the armed forces of the financial provision available. Today's announcement will make those decisions more difficult, but I am in no doubt that the need to increase Army manpower is the highest priority currently facing my Department.</p> <p>
This leads to the second area where extra manpower will be released. As well as the increase of 3,000 in the total size of the Army, the development of detailed plans for reorganisation, and the implementation of market testing and other initiatives aimed at improving efficiency should release approximately a further 2,000 personnel, mainly from the support area, over the next few years. Some of that manpower will be available for redeployment to field army units.</p> <p>
While it is important that the armed forces should be large enough to carry out the tasks required of them, manpower is a very expensive resource and I do not believe that it is sensible in terms of the overall defence programme and profile to view their size as permanently fixed. I will continue to keep the long-term strength of the Army under close review in the light of changing circumstances. Such circumstances will include any changes to current and foreseeable operational commitments, including the planned withdrawal from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>.</p> <p>
More generally, they will also include further progress with the Government's market testing and other initiatives, which should help us to reduce our requirement for service and civilian manpower across the programme. It is also important that senior commanders should have the flexibility to decide on the balance of manpower and other resources that they use to meet the objectives placed on them. Finally, following the publication last year of the open Government document on the future use of reserves, we have yet to complete our studies of how best to integrate both regular and volunteer reservists into the post-options force structure. That too will have implications for the long-term strength of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_Army">Regular Army</a>.</p> <p>
In ?Options for Change?, we committed ourselves to an Army which is fully manned, properly supported, and well


equipped. The decisions I have announced today reflect that commitment. I have arrived at those decisions only after several months of consideration with my professional military advisers. It represents a small but sensible adjustment to the planned size of the Army, which will ensure that it has the flexibility and resilience that it needs to meet the challenges of the 1990s and beyond.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>I welcome the <a href="/glossary/?gl=23" title="Secretary of State was originally the title given to the two officials who..." class="glossary">Secretary of State</a>'s statement, as one would the words of any sinner who repenteth. I welcome his admission that the armed forces of this country are over-stretched, but I suggest that this form of crisis management is not really the way to run an army. If the Government have got their sums wrong about the infantry, how can we trust them to have got the figures right overall?</p> <p>
The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">Secretary of State</a>'s announcement, long and complicated as it was, raised many issues of national concern&#8212;among them the key question, what is the extra cost of today?s announcement? The right hon. and learned Gentleman failed to give us the precise figure, although he did make it clear that the cost had to come from within the defence budget. He also admitted that the results of these cuts would be ?difficult decisions ahead?. How can he come to the House to announce such cuts and speak of difficult decisions ahead when he has not yet worked out the consequences of the cuts for the other arms of our services? These strike us as panic measures.</p> <p>
Are we to understand that the Navy's budget is to be cut? Does that mean that the vital helicopter landing ship will not be built, in spite of Government reassurances to the contrary only last week? Or is it the turn of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF">RAF</a>? Will this mean that the mid-term refits of essential aircraft will be delayed?</p> <p>
Will the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> give the House a categorical guarantee that, as a result of this statement, no one serving under fire in Bosnia or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> will be served with his redundancy notice while serving in those theatres?</p> <p>
I have mentioned Northern Ireland. May I press the Secretary of State on that? Will the emergency tours of four months be extended as a result of this statement, or will it be possible to reduce them to the four months originally envisaged? We have a right to know that.</p> <p>
Finally, what is the position of the service personnel due to be made redundant on 25 February?</p> <p>
Given the decision to replace <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a>'s Bedford trucks with DAF models, has today?s announcement that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAF_Trucks">DAF Trucks</a> is to be placed in the hands of administrators had any effect on the Army?s ability to do its job and move its personnel about?</p> <p>
Is not the Secretary of State?s statement merely an acknowledgement of the Government?s failure to have a national strategy for defence? Will he explain why, in the event of momentous strategic change&#8212;the end of the cold war&#8212;the Government have refused to implement a full-scale defence review? Will he now follow the advice of Field Marshal Lord Bramall and of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a> on Defence, who have joined the Labour party in calling for such a review?</p> <p>
Does not today's statement merely confirm that ?<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Options_for_Change">Options for Change</a>? was merely a response to Treasury diktats, not a policy to defend Britain and the free world?</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p>The hon. Gentleman's reference to repenting sinners comes well from a former member of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a> who now projects himself as the champion of the armed forces. Such remarks also come ill from representatives of a party which, at its last conference, once again called for a 25 per cent. reduction in the defence budget but which now seeks to chastise the Government.</p> <p>
Notwithstanding his pedigree, the hon. Gentleman asked a number of perfectly reasonable questions to which I shall now be happy to respond. He asked about the cost of today?s announcement. It will be about &#163;80 million in a full year. That &#163;80 million is a significant sum, but it should be put into perspective. It represents about one third of 1 per cent. of the defence budget. At the moment, we are involved, as we are every year at this stage, in reconciling the resources that have been provided as a result of the public expenditure round with the continuing programme of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence">Ministry of Defence</a>. That programme has to be assessed annually. Today?s announcement has been included in that review and, in due course, we shall reach conclusions about any adjustments in the programme that will prove necessary.</p> <p>
I am aware of various press reports about individual procurement items and whether they affect one service or another. No decisions have been reached, nor do I anticipate any for some time on any of these matters. As I said in my statement, of course there will be difficult decisions. They would have been necessary irrespective of the statement, and that continues to be the case.</p> <p>
The hon. Gentleman asked about redundancies, and he must also put that in the proper perspective. As a result of ?<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Options_for_Change">Options for Change</a>?, the overall size of <a href="/glossary/?gl=100" title="http://www.army.mod.uk/" class="glossary">the Army</a> is coming down substantially from 156,000. That means an overall reduction before today?s announcement of some 40,000. Today's announcement could have some implications, but clearly they will not be profound, because of the factors to which I have referred. It is of course welcome that most of the redundancies that are likely to arise will be voluntary, and that the number of compulsory redundancies will be relatively small.</p> <p>
The hon. Gentleman asked about a defence review. I have said on numerous occasions that ?Option for Change? was itself a comprehensive assessment of the needs facing our armed forces. The assumptions of ?Options for Change? remain valid because of the way in which the international situation has developed. The adjustments that I have announced will make a useful contribution to relieving some of the pressures on our armed forces. They will be warmly welcomed, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for welcoming them.</p>            </div>

He will also be well aware that our conclusions were comprehensively leaked to ?News at Ten? last week and will therefore know that my Committee wished for substantially more than my right hon. and learned Friend has offered. None the less, I wholeheartedly welcome his statement and thank him for showing the flexibility of being prepared to move towards the level of manpower that our armed forces need. There is no doubt that his announcement will help in the critical stage that has been reached in the emergency tour plot and


will also help to flesh out the inadequate level of manpower in our existing battalions. The 580 strength that we have had until now was inadequate and adding to it will inestimably help the strength of our armed forces.</p> <p>
I have two questions for my right hon. and learned Friend. First, he was good enough to tell the House that he will remain flexible about further changes should the need arise. It is probably the feeling of the House that in future we may need to increase the level further if the requirements imposed upon us by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a> and the peacekeeping and <a href="/glossary/?gl=39" title="An intervention is when the MP making a speech is interrupted by another MP..." class="glossary">intervention</a> roles that we now play increase. Will he confirm that that matter will be kept under constant review?</p> <p>
Secondly, how will my right hon. and learned Friend assist the reprieved regiments to repair the damage that has already been done to their recruiting ability? What can be done to ensure that they can now recruit back up to strength as soon as possible?</p>            </div>

Notwithstanding today?s announcement, I look forward to the publication of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee">Select Committee</a>?s report so that we can study not only its general conclusions, but its detailed analysis of any specific points that it wishes to draw to our attention. I am sure that it will contain much that is worthy of serious consideration. I assure my hon. Friend that, as I said, we must remain flexible.</p> <p>
The whole point about ?<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Options_for_Change">Options for Change</a>? is that it did not seek to implement its recommendations overnight. Quite deliberately and quite properly, there was to be a gradual implementation over several years, and that has given us the opportunity to monitor not only the implications for the armed forces, but the changing international scene that has led to my announcement.</p> <p>
Of course we all wish to take into account my hon. Friend's points about recruitment in the regions affected by today's announcement. We seek to ensure that it continues to be of a very high order, as it has traditionally been.</p>            </div>

As for the wider issues, of course our armed forces will continue to have difficult problems to resolve as between resources and commitments&#8212;that is true around the world&#8212;but I believe that the fundamental assumption of ?<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Options_for_Change">Options for Change</a>? remains unchallenged. It is no coincidence that, around the world, particularly in the western world, major reductions have been and continue to be implemented.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Kingdom">The United Kingdom</a> still spends perhaps a higher proportion of its gross domestic product on defence

commitments than most countries. I make no apology for that, and a number of reasons could be cited. However, at a time when France, the United States, Germany and other countries&#8212;quite apart from the countries of the old Warsaw pact&#8212;are making major reductions in their defence budgets, it is right and proper for us to do the same, thereby releasing resources for other requirements. It is important to get the balance right, and I believe that the adjustment in manpower that I have announced will help us to do so.</p>            </div>

Our armed forces will always be under pressure; it is the nature of armed forces and the nature of the work that they do.

I believe that the degree to which international events have required the United Kingdom to make a useful and important contribution justify the consideration that we have given to these matters and the decision that we announced today.</p>            </div>
