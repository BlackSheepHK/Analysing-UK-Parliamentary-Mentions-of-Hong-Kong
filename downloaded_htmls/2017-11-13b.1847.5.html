Both the UK and the EU recognised the new dynamic instilled in the talks by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a>&#8217;s Florence speech.</p> <p pid="b1836.5/3">At the October European Council, the 27 member states responded by agreeing to start their preparations for moving the negotiations on to trade and the future relationship we want to see. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Council">The Council</a> conclusions also called for work to continue, with a view to being able to move to the second phase of the negotiations as soon as possible.</p> <p pid="b1836.5/4">It is, of course, inevitable that our discussions are now narrowing to the few outstanding&#8212;albeit important&#8212;issues that remain. Last week, our focus was concentrated on finding solutions to those remaining issues. As we move forward towards the December Council, we have been clear with the EU that we are willing to engage in discussions in a flexible and constructive way in order to achieve the progress needed. To this end, our teams are in continuous contact, even between the formal rounds. I now turn to the three, key, ongoing areas of discussions, and will outline progress made last week on each of these.</p> <p pid="b1836.5/5">We have made solid progress in our ongoing discussions on Northern Ireland and Ireland. Key areas of achievement include: continued progress in technical discussions on preserving north-south co-operation; agreed joint principles on the continuation of the common travel area and associated rights; and drafting further joint principles on how best we preserve north-south co-operation under the Belfast agreement to help guide the specific solutions to the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland. Both sides also remain firmly committed to avoiding a hard border&#8212;a point we have remained clear on throughout. We also remain resolutely committed to upholding the Belfast/<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday">Good Friday</a> agreement, in all its parts, and to finding a solution that works for the people of Northern Ireland and Ireland.</p> <p pid="b1836.5/6">We have continued to hold frank discussions with our Commission counterparts about all these issues. But in this area we have also had to be very clear with our Commission counterparts that, while we respect their desire to protect the legal order of the single market and customs union, that cannot come at the cost of the constitutional or economic integrity of the United Kingdom. As I have said, we cannot create a &#8216;new border&#8217; within the United Kingdom. This is an area where we believe we will only be able to conclude talks finally in the context of our future relationship. Until such time as we can do so, we need to approach the issues which arise with a high degree of political sensitivity, pragmatism and creativity. Discussions on these areas will continue in the run-up to the December Council.</p> <p pid="b1836.5/7">We have continued to make good progress on citizens&#8217; rights. Both sides are working hard towards resolution of outstanding issues. Last week, to respond to the request for reassurances by the EU, we published a detailed description of our proposed administrative procedures for EU citizens seeking settled status in the UK. As our paper demonstrates, the new procedures  will be as streamlined, straightforward and low-cost as possible and will be based on simple, transparent criteria, which will be laid out in the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p pid="b1836.5/8">While there remain differences on the issues of family reunion and the export of benefits, we have been clear that we are willing to consider what further reassurance we can provide to existing families of EU residents here, even if they are not currently living together in the UK. I believe that this paves the way to resolving the remaining issues in this area, and this was acknowledged by the Commission on Friday. There also remain some areas where we are still seeking further movement from the EU. These are voting rights, mutual recognition of qualifications, and onward movement for British citizens currently living in the EU 27. In all of these three areas, the UK&#8217;s offer goes beyond that of the EU.</p> <p pid="b1836.5/9">Finally, the Commission has fallen short of the UK&#8217;s offer in relation to the right to stand and vote in local elections. This is a core citizen&#8217;s right, enshrined in the EU treaties. I have been disappointed that the EU has been unwilling to include voting rights in the withdrawal agreement so far. As a result, we will pursue this issue bilaterally with member states.</p> <p pid="b1836.5/10">This week we have also sought to give further clarity on our commitment to incorporate the agreement we reach on citizens&#8217; rights into UK law. This will ensure that EU citizens in the UK can directly enforce their rights in UK courts, providing certainty and clarity for the long term. We have made it clear that over time, our courts can take account of rulings of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice">European Court of Justice</a> in this area to help to ensure consistent interpretation. However, we remain clear that, as we leave the EU, it is a key priority for the UK to preserve the sovereignty of our courts and, as such, in leaving the EU, we will bring an end to direct jurisdiction of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECJ">ECJ</a>.</p> <p pid="b1836.5/11">It is not my intention to pre-empt the Committee stage of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill but what I say next will have some relevance to it. It is clear that we need to take further steps to provide clarity and certainty, both in the negotiations and at home, regarding the implementation of any agreement in UK law. I can now confirm that, once we have reached an agreement, we will bring forward a specific piece of primary legislation to implement that agreement. This will be known as the withdrawal agreement and implementation Bill. This will confirm that the major policies set out in the withdrawal agreement are directly implemented in UK law by primary legislation, not by secondary legislation under the withdrawal Bill. This also means that Parliament will be given time to debate, scrutinise and vote on the final agreement that we strike with the EU. This agreement will hold only if Parliament approves it.</p> <p pid="b1836.5/12">We expect this Bill to cover the contents of the withdrawal agreement, including issues such as an agreement on citizens&#8217; rights, any financial settlement and the details of an implementation period agreed between both sides. Of course, we do not yet know the exact details of this Bill and are unlikely to do so until the negotiations are near completion.</p> <p pid="b1836.5/13">I should also tell the House that this will be over and above the undertaking that we have already made to bring forward a Motion on the final deal as soon as possible after the deal is agreed, and that we still intend and expect such a vote on the final deal to happen before the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament">European Parliament</a> votes on it. There cannot be any doubt that Parliament will be intimately involved at every stage.</p> <p pid="b1836.5/14">Finally, on the financial settlement, the Prime <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>&#8217;s commitment made in her Florence speech stands: our European partners will not need to pay more or receive less over the remainder of the current budget plan as a result of our decision to leave. The UK will honour the commitments we have made during the period of our membership. This week we made substantial technical progress on the issues which underpin these commitments.</p> <p pid="b1836.5/15">This has been a low-key but important technical set of negotiations, falling, as it has, between two European Councils. This is now about pinpointing further technical discussions that need to take place and moving forward into political discussions and decisions. We must now also look forward to moving our discussions on to our future relationship. For this to happen, both parties need to build confidence in both the process and indeed the shared outcome.</p> <p pid="b1836.5/16"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Kingdom">The United Kingdom</a> will continue to engage and negotiate constructively as we have done since the start, but we need to see flexibility, imagination and willingness to make progress on both sides if these negotiations are to succeed and we are able to realise our new partnership. I commend this Statement to the House&#8221;.</p>            </div>

However, there remain serious questions in regard to the withdrawal Bill and the current negotiations.</p> <p pid="b1839.0/2">First, what on earth is this gimmick of an <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> to fix, down to the exact minute, the timing of our departure from the EU? Is it a panic measure for the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> to reassure doubters in her own party that she can deliver a workable Brexit&#8212;a response perhaps to the Johnson/Gove letter&#8212;rather than a serious piece of British legislation or diplomatic sensitivity, or was she jinxed by the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, or is it to undermine the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> amendment that it should be Parliament, not a Minister, that decides the exit date?</p> <p pid="b1839.0/3">Certainly, the government amendment would have Parliament fix the date, but it would decide it now, well before the withdrawal deal is complete, with imperfect knowledge of what will be needed by way of preparation or even whether a more suitable date, such as <phrase class="date" code="2017-04-05">5 April</phrase>&#8212;the traditional start of our tax year&#8212;is available and with no thought to what might be happening at the time. It does not allow for an earlier date, nor does it give any room for manoeuvre for, for example, another foot and mouth crisis, a <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a> or some other  national issue, let alone any decision by the 27 to extend the talks by a few days if they thought that we were on the edge of a breakthrough.</p> <p pid="b1839.0/4">More seriously, it cuts across the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister">Prime Minister</a>&#8217;s Florence speech, which envisaged that should there be a &#8220;heads of agreement&#8221; on our future relationship with the EU by March 2019, we could contribute to the EU budget for a period, during which we would abide by existing EU processes, including of course the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECJ">ECJ</a> for some matters. However, <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 6, with the Government&#8217;s new amendment, would disallow this from 11 o&#8217;clock on <phrase class="date" code="2017-03-29">29 March</phrase> 2019. Will the Minister agree that it is for Parliament nearer the time to fix the date, not the Prime Minister or even Parliament now, regardless of the interests of business, consumers, the pound or any other contemporary event?</p> <p pid="b1839.0/5">Secondly, on what basis are the Government negotiating if they are blind to the costs and benefits of each option? We thought they had done their homework but we are told now that perhaps those 58 impact assessments do not exist&#8212;they certainly have not been read by all the Ministers. Without these, on what basis are the Government taking decisions about this country&#8217;s future?</p> <p pid="b1839.0/6">Thirdly, will the Minister say whether the Government will heed the excellent advice of his predecessor but one, the noble Lord, Lord Bridges? He has called for &#8220;honesty and clarity&#8221; and that,</p> <p class="indent" pid="b1839.0/7">&#8220;Ministers should stop pretending an implementation period will begin at the end of March 2019&#8221;.</p> <p pid="b1839.0/8">Perhaps I should let the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, speak for himself, but it is too tempting to read out his words. He reminded the Government that implementation implies a treaty, well beyond the withdrawal deal, which will take years to negotiate and requires consent around the 27 parliaments. He urged the Government to clarify what they want to do with this supposed new-found freedom and to put some urgency&#8212;that is the word he used&#8212;into negotiations on the future framework.</p> <p pid="b1839.0/9">Finally, on Northern Ireland, I wonder if the Government are regretting their &#8220;rash and reckless&#8221; ruling out of continued membership of the customs union. Even as the Government accept the introduction of a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK-EU">UK-EU</a> border, albeit as &#8220;seamless and frictionless&#8221; as possible, they must realise that achieving this outside the customs union is a serious challenge. Had the Prime Minister not ruled out membership of the customs union, albeit from outside the European Union, then the apparently intractable conundrum in Northern Ireland might have been avoided, without <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Davis">David Davis</a> having to reassert in this Statement his understandable rejection of a &#8220;new border&#8221; within the United Kingdom.</p> <p pid="b1839.0/10">This week saw the commemoration of <phrase class="date" code="2017-11-11">11 November</phrase>, a World War I date but, for my generation, with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II</a> resonance, and a reminder of all that the EU has done to end conflict in western Europe. We also commemorated the <phrase class="date" code="2017-11-09">9 November</phrase> 1989 fall of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall">Berlin Wall</a> and everything that the EU did to bed-in democracies in former Soviet territories, as earlier it had done with the former dictatorships in Spain, Greece and Portugal. I therefore ask the Minister how much the UK&#8217;s continued and future role in such developments will be  ensured after Brexit, and how much this part of diplomacy features in Ministers&#8217; thinking as they negotiate our future relationship with continental Europe.</p>            </div>

That seems to be rather at odds with everything we have been hearing from Monsieur Barnier and the EU 27. One wonders who has been misled or has misunderstood what has happened in the past few weeks. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretary">The Secretary</a> of State suggested that there has been a narrowing to only a few aspects of the remaining issues, which he then goes onto talk about: the budget and what the United Kingdom will have to pay as the divorce settlement; the rights of EU citizens; and the question of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland_and_Northern_Ireland">Ireland and Northern Ireland</a>. Those are the same three issues that we have been looking at ever since the decision to leave the European Union was taken in June of last year. The idea that there has been a narrowing in these areas is interesting, but it is not yet clear what is really meant. In particular, in the context of the budget, we have heard frequently that the clock is ticking. However, while the clock is ticking, the value of sterling is falling&#8212;and every time sterling falls, the amount of money that the United Kingdom will owe in euros rises.</p> <p pid="b1841.0/3">Instability in the Government is hugely damaging to the United Kingdom&#8217;s negotiations. What is the <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> doing to ensure that her Government become more stable and secure and give a clearer sense to the 27 that they know what they are doing and that they have the same clarity of purpose as the 27? The Secretary of State suggested that it is important that both sides have confidence in the process and the shared outcome. However, the 27 have a clarity of purpose&#8212;we know what they are looking for&#8212;but do they know what the United Kingdom is looking for? It is not yet clear that they do.</p> <p pid="b1841.0/4"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Kingdom">The United Kingdom</a> has been given two weeks to sort out our budget offer. What plans have <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty">Her Majesty</a>&#8217;s Government put in place to ensure a solution so that, by December, progress can be made in phase 2? At present we have heard nothing at all from the Secretary of State. Is the <a href="/glossary/?gl=99" title="The chancellor of the exchequer is the government's chief financial..." class="glossary">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> in the loop? Is his input being asked for, or is the &#8220;flexible and constructive&#8221; approach that the Secretary of State is looking for required only of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister">Prime Minister</a>, with the back-seat drivers of Gove and Johnson telling her what she should say or think?</p> <p pid="b1841.0/5">As the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, suggested, some thought is being given to putting <phrase class="date" code="2017-03-29">29 March</phrase> 2019 in the Bill. Is that perhaps to do with the Brexiteers trying to pull the Prime Minister&#8217;s strings? Putting the date in the Bill is surely one of the worst things the Government could do. It would tie the Prime Minister&#8217;s hands and we should not support it.</p> <p pid="b1841.0/6">In June, when we had the unnecessary <a href="/glossary/?gl=178" title="In a general election, each constituency chooses an MP to represent it by..." class="glossary">general election</a> that was supposed to be a Brexit election, the idea was that we would have a strong and stable Government leading the negotiations. How fanciful that now seems. Can the Minister assure us that the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State and the whole  <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> are united in pushing, with one voice, for the best outcome for the United Kingdom? Do they have clarity of purpose? In getting the best deal for the United Kingdom, can they reassure in particular the citizens of Northern Ireland that the deal will be for the whole of the United Kingdom, and that our kingdom will remain united? It is not the <a href="/glossary/?gl=234" title="The European Commission is the politically independent institution that..." class="glossary">European Commission</a> that is jeopardising the integrity of the United Kingdom but Her Majesty&#8217;s Government&#8217;s unwillingness to have an agreement that will allow Ireland to remain without a closed border.</p> <p pid="b1841.0/7">It is hugely important that the future relationship is clarified. That can be done only if Her Majesty&#8217;s Government have their own view of what that relationship should be. Can the Minister tell the House what the Government&#8217;s view is? Is there any clarity of purpose?</p> <p pid="b1841.0/8">Finally, on citizens&#8217; rights, many of us will welcome the idea that Her Majesty&#8217;s Government would like EU citizens to be able to vote in local elections. However, the Secretary of State points out that this is one of the rights of EU citizens that is enshrined in the treaties. Yes, it is&#8212;many of us passionately believe that we wanted to keep, still want to keep and do not want to throw away the rights of EU citizens. Does <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Davis">David Davis</a> agree with us? Is he reluctant to see British citizens lose their citizenship rights? Would he prefer that the United Kingdom should remain part of the EU treaties? Have we made a huge mistake? Should we retain citizens&#8217; rights by simply not leaving the European Union?</p>            </div>

That date was triggered also by the submission of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_50">Article 50</a> notification letter&#8212;approved by both Houses&#8212;and will be two years from then. The noble Baroness, Lady Smith, is very keen to abide by EU treaties; as she well knows, the two-year date is set down in them, unless it is extended by the unanimous vote of the other 27 EU members. We are leaving the EU on <phrase class="date" code="2017-03-29">29 March</phrase> 2019, implementing the result of the referendum that was also approved in both Houses.</p> <p pid="b1842.0/2">We recognise the need for specific solutions to the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland and we have made good progress in the negotiations. We have proposed that the UK and EU seek to agree text for the withdrawal agreement that recognises the ongoing status of the common travel area and associated reciprocal arrangements. We have developed joint principles on this, and are drafting joint principles and commitments that will guide the solutions drawn up in the second phase. Both sides agree that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday">Good Friday</a> agreement on citizenship rights must be upheld, and we are committed to working together on how that is best codified.</p> <p pid="b1842.0/3">The noble Baroness, Lady Smith, asked me a number of questions. We have a good record: we have compromised in all the areas that the EU has thought to negotiate on. Now it is about time we saw some  compromise from the EU side. We have compromised on both our budget offer and citizens&#8217; rights. It would be nice to see some support from the parties opposite for the UK position. In terms of the budget, billions of pounds of taxpayers&#8217; money are involved. Are the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> saying that we should just hand over a cheque and agree to whatever the <a href="/glossary/?gl=234" title="The European Commission is the politically independent institution that..." class="glossary">European Commission</a> demands? Of course we have to negotiate. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=264" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Ki ngdom" class="glossary">Prime Minister</a> made a very generous offer in her Florence speech, involving considerable amounts of money. Now it is for the EU side to reciprocate with a budget offer of its own. We are very clear that, in all these areas, as set down in the EU negotiations, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. These areas cannot all be sorted until there is a final agreement on the shape of the agreement and future customs arrangements, which will also help to enlighten our discussion on the border in Northern Ireland.</p>            </div>

I presume that we will therefore have to find some way of having a court of arbitration which will mediate between the EU and the UK&#8212;incidentally, it will impact on the sovereignty and integrity of the British judicial system, because that is what courts of arbitration unavoidably do across a whole range of issues. Are the Government confident that they can square that circle, or do they think that taking ourselves out of the European Union and out of the European court, where we currently have a judge, will leave us stronger rather than weaker in our obedience to international law and our ability to negotiate it to our advantage? The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US">US</a> Commerce Secretary has suggested that when we leave the European Union, the Americans will simply expect us to accept US regulations without any say on a range of problems.

May I say to the Minister that I do not agree with his assessment that there is agreement between the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Government">UK Government</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Government">Irish Government</a>? The Irish Government are contradicting the position of the UK Government by saying that we need to remain in the single market and the customs union. Mr Verhofstadt, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament">European Parliament</a>&#8217;s rapporteur, is saying the same thing. They are both wrong, and if that is where we are today, we have a lot of work to do. Will the Minister please confirm that our UK Government will make it absolutely clear that we will not allow an internal border to be created within the United Kingdom? If our time and effort, at this stage, is still being spent arguing about that fundamental point, we have a very long way to go.</p>            </div>

People flying from the Republic of Ireland into Britain are not required to show their passports. From Britain to Ireland, you are required to show your passport, but not from Ireland to Britain. Of course, as a lot of people travel who are not EU citizens, scrutiny of passports is desirable. The idea that scrutinising passports forms a hard border is nonsense: it is no more a hard border, or denying the rights of people in Northern Ireland, to ask them to show their passports than it would be if Members of your Lordships&#8217; House refused to wear their passes on the grounds that they have the right to be here anyway, so why should they wear them?</p>            </div>
