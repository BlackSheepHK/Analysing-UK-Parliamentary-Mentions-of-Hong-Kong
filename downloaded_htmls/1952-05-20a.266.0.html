I should like to make a statement.</p> <p>
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> will be aware that British firms in China have, for reasons beyond their control, been facing for some time past increasing difficulties so far as trade and industry inside China are concerned. These difficulties are partly due to the increasing extent to which many of the functions formerly handled in China by private merchants and industrialists are being taken over by organisations operating on a State basis.</p> <p>
There are, however, other difficulties; for example, the increasing restrictions on the entry and exit of foreign staffs, arbitrary taxation demands and compulsion to retain and pay redundant labour. In these circumstances, many firms have been operating at a loss for a considerable period.</p> <p>
For these reasons, most of the British companies have reluctantly come to the conclusion that they can no longer operate satisfactorily inside China, and that the time has come to arrange for the disposal of their businesses. Many have already decided to apply for closure, custody, transfer, or lease of their various interests, as may be appropriate in each case.</p> <p>
There are likely to be many problems involved and, at the request of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Association">China Association</a>, acting on behalf of the firms concerned, Her Majesty's Government have presented a Note to the Central People's Government of China requesting that all the necessary facilities be made available to ensure that these problems are dealt with expeditiously.</p> <p>
Both Her Majesty's Government and the firms themselves remain convinced of the need and desirability for British trade with China to be continued. The suggestion has been conveyed to the Central

People's Government that the requirements of this trade under the changed conditions in China might perhaps be met by setting up a new form of organisation.</p> <p>
The firms feel that this could take the form of an association of representatives of manufacturers and overseas buyers, who would maintain direct contact with the appropriate Chinese authorities. This body could, in fact, act as a permanent trade organisation.</p> <p>
I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the skill, tenacity and courage of the British Community in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_East">Far East</a>. During the course of their long and honourable connection with China they have contributed greatly to the prosperity of both countries, and much of the traditional goodwill and mutual understanding which has existed between our two countries is also due to them.</p> <p>
The firms concerned have recently had to face increasingly heavy losses, as I have explained, and have been, in many cases, unable to replace their foreign staffs in China, who, as may be imagined, have been working under conditions of acute strain and anxiety. In these circumstnces, it is difficult to see how the firms could have made any other decision.</p> <p>
Her Majesty's Government for their part fully realise the gravity of this step, but they feel that, having regard to the factors which I have outlined, they can only endorse the decision which the firms have taken.</p>            </div>
