It introduces a new disciplinary system for the three armed services and, as Admiral Lord Boyce said recently, the armed forces currently feel under legal siege. Ministers have had months to prepare and it is not right that the Government are now planning to rush the measure through when the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> and those interested in it have had so little time to consider it.

The proposal to which he refers is a worthwhile one, which has commanded a lot of support, and it will be yet another way of ensuring that people can provide for their pensions.

Many of us feel that those are not economically viable, that they represent a real danger and that they should not be resumed. It would be right for the House to have the opportunity to debate that matter.</p> <p pid="b.387.2/3">Can we have a debate on social services?

We do not debate that subject enough in the House, and perhaps we should do so in the near future.</p> <p pid="b.387.2/4">Lastly, can we have a debate on local and regional newspapers?

The first is the provision of proper facilities for the cleaners. I gather that those have been provided, but that for some reason they have not so far been taken up. Secondly, there is a substantial pay rise&#8212;in excess of 15 per cent.&#8212;on the table. No one will lose their job as a result of that pay rise because jobs are available elsewhere, even if not on the Estate and in the House.

Friend may be aware that 28 cancer charities have bonded together to form a cancer campaigning group. Although they recognise the amazing things that have happened under the Government in terms of care, treatment and early diagnosis, there is much more to do. They and many others are of a mind to discuss the possibility of a cancer plan 2 to move things forward. Will my hon.

Everyone is guaranteed a job. If my hon.

These are always difficult decisions. Hon. Members have spoken with a great deal of passion and anger about their personal experiences. Nothing can bring back people who have been killed by terrorists.

That has been one of the causes of the problems in Northern Ireland. I would expect someone with the experience of the right hon.

It is unfortunate that an issue of such importance was not brought to the House as an oral statement. Can my hon.

Previous offenders were in the community with no oversight at all for a substantial part of their sentence. It is important that a more onerous regime for offenders be introduced, so that if they breach licence conditions, they can go back to jail. The problem that the hon. Member highlights, and which was reported, is that young teenagers on a first offence&#8212;I am not sure that mugging was the offence; I think that it was snatching of bags that involves no violence&#8212;may not, under magistrates' guidelines, get an automatic custodial sentence.
