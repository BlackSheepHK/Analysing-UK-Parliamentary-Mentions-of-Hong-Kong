                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> We move on to part 12 of the Bill and the important issue of company secretaries and their continuing role as a consequence of the provisions in part 12. May I welcome the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor-General">Solicitor-General</a>, as I understand he will debate and respond to various issues in relation to company secretaries? As Members will be aware, there has been considerable debate on this issue, particularly in the context of the continuing role of company secretaries in private companies as compared with public companies where the role of company secretary would be retained. I am sure that all members of the Committee will have received a number of e-mails and letters from various interested parties with their views.</p> <p>The <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> is central to that issue and I note the decision to incorporate the stand part debate intothe group of amendments that stand in my name and the names of my hon. Friends the Members for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) and for Reigate (Mr. Blunt). That obviously gives us an opportunity to have a fairly wide-ranging debate on the current role of company secretaries and how the proposed regime would operate as currently contemplated in the Bill. Public company secretaries are to be recognised under the Bill, but not private company secretaries. We can therefore debate the practical implications of that and why we believe that it is not the best way to proceed because of all the issues that would flow from it.</p> <p>It is helpful to give some context as to where company secretaries currently sit in terms of the corporate governance and corporate structures contained in companies up and down the country. The company secretary has an established and understood role in the context of English company law through a combination of statute, case law and years of custom and practice. A company secretary is an officer of the company by virtue of section 744 of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act_1985">Companies Act 1985</a>, is recognised and identifiable through notifications to the registrar of companies by virtue of section 288 of the 1985 Act and as an officer can be held to be criminally liable for defaults permitted by the company. The secretary may also have to make out a statement of the company’s affairs if an administrative receiver or a provisional liquidator is appointed or if a winding-up order is made by virtue of sections 47, 66 and 131 of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency_Act_1986">Insolvency Act 1986</a>.</p> <p>Although not formally prescribed by statute, company secretaries have responsibility for a range of administrative matters within the company for which they may be held liable in the event of default. Those include maintaining the statutory registers of the company, such as the register of shareholders, the register of directors’ interest and the register of charges, ensuring that the company keeps it statutory filings with the registrar of companies up to date, and ensuring that appropriate filings are made within the prescribed statutory time limits. I know that that is one of the key functions provided by company secretaries. It is important in ensuring that companies comply with their ongoing obligations under the Companies Act in terms of their relevant filings with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_House">Companies House</a>, so that the filings are in order, and so that third parties can see precisely what is happening at the company.</p> <p>Company secretaries are also responsible for co-ordinating the maintenance of the company’s internal records, such as minutes of meetings of the  board of directors kept under section 382 of the 1985 Act, and minutes of general meetings of shareholders. They provide appropriate notification for convening board meetings and shareholder meetings, and they compile and circulate supporting documentation. Their role is very much that of ensuring that directors are properly up to speed with all board papers and of presenting and compiling board packs, so that directors are properly informed on what will happen at forthcoming board meetings. Secretaries in both public and private companies fulfil an essential role.</p> <p>Secretaries are also involved in the quasi-legal situation of ensuring general legal compliance by the company with its statutory and legal requirements and adherence to its memorandum and articles of association. They co-ordinate the publication and distribution of the company’s annual report and accounts in conjunction with internal and external advisers and are involved in preparation and liaison with executive and non-executive directors to ensure that all appropriate statements are included and correct, and that all information is provided to the auditors.</p> <p>Finally, secretaries process share transfers and the issuance of new share certificates, including signing of share certificates that are in hard copy format—though as we move to electronic means for holding and transferring shares that may decline in importance. They ensure that people who are entitled to do so can inspect company records.</p> <p>I have taken some time to run through that background because it shows the breadth of the work in which company secretaries are involved and the importance within the general corporate structure of the role that they play in public and private companies in the UK. The point to stress is their position as formal office holders, which allows them to attend board meetings and gives them the added responsibility of the liabilities that attach to their office. Their position gives them a clear status and an ability to ensure that there is proper adherence by the company to its statutory and legal requirements. It enables them to have an important foothold in the board through their status and position, allowing them to be heard and to insist that compliance is maintained, whereas someone who was just an employee or an authorised signatory in a very defined role might not have the status and the role in the company necessary to ensure compliance.</p> <p>The company law review recognised that position. It said:</p> <p class="indent">“We do not doubt that company secretaries can provide a valuable service to private companies” but proposed removing the mandatory requirement for a company secretary in private companies. It stated that the decision whether to use the services of a secretary would be made by the market rather than by law. It also said:</p> <p class="indent">“We believe that private companies should be able, if they wish, to appoint a company secretary to carry out those functions that are ascribed to a director or secretary in the alternative in the Act, or performed by the secretary as a matter of practice. When appointed the secretary will be able to carry out these functions with the full authority that he has under the current Act.”</p> <p>My understanding is that that scene-setting, in terms of the company law review and the views that were  taken as a consequence of it, formed the basis of the provisions in part 12. The review proposed dispensing with the requirement for a company secretary for private companies. On my understanding, that was on the basis of deregulation—without any other justification—while recognising that removing the requirement to have a company secretary would not remove any responsibility of the company to carry out the functions that a company secretary would normally carry out. That approach was also reflected in both White Papers on the company law review.</p> <p>However, that does not seem to be quite what we have in the wording of the Bill, which includes a subtle but vital difference from the suggestion that the secretary would have the full authority that he or she currently has under the 1985 Act. An article by Andy Hamer writing in the June edition of the <span class="italic">Company Secretary </span>summarises the point quite well. He states:</p> <p class="indent">“Most public companies were fairly relaxed about the proposal to abolish the requirement for private companies to appoint a secretary on the basis that they continue to do so for their subsidiaries if they wish. Well nothing has changed in this regard. You will still be able to do that. The problem is that it will be a totally pointless exercise. The legal status of the person you appoint will not change one iota as a consequence of doing so. As far as the Company Law Reform Bill is concerned, that person will have no more power than your receptionist.”</p> <p>That is one view. It is an extreme view, but it summarises the angst and concern that clearly exist in various corporate organisations throughout the country. Having just an authorised signatory role will not give existing company secretaries the standing and status that they have at present. Their ability to procure compliance on the various issues that I alluded to in my initial comments will be affected.</p> <p>The approach that I outlined, which is reflected in Mr. Hamer’s comments, seems also to have been taken by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Sainsbury">Lord Sainsbury</a> on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Reading">Third Reading</a> in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a> when he said that</p> <p class="indent">“private companies will still be able to have a company secretary, but whether they so choose will not be material to third parties. That is why the Bill does not provide for them to have statutory recognition nor for their identity to be on the public record, either on formation of the company or thereafter.”—[<span class="italic">Official Report, <a href="/glossary/?gl=191" title="The house of Lords is the upper chamber of the Houses of Parliament. It is..." class="glossary">House of Lords</a>,</span> 9 May 2006; Vol. 681, c. 785.]</p> <p>On the basis of what is in the Bill, the proposal, rather than being deregulatory, will impose additional regulatory burdens and confusion as existing company secretaries continuing in their role will have to be specially authorised to carry out their existing functions. As they are not recognised, they would have to become authorised signatories to do what they do today. For example, company secretaries have authority to authenticate documents under section 41 of the 1985 Act, but clause 48 of the Bill would require them to be authorised to do that.</p> <p>Third parties will not wish to rely on a company secretary’s merely saying that they are authorised, and, in the absence of a continuing notification of secretaries at Companies House, presumably will wish to obtain a copy of the board resolution authorising the secretary to certify documents. However, a director would have to provide that duly certified evidence to the third party, as clearly the authorised signatory cannot self-certify.</p> <p>Almost automatically there is the additional step of having a document executed by a director to give  evidence to third parties that they can rely on the signature certifying the document. That will necessitate some additional step, but we will come on to that in further detail. The Under-Secretary said that her officials were examining methods of dealing with the situation in transitional arrangements. We touched on that point briefly last week when we talked about authorised signatories, and how—to paraphrase the Under-Secretary—that approach was being considered in the context of a transitional method under which existing company secretaries would be deemed as authorised signatories. She said, in general terms, that the proposal was still being considered by officials.</p> <p>That approach does not address the fundamental weakness of the proposals set out in the Bill, however. It goes so far, but not far enough. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Institute">The Institute</a> for Chartered Secretaries and Administrators says in its briefing note for the Committee, which has been endorsed by the Association of Corporate Treasurers, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBI">CBI</a>, the Institute of Directors and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Society">Law Society</a>:</p> <p class="indent">“Where the board of a private company wants the secretary to continue in his position post the enactment of the Bill, it will find that all the secretary’s automatic statutory powers under the Companies Act 1985 to certify documents, execute documents and file returns to Companies House will no longer exist. For any of the 2 million private companies which find their secretary useful, and want to continue employing such a person, there will be the confusing burden of having to set up appropriate authorisations to try and mimic the current statutory powers that are well understood. This new burden will bring complication not simplification. A secretary remains an officer of the company so his statutory powers should be clear along with his liabilities.”</p> <p>The last point in that quotation, to which I alluded earlier, is the continuing status of the secretary in a private company as an office holder. I have referred to section 744 of the 1985 Act, which currently prescribes a secretary as being an officer of the company, although the continuing effect of that section is somewhat vague and I would appreciate any clarification from the Solicitor-General about it. What the table of destinations provided by the Department says about section 744 of the 1985 Act is quite interesting:</p> <p class="indent">“Partially repealed, partially left in the Act without substantial <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> and partly replaced with substantive amendment by Various”.</p> <p>It is quite difficult to track where the bits have gone or work out precisely what will happen to section 744, so some clarification of what will happen and how the Bill will apply to secretaries moving forward would be helpful.</p> <p>What the Bill will mean for the status of a company secretary in the context of liability is a little confusing. The Bill raises the question whether the legal status of the post of secretary has been abolished from a statutory perspective for private companies. If someone was appointed as a new company secretary under the current wording of the Bill, but was apparently unable to notify their appointment to the registrar of companies under the new regime, third parties would not be put on notice of their position, so would they be an office holder or not?</p> <p>By the contrary, if someone is shown in the records of Companies House to be a secretary of an existing company but there is no ongoing notification procedure for appointments or changes, how would they get themselves off the record, in order to avoid potential claims against officer holders of the company in the event of something calamitous happening to the company many years subsequent to their having relinquished their position as company secretary?</p> <p>Practically, how do people ensure that notification is given to third parties, to ensure that they are not inadvertently and improperly drawn into a claim for default that might ultimately arise in criminal liability? The issue could be serious, so it would be helpful to have some clarification of what is intended in the Bill for the notification regime for private companies. I hope that we shall be able to shed some light on the issue.</p> <p>My mystification about all this was heightened when I had as my bedtime reading further aspects of the Bill.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> I am sure that we all have happy bedtime reading at the moment because of this weighty Bill. <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 640 deals with annual returns. Clearly, filing annual returns and ensuring that they have been appropriately prepared is one role of a company secretary at the moment. Subsection (1) states:</p> <p class="indent">“If a company fails to deliver an annual return before the end of the period of 28 days after a return date, an offence is committed by—</p> <p class="indent">(a) the company,</p> <p class="indent">(b) subject to subsection (4)—</p> <p class="indent">(i) every director of the company, and</p> <p class="indent">(ii) in the case of a public company, every secretary of the company, and</p> <p class="indent">(c) every other officer of the company who is in default.”</p> <p>If one assumes that the secretary of a private company remains an officer of the company, one could end up in quite a perverse situation, because subsection (4) states:</p> <p class="indent">“It is a defence for a director or secretary charged with an offence under subsection (1)(b)”— in other words, the provisions relating to secretaries of a public company—</p> <p class="indent">“to prove that he took all reasonable steps to avoid the commission or continuance of the offence.”</p> <p>The bizarre point is that that defence would not be available to secretaries of private companies if they remained officer holders of the company.</p> <p>I will table an <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> about that, as we have not yet discussed the issue, but that lacuna or potential issue in terms of liability makes it extremely important that we are clear about whether a secretary of a private company, whether recognised on the statutory register or not—we shall come to that issue—is, as an office holder, liable and the extent to which they are liable. If there are occasions on which some form of additional defence is offered to public company secretaries, it will be perverse if that defence is not available also to private company secretaries, given that they will be fulfilling the self-same duties, although one group will be doing so in public companies and the other in private companies.</p> <p>Any light that can be shed on the general issue—I have given a specific example—would be appreciated not only by me but, I am sure, by company secretaries up and down the country, who are concerned about the implications of what is happening.</p> <p>I hope that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor-General">Solicitor-General</a> can also respond to the comments of Andy Hamer in the latest edition of <span class="italic">Company Secretary</span>:</p> <p class="indent">“The most embarrassing thing about this whole episode for the Government is the way that it went about securing the support of (or avoiding <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> from) listed companies and then moved the goalposts without consultation. I sincerely hope that it will be made to defend itself against such accusations.”</p> <p>That goes back to the fundamental point, which is that the review seemed to suggest that the statutory rights of company secretaries would be preserved and therefore in the Bill, whereas we do not have that at the moment. An explanation or clarification as to why there has been a difference between the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLR">CLR</a>, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> and what we have now is important, because the reason certainly has not come out for me in reading the record of the debates in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a>. Perhaps I have missed it, but clarification as to why the subtlety that I have talked about was altered is important.</p> <p>What about where we are now and the proposals in the Bill? What has been the response from companies up and down the country? I suspect that hon. Members will have received many letters and e-mails on the subject, and I think that it is worth commenting on some of the ones that I have seen. I appreciate that this is by no means the full list of representations that may have come into the Department and to other members of the Committee.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Richardson">Elizabeth Richardson</a>, company secretary of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reckitt_Benckiser">Reckitt Benckiser</a> plc, a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100">FTSE 100</a> company, said:</p> <p class="indent">“While Reckitt Benckiser is a public company so will still be required to appoint a secretary, we have a hundred or so UK private companies within our group. If the Bill becomes law I will have no power to administer these companies for our group.”</p> <p>She adds:</p> <p class="indent">“The proposed changes will disenfranchise me and cause enormous administrative headaches for people in my position.”</p> <p>A similar point is made by Tania Stoat, assistant company secretary of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GKN">GKN</a> plc, who says:</p> <p class="indent">“In GKN, as is the case for most large UK-listed groups, the secretarial administration for subsidiary private companies is carried out centrally through the appointment of individual or corporate secretaries, thereby ensuring good corporate governance throughout the Group. The Bill as currently drafted will render such secretaries devoid of all statutory powers and require the imposition of unnecessary bureaucracy to delegate existing authorities in other ways.”</p> <p>Finally, Hilary Lowe, company secretary to the investment trust of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Asset_Management">JPMorgan Asset Management</a>, which obviously has to cope with a lot of administration, emphasises a similar approach and says:</p> <p class="indent">“I appreciate that for small, simple companies the role of secretary is not necessarily needed, but there still may be instances where the Directors of these companies may wish to appoint a secretary in order to complete, lodge and explain the routine forms on their behalf...More worryingly is that there are large private companies where the role of secretary is vital and it is also important to note that within plc companies the <a href="/glossary/?gl=37" title="The term &quot;majority&quot; is used in two ways in Parliament. Firstly a Government..." class="glossary">majority</a> of the work is done through subsidiary companies, which tend to  be private companies, as the umbrella plc is merely the listed entity. Furthermore, if the Bill remains as drafted it is likely that companies will find themselves in the confusing position of having to delegate authorities in other ways.”</p> <p>The point that Ms Lowe makes is crucial. For example, a listed company whose shares are traded on the London stock exchange would, as a public company, be required under the Bill to have a company secretary, but in essence it may be a shell or a holding company that holds the shares of various subsidiary limited liability companies.</p> <p>In many ways the role of company secretary in that instance would be fairly limited in scope if it was ring-fenced at that level in terms of continuing compliance with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act_1985">Companies Act 1985</a> as far as the plc is concerned and in terms of meeting the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Listing_Authority">UK Listing Authority</a>’s ongoing requirements. Yet in all likelihood, as some of the examples show, there may be hundreds of subsidiaries sitting underneath that holding company, all requiring accounts, forms and registration documents to be filed and updated and all trading. That would bring a different level of activity and the need for legal requirement and compliance. It is easy to see that the need for company secretaries and someone to be in charge of such activity is at subsidiary, private company level rather than being ring-fenced within the plc. That is important. Limited liability subsidiaries in such circumstances are likely to be considerable companies in their own right as the main trading companies for the listed group and may have turnovers of hundreds of millions of pounds, so the need for compliance is significant. Perhaps that aspect has not come across clearly enough in terms of the importance of maintaining compliance at that limited liability perspective.</p>            </div>

Clearly the listed holding company would be outside the UK, under no obligation to have a secretary at all. Under the new regime, the subsidiary company would have no responsibility or liability to have a secretary. That seems a rather strange situation to have arrived at in ensuring good corporate governance at a time when there are huge sensitivities about such issues and about ensuring that companies are in compliance with their regulatory obligations.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I suppose I was using the word “strange” to mean peculiar, bizarre and extremely ridiculous in terms of the guidance that we set for corporate entities across the globe. I shall come later to the international aspect. The situation is not acceptable, and when we turn to the amendments, we shall see that different approaches can be taken. I know that the various bodies have had their views, discussions and debates on the right way forward, which clearly needs to be focused on. I do not think that it has yet been properly addressed.</p> <p>As a further example, I have one final comment from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Jenner">Sue Jenner</a>, director and company secretary at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_Corporation">Thomson Corporation</a> plc:</p> <p class="indent">“MPs would appear not to be aware of the seriousness of this issue and I urgently request that you seek to redress this anomaly. Does the Government not realise how damaging this could be to large private companies with numerous operating subsidiaries, who rely on their secretaries to ensure good governance and, in particular, to facilitate the day to day legal administration of these entities. Stripping away their powers could cause untold difficulties, especially where certifying/authenticating documents, executing documents with a director and filing returns at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_House">Companies House</a> are concerned”.</p> <p>She adds:</p> <p class="indent">“It will be far more burdensome and crippling for companies if the Bill is left as drafted. In the cause of good governance, it is absolutely critical that company secretaries not be stripped of their powers.”</p> <p>It is interesting that under the proposed arrangements it would be possible for many subsidiaries to sit underneath and not to have the corporate powers behind the secretary in that context.</p> <p>I was looking at the list of representations that I have received through e-mail and correspondence during the past week or so, and it makes for interesting reading: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GKN">GKN</a> plc; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo_American">Anglo American</a> plc; the Association of Women Chartered Secretaries; Harbottle and Lewis solicitors; JPMorgan asset management; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Choice_Holidays">First Choice Holidays</a>; the Thomson Corporation; Hamilton Downing Quinn solicitors; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argos_Retail_Group">Argos Retail Group</a>; Mothercare UK Ltd; Vocus Europe Ltd; Mayer, Brown, Rowe and Maw solicitors; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Express_Group">National Express Group</a>; Virgin Group Ltd; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Wessing">Taylor Wessing</a> solicitors; Renew Holdings plc; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchells_and_Butlers">Mitchells and Butlers</a> plc and Lovells. Various other companies and individuals have expressed their concern, too. There is considerable angst and worry about the implications of what is happening and the practical difficulties that might be posed to such companies by the structural change between the private and public company settings.</p> <p>It is also interesting to work out how Companies House will respond in all such circumstances, given what I have said about the fact that company secretaries’ names would appear to remain on the register going forward. If secretaries in private companies were not authenticated and authorised to deal with the filing of forms after the introduction of the Bill, how would Companies House deal with the situation? I know that transitional provisions are still being considered, but there could be a nightmare at Companies House if that is not followed through properly. I believe that changing our current position is the best way in which to achieve a sensible arrangement and settlement.</p> <p>My hon. Friend talked about the international aspect. At a time when we appear to be seeking to  downgrade the position of the company secretary, certainly in limited liability companies, other jurisdictions appear to be embracing the corporate model that we have created and adopted for many years. Certainly, in developed and emerging markets, the adoption of our corporate governance structures and business behaviour are seen as key elements in the drive to attract investment.</p> <p>It is therefore interesting to note that jurisdictions such as Spain and Dubai have gone in the other direction and are seeking to adopt a requirement for a company secretary. I have been provided with some correspondence from Transeuropean Centre Ltd, which is in discussion with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Chartered_Secretaries_and_Administrators">Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators</a>, stating:</p> <p class="indent">“<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK">The UK</a> corporate law is highly regarded in Russia, especially the role of company secretaries within large companies.”</p> <p>The suggestion is that Russia is examining our corporate model and structure. Although it is seeking to adopt secretaries at the moment, the suggestion is that it might be trying to find ways in which to codify and structure company secretaries within Russian corporate law. It is great to see that that wonderful benefit in English corporate law is being exported far and wide. It is one of the great benefits in this country, and it is a hidden export. That is great to see. Our corporate governance structures, in which the company secretary plays a pivotal role, should be promoted.</p>            </div>

That is why it is important that we have the chance to give them a proper airing. In many cases, the representations arrived only in the past few days—indeed, the last few hours. Even as I came to the Committee this afternoon, my I was still receiving e-mails from people concerned about the issue.</p> <p>I want to finish on the international aspects. I was interested to read the letter from the <span class="hi"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a></span> Institute of Chartered Secretaries, especially as <span class="hi">Hong Kong</span> corporate law is historically modelled on English company law and largely remains so today. The letter, which is from Mr. Richard Leung, the president, reaffirms that</p> <p class="indent">“if the abolition of the requirement for private companies to appoint secretaries is to go ahead, secretaries of those companies which choose to appoint or retain them should continue to be given the statutory powers and their appointment should be a matter of public record at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_House">Companies House</a>.”</p> <p>We will come to the last point in discussing another group of amendments, but the letter gives some further international context by noting the potential influence and impact that the UK reforms will have on other jurisdictions, including <span class="hi">Hong Kong</span>. Although I fully recognise that we are talking about UK corporates and the UK situation—and rightly so in terms of the UK remaining an example that we hope will be followed by others—it is worth putting it in that international context.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> I am grateful for that guidance, Mr. Illsley.</p> <p>Last week the Under-Secretary said that existing company secretaries of private companies might or might not be deemed to be authorised signatories by virtue of their office, while appearing to rule out such an approach for new company secretaries, saying that transitional provisions were still a little up in the air. Her comments maintain the view that secretaries of private companies should effectively be phased out. That is mistaken and potentially confusing, particularly in large groups of companies where new subsidiaries may be formed regularly, some of which might fall within transitional provisions while others—new ones—might not. A more fundamental approach needs to be taken.</p> <p><a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> No. 185 proposes that private companies not entitled to an exemption from audit for the purposes of subsections (1) or (2) of section 249A of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act_1985">Companies Act 1985</a> should be required to have a company secretary. The subject was debated at length in the <a href="/glossary/?gl=129" title="The House of Lords. When used in the House of Lords, this phrase refers to..." class="glossary">other place</a> and I do not propose to rehearse the arguments again. Amendments Nos. 186, 188, 192 and 204 make further consequential changes.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 248, 249, 187 and 189 make what might be termed “flexibility changes” to enable the continuing statutory recognition of the private company secretary. They reflect the views adopted by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLR">CLR</a> and backed by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Chartered_Secretaries_and_Administrators">Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators</a>.</p> <p>The role of the company secretary is well understood, and it is welcome that as far as plcs are concerned, it will be retained. However, it is bizarre that the concept has been completely cast aside, as far as statutory recognition is concerned, for any private company. The secretary supports the board and the executive team in their primary objective of wealth creation, and allows the sophisticated obligations and functions of companies of all sizes to be discharged effectively. Importantly, the secretary’s role is widely understood and enables third parties, via <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_House">Companies House</a>, to know not only that the secretary has power to sign on behalf of the company, but that that person is at the heart of the board process.</p> <p>The Bill’s most worrying message is that compliance is in some way being downgraded. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICSA">ICSA</a> says that it is already receiving reports of smaller companies misinterpreting the proposals as a reduction in obligations to comply, to complete returns and to fulfil a wide range of functions. To amend the Bill either to require large private companies to maintain a company secretary or to give all private companies the ability to appoint or retain company secretaries to whom the existing statutory powers would be available does not appear to be overly difficult. I am happy to accept any suggestions or improvements to the drafting of our amendments. To do so would avoid placing the costly compliance and bureaucratic burdens on companies throughout the country which will result from adhering, without any change, to the current arrangements and structure.</p> <p>In our first sitting, the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a> for Industry and the Regions said:</p> <p class="indent">“the Government are very open-minded in our approach to the Bill. The provisions are in good shape, but we are always anxious to improve them. Certainly, during the discussions that I had in the past month with my officials, we found that there is always room for improvement in a Bill of such an enormous size.”—[<span class="italic">Official Report, <a href="/glossary/?gl=248" title="In a normal session there are up to ten standing committees on bills. Each..." class="glossary">Standing Committee</a> D,</span> 15 June 2006; c. 3.]</p> <p>Providing greater structure for the role of company secretaries would provide such an improvement.</p> <p>To date, the Government appear, for whatever reason, to have approached the matter with a closed mind. I hope that today they will open their eyes and finally recognise the important continuing role of company secretaries in private companies.</p>            </div>

            </h2>


                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> May I say what a pleasure it is to make my first but, I hope, not my last contribution to this marathon Bill under your chairmanship, Mr. Illsley? Right hon. and hon. Members will be delighted to know that my contribution will not take 45 minutes; it will be more like four and a half minutes. I hope that we can proceed somewhat quicker than we have done so far.</p> <p>If I understand the hon. Gentleman, the basic point of the Conservative amendments is that only small companies should be exempt and it should be made clear that private companies are allowed to have secretaries if they want to. We are not unsympathetic to that view. The key question is whether the company secretary’s function is solely to protect the interest of potential investors or to go further than that, and for example protect the interests of creditors, too. If the function is to protect only potential investors, the Bill is right to draw the distinction between companies that need a secretary and those that do not, as between public and private companies. However, if the function goes beyond that and the protected interests go beyond those of investors, it might be appropriate to use other criteria. The argument for using the size of the company is that one of the main functions of the company secretary is to maintain the integrity of the company’s system of governance.</p> <p>In practice, the company secretary’s job is to hold the ring between the directors, the shareholders and the creditors of the company, with creditors including employees. Their job is to represent the interests of the company as a whole, which might include reminding the directors that they are supposed to act in the interests of the company as a whole, not their personal interests, and take account of the interests of company members. In small companies, the distinction between the interests of the directors, or the director and the shareholders, can be theoretical, but as soon as it is meaningful to speak of shareholders as a separate interest from that of directors, it makes sense to require companies to have company secretaries. The key issue is how that idea is put into practice.</p> <p>The distinction between companies that are required to undertake an audit and those that are not might make some sense in that context. It relates to the difference between companies in which the members are so closely connected with the management that they can be assumed to understand what is going on, and those in which members are likely to be a separate interest and unconnected with the management of the business.</p> <p>Admittedly, there is a problem about whether the criteria in the 1985 Act are right. The <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> sets the limit at £5.6 million or more in turnover or £2.8 million or more in gross assets for private companies not involved in insurance or financial services. Do those criteria set the limits of concern about corporate governance, and is £5.7 million so different from £5.5 million in that sense? There must be a limit somewhere, and all numerical limits are arbitrary to some extent. The real question is whether exemption from a requirement to audit is in principle the same as an exemption from a guarantee of rectitude in corporate governance. Arguably at least, they are the same, and the requirement for an audit takes hold when the company’s affairs are complicated enough that an outsider is needed to help maintain trust between the various interests. That seems close enough to the situation in which a guarantee of the integrity of the company’s governance system is needed.</p> <p>For those reasons, we support the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Hornchurch (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brokenshire">James Brokenshire</a>) and his colleagues.</p>            </div>

Indeed, it has been mentioned that it could include many listed companies, where effectively the bulk of their business is carried out by various subsidiaries which carry out a substantial amount of business. The business of the company secretary is fundamental. I am referring to such companies, not necessarily to the small company where it can be a burden. I do not deny that for some companies the company secretary is perhaps superfluous—</p>            </div>

Indeed, it is ironic that the Government accuse the <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> of procrastination, yet Labour Members’ questions all seem to indicate that they have not paid any attention to anything that we have said so far.

It is interesting that Labour Members were happy to nod their heads in agreement when I said that private companies should be allowed to have a company secretary, but as soon as I mentioned that they should be allowed to have company secretaries with the existing powers there was a blank look on their faces and no nodding of heads.</p>            </div>

I do not agree with them. In the interests of making some progress, I should like to continue. I hold to my original view. Those who listen to my speech or read the record will doubtless form their own opinion as to which one of us is correct.</p> <p>Having a company secretary also has the benefit of giving certainty to third parties about who specifically in a company is charged with the responsibility of complying with statutory requirements, dealing with corporate governance and ensuring co-ordination between directors, shareholders and various departments within the company, and so on. The notion that anyone who wishes to contact a company should simply write to a director negates the argument for proper corporate governance. It is important that there is a specified individual who is an officer of the company and that third parties know with whom they are dealing.</p> <p>If there were not a company secretary, the directors would be burdened with the responsibility of form filling and dealing with changes in shares, changes in directors, changes of address and so on. The job of directors is to run a business and develop it. They do not wish to be bogged down with the detailed requirements for the proper efficient running of a company, so it is important that a company secretary can take on the responsibility of the administrative duties while the company directors get on with the business of developing the company and expanding it in what is a cut-throat and competitive business world.</p> <p>My understanding is that the aim of the Bill is to simplify matters and to allow people to get on with running businesses. By putting the additional burden of dealing with administrative duties on directors, as opposed to a specific individual, it will act as a hindrance to proper business efficiency. My hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch referred to plcs, which have many subsidiaries that are private companies and, thus, need company secretaries. There are also many large private companies that would qualify for listing, if so they wished, in which the role of the company secretary is vital. We must not forget that. If a company secretary’s duties were dispensed with, authority would need to be delegated to other individuals to fulfil the company secretarial role. It is important that third parties know who that person is.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> I was happy to <a href="/glossary/?gl=176" title="To allow another Member to speak." class="glossary">give way</a> to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=35" title="Ministers make up the Government and almost all are members of the House of..." class="glossary">Minister</a>, as always, but it is regrettable that, as usual, she has missed the point. When legislators are in the business of setting out legislation, it is important that they try as best as possible to cover future eventualities. I am not saying that we should deal with the minutiae, but we should cover the future, to the extent that that is possible.</p> <p>Only when companies get over the appropriate threshold should proper auditing come into operation. That is the answer: only when companies exceed the proper audited limits should the rules kick in. No doubt some legal and accountancy practices would welcome the additional work that will be created for them, not to mention the additional costs that companies will have to bear in giving them the work and paying their extortionate rates.</p> <p>My hon. Friends the Members for Hornchurch and for Huntingdon referred to the importance of being able to deal with company secretaries based in Britain when company directors are overseas. In an increasingly international business environment, we must recognise the need to have a specific person in the UK to whom third parties can turn to ensure proper corporate governance of a company, as well as proper service of notices, proper filing of documentation, and so on. There are many private companies, and company secretaries are crucial in ensuring their compliance with the proper requirements.</p> <p>Company secretaries also have an important role as co-ordinators of internal company departments. As the hon. Member for Cheadle (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hunter">Mark Hunter</a>) mentioned, they are a link, and we must not overlook their importance in that role. As a former practising solicitor, I remember that on occasions I used to speak to company secretaries. We would not necessarily discuss a particular issue ourselves, but the company secretary was the one person with whom I could liaise, and he would agree to speak to the various departments in the company and give me the answer that I wanted. In the business world it is important that banks, lawyers, accountants, architects and so on have an individual whom they trust and with whom they can develop a working relationship to progress business.</p> <p>Let us not overlook the role of non-executive directors in recent years. A number of reports have emphasised the importance of having independent non-executive directors, and we regularly see very able directors with a large portfolio of non-executive directorships. It is important that in that context a company secretary can advise each of them properly on the relevance of business practice for the company with whom that secretary is concerned, rather than the eight or nine other companies with which they have non-executive directorships. If the burdens and responsibilities of non-executive directors are to be increased—as they are—it is important that they are properly monitored and that there is an individual to do that monitoring.

Member for Falkirk (Mr. Joyce) is very keen on making comments that are just below the audible level. If he has anything credible or valid to say, I hope that he will make his contribution audible so that it can be put on the record, rather than constantly muttering so that it falls just below the radar. As I was saying, it is not in the public interest to create an additional administrative burden on directors, who have other duties and who do not need to be filling in forms, co-ordinating departments and so on. It is important that we let companies decide whether they want a company secretary, and we need a register of secretaries at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_House">Companies House</a> so that it is clear to all third parties who is responsible for the various administrative duties and whom they can contact immediately.</p> <p>There is an increasing focus on transparency and good corporate governance in business, but that is undermined when we seek to diminish the role of the one person who can be held accountable for high principles of corporate governance. As I mentioned earlier, there are 2 million private companies, all of which are subject to statutory requirements, proper corporate governance codes and guidelines issued by various company bodies. Company secretaries play a useful role in such companies, and doing away with that role will mean confusion and will impose the burden of setting up appropriate authorisations to duplicate the current statutory responsibilities.</p> <p>To conclude, company secretaries play a vital role—I repeat the word “vital”—in the efficient running of companies and in our legal framework. We should seek to retain them and give them the necessary authority and power properly and effectively to do their job.</p>            </div>

Were that not true, the Government would not have made it necessary for public companies to appoint company secretaries. I shall not rehearse at length the benefits of company secretaries; my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch and other contributors have already touched on them adequately. Save to say, company secretaries fulfil an important role to ensure that directors toe the line and operate within the bounds of their responsibilities and duties, and to assure persons such as creditors and shareholders who deal with the company.</p> <p>We are not a million miles apart, but we need increased regulation of private companies with an annual turnover of £5.6 million or more. They are not small, although they only just exceed the definition of small enterprise. A company that has a turnover of £5.6 million a year is by any stretch of the imagination a significant enterprise. It probably has a large number of employees, it will undoubtedly enter into obligations, and creditors and others will deal with it regularly. The existence of a company secretary who fulfils their statutory duties, and other duties not so closely defined by statute in this Bill, would be a huge reassurance to those individuals.</p> <p>Many private companies are very large. Theexample given on <a href="/glossary/?gl=24" title="The Second Reading is the most important stage for a Bill. It is when the..." class="glossary">Second Reading</a> was <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swire_and_Sons">John Swire and Sons</a>, which is an enormous company with morethan 130,000 employees and a turnover of about£2.3 billion. It is inconceivable that such a company would not appoint a company secretary.</p> <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hodge">Margaret Hodge</a><span class="italic">indicated assent.</span></p>            </div>

Again, to take the Swire example, it would be extraordinary for a company with 133,000 employees not to have a company secretary.</p> <p>I fully understand that the Government will say that it is open to such companies to employ secretaries. In the case of such a large enterprise, where so many interests are at stake, it should be mandatory for a company secretary to be appointed. That is not regulation for the sake of regulation, but simple logic. It is ridiculous that a small public company should be obliged to appoint a secretary, whereas a huge private company should not.

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> It is a great pleasure to appear before you for the first time, Mr. Illsley. I am sure that we will have a number of interesting debates in the coming weeks, although I hope not too many weeks. I  appreciate that some people might like Committees to go on for longer than I would, but provided that we make progress I see no reason why we cannot enjoy each other’s company before it becomes too stale.</p> <p>I begin by endorsing many of the points that the hon. Member for Hornchurch made in praise of the benefits of company secretaries. They provide an enormously valuable instrument for the protection of members in particular and, in certain circumstances, of the public. In the case of public companies, company secretaries perform a role that it is necessary and desirable that they should continue to perform. Private companies should have a greater degree of freedom and choice. We believe that that will not lead to any significant problems, and that this deregulatory approach is the better one.</p> <p>The hon. Gentleman said that there was a great deal of angst, worry and concern among members of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICSA">ICSA</a> and other organisations about the proposals. I appreciate that ICSA, an organisation that I have had some contact with in the past as a lecturer in law and for which I have the greatest respect, will want to reassure its members. I read the briefing paper with interest, and I hope during the course of my comments to be able to provide some reassurance that its members need not have the concern, angst and worry that he identified.</p> <p>The essential issue is not, as the hon. Gentleman said, about additional regulation. He was corrected by the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones), who rightly said that the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> were proposing more regulation than the Government want. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conservatives">The Conservatives</a> want to regulate medium-sized private companies—for want of a better description—rather than small companies. We agree that we should give more freedom to small companies, so the issue between us is in respect of medium-sized private companies. It was correctly identified by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer), who said that it was not about confusion, as the hon. Member for Hornchurch said, but about whether we give greater choice and freedom.</p> <p>We also want to deal with issues such as subsidiaries that are owned by larger corporations that may be public corporations and subject to obligations to have a secretary. Large public corporations that own private companies should be able to determine the internal management of those companies, provided they comply with the requirements on audit and so on.</p>            </div>

If one creates within that distinction a further distinction—an important one—based on internal financial thresholds of private companies, they create new categories and therefore new consequences and problems.

Lady will consider that companies grow and companies decline and their financial circumstances will alter. The number of employees they have will alter and other criteria will alter during the course of a year. Some of those companies may not know until after the conclusion of the financial year whether they fit within the category of section 249A or not. They are growing or declining and their circumstances change. To protect themselves, they may decide that whether they go up or down they had better appoint a company secretary. They may have chosen not to do so before, but they may decide to do so now because they will have to comply with the law that the hon. Lady wants to impose. The difficulty is that if they are growing or declining they will not know at the start of the year whether they comply with section 249A.</p>            </div>

Gentleman with pleasure.</p> <p>The proposal that the hon. Lady is presumably supporting today is based on criteria in section 249A—her hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch is nodding his head in agreement—and would impose a set of criteria. That set of criteria would create a distinction between whether a private, medium-sized company must have a company secretary or not. That is the objective of the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a>’ proposal and that is precisely what I am saying will lead to lack of precision because a company might not know until the end of the financial year whether it was obliged to comply with that.

Nobody can guess the difference between the various criteria that he seeks to identify for private companies. In the case of a public company, which may be listed or not, the Government have made a clear distinction that everyone who creates a public company will understand. They will know that they must have a company secretary. In the case of a private company, they will know that there is an element of choice. That is the key distinction that he seeks to deny. The amendments are essentially regulatory. They will impose regulations on medium-sized private companies by requiring them to have company secretaries.</p>            </div>

We are opposed in principle to any regulation that is not justified by its benefits. The amendments would require private companies over the threshold to appoint a company secretary.</p> <p>Company secretaries have certain benefits. They protect members and provide reassurance in particular circumstances to third parties. But do we need to impose a regulation like the one proposed by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a>? It would have to be justified in terms of the needs of medium-sized private companies, and nothing that I have heard from the hon. Member for Hornchurch shows that level of justification. We agree that there is no need to impose company secretaries on small private companies, and we agree that company secretaries are necessary in public companies. We are in agreement.</p> <p>In order to justify the imposition of that regulation on medium-sized private companies, or—for want of a better description—companies that go above the criteria in section 249A, the Conservatives will have to show that it is necessary for the purposes of the proper running of those companies. They say that choice should be denied, and we say that choice should remain. That is the difference between us.</p> <p>The hon. Member for Clwyd, West was quite right when he said that the Conservatives are supporting more regulation. That was a welcome level of honesty.</p> <p>Mr. Jones<span class="italic">rose—</span></p> <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Greening">Justine Greening</a><span class="italic">rose—</span></p>            </div>

Let me advance my argument, and then I shall give way to <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members with pleasure.</p> <p>The Bill does not strip away the powers of private company secretaries. However, like all previous <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Acts">Companies Acts</a>, it does not specify the role, functions, duties or responsibilities of a company secretary. Those are matters for the companies themselves. <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">Clause</a> 43 retains the power of any person to enter into contracts on behalf of companies if he or she is</p> <p class="indent">“acting under its authority, express or implied.”</p> <p>The only powers conferred on the company secretary by Companies Acts are—like those for a director—to authenticate the company’s documents, and to be a co-signatory with a director for the execution of documents by the company. The Bill will give a company the right to appoint one or more individuals as authorised signatories who will be able not only to authenticate the company’s documents, but to execute documents on the same basis as directors. There is room for both the concept of company director and the concept of authorised signatory, as I think that the hon. Member for Hornchurch said last Tuesday. Under the Bill, both of those should be optional for private companies. Unlike public companies, they will be able to have secretaries who are not also authorised signatories. That should be the choice of the private companies.</p> <p>The Bill goes further by giving all companies the power to appoint an individual as an authorised signatory, and private companies the freedom to decide whether to appoint a company secretary. Clearly, a private company that decides to appoint someone as its secretary can decide also to appoint that person as an authorised signatory. That is its choice. Many will wish to do that, but I expect others to prefer their secretaries not to have that authority. That, too, is their choice. The Bill gives them the freedom to decide. It introduces flexibility and a deregulatory approach that takes account of the widely varying nature of our private companies. We see no need to impose on any private company a requirement to have a company secretary. That is our position.</p>            </div>

I  fully support the amendments and giving companies a choice whether to have a company secretary. Our point, however, is that the Bill is devoid of any intellectual rigour, because it simply does not say why a company of one size, which happens to have publicly traded shares, needs a company secretary, when a private company of exactly the same size or smaller does not.</p>            </div>

To repeat the answer that I gave before—the hon. Lady obviously does not accept it, and that is a matter for her, but the rigour of the argument is clear—there is a clear distinction between private and public companies, which we all accept. Anyone who decides to create a public company therefore knows that they will have to comply with certain rules and appoint a company secretary. Anyone who decides to become involved in a private company will have an element of choice that is denied to those in a public company. There is a distinction between private and public companies, and that difference in nature is essentially the reason why it is right that private companies should have an element of choice.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> The essential difference between a private and a public company is that only a public company can make offers to the public, so the requirement for it to have a company secretary is needed to protect them. To that extent, I think that the hon. Gentleman and I agree. The need for corporate governance is different because of the ability to make offers to people who seek to be shareholders.</p> <p>There is a clear administrative difference between the natures of private and public companies and a clear dividing line. However, the hon. Gentleman and his Front-Bench colleagues are seeking to impose a very imprecise new criterion to distinguish between different kinds of private company—one that requires a company secretary for all sorts of reasons and another that does not. Given that the criterion is so imprecise, companies that are growing or declining might not have a clue whether they will comply with it in a particular year. Essentially, the result will be regulation by stealth. Companies will need to appoint a company secretary just in case they grow or decline during the coming financial year, because they will not know  whether, at the end of that year, they will come within the criteria imposed by section 249A. The hon. Gentleman shakes his head. Can he tell me how a company whose position is quite marginal in terms of some of the criteria outlined and which is growing or declining will know what the company results will be by the end of the year? Such companies would be forced to take precautions, would they not? They would be obliged to appoint a company secretary, would they not? That is why I say that the result would be regulation by stealth. If the hon. Gentleman wants to regulate, fine; let us be open about it. However, he is seeking to create a criterion that is not precise enough. The distinction between private and public companies is very precise, and everyone understands it. No one is in any doubt, least of all he or any member of the public. He is seeking to identify a new criterion, which is a recipe for confusion.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> Because I have said repeatedly that I want to make progress on the argument. I have given way to the hon. Member for Clwyd, West several times. Let us be fair.</p> <p>Let me deal with some of the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for Hornchurch, because he raised concerns that have been expressed elsewhere that existing private companies with secretaries that wish to retain them would face a further administrative burden if they wished the existing secretary to be appointed as an authorised signatory. I make it clear that we intend to make the transition to the new regime as easy as possible for existing companies. We shall consult on what the transitional provision should be in respect of such companies. We want to respond positively to the hon. Gentleman’s important point. We intend to ensure that individuals who are private company secretaries immediately before the Bill’s provisions come into force will continue to be able to authenticate documents for their companies and to participate in the execution of documents.</p> <p><a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">Amendment</a> No. 248 is inconsistent with the provision in <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 253 that frees any private company from the requirement for any private company to have a secretary. The amendment has three parts, which I shall address separately. On the first part, we see no reason why the sole director of a private company should not also be its secretary. As there is no requirement for a private company to have a secretary, it would be unnecessary regulation to place restrictions on who may be the secretary. Such bureaucratic nonsense would lead to the sort of complexity that we aim to strip out of company law, a move that I thought both parties supported.</p> <p>The second part is similar to section 287(4)(a) of the current Act, but whereas the existing provision refers to a corporation, the sole director of which is the director of the company, the amendment refers to</p> <p class="indent">“a corporation, the sole director of which is secretary to the company.”</p> <p>The amendment appears to bite only if the company has a joint secretary; otherwise, paragraph (a) does not appear to make much sense.</p> <p>The third part is not necessary, as clause 140 already provides that every company</p> <p class="indent">“must have at least one secretary who is a natural person”, so the sole director cannot be a corporation.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 185 and 188 would require private companies over the threshold to appoint a company secretary. Having a company secretary would benefit some private companies, and I think that many private companies will decide to appoint one. As we are talking about private companies only, the benefit would go no wider.</p> <p>Under the Bill, private company directors would be able to appoint a company secretary and the members could require them to do so. The members can choose for themselves. We considered that the decision whether or not to have a secretary should be left to the directors and members of all private companies, regardless of their size.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 189, 192 and 204 are consequential on amendments Nos. 185 and 188. Subsection (2) is intended to remove any doubt for third parties that are dealing with private companies and ensures that the company’s decision whether or not to have a secretary does not affect others. Amendments Nos. 249 and 186 would introduce a level of complexity and uncertainty and, in our view, are unnecessary. They would impose costs on third parties.</p> <p>Amendment No. 187 would conflict with the officer in default provisions under clause 744. It would be worthwhile for the hon. Member for Hornchurch to peruse that. The Bill provides that directors would be liable as officers in default for offences committed by the company. A director would be held to be in default for the purposes of a provision under the Companies Act if he authorises, permits, participates in or fails to take all reasonable steps to stop a contravention. That is not the case for every offence.</p> <p>The amendment would provide a blanket rule for all offences and obligations under the Act. It would remove any defence to a director being in default and would have the consequence of a director becoming  automatically liable for an offence in instances when he arguably has a reasonable defence. That would be disproportionately harsh. It is like the <a href="/glossary/?gl=85" title="The Conservatives are a centre-right political party in the UK, founded in..." class="glossary">Conservatives</a> deciding to be tough on directors and tough on the causes of directors, not something that they intend, but it would be a consequence of the amendment. It would impose a disproportionate burden on directors and, on that basis, I ask <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">Opposition</a> Members to withdraw it.</p> <p>As I have explained, the Bill, like previous <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Acts">Companies Acts</a>, does not specify the roles and functions of a company secretary. That will be a matter for the company. The Bill takes matters a step further. It will give all private companies the freedom to decide whether to appoint a secretary. As the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire said, that is little change, in effect, from the functions that the secretary usually performs in so far as those functions are statutory. They will still have to be performed by someone. We are not claiming enormous benefits in respect of the deregulatory measure, but it will be a helpful response to many private companies that wish to organise their internal affairs as they choose.</p> <p>Matters have been raised about the extent of consultation, who would be consulted and the way in which the policies arose. Opposition Members are familiar with the company law review and the background to it. They will have read the explanatory notes, so I shall not go into how it explored the issues. The 2005 <a href="/glossary/?gl=220" title="A document issued by the Government laying out its policy, or proposed..." class="glossary">White Paper</a> included proposals to implement that recommendation. The draft clauses were complex, as they addressed the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLR">CLR</a> supplementary recommendation that the secretary appointed should have full authority as under the current Act. That complexity was much criticised, not least by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Chartered_Secretaries_and_Administrators">Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators</a>.</p> <p>The responses to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper">White Paper</a> were fairly evenly split. Eight welcomed or supported the proposals, including the Federation of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Businesses">Small Businesses</a>, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Society">Law Society</a>, the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartered_Accountants">Chartered Accountants</a> in England and Wales. Previously, the Law Society and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBI">CBI</a> had been opposed to the proposals. Eight opposed them, including <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICSA">ICSA</a> and the Institute of Directors; five were broadly neutral and three did not comment significantly on the policy. Given that the main beneficiaries of the Bill will be private small companies, our view was that we should move forward with the proposals.</p> <p>A number of other points were raised by the hon. Member for Hornchurch. I will go through them reasonably quickly. The hon. Gentleman spoke about the shell listed plc with a secretary, with hundreds of subsidiaries, all trading, that would not need a secretary because they are private. The parent listed company will have to produce group accounts and reports in the normal way, which is what matters to the public. Even if the parent company does not actively trade, the responsibility will lie with it.</p> <p>The hon. Gentleman raised issues about all private companies being able to have a secretary for internal matters. It is the case that there is no change here. If they want a company secretary they can have one. For all external matters private companies will have a straightforward choice: they can have no secretary, or a secretary able to sign and authorise documents, or a company secretary  not able to sign and authorise documents. That will be a matter for them. Others may also have authorisation from the company to sign—again, that will be a matter for the company.</p> <p>The hon. Member for Hornchurch said that a company secretary is an officer of the company by virtue of section 744. He is an officer, but it is not section 744 that makes an officer of the company. Companies are free to create officers. There is no general great legal significance. We do not believe that it makes someone an office holder in the sense in which that applies. For example, in employment law a company secretary ceases to hold office when removed in accordance with the articles of the company—that is, normally by the directors or maybe by the members, depending on the circumstances.</p> <p>The hon. Gentleman raised a point in relation to clause 640, which I will deal with briefly. I do not think that I accept his point about a lacuna existing in clause 640, but I will have a look at that and explore it. At the moment our view is that directors in the public company sector and other officers in default can commit the offence. Directors in the public company sector in office when the return was due to be made commit the offence unless they prove that they took all reasonable steps to avoid the offence. For other officers in default and anyone who took office subsequently, an officer is liable only if he or she is in default—that is, if he or she is authorised or permitted. Of course they will need to be authorised or permitted, and they must have participated in or failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent the offence being committed.</p> <p>I think that I have dealt with most of the points raised. I have made a note here about some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Clwyd, West and to some extent the point raised by the hon. Member for Putney, but I think that I have waxed eloquent on the distinction and made my point. I will add just one more. It would appear that many of the private companies that are over the audit threshold are in fact wholly owned subsidiaries of public companies and our view remains that the internal administration of those companies is best left primarily to them.</p> <p>In essence, what we have here is a clear distinction between the Government and the Opposition. That distinction is on whether to impose a level of regulation on the larger private companies or to allow them an element of free choice about whether they have a company secretary. That, in essence, is the issue. We take the view that private companies are different in nature and, to that extent, they should be able to choose whether or not to have a company secretary. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conservatives">The Conservatives</a> take the view that larger private companies are not in a position where they should be able to have that choice. The Conservatives wish to impose more regulation on them than the Government do. That, in essence, is the distinction.</p> <p>My chief concern is the means. I understand why the Conservatives have gone for those criteria that they are seeking to make the judgment on. Basically, it is necessary to have something and there are no other useful criteria that one could choose. I can see why the hon. Member for Hornchurch, or whoever, would have chosen that particular section, which does create an element of distinction. But section 249A also creates a level of complexity and confusion for companies that  may during the course of their year move up or down and not know whether they are in compliance or not.</p> <p>I do not accept that the best way of dealing with the matter is to apply to appoint a company secretary in any event. We take the view that that element of choice should remain with the private company or with those who control it. That is therefore a fundamental distinction between us. We are best sticking to a clear distinction on the nature of companies, so that everyone understands the difference between public and private companies. That distinction is one to which we can, and should, all adhere. <span class="italic">[Interruption.] </span>I am being asked to <a href="/glossary/?gl=176" title="To allow another Member to speak." class="glossary">give way</a>, and I do.</p>            </div>

The question is whether a company secretary has to be one of them. The distinction between the hon. Gentleman and I is that he would wish to impose what I believe to be an unnecessary burden on those larger private companies. He would say that they must be regulated in a way that I do not think is necessary. He obviously thinks that it is necessary and he is entitled to that view, but it is a clear distinction between us. He has been honest throughout this debate; unlike some others who have suggested that this is not regulatory, he says yes, it is more regulatory because it is necessary to regulate more. I accept that that is a very straightforward position.</p> <p>Others have suggested—and got themselves into a bit of a mess by doing so—that the obligation is deregulatory. It is not deregulatory; it is more regulatory. There may be arguments for it but they are not very good. That is why the Government would prefer to stick with the position that we have set out in the Bill.</p>            </div>

Friend the Member for Hornchurch replies to the Minister I want to put one point on the record about the relationship between corporate governance and the size of the company. The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor-General">Solicitor-General</a> made great play about the difference between a private and a public company—that a public company can make an offer to the public. On that basis he justified the need for a public company only to appoint a company secretary and to need the corporate governance protection that having a company secretary implies.</p> <p>That is a somewhat narrow view of corporate governance, because a private company may have many hundreds of members. Indeed, it may be an old public company, which offered shares to the public but which now does not need to do so. But with hundreds of members, corporate governance in a private company will be very important. In some ways it will be more important that such a company adopts good corporate governance procedures because it is not forced to do so. Furthermore, corporate governance goes much further  than the company’s relationship with its members, or its future members; it goes to other issues such as the company’s relationship with suppliers, employees and community interests. I submit that the corporate governance importance of the large private company will be just as great if not greater than if the company is simply public.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> We have had a good debate on company secretaries and their continuing role within either the public or the private company environment. The hon. Member for Cheadle made an important point, recognising the role and importance of the company secretary, and also recognising the point that my hon. Friend just made about the need to look not only at the company itself, but externally at the continuing roles and functions.</p> <p>The hon. Member for Broxtowe touched on the regulatory/deregulatory issue. Although I recognise that private companies are being given a choice, our amendments would mean less regulation on either side because all companies currently have to have company secretaries. It is a bit of a false argument to say we are being more regulatory, because we already have company secretaries.</p> <p>My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire emphasised the deregulatory nature of whatever approach we take. He made an important point about the involvement of directors. If the role of  the company secretary, whether intended or not, is downgraded or downplayed in a private company setting, directors will become more involved in the day-to-day administrative matters and that may cause problems. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICSA">ICSA</a> identified that problem in relation to good corporate governance, which might be threatened in some way.</p> <p>My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West talked about reassurance and how, from the corporate governance perspective, it is important to have certainty for a particular size of company. In some ways, that is where the dividing line is drawn in terms of when it is appropriate to require a company to have a secretary or not. The Government say that the dividing line is a plc, as compared with a private company. We think that we need to be more sophisticated and take a different view. It is the size and scale of operations that matters, not an artificial definition of whether something is a plc or a limited liability company because of the nature of the activities that are undertaken. I suppose that that is the dividing line between our two differing approaches.</p> <p>My hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon pointed out that some plcs will have outside shareholders, too. Although the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor-General">Solicitor-General</a> is right that a limited liability company cannot make an offer to the public, certain other offers can be made in a private placement which could bring in institutional investors, and there could be a limited number of high net worth individuals who might invest in a private company. In some ways, they may have a lesser protection if a very clear dividing line is drawn between the plc and the limited liability. That is certainly the distinction that I would draw.</p> <p>The Solicitor-General tried to brush aside the plc versus private company issue, but private companies with a significant number of shareholders might not be family companies and might have outside interests. It is better to look at the distinction in terms of financial issues, and that is why the amendments are drafted in such a way. To be fair to the Solicitor-General, he eventually framed the distinction in a high-blown way, but we would distinguish it on the basis of the turnover threshold, as identified in our amendments.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor-General">Solicitor-General</a> makes an interesting point. That is why I talked about the provision creating burdens. He made a good argument for the fact that additional costs and burdens are being created. We all understand what a company secretary is at the moment, whereas in such circumstances an  investor will say, “Okay. This is a limited liability company. I want it treated as a plc.” The lawyers will have to be brought in and additional costs racked up to put that into the articles. That is additionally burdensome. His point about what additional burdens might be created in such circumstances was well made. That is what I mean when I talk about the burdens.</p> <p>I welcome the Solicitor-General’s comment about transitional arrangements and the transitional situation with existing company secretaries, but the problem is that if a group is large and has a number of different subsidiaries, it is possible for new subsidiaries to be formed all the time. As of today’s date, the company secretary of a large group will have to create that position in the new subsidiaries to maintain the status quo. That brings an additional level of complexity. They will have to ask whether the limited liability company was in existence prior to the Bill and whether he or she was company secretary at the time, or whether it was a limited liability company for which they were not company secretary at the time, or which was not formed prior to the Bill. Within large groups, there is likely to be a level of complexity that the Solicitor-General perhaps glossed over in some of his comments.</p> <p>I am talking about burdens and regulation. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICSA">ICSA</a> and its members are concerned about the regulatory requirements that might be created as a consequence of the construct that has been created by the Bill. We touched on the fact that plcs they can be small and not necessarily listed. It is interesting that the Government want to maintain that line, rather than take our approach with the turnover threshold.</p> <p>I note that the Solicitor-General emphasised the authorised signatory situation and said, “Look, you’ve got the choice. If you want to create a company secretary, that is fine, but it is up to you to go and create that role, to make them authorised signatories, to give them authority, and everything like that.” I hear what he says, and that might be suitable for small companies who might say that they do not need a company secretary. I think that we are in agreement on such cases. There are clearly situations when a company secretary might be inappropriate and unnecessarily burdensome, such as in a small, family-run company. We are not arguing at all on that point.</p> <p>It is a question of where we set the benchmark from a corporate governance perspective and from the external perspective of what people who deal with a company and who might become shareholders expect. Although I hear what the Solicitor-General says about it all being terribly regulatory, I do not accept that. The Government are accepting the requirement to have company secretaries in plcs, so one might say that they are being over-regulatory in that way. If they believe so fervently that company secretaries are an unnecessary burden, perhaps they should have got rid of them altogether.</p> <p>I think that the Government rightly recognise the value of company secretaries in ensuring good corporate governance. That is why they sought to retain them in a plc context, but it should not be viewed in that context alone. For medium-sized and larger companies, it is appropriate to expect that standard of behaviour and for corporate governance to apply.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> With all due respect to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor-General">Solicitor-General</a>, I have made that argument. It is about what external people who deal with the company can expect. It is all very well saying that the company must have choice, but there comes a time when consideration must be given to the members and shareholders of the company, its creditors and third parties, and to what they may expect. It is a false argument to say that the matter concerns the company alone. We must look at the context of the company, where it sits in its dealings, and how that works in practice.</p> <p>I note that the Solicitor-General will return to the point about section 640, which I raised in the context of whether secretaries are officers of companies. I note also that he said that that does not necessarily derive from section 744, which defines an officer for the purposes of the 1985 Act and specifically lists a secretary as being an officer in that context, from an interpretive point of view, to give clarity. In relation to section 744, I am not sure whether that will be entirely reflected in the Bill when it is finalised and we have all the definitions and so on lined up. I seek clarity on whether that will appear in it.</p> <p>The Solicitor-General said that companies can create officers without statutory authority, but we need to be clear whether someone is an officer or not. The current mechanism of having a secretary whose name appears on the record at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_House">Companies House</a> provides that clarity and the standing for that individual to be able to ensure compliance at board level. That provides added weight and credibility. It may be possible for a company to create an officer in the way that he describes, but because company secretaries do not have the back-up of registration at Companies House and in the record of third parties, their position is not properly recognised and their standing is lessened in the eyes of third parties.</p>            </div>

                                  <div class="debate-speech__content">                <p> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. What concerns us is the liability that goes with an officer’s position. I want to put that in context in relation to section 640, because the way in which it is drafted provides a defence for a secretary of a public company that is not available to a secretary of a private company. I note that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor-General">Solicitor-General</a>  will come back to us on that. My point is genuine and I am not trying to raise false problems. That needs to be examined carefully and it puts into context the status of secretaries, whether they are officers and what liability they may have in that regard.</p> <p>In closing, I want to encapsulate two lines of argument that we have developed and which have not been distilled out. Most of the debate has been in connection with the pure issue of whether we should have company secretaries for plcs as against whether we should have company secretaries for medium or larger-sized private companies.</p> <p>There is a further line of argument, in that if the Government are not minded to accept our position in insisting that medium-sized or larger private companies should have a secretary, there is the residual issue of the standing of a secretary. I note that the issue comes through clearly in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICSA">ICSA</a>’s latest briefing note. It is concerned that if additional language is not built into the Bill, the standing of a secretary will be diminished in some way.</p> <p>Even if we were to accept the Government’s argument about limited liabilities having the choice of whether to appoint a secretary, the further point is, first, that that should be given recognition by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_House">Companies House</a> and, secondly, that there should be some recognition in the Bill of where a secretary sits, either as an office holder or more generally. It is that absence, what it will mean and the point about administration moving forward that is causing disturbance, distress and—to repeat the language that I employed in my opening comments—anxiety among existing company secretaries.</p> <p>There is a question where we set the dividing line. I hear what the Solicitor-General said and clearly we are at variance on that. There is also the point about the recognition of private company secretaries, if a company chooses to adopt that route. That point should be not underestimated, ignored or glossed over, because it is serious and needs to be examined carefully, but it has not been addressed properly by the Government to date.</p> <p>In light of that, I would like to press the <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a>, which concerns where we set the dividing line, to a <a href="/glossary/?gl=43" title="The House of Commons votes by dividing. Those voting Aye (yes) to any..." class="glossary">Division</a>. Separately, I should also like to press to a Division amendment No. 249, which concerns the secondary issue that I have raised on the need for some recognition of private companies’ secretaries in the Bill. Private companies’ secretaries play a significant role in our corporate environment. That their role appears to be being downgraded is a shortcoming of the Bill. That role should be protected; I shall therefore press those two amendments to a Division.</p>            </div>
