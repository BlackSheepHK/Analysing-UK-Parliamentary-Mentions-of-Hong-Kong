It is a fact that this kind of activity has recently become more common, with states that have malign intentions operating covertly and below current criminal thresholds in an attempt to interfere with our democracy. Members of both <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houses_of_Parliament">Houses of Parliament</a> should ensure that they are aware of the threat of foreign interference.</p> <p pid="c23.1/3">State threats to and malign influence on the UK are growing and diversifying as systematic competition intensifies. State threats are persistent and take many, many forms. In fact, we have discussed that many times in this House, given some of the terrible incidents that have taken place, including espionage, interference&#8212;that means political interference as well&#8212;sabotage and physical threats to individuals.</p> <p pid="c23.1/4">The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> has been working closely with the police and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prosecution_Service">Crown Prosecution Service</a> for some time on potential measures to help to secure successful prosecutions for this kind of activity. I am unequivocal in the tasking that takes place with our security partners to protect our citizens and institutions from hostile state activity and foreign influence.</p> <p pid="c23.1/5">In relation to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI5">MI5</a> security alert issued last Thursday, the parliamentary authorities, following careful and detailed discussion with MI5, issued an alert to Members of Parliament&#8212;MPs and peers&#8212;alerting them about specific individuals involved in direct political interference. In this case, the individual has well-established links to parliamentarians and facilitated political donations to serving and aspiring politicians, with funding coming from foreign nationals in China and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>. That was done covertly to mask the origins of the payments.</p> <p pid="c23.1/6">The individual has links to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Front_Work_Department">United Front Work Department</a>, which is the Chinese Communist Party. They have not been open about the nature of these links. MI5 concluded that this person acted covertly in co-ordination with the United Front Work Department, and is involved in political interference activities in the UK. As anyone would expect, those investigations are ongoing.</p> <p pid="c23.1/7">In this case, the aim was to make the UK political landscape favourable to the Chinese authorities&#8217; agenda and, in particular&#8212;I would not question this as there is no doubt&#8212;to challenge those who raise concerns about the Chinese authorities&#8217; activities on very pressing and pertinent issues such as human rights. Of course, this activity is not new, which is why our agencies are so diligent in the work that they undertake.</p> <p pid="c23.1/8">We can expect to see these kinds of alerts become more commonplace as a result of the work of our world-class intelligence agencies, which have adapted to counter these new and emerging threats. Security service  interference alerts are just one of several tools MI5 can use to highlight&#8212;and thus robustly mitigate&#8212;state threats such as malign political interference activity.</p> <p pid="c23.1/9">Decisions to prosecute individuals are made by the Crown Prosecution Service independently of politicians, so I cannot comment in detail about the work that is under way, but all Members should know that we already have strong security structures in place in the UK to identify foreign interference and any potential threats to our democracy. This case in particular demonstrates such robust action. Those structures enabled our world-leading intelligence and security agencies to issue this particular warning.</p> <p pid="c23.1/10">Protecting the UK from foreign interference is absolutely crucial. Our most recent integrated review highlighted the importance of strengthening our defence when it comes to state threats, and we are at the forefront of that activity. To build on the strong safeguards that are already in place, we are developing new national security legislation to make it even harder for states to conduct malign activity. We are also taking further steps to protect the integrity of our democracy by tackling electoral fraud and preventing foreign interference in elections through the Elections Bill. We will introduce new legislation to provide the security services and law enforcement agencies with the tools that they need to disrupt the full range of state threats.</p> <p pid="c23.1/11">As I mentioned at departmental questions, we are working with our allies to take steps to safeguard our open, democratic societies and to promote an international rules-based system that underpins our stability, security and prosperity. We will always take proportionate and necessary action in response to foreign interference in our political system when it comes to state threats, and we will always act in the interests of our country. I commend this statement to the House.</p>            </div>

As she will know, the Labour party always stands ready to work with the Government on national security and protecting our country from foreign interference.</p> <p pid="c24.0/2">May I take a moment to think of those in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_Beth_Israel">Congregation Beth Israel</a> synagogue community in Texas who will still be reeling from their terrible ordeal? People must be free to worship at synagogues and other religious sites, free from fear of violence, across the world. It reminds us that we must be unrelenting in our fight against antisemitism and against extremism. It is, of course, of deep concern that the hostage taker was a British citizen. I want to give thanks to our intelligence agencies and police forces, who are working in co-operation with their <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US">US</a> counterparts and other international partners to investigate the issue further.</p> <p pid="c24.0/3">To turn to the Home Secretary&#8217;s statement, the information that you, Mr <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>, received from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Service">Security Service</a> last week was obviously extremely serious. We condemn in the strongest terms the attempts by China to interfere in Britain&#8217;s democratic process. I support the Home Secretary&#8217;s words on this important issue and, again, I thank the security and intelligence services for their work on this.</p> <p pid="c24.0/4">Obviously, there are further important questions about the extent of the deception and interference that took place in this case and the ongoing risks of malign activity from foreign states in our Parliament and across our democracy. I appreciate that the Home Secretary will be limited in what she can say in the Chamber; I am grateful to her and to the Security Service for the further briefing that has been arranged.</p> <p pid="c24.0/5">May I raise a concern about one point in the Home Secretary&#8217;s statement? She says that this alert shows that our system is working. The work that has been done is clearly important, but I would be very concerned if that meant that the Home Secretary and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office">Home Office</a> were complacent in this area, because we have seen a series of important warnings about attempts by both Russia and China to interfere in the Russian report and in the report from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_Standards_in_Public_Life">Committee on Standards in Public Life</a>, particularly with respect to the risks from foreign money. Lord <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Evans">Jonathan Evans</a> has said:</p> <p class="indent" pid="c24.0/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we should assume&#8221; that this</p> <p class="indent" pid="c24.0/8" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;would be the only case. I would be astonished if there weren&#8217;t similar cases, for instance from Russia.&#8221;</p> <p pid="c24.0/9">He has raised concerns that loopholes for foreign money have not been closed, and has described that as</p> <p class="indent" pid="c24.0/10" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;a live and present threat&#8221; to our democracy.</p> <p pid="c24.0/12"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Russia">The Russia</a> report was published in July 2020, and we are still waiting for the full implementation. Nor have we yet had a proper response to the recommendations from the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which is chaired by the former <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI5">MI5</a> head. Can the Home Secretary assure us that she is not complacent about threats to our national security and to our democracy? Can she tell me when the Russia report&#8217;s recommendations will be implemented in full and when the results of the consultation on foreign state interference, which closed last summer, will be published?</p> <p pid="c24.0/13">When will there be a response to the Committee&#8217;s crucial recommendation on the funding of digital campaigns and to its important recommendation that more needs to be done on identifying the source of donations and the role of shell companies? Labour has tabled a common-sense <a href="/glossary/?gl=114" title="As a bill passes through Parliament, MPs and peers may suggest amendments -..." class="glossary">amendment</a> to the Elections Bill this very afternoon: new <a href="/glossary/?gl=98" title="A parliamentary bill is divided into sections called clauses.    Printed in..." class="glossary">clause</a> 9, which would close the loophole allowing foreign donors to hide behind shell companies. Will the Home Secretary now support that important amendment to ensure that donors to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK">UK</a> political parties have a connection to the UK?</p>            </div>

Lady&#8217;s overall comment: there is no complacency. There is never any complacency at all. On issues of national security, it is absolutely vital and important that all parties, irrespective of their previous <a href="/glossary/?gl=29" title="The Opposition are the political parties in the House of Commons other than..." class="glossary">opposition</a> to aspects of protecting our country from some of our adversaries, come together.</p> <p pid="c25.0/2">The right hon. Lady has asked a series of important questions not just about protecting us from our adversaries and malign threats, including state threats, but in relation to the Russia report. She will be aware that the Government gave a full response to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee">Intelligence and Security Committee</a> Russia report in July 2020. Many of the recommendations were already in train, co-ordinating  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty">Her Majesty</a>&#8217;s Government, the work across the Treasury, and all aspects of Government work, led by the <a href="/glossary/?gl=108" title="The cabinet is the group of twenty or so (and no more than 22) senior..." class="glossary">Cabinet</a> Office.</p> <p pid="c25.0/3">That comes together in relation to much of the work around protecting democracy, which, as the right hon. Lady will be well aware, sits with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Office">Cabinet Office</a> and is co-ordinated through our agencies in terms of understanding where the threats are, calling out malicious cyber-activity, sanctioning individuals, working further on global anti-corruption sanctions regimes and cracking down on illicit finance. That work is clearly co-ordinated at that particular level.</p> <p pid="c25.0/4">The right hon. Lady also makes reference to aspects of new legislation, and I touched on that issue myself during my opening remarks. She is right to say that the consultation took place last year. Work is under way, and there will be announcements in due course about the approach that the Government are taking to new legislation on state threats.</p> <p pid="c25.0/5">My final comment is that when it comes to state interference it is absolutely vital that not just all Members of this House, but members of the public&#8212;we have had many debates about this during previous elections&#8212;officials across Government and local authorities are highly attuned to the implications of state threat interference in democracy and when it comes to cyber. That is why across the whole of Government there is such extensive work on systematic integration and co-operation to ensure that institutions of the state are protected from hostile state interference.</p>            </div>

We are going to change the <a href="/glossary/?gl=38" title="Laws are the rules by which a country is governed. Britain has a long..." class="glossary">laws</a> to ensure that we can look at those thresholds&#8212;that is important work that takes place. However, there is no doubt that foreign influence manifests itself in many, many ways: economic; through our institutions&#8212;not just Parliament, and some of these institutions&#8217; involvement are well documented; and dirty money. That has been a long-running issue and it absolutely needs to be addressed.</p>            </div>

The sad truth is that from time to time this activity has happened in our House. Looking to the future, and in welcoming my right hon. Friend&#8217;s statement, may I ask whether she agrees that not only is it incumbent on the Government, through their new legislation, to deal with the criminal threshold issue that she mentions, but that we must work, with the House authorities, on the granting of passes and the funding of all-party groups, to ensure that all these subtle but insidious and increasingly brazen attempts to influence Members are stamped out, and stamped out for good?</p>            </div>

Of course it is shocking that any Member of this House should allow themselves to be used by a foreign power, but one problem we have is that this issue is not suddenly emerging. We have now a real problem with China. There are more than 13 organisations hell-bent on such purposes, hiding in public view, working with the United Front and other organisations to report back to China. We know that there are four people we have failed to sanction that the Americans have sanctioned for complicity in the Uyghur genocide that is going on. The Government have got to get tougher even still. The problem is that in the integrated review, which she rightly referred to, we referred to Russia as a threat but to China as a &#8220;systemic challenge&#8221;.

Yes, there is more activity, for a number of reasons. Technology changes, these threats evolve and develop with time, and tradecraft adapts and evolves as well. That brings me to his second point, which was about our academic institutions. This is the subject of an ongoing discussion. I have been in many committees where it has been raised, including the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC">ISC</a>, and it is being discussed across Government. He asks whether the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Education">Department for Education</a> is doing enough. We have spent a great deal of time working with the Department.</p> <p pid="c31.4/2">Let me say something about the legislation that we want to introduce. We are learning from other countries, such as Australia&#8212;indeed, I had a bilateral meeting just last week. This is also part of the work of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a>. A lot of work is being done to look at the institutional impacts of hostile state activity, alongside issues such as foreign agent registration. We want to get this right through future legislation, and that is what we are working on.</p>            </div>

It seems to me that the crucial issue, as the Home Secretary has highlighted, is the whole business of foreign donations and cash being used for inducements. That is the main reason why, during the 10 years in which I have chaired the all-party parliamentary China group, all our sponsors have been British organisations. Does she agree, first, that we need to get a grip of the whole issue of foreign donations, wherever they come from, because third-party countries can be used as well? Secondly, does she agree that the Committee on Standards needs to look more closely at whether any individual parliamentarian needs to be investigated? Thirdly, does she agree that while of course we must rise to the systematic challenge of China that was raised in the integrated review, we do not wish to avoid any engagement with a nation that is a fellow permanent member of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</a> and with which we have much important business to do?</p>            </div>

In relation to the House, standards and transparency, there are already measures in place, as we know, and greater work will take place, as I have said. Obviously we will support all aspects of Parliament to ensure that when more work can be undertaken on transparency, it will indeed be undertaken. When it comes to China&#8217;s role in the world, in multilateral institutions and organisations, and our own values versus the type of values that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government">Chinese Government</a> are proposing around the world, I think it is fair to say that there are many difficult issues. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House">The House</a> recognises that, as do I as Home Secretary and the entire Government. I have already alluded to issues such as human rights abuses, whether they involve the Uyghurs or even BNOs, whom I have helped assiduously. I have set up a bespoke scheme to ensure that they are safe, despite the measures that the Chinese Government are putting in place. We as a Government will always stand up for what is right in the world. That means international law and the rules-based system, and it means calling out those who have behaved in an appalling and inappropriate way in respect of some of the issues that I have touched on.</p>            </div>

On issues such as national security and intelligence co-operation, he is privy to much of our work and will understand the approach that we take. When it comes to legislation that is under development, we know that there are just so many aspects on which we need to legislate. I have already touched on criminal thresholds and the changing nature of the threats. We are also looking at schemes that are already running in other countries&#8212;jurisdictions overseas&#8212;to see how we can apply them to our own jurisdiction. It takes time to work through them, but I give the House every assurance that we will work in a collaborative way on these measures.</p>            </div>

The word &#8220;covert&#8221; has been used quite a bit, but the Chinese Communist party is acting in plain sight. It is threatening the House and it is threatening MPs, and then it sanctions MPs who expose what it is up to. My question to my right hon. Friend is this: where is the organising force of this Government? I respectfully say the same to the <a href="/glossary/?gl=21" title="The Speaker is an MP who has been elected to act as Chairman during debates..." class="glossary">Speaker</a>: where is the organising force for this House in defending our democracy and also ensuring that we are not complicit in genocide?

Why are we not blacklisting firms that are selling our data to the Chinese Communist party and selling us products made by Uyghur slave labour? Finally, will she do everything she can to get the individuals who run those prison camps in Xinjiang sanctioned&#8212;in particular, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Quanguo">Chen Quanguo</a>?</p>            </div>

Of course I will be happy to meet her in relation to the legislation that is under development. There is a very poignant note here. We have touched on defending democracy and exposure to Parliament by those that seek to do us harm, but it goes much wider than that, as I have already mentioned: to different institutions, to officials, to civil servants, and across the board. Everyone should be very, very well attuned to the types of engagements that they are having from individuals and what their motivations are.</p>            </div>
